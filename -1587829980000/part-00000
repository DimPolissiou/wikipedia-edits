Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide, and was positively reviewed for its performances, although the Earth-based elements of the film received some criticism. Two sequels have been released, ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' in 2017. A fourth film, ''Thor: Love and Thunder'', is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], [[Norway]], and seize the source of their power, the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].\n\nIn the present,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the latter of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After he confronts Odin, a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,{{refn|name=CosmicCube|group=N|Identified off-screen as the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref name=\"CosmicCube\" />}} which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:ChrisHemsworthApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemsworth promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] [[deity]] of the [[Thor|same name]]. Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] and Marvel Studios chief [[Kevin Feige]] chose Hemsworth after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was initially dropped from consideration and then given a second chance to read for the part.<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> Hemsworth stated that he gained 20&nbsp;pounds for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that \"It wasn't until ''Thor'' that I started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me.\"<ref name=\"Shira\" /> Regarding his take on the character, Hemsworth said, \"We just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real. Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\"/> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier.\"<ref name=\"Warmoth\" /> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]: <br />A scientist and Thor's love interest. Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation.<ref name=\"portman\" /> When asked why she took the role, Portman replied, \"I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh's directing it, so I was just like, 'Kenneth Branagh doing ''Thor'' is super-weird, I've gotta do it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"portmanthorweird\" /> Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked, \"I signed on to do it before there was a script. And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. Really, I know it sounds silly, but it is those little things that makes girls think it's possible. It doesn't give them a [role] model of 'Oh, I just have to dress cute in movies'\".<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n[[File:TomHiddlestonApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity of the [[Loki|same name]]. Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' and ''[[Wallander (British TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> Initially, Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki. Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now. I try to pick different films, I go and do those big ones and having done that I can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little\".<ref name=\"Cheney\" />\n* [[Colm Feore]] as [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]]: <br />King of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] and Loki's biological father, based on the mythological being of the [[Laufey|same name]], who in myth was actually Loki's mother.<ref name=\"feoreaudio\" /> Feore stated it took five hours for his makeup to be applied.<ref name=\"Marnell\" /> About his character, Feore remarked, \"I am the King of Frost Giants. And if you've seen any of the Frost Giants, you know that I am, of course, the [[Napoleon]] of Frost Giants. We've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. But, no. Can't you tell by the commanding presence? I am the boss\".<ref name=\"feoreaudio\"/> He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that \"during the breaks, Tony, myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on. So that was enormously helpful.\"<ref name=\"Seeton\" />\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Volstagg]]: <br />A member of the [[Warriors Three]], a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth.<ref name=\"three\" /> Stevenson previously worked with Kenneth Branagh in the 1998 film ''[[The Theory of Flight]]'', and with Marvel Studios as the titular character in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics. He's Falstaff with muscles. I've got this amazing foam-injected undersuit that flexes with me.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]: <br />The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the [[Bifr\u00f6st|bifr\u00f6st bridge]], based on the mythological deity of the [[Heimdall|same name]].<ref name=\"elba\" /> Elba said Branagh's involvement was a major incentive to take the role: \"[Branagh] called me up personally and said, 'I know this isn't a big role, but I would really love to see you play it.' It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time! I wouldn't like to do a whole movie of green screen, though. You kind of forget the plot a little\u2014like being in a Broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through\".<ref name=\"Gornstein\" /> Elba stated he has made a four-picture commitment with Marvel Studios.<ref name=Truitt /> Elba's casting prompted a proposed boycott by the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] and a debate amongst comic book fans, some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god. In response Elba called the debate \"ridiculous\".<ref name=\"Belonsky\" /><ref name=\"McClintock\" /><ref name=\"Child\" />\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as Darcy Lewis: <br />A political science major who is Jane Foster's intern.<ref name=\"darcy\" /> Dennings described her character as Foster's \"little helper [[gnome]]\".<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Dennings stated that her role was expanded during the rehearsal process.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> Dennings explained, \"She's kind of like a cute, clueless, little puppy or maybe a hamster. There wasn't much on the page for the Darcy role to begin with and I didn't even see a script before I took the job so I didn't really know who Darcy was at first. But she really evolved\u2014she's so much fun now even. She's very [[Scooby-Doo]] if that makes sense. She's always three steps behind and reacting to what's happening with these great expressions ... She gets things wrong and doesn't care.\"<ref name=\"Boucher2\" />\n* [[Rene Russo]] as [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]]: <br />The wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, mother of Thor, and adoptive mother of Loki, based on the mythological deity of the [[Frigg|same name]].<ref name=\"frigga\" /> Russo stated in March 2011 interview that she has signed on for possible sequels, although she stated that \"who knows how many I'll do\".<ref name=\"Malkin\" />\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Odin (character)|Odin]]: <br />The ruler of Asgard, father of Thor, and adoptive father of Loki, based on the mythological deity of the [[Odin|same name]].<ref name=\"hopkins\" /> In an interview Hopkins stated he knew nothing of the comic. About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving. I know in my life, my karma is, 'If you don't like it, tough, move on.' And I move on. I'm a little like Odin myself\".<ref name=\"Boucher\" /> In May 2016, [[Mel Gibson]] stated he was approached about the role but \"didn't do it\".<ref name=\"MelGibson\" />\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Hogun]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an [[\u00c6sir]].<ref name=\"three\" /> Ray Stevenson said of Asano's character, \"He doesn't speak much but when he does, everybody shuts up. But also in the healing room where everyone licks their wounds, he's the guy who just goes about his business\".<ref name=\"weintraub\" />\n* [[Josh Dallas]] as [[Fandral]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, characterized as an irrepressible [[swashbuckler]] and romantic.<ref name=\"three\" /> [[Stuart Townsend]] was initially cast after [[Zachary Levi]] was forced to vacate the role due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"Levi\" /> However, days before filming began, Townsend was replaced by Dallas citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"townsendexit\" /> Dallas said he believed that Fandral \"would like to think of himself a philanderer. He would like to think of himself, I was saying, as the [[R. Kelly]] of Asgard. He's a lover, not a fighter\". Dallas mentioned that [[Errol Flynn]] was an inspiration for the character stating, \"He was a big inspiration for the character and for me. I watched a lot of his movies and kind of got that into my bones. I tried to bring out that little bit of Flynn-ness in it. Flynn had a lot of that boyish charm that Fandral's got....\"<ref name=\"weintraub\" />\n* [[Jaimie Alexander]] as [[Sif (comics)|Sif]]: <br />A warrior and Thor's childhood friend, based on the mythological deity of the [[Sif|same name]].

He described it as \"a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario.\"<ref name=\"Branagh\" /> Branagh stated that he hoped to begin filming in January 2010,<ref name=\"Wigler2\" /> and Marvel Studios set back the release date of the film from its scheduled July 16, 2010 date to June 17, 2011, almost a full year later.<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> They later moved the release date to May 20, 2011, to distance the film's release from that of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', another Marvel Studios film that was scheduled to be released on July 22, 2011.<ref name=\"may20\" /> In October 2008, [[Daniel Craig]] was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]].<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nIn February 2009, [[Samuel L. Jackson]], who had briefly portrayed Nick Fury at the end of the film ''Iron Man'', signed on to reprise the role in ''Thor'' as part of an unprecedented nine-picture deal with Marvel Studios.<ref name=\"samjackson\" /> In the same month, a casting call went out looking for actors with certain physical attributes to audition for the role of Thor.<ref name=\"Brady\" />\n\nHowever, in an April 2010 interview, Jackson stated that he would not be appearing in ''Thor''. When asked why not Jackson explained, \"I have no idea. I'm not in charge of making those kinds of decisions. I thought I was; they said I was in the trades, and I was like, 'Ooh! I got a job!' I called my agent he said, 'Naw, you're not in it.' I was like, 'Well shit, they need to pay me if they're gonna put my name in it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"Yamato\" /> Later in the month, Jackson revealed that he would be filming a scene for ''Thor'' to serve as \"connective tissue\" for ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.<ref name=\"Davis2\" />\n\nIn May 2009, [[Chris Hemsworth]] was in negotiations to portray the title role after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was refused early on, then given a second chance to read for the part. Hemsworth's brother, [[Liam Hemsworth|Liam]] also auditioned for the role, but was passed on by Marvel Studios head [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> The next day, Marvel announced that [[Tom Hiddleston]], who had worked with Branagh before and had initially been considered to portray the lead role, had been cast as Loki.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> In June 2009, Feige confirmed that both Hemsworth and Hiddleston had signed on.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> Feige mentioned that the film would take place on both modern day Earth and Asgard but Thor's human host, Dr. Donald Blake, would not be included.<ref name=\"feigehemsworth\" /> In July 2009, Marvel announced that [[Natalie Portman]] would portray Jane Foster.<ref name=\"portman\" /> [[Jaimie Alexander]] and [[Colm Feore]] were reported to have joined the cast in September, with Alexander portraying [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] and Feore's role unrevealed, though it was thought to be a villain.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> In an interview with Swedish news site ''Ystads Allehanda'', [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] stated that he had joined the cast, though he did not specify his role.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> By late October [[Anthony Hopkins]] had been cast as [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] in the film.<ref name=\"hopkins\" /> The following month, Marvel announced that they had cast the Warriors Three; Fandral was to be played by [[Stuart Townsend]], Hogun was to be played by [[Tadanobu Asano]] and Volstagg was to be played by [[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]].<ref name=\"three\" /> [[Idris Elba]] was announced to have joined the cast, portraying Heimdall.<ref name=\"elba\" /> Natalie Portman revealed that [[Kat Dennings]] would be involved in the project, portraying Darcy, a coworker of Portman's Jane Foster.<ref name=\"darcy\" /><ref name=\"kat\" />\n\nIn December 2009, [[Rene Russo]] was cast as [[Frigga (Marvel Comics)|Frigga]], Thor's stepmother and Odin's wife.<ref name=\"frigga\" /> Later that month, actors Joseph Gatt, [[Troy Brenna]], and Joshua Cox had been cast in the film, though none of their roles were revealed.<ref name=\"newactors\" /> In January 2010, Adriana Barraza had joined the film's cast, in a supporting capacity.<ref name=\"barraza\" /> Only days before filming began, Stuart Townsend was replaced by [[Joshua Dallas]] as Fandral, citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"townsendexit\" /> When ''[[Spider-Man 4]]''{{'}}s production stalled, Paramount and Marvel Entertainment pushed up the release of ''Thor'' by two weeks to May 6, 2011.<ref name=\"date\" />\n\nThe [[Science & Entertainment Exchange]] introduced Marvel Entertainment, Kenneth Branagh, \"the screenwriter, and a few people on the design and production side of things\" to three physicists ([[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]], [[Kevin Hand]], and Jim Hartle), as well as physics student Kevin Hickerson, to provide a realistic science background for the Thor universe. The consultation resulted in a change in Jane Foster's profession, from nurse to particle physicist, and the terminology ([[Einstein-Rosen bridge]]) to describe the [[Bifrost Bridge]].<ref name=\"SEE\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:KennethBranaghApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\nIn October 2008, Marvel Studios signed a long-term lease agreement with Raleigh Studios to photograph their next four films\u2014''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'', ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''\u2014at Raleigh's [[Manhattan Beach, California]] facility.<ref name=\"RaleighStudios\" /> ''Production Weekly'' reported that filming on Marvel's ''Thor'' was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles mid-January, then move to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] from March until late-April.<ref name=\"Baxter\" /> [[Principal photography]] began on January 11, 2010.<ref name=\"thorfilmingbegins\" /> A few days after filming began, Clark Gregg signed on to reprise his role from ''Iron Man'' and ''Iron Man 2'' as Agent Coulson.<ref name=\"coulson\" /> In February, Paramount Pictures entered negotiations with [[Del Mar, California]] to use a 300-yard stretch of beach to film a scene for ''Thor'' involving six horses running down the terrain. Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film.<ref name=\"delmar\" /> On March 15, 2010, production of ''Thor'' moved to [[Galisteo, New Mexico]] where [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]],<ref name=\"CerroPelonRanch\" /> an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.<ref name=\"Bord\" /><ref name=\"Paramount\" />\n\nBranagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world: \"Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film\".<ref name=\"Boucher3\" />\n\nBy April, the prospect for filming parts of ''Thor'' in Del Mar, California had fallen through. Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed [[Northern California]] location to film a beachfront scene for the film. The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters.<ref name=\"Horn\" /> Filming wrapped on May 6, 2010.<ref name=\"huver\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Thor \u2013 Bifrost sequence.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = HubblePAO.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The film's [[Bifr\u00f6st]] travel sequences (top) were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography (bottom).\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots.<ref name=\"rehoots\" /> In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\".<ref name=\"Esmas\" /> Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants.<ref name=\"tait\" /> On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".<ref name=\"tait\" /> In April 2011, the [[IMAX Corporation]], Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in [[IMAX 3D]], continuing the partnership which began on ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"imax\" /> Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to Digital Domain when creating [[J\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]].<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of [[Fuel VFX]], said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifr\u00f6st would look like, \"You can't [[Google]] what these things look like\u2014they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.

The 2-disc and 3-disc packs includes a digital copy, the first in a series of [[Marvel One-Shots]], ''The Consultant'', and 7 behind-the-scenes featurettes.<ref name=\"DVD Release\" />\n\nBranagh said that the DVD includes at least 20 minutes of [[deleted scene]]s. Branagh stated the footage contains \"things like the Asgardian parents, Odin and Frigga, played by the beautiful Rene Russo, there's some beautiful scenes in there that I think people will enjoy. And certainly Thor and Loki interacting in different ways that just fill in a little bit of a back story, that was part of our rehearsal and research.\"<ref name=\"Marshall4\" /> In its first week of release, ''Thor'' took the number one spot on Blu-ray/DVD sales chart and topped ''[[Home Media Magazine]]'''s rental chart for the week.<ref name=\"Arnold\" />\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled \"[[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One \u2013 Avengers Assembled]]\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetAnnounced\" /> It was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on April 2, 2013.<ref name=\"PhaseOneSetDelayed\" /><ref name=\"Boxset release\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\n''Thor'' earned $181&nbsp;million in [[North America]] and $268.3&nbsp;million in other territories for a worldwide total of $449.3&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo\"/> It was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo4\" />\n\n''Thor'' earned $25.5 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada, including $3.3 million from Thursday previews,<ref name=\"BOWknd1\" /> for a total weekend gross of $65.7 million. $6.2 million of the gross came from IMAX 3D, while 60% of the gross was from 3D screenings.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo5\" /><ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo6\" /> It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 2011 in the United States and Canada,<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo7\"/> and the highest-grossing comic-book film from May\u2013August 2011.<ref name=\"BoxOfficeMojo8\"/>\n\n''Thor''{{'}}s opening in Australia generated $5.8 million and placing second behind [[Universal Pictures]]' ''[[Fast Five]]''.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]],{{refn|name=Distributor|group=N}} it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the fourth film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). It was directed by [[Kenneth Branagh]], written by the writing team of [[Ashley Miller (screenwriter)|Ashley Edward Miller]] and [[Zack Stentz]] along with [[Don Payne (writer)|Don Payne]], and stars [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|the title character]] alongside [[Natalie Portman]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]], [[Colm Feore]], [[Ray Stevenson]], [[Idris Elba]], [[Kat Dennings]], [[Rene Russo]], and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. After reigniting a dormant war, Thor is banished from [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] to Earth, stripped of his powers and his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]]. As his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] plots to take the Asgardian throne, Thor must prove himself worthy.\n\n[[Sam Raimi]] first developed the concept of a film adaptation based on ''Thor'' in 1991, but soon abandoned the project, leaving it in \"[[development hell]]\" for several years. During this time, the rights were picked up by various film studios until Marvel signed [[Mark Protosevich]] to develop the project in 2006, and planned to finance and release it through Paramount. [[Matthew Vaughn]] was assigned to direct the film for a tentative 2010 release. However, after Vaughn was released from his holding deal in 2008, Branagh was approached and the film's release was rescheduled to 2011. The main characters were cast in 2009, and principal photography took place in [[California]] and [[New Mexico]] from January to May 2010. The film was converted to [[3-D film|3D]] in post-production.\n\n''Thor'' premiered in Sydney on April 17, 2011, and was released in the United States on May 6, as part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One|Phase One]] of the MCU. The film was a financial success, earning $449.3 million worldwide, and was positively reviewed for its performances, although the Earth-based elements of the film received some criticism. Two sequels have been released, ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' in 2013 and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' in 2017. A fourth film, ''Thor: Love and Thunder'', is in development.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nIn 965 AD, [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], king of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wages war against the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)#Giants of Jotunheim 2|Frost Giants]] of [[Jotunheim]] and their leader [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]], to prevent them from conquering the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|nine realms]], starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants in [[T\u00f8nsberg]], [[Norway]], and seize the source of their power, the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]].\n\nIn the present,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008) and ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010),<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the latter of which is set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"IM2Timeline\" />}} Odin's son [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], childhood friend [[Sif (comics)|Sif]] and the [[Warriors Three]]: [[Volstagg]], [[Fandral]], and [[Hogun]]. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mj\u00f6lnir]], now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.\n\nThor lands in [[New Mexico]], where astrophysicist [[Jane Foster (comics)|Dr. Jane Foster]], her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Phil Coulson]] soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Foster's data about the [[wormhole]] that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.\n\nLoki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After he confronts Odin, a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor proves himself worthy by his sacrifice to wield Mj\u00f6lnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], Selvig is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where [[Nick Fury]] opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube-shaped object,{{refn|name=CosmicCube|group=N|Identified off-screen as the [[Cosmic Cube]].<ref name=\"CosmicCube\" />}} which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:ChrisHemsworthApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemsworth promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]: <br />The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] [[deity]] of the [[Thor|same name]]. Director [[Kenneth Branagh]] and Marvel Studios chief [[Kevin Feige]] chose Hemsworth after a back-and-forth process in which the 25-year-old actor was initially dropped from consideration and then given a second chance to read for the part.<ref name=\"hemsworth\" /> Hemsworth stated that he gained 20&nbsp;pounds for the role by eating non-stop and revealed that \"It wasn't until ''Thor'' that I started lifting weights, it was all pretty new to me.\"<ref name=\"Shira\" /> Regarding his take on the character, Hemsworth said, \"We just kept trying to humanize it all, and keep it very real. Look into all the research about the comic books that we could, but also bring it back to 'Who is this guy as a person, and what's his relationship with people in the individual scenes?{{Single double}}<ref name=\"huver\"/> About approaching Thor's fighting style, he remarked, \"First, we looked at the comic books and the posturing, the way [Thor] moves and fights, and a lot of his power seems to be drawn up through the ground. We talked about boxers, you know, [[Mike Tyson]], very low to the ground and big open chest and big shoulder swings and very sort of brutal but graceful at the same time, and then as we shot stuff things became easier.\"<ref name=\"Warmoth\" /> [[Dakota Goyo]] portrays a young Thor.\n* [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]: <br />A scientist and Thor's love interest. Marvel Studios stated in an announcement that the character was updated from the comics' initial portrayal for the feature adaptation.<ref name=\"portman\" /> When asked why she took the role, Portman replied, \"I just thought it sounded like a weird idea because Kenneth Branagh's directing it, so I was just like, 'Kenneth Branagh doing ''Thor'' is super-weird, I've gotta do it.{{Single double}}<ref name=\"portmanthorweird\" /> Portman stated that she really wanted to do a big effects film that emphasized character, and getting to do it with Branagh was a new way of approaching it, relative to ''[[Star Wars]]''.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Regarding her preparation for the role Portman remarked, \"I signed on to do it before there was a script. And Ken, who's amazing, who is so incredible, was like, 'You can really help create this character'. I got to read all of these biographies of female scientists like [[Rosalind Franklin]] who actually discovered the [[Nucleic acid double helix|DNA double helix]] but didn't get the credit for it. The struggles they had and the way that they thought&nbsp;\u2013 I was like, 'What a great opportunity, in a very big movie that is going to be seen by a lot of people, to have a woman as a scientist'. She's a very serious scientist. Because in the comic she's a nurse and now they made her an [[Astrophysics|astrophysicist]]. Really, I know it sounds silly, but it is those little things that makes girls think it's possible. It doesn't give them a [role] model of 'Oh, I just have to dress cute in movies'\".<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n[[File:TomHiddlestonApr2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiddleston promoting the film in London in April 2011]]\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]: <br />Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the deity of the [[Loki|same name]]. Hiddleston was chosen after previously working with Branagh on ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' and ''[[Wallander (British TV series)|Wallander]]''.<ref name=\"hiddleston\" /> Initially, Hiddleston auditioned to play Thor but Branagh decided his talent would be better harnessed playing Loki. Hiddleston stated that the character was \"a comic book version of [[Edmund (King Lear)|Edmund]] in ''[[King Lear]]'', but nastier.\" Hiddleston had to keep a strict diet before the start of filming because Branagh wanted \"Loki to have a lean and hungry look, like [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. Physically, he can't be posing as Thor\".<ref name=\"HiddlestonMay2009\" /> Hiddleston looked at [[Peter O'Toole]] as inspiration for Loki as well, explaining, \"Interestingly enough, [Kenneth Branagh] said to look at Peter O'Toole in two specific films, ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' and ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''. What's interesting about ... his performance [as King Henry] is you see how damaged he is. There's a rawness [to his performance]; it's almost as if he's living with a layer of skin peeled away. He's grandiose and teary and, in a moment, by turns hilarious and then terrifying. What we wanted was that emotional volatility. It's a different acting style, it's not quite the same thing, but it's fascinating to go back and watch an actor as great as O'Toole head for those great high hills\".<ref name=\"Storm\" /> Ted Allpress portrays a young Loki.\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: <br />A scientist doing research in New Mexico who encounters Thor.<ref name=\"skarsgard\" /> Skarsg\u00e5rd stated that he was not initially familiar with the comic book version of Thor.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> As to why he took the part, Skarsg\u00e5rd remarked, I \"chose ''Thor'' because of [director] Kenneth Branagh. The script was nice and we got to rehearse and talk to the writers and do some collaborating in the process to make it fit us. So I had a very happy time on it. What I always try to do is immediately do something I just haven't done so I get variation in my life. I've made about 90 films and if I did the same thing over and over again I would be bored by now. I try to pick different films, I go and do those big ones and having done that I can usually afford to go and do some really small obscure films and experiment a little\".<ref name=\"Cheney\" />\n* [[Colm Feore]] as [[Laufey (comics)|Laufey]]: <br />King of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]] and Loki's biological father, based on the mythological being of the [[Laufey|same name]], who in myth was actually Loki's mother.<ref name=\"feoreaudio\" /> Feore stated it took five hours for his makeup to be applied.<ref name=\"Marnell\" /> About his character, Feore remarked, \"I am the King of Frost Giants. And if you've seen any of the Frost Giants, you know that I am, of course, the [[Napoleon]] of Frost Giants. We've got some massive, fabulous guys who dwarf me and come in at around eight-and-a-half feet, nine feet. But, no. Can't you tell by the commanding presence? I am the boss\".<ref name=\"feoreaudio\"/> He said the Shakespearean training he shared with Hopkins and director Branagh helped keep production moving briskly, saying that \"during the breaks, Tony, myself and Ken would be talking in Shakespearean shorthand about what the characters were doing, what we thought they may be like, and how we could focus our attention more intelligently. These were discussions that took no more than a few minutes between takes, but they allowed Ken, Tony and [me] to understand each other instantly without Ken taking an hour away to explain to the actors exactly what was going on. So that was enormously helpful.\"<ref name=\"Seeton\" />\n* [[Ray Stevenson]] as [[Volstagg]]: <br />A member of the [[Warriors Three]], a group of three Asgardian adventurers who are among Thor's closest comrades, known for both his hearty appetite and wide girth.<ref name=\"three\" /> Stevenson previously worked with Kenneth Branagh in the 1998 film ''[[The Theory of Flight]]'', and with Marvel Studios as the titular character in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''. Stevenson wore a [[fat suit]] for the role, stating, \"I've tried the suit on, and what they've done is kind of sex him up: he's sort of slimmer but rounder.\". Stevenson said, \"He's got every bit of that [[Falstaff]]ian verve and vigor, and a bit of a beer gut to suggest that enormous appetite, but he's not the sort of [[Weeble]]-shaped figure he is in the comics. He's Falstaff with muscles. I've got this amazing foam-injected undersuit that flexes with me.\"<ref name=\"Williams\" />\n* [[Idris Elba]] as [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]]: <br />The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian sentry of the [[Bifr\u00f6st|bifr\u00f6st bridge]], based on the mythological deity of the [[Heimdall|same name]].<ref name=\"elba\" /> Elba said Branagh's involvement was a major incentive to take the role: \"[Branagh] called me up personally and said, 'I know this isn't a big role, but I would really love to see you play it.' It's Kenneth Branagh. I was like, 'Definitely'\".<ref name=\"Bierly\" /> About the role Elba remarked, \"I did green screen for the first time! I wouldn't like to do a whole movie of green screen, though. You kind of forget the plot a little\u2014like being in a Broadway play and doing it over and over and forgetting your line halfway through\".<ref name=\"Gornstein\" /> Elba stated he has made a four-picture commitment with Marvel Studios.<ref name=Truitt /> Elba's casting prompted a proposed boycott by the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] and a debate amongst comic book fans, some insisting it was wrong for a black man to play a Nordic god. In response Elba called the debate \"ridiculous\".<ref name=\"Belonsky\" /><ref name=\"McClintock\" /><ref name=\"Child\" />\n* [[Kat Dennings]] as Darcy Lewis: <br />A political science major who is Jane Foster's intern.<ref name=\"darcy\" /> Dennings described her character as Foster's \"little helper [[gnome]]\".<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> Dennings stated that her role was expanded during the rehearsal process.<ref name=\"Murray\" /> Dennings explained, \"She's kind of like a cute, clueless, little puppy or maybe a hamster. There wasn't much on the page for the Darcy role to begin with and I didn't even see a script before I took the job so I didn't really know who Darcy was at first. But she really evolved\u2014she's so much fun now even. She's very [[Scooby-Doo]] if that makes sense. She's always three steps behind and reacting to what's happening with these great expressions ... She gets things wrong and doesn't care.\"<ref name=\"Boucher2\" />\n* [[Rene Russo]] as [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]]: <br />The wife of Odin, queen of Asgard, mother of Thor, and adoptive mother of Loki, based on the mythological deity of the [[Frigg|same name]].<ref name=\"frigga\" /> Russo stated in March 2011 interview that she has signed on for possible sequels, although she stated that \"who knows how many I'll do\".<ref name=\"Malkin\" />\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Odin (character)|Odin]]: <br />The ruler of Asgard, father of Thor, and adoptive father of Loki, based on the mythological deity of the [[Odin|same name]].<ref name=\"hopkins\" /> In an interview Hopkins stated he knew nothing of the comic. About the film he said, \"It's a superhero movie, but with a bit of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] thrown in\".<ref name=\"Carroll\" /> Hopkins stated, \"I'm very interested in that relationship between fathers and sons\", and that, \"My father's relationship with me was cold. He was a hot-blood character but to me, cold. When I was young, he expressed his disappointment because I was bad in school and all of that. He didn't mean any harm, but I felt I could never meet up to his expectations.\" Hopkins expressed that he found a personal resonance in the Odin role, saying, \"He's a stern man. He's a man with purpose. I play the god who banishes his son from the kingdom of Asgard because he screwed up. He's a hot-headed, temperamental young man... probably a chip off of the old block but I decide he's not really ready to rule the future kingdom, so I banish him. I'm harsh and my wife complains and I say, 'That is why I'm king.' He's ruthless, take-it-or-leave-it. Women are much more forgiving; men are not so forgiving. I know in my life, my karma is, 'If you don't like it, tough, move on.' And I move on. I'm a little like Odin myself\".<ref name=\"Boucher\" /> In May 2016, [[Mel Gibson]] stated he was approached about the role but \"didn't do it\".<ref name=\"MelGibson\" />\n* [[Tadanobu Asano]] as [[Hogun]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, primarily identified by his grim demeanor and as the only member who is not an [[\u00c6sir]].<ref name=\"three\" /> Ray Stevenson said of Asano's character, \"He doesn't speak much but when he does, everybody shuts up. But also in the healing room where everyone licks their wounds, he's the guy who just goes about his business\".<ref name=\"weintraub\" />\n* [[Josh Dallas]] as [[Fandral]]: <br />A member of the Warriors Three, characterized as an irrepressible [[swashbuckler]] and romantic.<ref name=\"three\" /> [[Stuart Townsend]] was initially cast after [[Zachary Levi]] was forced to vacate the role due to a scheduling conflict.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"Levi\" /> However, days before filming began, Townsend was replaced by Dallas citing \"creative differences\".<ref name=\"townsendexit\" /> Dallas said he believed that Fandral \"would like to think of himself a philanderer. He would like to think of himself, I was saying, as the [[R. Kelly]] of Asgard. He's a lover, not a fighter\".

The plan was for ''Thor'' to be made for television. [[UPN]] was in talks for airing it; excited by the prospect, they pushed for a script and approached [[Tyler Mane]] to play Thor.<ref name=\"Lethert\" /> In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought [[Artisan Entertainment]] to help finance it as a film, but by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronized by a studio.<ref name=\"Fleming2\" /><ref name=\"Fleming3\" /><ref name=\"Brodesser\" /> [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] finally purchased the film rights, and in December 2004 [[David S.

It's the story of an [[Old Testament]] god who becomes a [[New Testament]] god\".<ref name=\"Mark\" /> In August 2007 Marvel Studios signed [[Matthew Vaughn]] to direct the film.<ref name=\"Fleming4\" /> Vaughn then rewrote Protosevich's script in order to bring down the budget to $150 million, as Protosevich's first draft would have cost $300 million to produce.<ref name=\"rewrite\" /> After the success of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', Marvel Studios announced that they intended to release ''Thor'' on June 4, 2010, with ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' being used to introduce the character of Thor.<ref name=\"EW\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=33%|quote=\"Thor, at his best, has always had a classic bent in terms of his history, the way he speaks and the often Shakespearean dramas that surround him.

By September 2008 [[D. J.

He described it as \"a human story right in the center of a big epic scenario.\"<ref name=\"Branagh\" /> Branagh stated that he hoped to begin filming in January 2010,<ref name=\"Wigler2\" /> and Marvel Studios set back the release date of the film from its scheduled July 16, 2010 date to June 17, 2011, almost a full year later.<ref name=\"Marshall\" /> They later moved the release date to May 20, 2011, to distance the film's release from that of ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', another Marvel Studios film that was scheduled to be released on July 22, 2011.<ref name=\"may20\" /> In October 2008, [[Daniel Craig]] was offered the role, but ultimately turned it down, citing his commitments to the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' franchise]].<ref name=\"Craig\" />\n\nIn February 2009, [[Samuel L.

Paramount said this coastline was ideal because its gradual slope of sand down to the waterline creates excellent reflective opportunities on film.<ref name=\"delmar\" /> On March 15, 2010, production of ''Thor'' moved to [[Galisteo, New Mexico]] where [[Cerro Pelon Ranch]],<ref name=\"CerroPelonRanch\" /> an old-fashioned Western film town, was extensively modified for the shoot.<ref name=\"Bord\" /><ref name=\"Paramount\" />\n\nBranagh, a fan of the comic book since childhood, commented on the challenge of bridging Asgard and the modern world: \"Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find a way to make a virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film\".<ref name=\"Boucher3\" />\n\nBy April, the prospect for filming parts of ''Thor'' in Del Mar, California had fallen through. Paramount Pictures sent a letter informing the city that it has instead chosen an undisclosed [[Northern California]] location to film a beachfront scene for the film. The letter cited cost concerns with moving production too far away from its headquarters.<ref name=\"Horn\" /> Filming wrapped on May 6, 2010.<ref name=\"huver\" />\n\n===Post-production===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n| image1    = Thor \u2013 Bifrost sequence.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = HubblePAO.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  =\n| footer            = The film's [[Bifr\u00f6st]] travel sequences (top) were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography (bottom).\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background =\n}}\nIn October 2010, casting calls revealed the film would be undergoing an undisclosed number of reshoots.<ref name=\"rehoots\" /> In March 2011, scenes involving Adriana Barraza were removed from the theatrical cut of the film during the editing process. Branagh sent a letter of apology explaining the reasons for the cut and desire to work with Barraza again in the future. In response Barraza stated, \"It saddens me because the movie is great and because I was acting alongside some tremendous actors that I admire very much, but I understand the nature of films, and it's not the first or last time that scenes will be cut\".<ref name=\"Esmas\" /> Barraza appears in only one scene in the film's theatrical cut. In that same month, Douglas Tait revealed that he performed for motion capture of the Frost Giants.<ref name=\"tait\" /> On his hiring, Tait said \"I am 6'5\" and have a lean, athletic build, and they hired guys who were 6'7\" and taller, and weighed over {{convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. When the film was being edited, they wanted to make them even bigger and move faster. They auditioned people again and Kenneth Branagh chose me to perform the motion capture movements of the Frost Giants\".<ref name=\"tait\" /> In April 2011, the [[IMAX Corporation]], Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment announced that they have finalized an agreement to release the film in [[IMAX 3D]], continuing the partnership which began on ''Iron Man 2''.<ref name=\"imax\" /> Branagh stated that the 3-D process initially made him cringe but said \"We came to feel that in our case 3-D could be the very good friend of story and character for a different kind of experience\". Although the film was shot in 2D, Feige stated that the \"special effects for the film were conceived and executed from the beginning in 3D\".<ref name=\"3d\" /> The [[post-credits scene]] that sees [[Nick Fury]] approach Erik Selvig to ask him to study the Tesseract, was directed by ''The Avengers''{{'}}s director, [[Joss Whedon]].<ref name=\"Hewitt\" />\n\n[[BUF Compagnie]] served as the lead [[visual effects]] vendor working on the film,<ref name=\"bufcompagnie\" /> with [[Digital Domain]] also providing work on the film.<ref name=\"digitaldomain\" /> Branagh stated that BUF, who developed the effects for the race through space, were inspired by [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] photography and other images of deep space. Branagh stated he sent paintings from classic studies by [[J. M. W. Turner]] to Digital Domain when creating [[J\u00f6tunheimr|Jotunheim]].<ref name=\"Desowitz\" /> Peter Butterworth, VFX supervisor and co-founder of [[Fuel VFX]], said the most challenging task was interpreting what the Bifr\u00f6st would look like, \"You can't [[Google]] what these things look like\u2014they are totally imagined and within the heads of the stakeholders. So to extract that and interpret it for the big screen was an interesting challenge creatively. Technically, probably creating fluid simulations that could be art-directed and used for both the Bifr\u00f6st and Odin's chamber shots. Part of the difficulty with solving these is that we had to ensure they would work in stereo.<ref name=\"Frei\" /> In the film, Odin enters what is known as the \"Odinsleep\" in his chamber to regenerate. Butterworth stated, \"For Odin's Chamber, we developed a dome and curtain of light rays that hover over Odin's bed. This dome of light suggests harnessed power and energy that revitalizes him as he sleeps. We took a lot of reference from the natural world such as the corona of the sun and gave the sleep effect plenty of volume and space\".<ref name=\"Frei\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{further|Thor (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}\n\nThe film's score was written by composer [[Patrick Doyle]], a frequent collaborator of Branagh. Doyle described ''Thor'' as \"the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''\",<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> adding that the composing process had the challenge of trying to find a tone that fit the duality of Asgard and Earth. Thus Doyle and Branagh had frequent discussions on the musical direction,<ref name=\"MotG\" /> with the director suggesting a contemporary feel and having a balance between the music and \"grand images [that] were not in any way hyperbolized\", and the composer in turn implementing \"a strong sense of melody, which he responds to in my work\". As Doyle declared that his own [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] background made him familiar with Norse mythology, an old Celtic folk song also provided the inspiration for Thor's leitmotif.<ref name=\"fmmg\" /> A soundtrack album was released by [[Buena Vista Records]] in April 2011.<ref name=\"filmmusicreporter\" />\n\nThe film also features a song by the [[Foo Fighters]], \"[[Walk (Foo Fighters song)|Walk]]\", in both a scene where a powerless Thor shares some [[Boilermaker (beer cocktail)|boilermakers]] with Selvig in a roadhouse, and the film's closing credits. Marvel president Kevin Feige stated that \"Walk\" was a last minute addition, that the crew felt had \"these eerie appropriate lyrics and themes\" upon hearing it. Branagh in particular thought that \"these lyrics about learning to walk again\" were appropriate \"of [a] movie about redemption, learning to be a hero.\"<ref name=\"Boucher4\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n[[File:Thor Comic-Con Panel.jpg|thumb|right|Hemsworth, Portman, Dennings and Hiddleston at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn July 2010 Marvel Studios held a ''Thor'' panel at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] during which Kenneth Branagh, Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg discussed the film and showed some clips from it.<ref name=\"comiccon\" /> A few days later, this footage was leaked on the internet.<ref name=\"Fleming6\" /> The first television advertisement was broadcast during [[Super Bowl XLV]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in the United States.

American Historian [[Albert T. Olmstead]] describes in his work \"''History of the Persian Empire''\" how the [[Persians|Persian]] General Vaumisa wins a battle in the Autiyara districts located in Tyari and mentions that this is where the Assyrian Christians of the Tyari tribe maintained their independence.<ref>Olmstead, Albert T. (1970). ''History of the Persian Empire''. University of Chicago Press, p. 114</ref>  \n\nIn Classical [[Syriac language|Syriac]] the word Tyare is the plural form of a sheepfold, or grazing area. Indeed, the Assyrians of Tyare were renowned even amongst neighboring Kurds and [[Armenians]] for their [[yogurt]], [[cheese]] and other dairy products mostly made from [[sheep]] or [[goat milk|goat's milk]]. They were also famous for their [[textiles]]<ref name=\":0\" />, which again were spun and woven from sheep's wool. They also made woolen felt for their characteristic conical caps<ref>{{Cite book|last=Layard, Austen Henry, 1817-1894.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/12578949|title=Nineveh and Its Remains|date=1858|publisher=Appleton|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=194|oclc=12578949}}</ref>, and felt was also used for bedding.\n\nThese industries have continued to some extent in their rural settlements in Northern Iraq and North East Syria. One anecdote mentions that, on the flight of Assyrians from Urmia, Iran to Bakuba, Iraq in 1918, the Tyare Assyrians reached the end of the thousand mile trek with more sheep than when they had originally set out.\n\n\n==Dialect==\n[[File:Tyariaccent.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Tyare dialect. Notice the usage of [\u03b8], [\u00f0] and [aw], and also the analytic approach regarding [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''otax'd deyeh'', \"bedroom of his\").]]\nLike [[Jilu#Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b|J\u012bl\u016b]], the Tyare dialect is a very distinct [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] dialect. Unlike the ''Jilu'', ''Baz'' and ''Gawar'' dialects (which are very similar to each other), this one is more \"thick\". It is, in a way, a sort of a \"[[working class]]\" accent of the Assyrian dialects. Dialects within Tyare, and especially the Western group, have more in common with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] than with Iraqi Koine (similar to General Urmian). \n\nMany Tyare speakers can switch [[accent reduction|back and forth]] from Tyare to \"Assyrian Standard\" (or \"Iraqi Koine\") when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects. Some speakers tend to adopt a form of verb conjugation that is closer to the Iraqi Koine or Urmian Standard. This is attributed to the growing exposure to Assyrian Standard-based literature, media, and its use as a [[liturgical]] language by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Furthermore, it is customary for [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian artists]] to generally sing in ''Iraqi Koine'' for them to be intelligible and have widespread recognition. Songs in Tyare dialects are usually of the [[folk music|folk]]-dance music genre and would attract certain audiences.<ref>Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997).

(1994). ''Basic sentence structure in Assyrian Aramaic'', Journal of Assyrian Academic Studies, VIII/1:83-107</ref> The following are [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] ways to express possession, using the word ''b\u0115t\u0101'' (\"house\") as a base:\n\n*my house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yi'' (\"house of mine\")\n*your ([[Grammatical gender|masc.]], sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u016bx'' (\"house of yours\")\n*your (fem., sing.) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yax'' \n*your (plural) house: ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115x\u016b'' (\"house of yours\")\n*3rd person (masc., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113yeh'' (\"house of his\")\n*3rd person (fem., sing.): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u014d'' (\"house of hers\")\n*3rd person (plural): ''b\u0115t\u0101 it d\u0113y\u0115h\u0115'' (\"house of theirs\")\n\n===Consonants===\nThe Lower Tyare dialect, being [[Conservative (language)|conservative]], generally retains interdental fricative allophones ({{IPAblink|\u03b8}} and {{IPAblink|\u00f0}}) of alveolar stops ([[Voiceless alveolar stop|/t/]] and [[Voiced alveolar stop|/d/]], respectively). This is a feature present in ancient Aramaic (see ''[[begadkefat]]''). Examples:\n* \"Village\": ''m\u0101\u1e6f\u0101'' (like \"math\" said in [[Received Pronunciation]]) in Lower Tyare becomes ''m\u0101t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n* \"Hand\": ''\u012b\u1e0f\u0101'' in Tyare becomes ''\u012bd\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn Upper Tyare, {{IPAblink|\u03b8}} is not present in native words. Instead, it becomes a voiceless postalveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0283}} after [[front vowel]]s and a voiceless alveolar stop {{IPAblink|t}} everywhere else. Examples:\n*\"Dead\" (masc. singular): ''m\u012b\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''m\u012b\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''m\u012bt\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n*\"Chicken\": ''k\u1e6f\u0113\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''kt\u0113\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''kt\u0113t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn some words of foreign origin, [f] may be retained instead of [p]--this is a feature also present in [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]]. Furthermore, a {{IPAblink|l}} after a [[stop consonant|voiceless stop]] may be [[assimilation (phonology)|perseveratively assimilated]] by some speakers, namely those with a \"thicker\" accent from [[Ashita]], where, ''letl\u012b'' (\"I don't have\") becomes ''lett\u012b'', and ''priql\u0101h'' (\"it's over\") would become ''priqq\u0101h''.\n\n===Vowels===\n*The [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}), heard in the Standard Assyrian pronunciations of words like ''x'''\u0259'''\u0161k\u0101'' (\"darkness\"), ''b'''\u0259'''rq\u0101'' (\"lightning\") and ''d'''\u0259'''dw\u0101'' (\"housefly\"), is switched to the [[near-close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|\u026a}} in the Tyare dialects. This distinct [[vowel shift]] gives the dialect a stronger, \"uneducated\" sound to outside ears.\n* The {{IPAblink|o}} in words like ''t'''\u014d'''r\u0101'' (\"bull\") is [[diphthong]]ized, so it will have an [aw] sound instead (''t'''aw'''r\u0101''). \n* The {{IPAblink|u}} in the standard Assyrian pronunciation, as in ''m'''\u016b'''d\u012b'' (\"what\"), is retained as {{IPAblink|o}} (i.e. ''m'''\u014d'''\u1e0f\u012b'').\n* {{IPA|/a/}}, as commonly uttered in words like ''n'''\u0101'''\u0161\u0101'' (\"man\") and ''n'''\u0101'''r\u0101'' (\"river\") is usually more back {{IPAblink|\u0251}} in the Tyare dialects.<ref>Robinson, Theodore Henry (1915).

A broad cloth, \"Kammar band,\" or waist band, is folded several times round the trunk of the body, and a short cut-away jacket of amazing colors, worn over a thin cotton variegated shirt.

Their jackets are one mass of gold embroidery, their shirts, with hanging sleeves, are striped satin; their trousers, of sailor cut, are silk, made from the cocoons of their own silkworms, woven with broad crimson stripes on a white ground, on which is a zigzag pattern; and their handsome jackboots are of crimson leather.

They also made woolen felt for their characteristic conical caps<ref>{{Cite book|last=Layard, Austen Henry, 1817-1894.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/12578949|title=Nineveh and Its Remains|date=1858|publisher=Appleton|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=194|oclc=12578949}}</ref>, and felt was also used for bedding.\n\nThese industries have continued to some extent in their rural settlements in Northern Iraq and North East Syria. One anecdote mentions that, on the flight of Assyrians from Urmia, Iran to Bakuba, Iraq in 1918, the Tyare Assyrians reached the end of the thousand mile trek with more sheep than when they had originally set out.\n\n\n==Dialect==\n[[File:Tyariaccent.ogg|thumb|right|Sample of the Tyare dialect. Notice the usage of [\u03b8], [\u00f0] and [aw], and also the analytic approach regarding [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]] (''otax'd deyeh'', \"bedroom of his\").]]\nLike [[Jilu#Neo-Aramaic dialect of J\u012bl\u016b|J\u012bl\u016b]], the Tyare dialect is a very distinct [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] dialect. Unlike the ''Jilu'', ''Baz'' and ''Gawar'' dialects (which are very similar to each other), this one is more \"thick\". It is, in a way, a sort of a \"[[working class]]\" accent of the Assyrian dialects. Dialects within Tyare, and especially the Western group, have more in common with [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] than with Iraqi Koine (similar to General Urmian). \n\nMany Tyare speakers can switch [[accent reduction|back and forth]] from Tyare to \"Assyrian Standard\" (or \"Iraqi Koine\") when conversing with Assyrian speakers of other dialects. Some speakers tend to adopt a form of verb conjugation that is closer to the Iraqi Koine or Urmian Standard. This is attributed to the growing exposure to Assyrian Standard-based literature, media, and its use as a [[liturgical]] language by the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Furthermore, it is customary for [[Assyrian folk/pop music|Assyrian artists]] to generally sing in ''Iraqi Koine'' for them to be intelligible and have widespread recognition. Songs in Tyare dialects are usually of the [[folk music|folk]]-dance music genre and would attract certain audiences.<ref>Solomon, Zomaya S. (1997).

This is a feature present in ancient Aramaic (see ''[[begadkefat]]''). Examples:\n* \"Village\": ''m\u0101\u1e6f\u0101'' (like \"math\" said in [[Received Pronunciation]]) in Lower Tyare becomes ''m\u0101t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n* \"Hand\": ''\u012b\u1e0f\u0101'' in Tyare becomes ''\u012bd\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn Upper Tyare, {{IPAblink|\u03b8}} is not present in native words. Instead, it becomes a voiceless postalveolar fricative {{IPAblink|\u0283}} after [[front vowel]]s and a voiceless alveolar stop {{IPAblink|t}} everywhere else. Examples:\n*\"Dead\" (masc. singular): ''m\u012b\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''m\u012b\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''m\u012bt\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n*\"Chicken\": ''k\u1e6f\u0113\u1e6f\u0101'' in Lower Tyare, ''kt\u0113\u0161\u0101'' in Upper Tyare, and ''kt\u0113t\u0101'' in Iraqi Koine.\n\nIn some words of foreign origin, [f] may be retained instead of [p]--this is a feature also present in [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Turoyo]]. Furthermore, a {{IPAblink|l}} after a [[stop consonant|voiceless stop]] may be [[assimilation (phonology)|perseveratively assimilated]] by some speakers, namely those with a \"thicker\" accent from [[Ashita]], where, ''letl\u012b'' (\"I don't have\") becomes ''lett\u012b'', and ''priql\u0101h'' (\"it's over\") would become ''priqq\u0101h''.\n\n===Vowels===\n*The [[schwa]] ({{IPA|/\u0259/}}), heard in the Standard Assyrian pronunciations of words like ''x'''\u0259'''\u0161k\u0101'' (\"darkness\"), ''b'''\u0259'''rq\u0101'' (\"lightning\") and ''d'''\u0259'''dw\u0101'' (\"housefly\"), is switched to the [[near-close front unrounded vowel]] {{IPAblink|\u026a}} in the Tyare dialects. This distinct [[vowel shift]] gives the dialect a stronger, \"uneducated\" sound to outside ears.\n* The {{IPAblink|o}} in words like ''t'''\u014d'''r\u0101'' (\"bull\") is [[diphthong]]ized, so it will have an [aw] sound instead (''t'''aw'''r\u0101''). \n* The {{IPAblink|u}} in the standard Assyrian pronunciation, as in ''m'''\u016b'''d\u012b'' (\"what\"), is retained as {{IPAblink|o}} (i.e. ''m'''\u014d'''\u1e0f\u012b'').\n* {{IPA|/a/}}, as commonly uttered in words like ''n'''\u0101'''\u0161\u0101'' (\"man\") and ''n'''\u0101'''r\u0101'' (\"river\") is usually more back {{IPAblink|\u0251}} in the Tyare dialects.<ref>Robinson, Theodore Henry (1915).

A broad cloth, \"Kammar band,\" or waist band, is folded several times round the trunk of the body, and a short cut-away jacket of amazing colors, worn over a thin cotton variegated shirt. The head-dress consists of conical felt cap as depicted in frescoes of Assyrians of thousands of years ago, and which has survived to this day.\"<ref>Brigadier-Gen. H.H. Austin (1920). ''The Baqubah Refugee Camp''. The Faith Press, London.</ref>\n*\"There are 115 guests today. Among them are a number of Tyare men, whose wild looks, combined with the splendour of their dress and arms, are of great interest. Their jackets are one mass of gold embroidery, their shirts, with hanging sleeves, are striped satin; their trousers, of sailor cut, are silk, made from the cocoons of their own silkworms, woven with broad crimson stripes on a white ground, on which is a zigzag pattern; and their handsome jackboots are of crimson leather. With their white or red peaked felt hats and twisted silk pagris or head-cloths, their rich girdles, jewelled daggers, and inlaid pistols, they are very imposing.\" <ref>Bird, Isabella (1891).

The season occurs during the cold half of the year in each [[Earth|hemisphere]]. Influenza activity can sometimes be predicted and even tracked geographically. While the beginning of major flu activity in each season varies by location, in any specific location these minor epidemics usually take about three weeks to reach its pinnacle, and another 3 weeks to significantly diminish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/flu.htm |title=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Factsheet |access-date=8 October 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013070339/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/flu.htm |archive-date=13 October 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{Main|Influenza}}\nThree [[virus]] families, [[Influenzavirus A]], [[Influenzavirus B|B]], and [[Influenzavirus C|C]] are the main infective agents that cause influenza. During periods of cooler temperature, influenza cases increase roughly tenfold or more. Despite higher incidence of manifestations of the flu during the season, the viruses are actually transmitted throughout populations all year round.\n\nEach annual flu season is normally associated with a major influenzavirus subtype. The associated subtype changes each year, due to development of immunological resistance to a previous year's strain (through exposure and vaccinations), and mutational changes in previously dormant viruses strains.\n\nThe exact mechanism behind the seasonal nature of [[influenza]] outbreaks are gradually being uncovered. It's seen as a combination of meteorological variables (Temperature, UV light, humidity) with pollen season with its antiviral aerosol and immuno-activation properties, whereby seasonal social distancing behaviors play a certain role as well.\n\n*Pollen season is observed to be the inverse of flu season: pollen aerosol has antiviral characteristics, and also invokes immune responses (hay fever) that are jointly associated to reduced flu incidence. Pollen counts thresholds mark the start and end of flu season.<ref>{{cite journal |author-last1=Hoogeveen |author-first1=M. |title=Pollen likely seasonal factor in inhibiting flu-like epidemics.

Thus, it has been recommended that diabetics be vaccinated against flu, before the start of the flu season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/healthconditions/diabetes/index.html |title=flu.gov: Diabetes and the Flu |access-date=12 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025113447/http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/healthconditions/diabetes/index.html |archive-date=25 October 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/projects/pdfs/eng_brochure.pdf |title=CDC brochure on flu vaccination for diabetics |access-date=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515114135/https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/projects/pdfs/eng_brochure.pdf |archive-date=15 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- These refs were provided for the diabetes section, but seem irrlevant;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flustrain.net/ |title=Flu Strain Information |date=2010-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite |publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Service |url=http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/about/seasonalflu/index.html |title=Seasonal Flu |date=2010-02-09}}</ref> pol098 Dec10 -->\n\n===Asthma/COPD===\nIt is recommended that [[asthma]]tics and [[COPD]] patients be vaccinated against flu before the flu season.

Moreover, many cancer patients undergo [[radiation therapy]] and potent immunosuppressive medications, which further suppresses the body's ability to fight off infections. Everyone with cancer is highly susceptible and is at risk for complications from flu. People with cancer or a history of cancer should receive the seasonal flu shot. Flu vaccination is also strict for lung cancer patients, as cancer leads to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis. People with cancer should not receive the nasal spray vaccine. The flu shot is made up of inactivated (killed) viruses, and the nasal spray vaccines are made up of live viruses. The flu shot is safer for those with a weakened immune system. Those who have received cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within the last month, or have a blood or lymphatic form of cancer should call their doctor immediately if they suspect they may have flu.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/flu/ |title=Cancer and the Flu |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825183451/https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/flu/ |archive-date=25 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===HIV/AIDS===\nIndividuals who acquire the human immune deficiency virus ([[HIV]]) are very prone to a variety of infections. HIV has a tremendous capacity to destroy the body's immune system and this makes one prone to not only viral infections but also bacterial, fungal, and [[protozoa]] disorders. People with HIV are at an increased risk of serious flu-related complications. Many reports have shown that individuals with HIV can develop serious pneumonias which need hospitalization and aggressive [[antibiotic]] therapy. Moreover, people with HIV have a longer flu season and are at a high risk of death. Vaccination with the flu shot has been shown to boost the immune system and protect against the seasonal flu in some patients with HIV; individuals who have HIV should only get vaccinated with the inactivated influenza vaccine. Any HIV patient who has been exposed to other people with influenza should see a physician to determine if there is a need for [[Antiviral drug|anti viral medications]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15993 |title=Flu Season 2005-2006: Questions & Answers |work=MedicineNet |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203152052/https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15993 |archive-date=3 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Cost ==\n[[File:CDC-influenza-outpatient-visits-2015-01.gif|thumb|300px|During the 2011\u20132014 seasons, flu-like illnesses have typically accounted for 6% of outpatient visits at the peak of the season in the United States.]]\n\nThe cost of a flu season in lives lost, medical expenses and economic impact can be severe. \n:\"In the United States of America, for example, recent estimates put the cost of influenza epidemics to the economy at US$ 71-167 billion per year.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=WHO Influenza Overview |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/ |access-date=8 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505070146/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/ |archive-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA study<ref>{{cite |author1=Molinari |author2=Ortega-Sanchez |author3=Messonnier |author4=Thompson |author5=Wortley |author6=Weintraub |author7=Bridges |title=The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the US: Measuring disease burden and costs |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.03.046 |pmid=17544181}}</ref> estimated that in the [[United States]], annual influenza epidemics result in approximately 600,000 life-years lost, 3 million hospitalized days, and 30 million outpatient visits, resulting in medical costs of $10 billion annually.

The season occurs during the cold half of the year in each [[Earth|hemisphere]]. Influenza activity can sometimes be predicted and even tracked geographically. While the beginning of major flu activity in each season varies by location, in any specific location these minor epidemics usually take about three weeks to reach its pinnacle, and another 3 weeks to significantly diminish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/flu.htm |title=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Factsheet |access-date=8 October 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013070339/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/flu.htm |archive-date=13 October 2005 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Cause==\n{{Main|Influenza}}\nThree [[virus]] families, [[Influenzavirus A]], [[Influenzavirus B|B]], and [[Influenzavirus C|C]] are the main infective agents that cause influenza. During periods of cooler temperature, influenza cases increase roughly tenfold or more. Despite higher incidence of manifestations of the flu during the season, the viruses are actually transmitted throughout populations all year round.\n\nEach annual flu season is normally associated with a major influenzavirus subtype. The associated subtype changes each year, due to development of immunological resistance to a previous year's strain (through exposure and vaccinations), and mutational changes in previously dormant viruses strains.\n\nThe exact mechanism behind the seasonal nature of [[influenza]] outbreaks is unknown. Some proposed explanations are:\n\n* People are indoors more often during the winter, they are in close contact more often, and this promotes transmission from person to person.\n* A seasonal decline in the amount of ultraviolet radiation may reduce the likelihood of the virus being damaged or killed by direct radiation damage or indirect effects (i. e. ozone concentration) increasing the probability of infection.\n* Cold temperatures lead to drier air, which may dehydrate [[mucous membrane]]s, preventing the body from effectively defending against respiratory virus infections.<ref name=\"Lowen2007\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author-last1=Shaman |author-first1=J. |author-last2=Kohn |author-first2=M. |title=Absolute humidity modulates influenza survival, transmission, and seasonality |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=106 |issue=9 |pages=3243\u20133248 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19204283 |pmc=2651255 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0806852106 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.3243S}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author-last1=Shaman |author-first1=J. |author-last2=Pitzer |author-first2=V.

When [[blood sugar]]s are not well controlled, diabetics can quickly develop a wide range of complications. Diabetes results in elevated blood sugars in the body, and this environment allows viruses and [[bacteria]] to thrive.\n\nIf blood sugars are poorly controlled, a mild flu can quickly turn severe, leading to hospitalization and even [[death]]. Uncontrolled blood sugars suppresses the [[immune system]]s and generally lead to more severe cases of the [[common cold]] or influenza. Thus, it has been recommended that diabetics be vaccinated against flu, before the start of the flu season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/healthconditions/diabetes/index.html |title=flu.gov: Diabetes and the Flu |access-date=12 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025113447/http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/healthconditions/diabetes/index.html |archive-date=25 October 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/projects/pdfs/eng_brochure.pdf |title=CDC brochure on flu vaccination for diabetics |access-date=9 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515114135/https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/projects/pdfs/eng_brochure.pdf |archive-date=15 May 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- These refs were provided for the diabetes section, but seem irrlevant;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flustrain.net/ |title=Flu Strain Information |date=2010-02-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite |publisher=U.S. Department of Health & Human Service |url=http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/about/seasonalflu/index.html |title=Seasonal Flu |date=2010-02-09}}</ref> pol098 Dec10 -->\n\n===Asthma/COPD===\nIt is recommended that [[asthma]]tics and [[COPD]] patients be vaccinated against flu before the flu season.

It is recommended that asthmatics are vaccinated between October and November, before the peak of the flu season.

Moreover, many cancer patients undergo [[radiation therapy]] and potent immunosuppressive medications, which further suppresses the body's ability to fight off infections. Everyone with cancer is highly susceptible and is at risk for complications from flu. People with cancer or a history of cancer should receive the seasonal flu shot. Flu vaccination is also strict for lung cancer patients, as cancer leads to complications of pneumonia and bronchitis. People with cancer should not receive the nasal spray vaccine. The flu shot is made up of inactivated (killed) viruses, and the nasal spray vaccines are made up of live viruses. The flu shot is safer for those with a weakened immune system. Those who have received cancer treatment such as chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy within the last month, or have a blood or lymphatic form of cancer should call their doctor immediately if they suspect they may have flu.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/flu/ |title=Cancer and the Flu |access-date=2012-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825183451/https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/flu/ |archive-date=25 August 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===HIV/AIDS===\nIndividuals who acquire the human immune deficiency virus ([[HIV]]) are very prone to a variety of infections. HIV has a tremendous capacity to destroy the body's immune system and this makes one prone to not only viral infections but also bacterial, fungal, and [[protozoa]] disorders. People with HIV are at an increased risk of serious flu-related complications. Many reports have shown that individuals with HIV can develop serious pneumonias which need hospitalization and aggressive [[antibiotic]] therapy. Moreover, people with HIV have a longer flu season and are at a high risk of death. Vaccination with the flu shot has been shown to boost the immune system and protect against the seasonal flu in some patients with HIV; individuals who have HIV should only get vaccinated with the inactivated influenza vaccine. Any HIV patient who has been exposed to other people with influenza should see a physician to determine if there is a need for [[Antiviral drug|anti viral medications]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15993 |title=Flu Season 2005-2006: Questions & Answers |work=MedicineNet |access-date=2010-02-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203152052/https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=15993 |archive-date=3 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Cost ==\n[[File:CDC-influenza-outpatient-visits-2015-01.gif|thumb|300px|During the 2011\u20132014 seasons, flu-like illnesses have typically accounted for 6% of outpatient visits at the peak of the season in the United States.]]\n\nThe cost of a flu season in lives lost, medical expenses and economic impact can be severe. \n:\"In the United States of America, for example, recent estimates put the cost of influenza epidemics to the economy at US$ 71-167 billion per year.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=WHO Influenza Overview |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/ |access-date=8 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505070146/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/2003/fs211/en/ |archive-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA study<ref>{{cite |author1=Molinari |author2=Ortega-Sanchez |author3=Messonnier |author4=Thompson |author5=Wortley |author6=Weintraub |author7=Bridges |title=The annual impact of seasonal influenza in the US: Measuring disease burden and costs |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2007.03.046 |pmid=17544181}}</ref> estimated that in the [[United States]], annual influenza epidemics result in approximately 600,000 life-years lost, 3 million hospitalized days, and 30 million outpatient visits, resulting in medical costs of $10 billion annually.

In 1880, he deciphered another hieroglyphic which he recognised as the governing prefix that identified divinity. He had suspected for some time that [[Bo\u011fazkale|Boghazkoy]] was the capital of the [[Hittites]] because some hieroglyphic scripts found at [[Aleppo]] and Hamath in northern Syria were matched to the script on a monument at Boghazkoy.\n\nIn 1882, in a lecture to the [[Society of Biblical Archaeology]] in London, he announced that the Hittites, far from being a small [[Canaan]]ite tribe who dealt with the kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], were the people of a \"lost Hittite empire\", which [[New Kingdom|Egyptian]] texts were then bringing to light. He and [[William Wright (missionary)|William Wright]] identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with [[Hattusa]], the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the [[Aegean Sea]] to the banks of the [[Euphrates]], centuries before the age of the [[Old Testament]] patriarchs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Bryce|authorlink=Trevor R. Bryce|title=Life and Society in the Hittite World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|page=3}}</ref>\n\nSayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a [[syllabary]], that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.\n\nSayce dreamed of finding a bilingual [[Rosetta Stone]]. In 1880, he found a clue on a writing that spoke of an ancient silver disk discovered in [[Istanbul]]. It was a small-sized relic resembling a seal. In its centre, the figure of a warrior wearing a short robe, cape, helmet and upward-toe-capped boots (a Hittite apparel, no doubt) lay. The frieze around the warrior contained a cuneiform inscription in [[Hurrian]] dialect. Sayce supposed that the cuneiform inscription on the seal and the Hittite characters contained in its inner circle expressed one only meaning. Therefore, he was facing a bilingual text.\n\nWorking with a plaster impression, Sayce translated the cuneiform text of a seal \"Tarritktimme, king of the country of Erme\" (Walters Gallery, Baltimore). By late 1886, only seven signs had been deciphered out of the totality of signs belonging to the hieroglyphic system.\n\nLater, after Sayce had turned his attention to [[Egyptology]], archives were discovered at Hattusa that unlocked the language spoken there.\n\nLectures were his favourite vehicle for publication. He published in 1887 his [[Hibbert lectures]] on Babylonian religion;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sayce, Rev. Archibald Henry|journal=Who's Who|year=1913|page=1782|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453201;view=1up;seq=1816}}</ref> in 1902 his [[Gifford lectures]] on Egyptian and Babylonian religion; and in 1907 his [[Rhind lectures]].\n\nSayce was working at [[Eileithyiaspolis|El Kab]] in Egypt with [[Somers Clarke]] in the 1900s. In his seasonal winter digs in Egypt he always hired a well-furnished boat on the [[Nile]] to accommodate his travelling library, which also enabled him to offer tea to visiting Egyptologists like the young American [[James Henry Breasted]] and his wife.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n===Books===\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = Fresh light from the ancient monuments : a sketch of the most striking confirmations of the Bible, from recent discoveries in Egypt, Palestine, Assyria, Babylonia, Asia Minor\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = [[Religious Tract Society]]\n | series = [[By-paths of Bible Knowledge]]\n | volume = III\n | orig-year =\n | year = 1865\n | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroman00sayc\n |accessdate=2020-04-17}} ({{Citation | title = 2nd Edition | year = 1884 | publisher = Religious Tract Society | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroma01saycgoog|accessdate=2020-04-17}})({{Citation | title = 7th Edition | year = 1892 | url = https://archive.org/details/freshlightfroman92sayc|accessdate=2020-04-17}})\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = The origin of Semitic civilisation, chiefly upon philological evidence\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Harrison & Sons\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1872\n | url = https://archive.org/details/originsemiticci00saycgoog\n |accessdate=2020-04-17\n }}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = An Assyrian grammar for comparative purposes\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Tr\u00fcbner & Co\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1872\n | url = https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_WWAUAAAAYAAJ\n |accessdate=2020-04-17\n }}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = The principles of comparative philology\n | place = London, United Kingdom\n | publisher = Tr\u00fcbner & Co\n | series =\n | volume =\n | orig-year = \n | year = 1874\n | url = https://archive.org/details/principlescompa06saycgoog\n |accessdate=2020-04-17}} ({{Citation |title = 4th Edition  | year = 1893 | publisher = Scribner | url = https://archive.org/details/cu31924026441729 |accessdate=2020-04-17}})\n*{{Citation\n | last = Sayce\n | title = Archaic classics.

In 1880, he deciphered another hieroglyphic which he recognised as the governing prefix that identified divinity. He had suspected for some time that [[Bo\u011fazkale|Boghazkoy]] was the capital of the [[Hittites]] because some hieroglyphic scripts found at [[Aleppo]] and Hamath in northern Syria were matched to the script on a monument at Boghazkoy.\n\nIn 1882, in a lecture to the [[Society of Biblical Archaeology]] in London, he announced that the Hittites, far from being a small [[Canaan]]ite tribe who dealt with the kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], were the people of a \"lost Hittite empire\", which [[New Kingdom|Egyptian]] texts were then bringing to light. He and [[William Wright (missionary)|William Wright]] identified the ruins at Boghazkoy with [[Hattusa]], the capital of a Hittite Empire that stretched from the [[Aegean Sea]] to the banks of the [[Euphrates]], centuries before the age of the [[Old Testament]] patriarchs.<ref>{{cite book|first=Trevor|last=Bryce|authorlink=Trevor R. Bryce|title=Life and Society in the Hittite World|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|page=3}}</ref>\n\nSayce concluded that the Hittite hieroglyphic system was predominantly a [[syllabary]], that is, its symbols stood for a phonetic syllable. There were too many different signs for a system that was alphabetical and yet there were too few for it to be a set of ideographs. That very sign standing for the divinity had appeared on the stones of Hamath and other places, always in the form of a prefix of an indecipherable group of hieroglyphics naming the deities. This led Sayce to conclude that by finding the name of one of these deities with the help of another language endowed with similar pronunciation, one might analyse the conversion of the aforesaid name in Hittite hieroglyphics. Also, he stated that the keys to be obtained through that process might in turn be applied to other parts of a Hittite inscription where the same sign were to occur.\n\nSayce dreamed of finding a bilingual [[Rosetta Stone]]. In 1880, he found a clue on a writing that spoke of an ancient silver disk discovered in [[Istanbul]]. It was a small-sized relic resembling a seal. In its centre, the figure of a warrior wearing a short robe, cape, helmet and upward-toe-capped boots (a Hittite apparel, no doubt) lay. The frieze around the warrior contained a cuneiform inscription in [[Hurrian]] dialect. Sayce supposed that the cuneiform inscription on the seal and the Hittite characters contained in its inner circle expressed one only meaning. Therefore, he was facing a bilingual text.\n\nWorking with a plaster impression, Sayce translated the cuneiform text of a seal \"Tarritktimme, king of the country of Erme\" (Walters Gallery, Baltimore). By late 1886, only seven signs had been deciphered out of the totality of signs belonging to the hieroglyphic system.\n\nLater, after Sayce had turned his attention to [[Egyptology]], archives were discovered at Hattusa that unlocked the language spoken there.\n\nLectures were his favourite vehicle for publication. He published in 1887 his [[Hibbert lectures]] on Babylonian religion;<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sayce, Rev.

Moni Garr produces many Indigenous language games for multiple platforms<ref>https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/2/25/21150973/indigenous-representation-in-video-games</ref>. Both the video games made in the Skins Hawai\u2018i-based workshops, He Ao Hou [2017]  and Wao Kanaka: Realm of the People [2018], were designed so that the player can play in \u2018\u014clelo Hawai\u2018i as well as in English. Similarly, Karihonniennihtshera (Teachings) by Kahentawaks Tiewishaw can be played in English, wherein it teaches the player how to identify flora and fauna in the Kanien\u2019k\u00e9ha language, or played entirely in Kanien\u2019k\u00e9ha. \n\nFull immersion is a possible design choice for some Indigenous game developers. Honour Water [2016]<ref>https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/30405</ref> is a singing game entirely in Anishinaabemowin, much like the virtual reality game Along the River of Spacetime [2020]<ref>http://www.cal.msu.edu/news/professor-lapensee-wins-guggenheim-fellowship-award</ref>. Carl Petersen emphasizes full immersion in his games, which include Lakota instructions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianyouth.org/news/detail/carl-petersen-develops-a-lakota-video-game-to-revitalize-language|title=Carl Petersen Develops a Lakota Video Game to Revitalize Language &#124; Running Strong|website=indianyouth.org}}</ref> \n\nIn addition, there are games that have been localized to Indigenous languages. For example, Pinnguaq localized [[Osmosis]] and [[Ittle Dew]] to Inuktitut and [[Mushroom 11]] [2015] is available in Inuktitut and Algonquin.\n\n==Academic studies==\nResearch of Indigenous video games, ranging from representations to design and development, are on the rise.

Moni Garr produces many Indigenous language games for multiple platforms<ref>https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/2/25/21150973/indigenous-representation-in-video-games</ref>. Both the video games made in the Skins Hawai\u2018i-based workshops, He Ao Hou [2017]  and Wao Kanaka: Realm of the People [2018], were designed so that the player can play in \u2018\u014clelo Hawai\u2018i as well as in English. Similarly, Karihonniennihtshera (Teachings) by Kahentawaks Tiewishaw can be played in English, wherein it teaches the player how to identify flora and fauna in the Kanien\u2019k\u00e9ha language, or played entirely in Kanien\u2019k\u00e9ha. \n\nFull immersion is a possible design choice for some Indigenous game developers. Honour Water [2016]<ref>https://jps.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/des/article/view/30405</ref> is a singing game entirely in Anishinaabemowin, much like the virtual reality game Along the River of Spacetime [2020]<ref>http://www.cal.msu.edu/news/professor-lapensee-wins-guggenheim-fellowship-award</ref>. Carl Petersen emphasizes full immersion in his games, which include Lakota instructions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianyouth.org/news/detail/carl-petersen-develops-a-lakota-video-game-to-revitalize-language|title=Carl Petersen Develops a Lakota Video Game to Revitalize Language &#124; Running Strong|website=indianyouth.org}}</ref> \n\nIn addition, there are games that have been localized to Indigenous languages. For example, Pinnguaq localized [[Osmosis]] and [[Ittle Dew]] to Inuktitut and [[Mushroom 11]] [2015] is available in Inuktitut and Algonquin.\n\n==Academic studies==\nResearch of Indigenous video games, ranging from representations to design and development, are on the rise. In 2017, Indigenous Studies [[academic journal|journal]] ''Transmotion'' devoted a special issue to such research.<ref> Transmotion 3:1 (2017) https://journals.kent.ac.uk/index.php/transmotion/issue/view/25</ref>\n\nScholars vary in their fields, methods, and topics.

The population for the city was 106,098 at the 2010 census.\n\nWest Covina is bordered by [[Covina, California|Covina]] to its north and east side. [[Baldwin Park, California|Baldwin Park]] is to the west, [[Irwindale, California|Irwindale]] to the northwest, [[La Puente, California|La Puente]] to the south, and [[Walnut, California|Walnut]] to the southeast.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nWest Covina was incorporated as an independent city in 1923 to prevent the city of [[Covina, California|Covina]] from building a sewage farm in the area. Benjamin Franklin Maxson, Jr., (1897-1928) initiated the incorporation process and was the first mayor.  Walnut groves and orange groves continued to flourish. The population in 1930 was 769 and blossomed to 1,549 in 1940. As a result of remarkable expansion during the post World War II building boom, West Covina became one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000% from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The decades between 1960 and 2000 demonstrated steady growth, which slowed significantly by the time of the 2010 census.\n\nThe City of West Covina began the second half of the 20th century with new developments and projects, mostly brought on by big business. The City Hall and police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Covina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the city offices.\n\nThe first Redevelopment Agency project included a regional shopping center, the West Covina Fashion Plaza, with three major department stores and 150 shops in an air-conditioned, enclosed mall. It also included the revitalization of the older sections of the shopping center. The Fashion Plaza has provided the citizens of the San Gabriel Valley with convenient access to all shopping needs. In 1991 the mall was renovated adding a food court and additional shops, as well as the redecorating of the entire mall. The mall was renamed \"The Plaza at West Covina\". The Plaza opened a new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. wing in October 1993 featuring 50 new stores including a new Robinson's-May and interior renovation throughout The Plaza.\n\nThe Redevelopment Agency's efforts have also resulted in several major office buildings in the city, such as \"The Lakes\", in addition to two new community shopping centers, freestanding retail developments, restaurants, residential projects, and the Auto Plaza.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 769\n|1940= 1072\n|1950= 4499\n|1960= 50645\n|1970= 68034\n|1980= 80292\n|1990= 96086\n|2000= 105080\n|2010= 106098\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106311\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715033846/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - West Covina city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that West Covina had a population of 106,098.

As a result of remarkable expansion during the post World War II building boom, West Covina became one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities between 1950 and 1960, with the population increasing 1,000% from less than 5,000 to more than 50,000 citizens. The decades between 1960 and 2000 demonstrated steady growth, which slowed significantly by the time of the 2010 census.\n\nThe City of West Covina began the second half of the 20th century with new developments and projects, mostly brought on by big business. The City Hall and police facility were built in 1969 as the first phase of an example of a Joint Powers Authority in the County of Los Angeles. The Civic Center Joint Powers Authority, consisting of the County of Los Angeles and the City of West Covina, also completed a three-level parking structure in the Civic Center complex. The Civic Center complex includes the Los Angeles County Regional Library and the Citrus Municipal Court building and the city offices.\n\nThe first Redevelopment Agency project included a regional shopping center, the West Covina Fashion Plaza, with three major department stores and 150 shops in an air-conditioned, enclosed mall. It also included the revitalization of the older sections of the shopping center. The Fashion Plaza has provided the citizens of the San Gabriel Valley with convenient access to all shopping needs. In 1991 the mall was renovated adding a food court and additional shops, as well as the redecorating of the entire mall. The mall was renamed \"The Plaza at West Covina\". The Plaza opened a new {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. wing in October 1993 featuring 50 new stores including a new Robinson's-May and interior renovation throughout The Plaza.\n\nThe Redevelopment Agency's efforts have also resulted in several major office buildings in the city, such as \"The Lakes\", in addition to two new community shopping centers, freestanding retail developments, restaurants, residential projects, and the Auto Plaza.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 769\n|1940= 1072\n|1950= 4499\n|1960= 50645\n|1970= 68034\n|1980= 80292\n|1990= 96086\n|2000= 105080\n|2010= 106098\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=106311\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140715033846/http://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0684200|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 15, 2014|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - West Covina city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that West Covina had a population of 106,098.

The [[scientific method]] is built on testing statements that are [[logical consequence]]s of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable [[experiment]]s or observational studies.\n\nA [[scientific theory]] which is contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or [[falsifiability|falsified]] (see [[predictive power]]). Notions that make no ''testable'' predictions are usually <!--only usually; string theory is considered science though no predictions can be tested-->considered not to be part of science ([[protoscience]] or [[nescience]]) until testable predictions can be made.\n\n[[Mathematical equation]]s and [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[computer model]]s, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the [[probability]] of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of [[quantum physics]].\n\nIn [[microprocessor]]s, [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] permits avoidance of [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] emptying at [[Branch (computer science)|branch instructions]].\n\nIn [[engineering]], possible [[failure mode]]s are predicted and avoided by correcting the [[failure mechanism]] causing the failure.\n\nAccurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as [[natural disasters]], [[pandemics]], [[demography]], [[population dynamics]] and [[meteorology]]. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of [[solar cycle]]s, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).\n\nIn materials engineering it is also possible to predict the life time of a material with a mathematical model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Garcia Hernandez|first1=Maria Inmaculada|title=Life time prediction for low energy and ecological effects bituminous mixtures|journal=Construction and Building Materials|volume=118|year=2018|pages=108\u2013113|url=|doi=10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.09.158}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific hypothesis and prediction ===\nEstablished science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, [[eclipse]]s are routinely predicted.\n\nNew theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge.<ref>{{citation |author1=Woodley, S.M. |author2=Catlow, R. |year=2008 |title=Crystal structure prediction from first principles |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=937\u2013946 |doi=10.1038/nmat2321 |pmid=19029928 }}</ref> In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute [[frame of reference]], which was given the name ''[[luminiferous ether]]''. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The [[special theory of relativity]] was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, as one of the first [[tests of general relativity]], the theory predicted that large masses such as [[star]]s would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.\n\n== Finance ==\n[[File:Augur, decentralized prediction market platform.png|thumb|right|220px|[[Prediction market]].]]\n\nMathematical models of [[stock market]] behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a [[stock investor]] to [[Foresight (psychology)|anticipate]] or predict a [[stock market boom]], or a [[stock market crash]]. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nSome correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.\n\nAn [[actuary]] uses [[actuarial science]] to assess and predict future business [[risk]], such that the risk(s) can be [[Emergency management|mitigated]]. For example, in [[insurance]] an actuary would use a [[Actuarial table|life table]] (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project [[life expectancy]].\n\n==Sports==\n\nPredicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years.  Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]].  Early, well known sports bettors, such as [[Jimmy the Greek]], were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge.  Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.\n\nRecent times have changed the way sports are predicted.  Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models.  Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team.  Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote \"Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won\u2019t put my money on it\".<ref>{{cite book | author = Gordon, Dan\n | date = 2005\n | title = Beat the Sports Books\n | publisher = Cardoza\n | location = New York, United States\n | isbn = 978-1-5804-2174-4\n | url = http://cardozabooks.com/BEAT-THE-SPORTS-BOOKS.html}}</ref>  These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in \"look ahead\" games etc.  As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.\n\nThe widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern [[sports betting systems]].  These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on [[regression analysis]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]], a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today.  He is currently paid as a consultant by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. [[Advanced NFL Stats|Brian Burke]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games.<ref>{{cite web | author = Burke, Brian\n | date = 2008\n | title = NFL Win Prediction Methodology\n | url = http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/nfl-win-prediction-methodology.html}}</ref> [[Ken Pomeroy]] is widely accepted as a leading authority on college basketball statistics.  His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system.  Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems.  Dare wrote \"the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error\".<ref>{{cite book | author = Dare, William H\n | date = 2006\n | title = Risk Return and Gambling Market Efficiency\n | publisher = Oklahoma State University\n | location = Oklahoma City, United States\n | url = http://finance.ba.ttu.edu/new/documents/researchSeminars/fall2006/Risk%20and%20Gambling%20Market%20Efficiency.pdf}}</ref>  Unlike other games offered in a casino, prediction in sporting events can be both logical and consistent.\n\nOther more advance models include those based on Bayesian networks, which are causal probabilistic models commonly used for risk analysis and decision support. Based on this kind of mathematical modelling, Constantinou et al.,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Constantinou|first=Anthony|author2=Fenton, N. |author3=Neil, M. |title=pi-football: A Bayesian network model for forecasting Association Football match outcomes|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|year=2012|volume=36|pages=322\u2013339|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2012.07.008|url=http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~norman/papers/pi-football%20%20A%20Bayesian%20network%20model%20for%20forecasting%20Association%20Football%20match%20outcomes.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Constantinou|first=Anthony|author2=Fenton, N. |author3=Neil, M. |title=Profiting from an inefficient Association Football gambling market: Prediction, Risk and Uncertainty using Bayesian networks.|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|year=2013|volume=50|pages=60\u201386|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2013.05.008|doi-access=free}}</ref> have developed models for predicting the outcome of association football matches. What makes these models interesting is that, apart from taking into consideration relevant historical data, they also incorporate all these vague subjective factors, like availability of key players, team fatigue, team motivation and so on. They provide the user with the ability to include their best guesses about things that there are no hard facts available. This additional information is then combined with historical facts to provide a revised prediction for future match outcomes. The initial results based on these modelling practices are encouraging since they have demonstrated consistent profitability against published market odds.\n\nNowadays sport betting is a huge business; there are many websites (systems) alongside betting sites, which give tips or predictions for future games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soccer picks and predictions|url=http://soccerpunt.com/|website=Soccer Punt}}</ref> Some of these prediction websites (tipsters) are based on human predictions, but others on computer software sometimes called prediction robots or bots. Prediction bots can use different amount of data and algorithms and because of that their accuracy may vary.\n\n==Social science==\nPrediction in the non-economic social sciences differs from the natural sciences and includes multiple alternative methods such as trend projection, forecasting, scenario-building and Delphi surveys. The oil company Shell is particularly well known for its scenario-building activities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Scenario planning|date=2019-06-05|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scenario_planning&oldid=900405612|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>\n\nOne reason for the peculiarity of societal prediction is that in the social sciences, \"predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2019-03-01|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|journal=Energy Research & Social Science|volume=49|pages=36\u201340|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296|doi-access=free}}</ref> As a consequence, societal predictions can become self-destructing. For example, a forecast that a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more security cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Opinion polls ===\n[[File:2004 canadian election approval ratings June 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Approval rating]]s (percentages) for the 2004 Canadian federal election]]\n\nIn [[politics]] it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of [[elections]] via [[political forecasting]] techniques (or assess the popularity of [[politicians]]) through the use of [[opinion polls]]. [[Prediction games]] have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.\n\n==Supernatural prediction==\n{{Main|Prophecy}}\n\nPredictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] means such as [[prophecy]] or by observing [[omen]]s. Methods including [[water divining]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Oneiromancy|interpretation of dreams]], and many other forms of [[divination]], have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.\n\nIn literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events.  They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The [[New Testament]] book of [[Revelation|Revelation (Bible)]] thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a [[sermon]] or other public forum.\n\n[[Divination]] is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual.<ref>Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.</ref> It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency, most often describe as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.<ref name=\"merriamw\">[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/divination ''Definition of divination'']</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\nFiction (especially fantasy, [[future history|forecasting]] and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means.\n* In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[prophecy]], sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague 'feelings'. The character [[Galadriel]], in addition, employs a water \"mirror\" to show images, sometimes of possible future events.\n* In some of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s stories, mutant humans called ''precogs'' can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called ''[[The Golden Man]]'', an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick's stories, ''[[The Minority Report]]'', which was turned into a [[Minority Report (film)|film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002.\n* In the ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series by [[Isaac Asimov]], a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.\n* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s sequels to 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called \"[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]\" out of the trap.\n* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=10em}}\n* [[Expectation (epistemic)|Expectation]]\n* [[Forecasting]]\n* [[Famous predictions]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Omen]]\n* [[Oracle]]\n* [[Predictability]]\n* [[Prediction market]]\n* [[Predictive medicine]]\n* [[Prognosis]]\n* [[Prognostics]]\n* [[Reference class forecasting]]\n* [[Regression analysis]]\n* [[Thought experiment]]\n* [[Trend estimation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | author=Rescher, Nicholas\n | authorlink =Nicholas Rescher\n | title = Predicting the future: An introduction to the theory of forecasting\n | date = 1998\n | publisher = State University of New York Press\n | isbn = 0-7914-3553-9\n }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n[[Category:Prediction| ]]\n[[Category:Futures studies]]\n[[Category:Scientific method]]\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{redirect|predict}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|frame|''[[The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' is famous in the US for its (not necessarily accurate) long-range weather predictions.]]\n\nA '''prediction''' ([[Latin]] ''pr\u00e6-'', \"before,\" and ''dicere'', \"to say\"), or '''[[forecasting|forecast]]''', is a statement about a future [[event (probability theory)|event]].

For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future (or current but not yet observed) values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fox |first=John |year=2016 |title=Applied Regression Analysis and Generalized Linear Models |publisher=Sage |location=London |edition=Third |isbn=978-1-4522-0566-3 }}</ref>\n\n==Prediction in science==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical| footer = [[NASA]]'s 2004 predictions of the solar cycle, which were inaccurate (predicting that [[solar cycle 24]] would start in 2007 and be larger than cycle 23), and the refined predictions in 2012, showing it started in 2010 and is very small. | width = 220 | image1 = SSN Predict NASA.gif | image2 = Hathaway Cycle 24 Prediction.png\n}}\n\nIn science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would happen under specific conditions; for example, if an apple fell from a tree it would be attracted towards the center of the earth by [[gravity]] with a specified and constant [[acceleration]]. The [[scientific method]] is built on testing statements that are [[logical consequence]]s of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable [[experiment]]s or observational studies.\n\nA [[scientific theory]] which is contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or [[falsifiability|falsified]] (see [[predictive power]]). Notions that make no ''testable'' predictions are usually <!--only usually; string theory is considered science though no predictions can be tested-->considered not to be part of science ([[protoscience]] or [[nescience]]) until testable predictions can be made.\n\n[[Mathematical equation]]s and [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[computer model]]s, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the [[probability]] of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of [[quantum physics]].\n\nIn [[microprocessor]]s, [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] permits avoidance of [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] emptying at [[Branch (computer science)|branch instructions]].\n\nIn [[engineering]], possible [[failure mode]]s are predicted and avoided by correcting the [[failure mechanism]] causing the failure.\n\nAccurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as [[natural disasters]], [[pandemics]], [[demography]], [[population dynamics]] and [[meteorology]]. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of [[solar cycle]]s, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).\n\nIn materials engineering it is also possible to predict the life time of a material with a mathematical model.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Garcia Hernandez|first1=Maria Inmaculada|title=Life time prediction for low energy and ecological effects bituminous mixtures|journal=Construction and Building Materials|volume=118|year=2018|pages=108\u2013113|url=|doi=10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2017.09.158}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific hypothesis and prediction ===\nEstablished science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, [[eclipse]]s are routinely predicted.\n\nNew theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge.<ref>{{citation |author1=Woodley, S.M. |author2=Catlow, R. |year=2008 |title=Crystal structure prediction from first principles |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=937\u2013946 |doi=10.1038/nmat2321 |pmid=19029928 }}</ref> In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute [[frame of reference]], which was given the name ''[[luminiferous ether]]''. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The [[special theory of relativity]] was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, as one of the first [[tests of general relativity]], the theory predicted that large masses such as [[star]]s would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.\n\n== Finance ==\n[[File:Augur, decentralized prediction market platform.png|thumb|right|220px|[[Prediction market]].]]\n\nMathematical models of [[stock market]] behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a [[stock investor]] to [[Foresight (psychology)|anticipate]] or predict a [[stock market boom]], or a [[stock market crash]]. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nSome correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.\n\nAn [[actuary]] uses [[actuarial science]] to assess and predict future business [[risk]], such that the risk(s) can be [[Emergency management|mitigated]]. For example, in [[insurance]] an actuary would use a [[Actuarial table|life table]] (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project [[life expectancy]].\n\n==Sports==\n\nPredicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years.  Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]].  Early, well known sports bettors, such as [[Jimmy the Greek]], were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge.  Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.\n\nRecent times have changed the way sports are predicted.  Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models.  Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team.  Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote \"Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won\u2019t put my money on it\".<ref>{{cite book | author = Gordon, Dan\n | date = 2005\n | title = Beat the Sports Books\n | publisher = Cardoza\n | location = New York, United States\n | isbn = 978-1-5804-2174-4\n | url = http://cardozabooks.com/BEAT-THE-SPORTS-BOOKS.html}}</ref>  These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in \"look ahead\" games etc.  As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.\n\nThe widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern [[sports betting systems]].  These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on [[regression analysis]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]], a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today.  He is currently paid as a consultant by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. [[Advanced NFL Stats|Brian Burke]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games.<ref>{{cite web | author = Burke, Brian\n | date = 2008\n | title = NFL Win Prediction Methodology\n | url = http://www.advancednflstats.com/2007/09/nfl-win-prediction-methodology.html}}</ref> [[Ken Pomeroy]] is widely accepted as a leading authority on college basketball statistics.  His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system.  Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems.  Dare wrote \"the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error\".<ref>{{cite book | author = Dare, William H\n | date = 2006\n | title = Risk Return and Gambling Market Efficiency\n | publisher = Oklahoma State University\n | location = Oklahoma City, United States\n | url = http://finance.ba.ttu.edu/new/documents/researchSeminars/fall2006/Risk%20and%20Gambling%20Market%20Efficiency.pdf}}</ref>  Unlike other games offered in a casino, prediction in sporting events can be both logical and consistent.\n\nOther more advance models include those based on Bayesian networks, which are causal probabilistic models commonly used for risk analysis and decision support. Based on this kind of mathematical modelling, Constantinou et al.,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Constantinou|first=Anthony|author2=Fenton, N. |author3=Neil, M. |title=pi-football: A Bayesian network model for forecasting Association Football match outcomes|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|year=2012|volume=36|pages=322\u2013339|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2012.07.008|url=http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~norman/papers/pi-football%20%20A%20Bayesian%20network%20model%20for%20forecasting%20Association%20Football%20match%20outcomes.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Constantinou|first=Anthony|author2=Fenton, N. |author3=Neil, M. |title=Profiting from an inefficient Association Football gambling market: Prediction, Risk and Uncertainty using Bayesian networks.|journal=Knowledge-Based Systems|year=2013|volume=50|pages=60\u201386|doi=10.1016/j.knosys.2013.05.008|doi-access=free}}</ref> have developed models for predicting the outcome of association football matches. What makes these models interesting is that, apart from taking into consideration relevant historical data, they also incorporate all these vague subjective factors, like availability of key players, team fatigue, team motivation and so on. They provide the user with the ability to include their best guesses about things that there are no hard facts available. This additional information is then combined with historical facts to provide a revised prediction for future match outcomes. The initial results based on these modelling practices are encouraging since they have demonstrated consistent profitability against published market odds.\n\nNowadays sport betting is a huge business; there are many websites (systems) alongside betting sites, which give tips or predictions for future games.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soccer picks and predictions|url=http://soccerpunt.com/|website=Soccer Punt}}</ref> Some of these prediction websites (tipsters) are based on human predictions, but others on computer software sometimes called prediction robots or bots. Prediction bots can use different amount of data and algorithms and because of that their accuracy may vary.\n\n==Social science==\nPrediction in the non-economic social sciences differs from the natural sciences and includes multiple alternative methods such as trend projection, forecasting, scenario-building and Delphi surveys. The oil company Shell is particularly well known for its scenario-building activities.<ref>{{Citation|title=Scenario planning|date=2019-06-05|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scenario_planning&oldid=900405612|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>\n\nOne reason for the peculiarity of societal prediction is that in the social sciences, \"predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2019-03-01|title=The geopolitics of renewable energy: Debunking four emerging myths|journal=Energy Research & Social Science|volume=49|pages=36\u201340|doi=10.1016/j.erss.2018.10.018|issn=2214-6296|doi-access=free}}</ref> As a consequence, societal predictions can become self-destructing. For example, a forecast that a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more security cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Opinion polls ===\n[[File:2004 canadian election approval ratings June 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Approval rating]]s (percentages) for the 2004 Canadian federal election]]\n\nIn [[politics]] it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of [[elections]] via [[political forecasting]] techniques (or assess the popularity of [[politicians]]) through the use of [[opinion polls]]. [[Prediction games]] have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.\n\n==Supernatural prediction==\n{{Main|Prophecy}}\n\nPredictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] means such as [[prophecy]] or by observing [[omen]]s. Methods including [[water divining]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Oneiromancy|interpretation of dreams]], and many other forms of [[divination]], have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.\n\nIn literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events.  They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The [[New Testament]] book of [[Revelation|Revelation (Bible)]] thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a [[sermon]] or other public forum.\n\n[[Divination]] is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual.<ref>Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.</ref> It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency, most often describe as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.<ref name=\"merriamw\">[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/divination ''Definition of divination'']</ref>\n\n==In fiction==\nFiction (especially fantasy, [[future history|forecasting]] and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means.\n* In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[prophecy]], sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague 'feelings'. The character [[Galadriel]], in addition, employs a water \"mirror\" to show images, sometimes of possible future events.\n* In some of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s stories, mutant humans called ''precogs'' can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called ''[[The Golden Man]]'', an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick's stories, ''[[The Minority Report]]'', which was turned into a [[Minority Report (film)|film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002.\n* In the ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series by [[Isaac Asimov]], a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.\n* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s sequels to 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called \"[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]\" out of the trap.\n* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=10em}}\n* [[Expectation (epistemic)|Expectation]]\n* [[Forecasting]]\n* [[Famous predictions]]\n* [[Futures studies]]\n* [[Omen]]\n* [[Oracle]]\n* [[Predictability]]\n* [[Prediction market]]\n* [[Predictive medicine]]\n* [[Prognosis]]\n* [[Prognostics]]\n* [[Reference class forecasting]]\n* [[Regression analysis]]\n* [[Thought experiment]]\n* [[Trend estimation]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | author=Rescher, Nicholas\n | authorlink =Nicholas Rescher\n | title = Predicting the future: An introduction to the theory of forecasting\n | date = 1998\n | publisher = State University of New York Press\n | isbn = 0-7914-3553-9\n }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n[[Category:Prediction| ]]\n[[Category:Futures studies]]\n[[Category:Scientific method]]\n\n[[ru:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437]]\n", "name_user": "Rocky8083", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction"}
