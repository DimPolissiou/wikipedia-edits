He was director of [[DARPA|ARPA]]'s [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] from 1965 through 1969, founder and later manager of [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]'s Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983, and founder and manager of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] until 1996.<ref>{{cite book |title= A Brief History of the Future: Origins of the Internet |author= John Naughton |date= October 5, 2000 |publisher= Phoenix |isbn= 978-0-7538-1093-4 }}</ref>\n\nUniquely, Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in [[computer science]]; [[Severo Ornstein]] likened Taylor to a \"concert pianist without fingers,\" a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin: \"Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance, but he could not play it himself. He knew whether to move up or down the scale to approximate the sound, he could recognize when a note was wrong, but he needed someone else to make the music.\"<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=t0k8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=troublemakers+silicon#v=onepage&q=pianist&f=false |title = Troublemakers: Silicon Valley's Coming of Age|isbn = 9781451651508|last1 = Berlin|first1 = Leslie|date = 2017-11-07}}</ref>\n\nHis awards include the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]] and the [[Charles Stark Draper Prize|Draper Prize]].<ref name=\"almanac\">{{cite news |title= Building the Internet: Bob Taylor won the National Medal of Technology \"For visionary leadership in the development of modern computing technology\" |date= October 11, 2000 |author= Marion Softky |work= The California Almanac |url= http://www.almanacnews.com/morgue/2000/2000_10_11.taylor.html |access-date= March 30, 2011 }}</ref> Taylor was known for his high-level vision: \"The Internet is not about technology; it's about communication.

Taylor was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], in 1932.<ref name=\"texas\">{{cite web |title= Internet and use of the computer as communication device the 1960s brainchild of psychology alum |author= Gary Susswein |date= September 14, 2009 |work= University of Texas Alumni profile |url= http://www.utexas.edu/features/2009/09/14/taylor_internet/ |accessdate= March 30, 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100720175751/http://www.utexas.edu/features/2009/09/14/taylor_internet/ |archivedate= July 20, 2010 }}</ref> His adoptive father, Rev. Raymond Taylor, was a [[Methodist]] minister who held degrees from [[Southern Methodist University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Yale Divinity School]]. The family (including Taylor's adoptive mother, Audrey) was highly itinerant during Taylor's childhood, moving from parish to parish. Having skipped several grades as a result of his enrollment in an experimental school, he began his higher education at Southern Methodist University at the age of 16 in 1948; while there, he was \"not a serious student\" but \"had a good time.\"<ref name=\"computerhistory.org\">http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Taylor_Robert/102702015.05.01.acc.pdf</ref>\n\nTaylor then served a stint in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] during the [[Korean War]] (1952\u20131954) at [[Naval Air Station Dallas]] before returning to his studies at the University of Texas at Austin under the [[GI Bill]]. At UT he was a \"professional student,\" taking courses for pleasure. In 1957, he earned an undergraduate degree in [[experimental psychology]]<ref name=\"marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100020542480|title=Marquis Biographies Online}}</ref> from the institution with minors in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], English and [[religion]].\n\nHe subsequently earned a master's degree in psychology from Texas in 1959<ref name=\"marquiswhoswho.com\"/> before electing not to pursue a [[PhD]] in the field. Reflecting his background in experimental psychology and mathematics, he completed research in [[neuroscience]], [[psychoacoustics]] and the auditory [[nervous system]] as a graduate student. According to Taylor, \"I had a teaching assistantship in the department, and they were urging me to get a PhD, but to get a PhD in psychology in those days, maybe still today, you have to qualify and take courses in [[abnormal psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[child psychology]], none of which I was interested in. Those are all sort of in the softer regions of psychology. They're not very scientific, they're not very rigorous. I was interested in [[physiological psychology]], in psychoacoustics or the portion of psychology which deals with science, the nervous system, things that are more like [[applied physics]] and [[biology]], really, than they are what normally people think of when they think of psychology. So I didn't want to waste time taking courses in those other areas and so I said I'm not going to get a PhD.\"<ref name=\"computerhistory.org\"/>\n\nAfter leaving Texas, Taylor taught math and coached basketball for a year at Howey Academy, a co-ed prep school in [[Florida]]. \"I had a wonderful time but was very poor, with a second child \u2014 who turned out to be twins \u2014 on the way,\" he recalled.\n\nTaylor took engineering jobs with aircraft companies at better salaries. He helped to design the [[MGM-31 Pershing]] as a senior systems engineer for [[defense contractor]] [[Martin Marietta]] (1960\u20131961) in [[Orlando, Florida]]. In 1962, he was invited to join [[NASA]]'s Office of Advanced Research and Technology as a program manager assigned to the manned flight control and display division after submitting a research proposal for a flight control simulation display.\n\n==Computer career==\nTaylor worked for NASA in [[Washington, D.C.]] while the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] was backing research and development projects such as the [[Apollo program]] for a manned moon landing. In late 1962 Taylor met [[J. C. R. Licklider]], who was heading the new [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] (IPTO) of the  [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA) of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. Like Taylor, Licklider had specialized in psychoacoustics during his graduate studies. In March 1960, he published \"Man-Computer Symbiosis,\" an article that envisioned new ways to use computers.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Man-Computer Symbiosis |author= [[J. C. R.

He directed NASA funding to Engelbart's studies of computer-display technology at SRI that led to the [[computer mouse]]. The public demonstration of a mouse-based user interface was later called \"[[the Mother of All Demos]].\" At the Fall 1968 [[Joint Computer Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], Engelbart, [[Bill English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], [[Jeff Rulifson]] and the rest of the Human [[Augmentation Research Center]]  team at SRI showed on a big screen how he could manipulate a computer remotely located in Menlo Park, while sitting on a San Francisco stage, using his mouse.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |title= An Internet Pioneer Ponders the Next Revolution |date= December 20, 1999 |author= [[John Markoff]] |work= New York Times  |url= http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/12/biztech/articles/122099outlook-bobb.html }}</ref>\n\n===ARPA===\nIn 1965, Taylor moved from NASA to IPTO, first as a deputy to [[Ivan Sutherland]] (who returned to academia shortly thereafter) to fund large programs in advanced research in computing at major universities and corporate research centers throughout the United States. Among the computer projects that ARPA supported was [[time-sharing]], in which many users could work at terminals to share a single large computer. Users could work interactively instead of using [[punched card]]s or [[punched tape]] in a [[batch processing]] style. Taylor's office in [[the Pentagon]] had a terminal connected to time-sharing at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], a terminal connected to the [[Berkeley Timesharing System]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and a third terminal to the [[System Development Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]].  He noticed each system developed a community of users, but was isolated from the other communities.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nTaylor hoped to build a [[computer network]] to connect the ARPA-sponsored projects together, if nothing else, to let him communicate to all of them through one terminal. By June 1966, Taylor had been named director of IPTO; in this capacity, he shepherded the [[ARPANET]] project until 1969.<ref name = Wizards12>Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet (p. 12). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition \"1965 to 1969\"</ref> Taylor had convinced ARPA director [[Charles M. Herzfeld]] to fund a network project earlier in February 1966, and Herzfeld transferred a million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylor's budget.<ref>Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and the mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A1</ref>  Taylor hired [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]] from [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] to be its first program manager. Roberts first resisted moving to Washington DC, until Herzfeld reminded the director of Lincoln Laboratory that ARPA dominated its funding.<ref name=\"babbage\"/> Licklider continued to provide guidance, and [[Wesley A. Clark]] suggested the use of a dedicated computer, called the [[Interface Message Processor]] at each node of the network instead of centralized control. At the 1967 [[Symposium on Operating Systems Principles]], a member of [[Donald Davies]]' team ([[Roger Scantlebury]]) presented their research on [[packet switching]] and suggested it for use in the ARPANET.<ref name=Isaacson2014>{{cite book|last1=Isaacson|first1=Walter|title=The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=9781476708690|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V9koAEACAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Birthing the Internet: Letters From the Delivery Room; Disputing a Claim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/22/technology/l-birthing-the-internet-letters-from-the-delivery-room-disputing-a-claim-325210.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 22, 2001|author= Robert Taylor|quote=Authors who have interviewed dozens of Arpanet pioneers know very well that the Kleinrock-Roberts claims are not believed.}}</ref> ARPA issued a [[request for quotation]] (RFQ) to build the system, which was awarded to [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN). ATT Bell Labs and [[IBM Research]] were invited to join, but were not interested. At a pivotal meeting in 1967 most participants resisted testing the new network; they thought it would slow down their research.\n\nIn 1968, Licklider and Taylor published \"The Computer as a Communication Device\". The article laid out the future of what the Internet would eventually become.<ref name=\"com68\">{{cite journal |title= The Computer as a Communication Device |author1= [[J. C. R.

Only 35 years old, he was given an identification card with the military rank equivalent to his civilian position ([[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]), thus ensuring protection under the [[Geneva convention]] if he were captured. Over the course of several trips to the area, he established a computer center at the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] base in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]. In his words: \"After that the White House got a single report rather than several. That pleased them; whether the data was any more correct or not, I don't know, but at least it was more consistent.\"<ref name=\"babbage\">{{cite web |title= Oral history interview with Robert William Taylor |publisher= [[Charles Babbage Institute]], University of Minnesota |url= http://purl.umn.edu/107666 |access-date= April 1, 2011 }}</ref> The Vietnam project took him away from directing research, and \"by 1969 I knew ARPANET would work. So I wanted to leave.\"<ref name=\"babbage\"/> \n\nThe election of [[Richard Nixon]] to the presidency and ongoing tensions with Roberts (who, despite maintaining a putatively cordial relationship with Taylor, resented his lack of research experience and appointment to the IPTO directorship) also factored in his decision to leave ARPA. For about a year, he joined Sutherland and [[David C. Evans]] at the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]], where he had funded a center for research on computer graphics while at ARPA.\n\nUnable to acclimate to the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]-dominated milieu, Taylor moved to [[Palo Alto, California]] in 1970 to become associate manager of the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) at [[Xerox Corporation]]'s new [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]].\n\n===Xerox===\nAlthough Taylor played an integral role in recruiting scientists for the laboratory from the ARPA network, physicist and Xerox PARC director [[George Pake]] felt that he was an unsuitable candidate to manage the group because he lacked a relevant doctorate and subsequent experience in academic research. While Taylor eschewed a Pake-proposed research program in computer graphics in favor of largely administering the day-to-day operations of the laboratory from its inception, he acquiesced to the appointment of BBN scientist and ARPA network acquaintance [[Jerome I. Elkind]] as titular CSL manager in 1971.<ref name=\"alto\">{{cite journal |title= Personal Distributed Computing: The Alto and Ethernet Software |journal= ACM Conference on the History of Personal Workstations |location= Palo Alto |date= January 1986 |author= [[Butler Lampson]] |url= http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/38-AltoSoftware/WebPage.html }}</ref>\n\nTechnologies developed at PARC under Taylor's aegis focused on reaching beyond ARPANET to develop what has become the Internet, and the systems that support today's personal computers. They included:\n\n*Powerful [[personal computer]]s (including the [[Xerox Alto]] and later \"D-machines\") with windowed displays and graphical user interfaces that inspired the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]]. The Computer Science Laboratory built the Alto, which was conceived by [[Butler Lampson]] and designed mostly by [[Charles P. Thacker]], [[Edward M. McCreight]], [[Bob Sproull]] and [[David Boggs]]. The Learning Research Group of PARC's Systems Science Laboratory (led by [[Alan Kay]]) added the software-based \"desktop\" metaphor.<ref>Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A14</ref> \n*[[Ethernet]], which networks local computers within a building or campus; and the first [[Internet]], a network that connected the Ethernet to the ARPANET utilizing PUP (PARC Universal Protocol), forerunner to [[TCP/IP]]. It was primarily designed by [[Robert Metcalfe]], Boggs, Thacker and Lampson.\n*The electronics and software that led to the [[Laser printing|laser printer]] (spearheaded by optical engineer [[Gary Starkweather]], who transferred from Xerox's [[Webster, New York]] laboratory to work with CSL) and the  [[Interpress]] [[page description language]] that allowed [[John Warnock]] and [[Chuck Geschke]] to found [[Adobe Systems]].\n*\"What-you-see-is-what-you-get\" ([[WYSIWYG]]) word-processing programs, as exemplified by [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], which [[Charles Simonyi]] took to [[Microsoft]] to serve as the basis for [[Microsoft Word]].\n*[[SuperPaint]], a pioneering [[graphics program]] and [[framebuffer]] computer system developed by [[Richard Shoup (programmer)|Richard Shoup]]. The software was written in consultation with future [[Pixar]] co-founder [[Alvy Ray Smith]], who could not secure an appointment at PARC and was retained as an independent contractor. Although Shoup received a special [[Emmy Award]] (shared with Xerox) in 1983 and an [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award|Academy Scientific Engineering Award]] (shared with Smith and [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Thomas Porter]]) in 1998 for his achievement, program development continued to be marginalized by PARC, ultimately precipitating Shoup's departure in 1979.\n\nBelying his lack of programming and engineering experience, Taylor was noted for his strident advocacy of Licklider-inspired distributed personal computing and his ability to maintain collegial and productive relationships between what was widely perceived as the foremost array of the epoch's leading computer scientists. This was exemplified by a weekly staff meeting at PARC (colloquially known as \"Dealer\" after [[Edward O. Thorp]]'s ''Beat the Dealer'') in which staff members would lead a discussion about myriad topics. They would sit in a circle of beanbag chairs and open debate was encouraged. According to Kay, the meeting \"was part of the larger ARPA community to learn how to argue to illuminate rather than merely to win. ... The main purposes of Dealer -- as invented and implemented by Bob Taylor -- were to deal with how to make things work and make progress without having a formal manager structure. The presentations and argumentation were a small part of a deal session (they did quite bother visiting Xeroids). It was quite rare for anything like a personal attack to happen (because people for the most part came into PARC having been blessed by everyone there -- another Taylor rule -- and already knowing how 'to argue reasonably').\"<ref>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14111999</ref>\n\nThroughout his tenure at PARC, Taylor frequently clashed with Elkind (who held budgetary responsibility for new projects but found his managerial authority undercut by Taylor's intimate relationships with the research staff) and Pake (who did not countenance Taylor's outsized influence in the laboratory and deprecatory attitude toward Xerox's physics research program, then directly overseen by Pake); as a result, he was not officially invited to the company's \"Futures Day\" demo (marking the public premiere of the Alto) in [[Boca Raton, Florida]] in 1977. However, after one of Elkind's extended absences (stemming from his ongoing involvement in other corporate and government projects), Taylor became the manager of the laboratory in early 1978.\n\nIn 1983, physicist and integrated circuit specialist William J. Spencer<!-- no article on this one --> became director of PARC. Spencer and Taylor disagreed about budget allocations for CSL (exemplified by the ongoing institutional divide between computer science and physics) and CSL's frustration with Xerox's inability to recognize and use what they had developed. By the end of the year, Taylor and most of the researchers at CSL left Xerox. A coterie of leading computer scientists (including Licklider, [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Dana Scott]]) expressed their displeasure with Xerox's decision not to retain Taylor in a letter-writing campaign to CEO [[David Kearns]].\n\n===DEC SRC===\n<!-- Xerox management could not be convinced of the possibilities of personal computing, and the researchers were frustrated.<ref>Smith, Douglas K. and Alexander, Robert C., \"Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer\" (1999)</ref> bit of a myth I think-->Taylor was hired by [[Ken Olsen]] of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and formed the [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] in Palo Alto.  Many of the former CSL researchers came to work at SRC.  Among the projects at SRC were the [[Modula-3]] programming language; the snoopy cache, used in the Firefly multiprocessor workstation; the first multi-threaded Unix system; the first User Interface editor; the [[AltaVista]] search engine<ref>Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create the PC, Internet and the mouse, New York Times,\n April 15, 2017, p.A14</ref> and a networked Window System.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nTaylor retired from DEC in 1996. Following his divorce (coinciding with his departure from Xerox), he lived in a secluded house in [[Woodside, California]].\n\nIn 2000, he voiced two concerns about the future of the Internet: control and access. In his words:\n<blockquote>There are many worse ways of endangering a larger number of people on the Internet than on the highway. It's possible for people to generate networks that reproduce themselves and are very difficult or impossible to kill off. I want everyone to have the right to use it, but there's got to be some way to insure responsibility.<br /><br />Will it be freely available to everyone?  If not, it will be a big disappointment.<ref name=\"almanac\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, he died at his home in Woodside, California. His son said he had suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] and other health problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-robert-taylor-obit-20170414-story.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=14 April 2017|title=Robert W.

He was director of [[DARPA|ARPA]]'s [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] from 1965 through 1969, founder and later manager of [[PARC (company)|Xerox PARC]]'s Computer Science Laboratory from 1970 through 1983, and founder and manager of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] until 1996.<ref>{{cite book |title= A Brief History of the Future: Origins of the Internet |author= John Naughton |date= October 5, 2000 |publisher= Phoenix |isbn= 978-0-7538-1093-4 }}</ref>\n\nUniquely, Taylor had no formal academic training or research experience in [[computer science]]; [[Severo Ornstein]] likened Taylor to a \"concert pianist without fingers,\" a perception reaffirmed by historian Leslie Berlin: \"Taylor could hear a faint melody in the distance, but he could not play it himself.

Taylor was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], in 1932.<ref name=\"texas\">{{cite web |title= Internet and use of the computer as communication device the 1960s brainchild of psychology alum |author= Gary Susswein |date= September 14, 2009 |work= University of Texas Alumni profile |url= http://www.utexas.edu/features/2009/09/14/taylor_internet/ |accessdate= March 30, 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100720175751/http://www.utexas.edu/features/2009/09/14/taylor_internet/ |archivedate= July 20, 2010 }}</ref> His adoptive father, Rev. Raymond Taylor, was a [[Methodist]] minister who held degrees from [[Southern Methodist University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Yale Divinity School]]. The family (including Taylor's adoptive mother, Audrey) was highly itinerant during Taylor's childhood, moving from parish to parish. Having skipped several grades as a result of his enrollment in an experimental school, he began his higher education at Southern Methodist University at the age of 16 in 1948; while there, he was \"not a serious student\" but \"had a good time.\"<ref name=\"computerhistory.org\">http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Oral_History/Taylor_Robert/102702015.05.01.acc.pdf</ref>\n\nTaylor then served a stint in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] during the [[Korean War]] (1952\u20131954) at [[Naval Air Station Dallas]] before returning to his studies at the University of Texas at Austin under the [[GI Bill]]. At UT he was a \"professional student,\" taking courses for pleasure. In 1957, he earned an undergraduate degree in [[experimental psychology]]<ref name=\"marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100020542480|title=Marquis Biographies Online}}</ref> from the institution with minors in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], English and [[religion]].\n\nHe subsequently earned a master's degree in psychology from Texas in 1959<ref name=\"marquiswhoswho.com\"/> before electing not to pursue a [[PhD]] in the field. Reflecting his background in experimental psychology and mathematics, he completed research in [[neuroscience]], [[psychoacoustics]] and the auditory [[nervous system]] as a graduate student. According to Taylor, \"I had a teaching assistantship in the department, and they were urging me to get a PhD, but to get a PhD in psychology in those days, maybe still today, you have to qualify and take courses in [[abnormal psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[child psychology]], none of which I was interested in. Those are all sort of in the softer regions of psychology. They're not very scientific, they're not very rigorous. I was interested in [[physiological psychology]], in psychoacoustics or the portion of psychology which deals with science, the nervous system, things that are more like [[applied physics]] and [[biology]], really, than they are what normally people think of when they think of psychology. So I didn't want to waste time taking courses in those other areas and so I said I'm not going to get a PhD.\"<ref name=\"computerhistory.org\"/>\n\nAfter leaving Texas, Taylor taught math and coached basketball for a year at Howey Academy, a co-ed prep school in [[Florida]]. \"I had a wonderful time but was very poor, with a second child \u2014 who turned out to be twins \u2014 on the way,\" he recalled.\n\nTaylor took engineering jobs with aircraft companies at better salaries. He helped to design the [[MGM-31 Pershing]] as a senior systems engineer for [[defense contractor]] [[Martin Marietta]] (1960\u20131961) in [[Orlando, Florida]]. In 1962, he was invited to join [[NASA]]'s Office of Advanced Research and Technology as a program manager assigned to the manned flight control and display division after submitting a research proposal for a flight control simulation display.\n\n==Computer career==\nTaylor worked for NASA in [[Washington, D.C.]] while the [[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]] was backing research and development projects such as the [[Apollo program]] for a manned moon landing. In late 1962 Taylor met [[J. C. R. Licklider]], who was heading the new [[Information Processing Techniques Office]] (IPTO) of the  [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]] (ARPA) of the [[United States Department of Defense]]. Like Taylor, Licklider had specialized in psychoacoustics during his graduate studies. In March 1960, he published \"Man-Computer Symbiosis,\" an article that envisioned new ways to use computers.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Man-Computer Symbiosis |author= [[J. C. R.

He directed NASA funding to Engelbart's studies of computer-display technology at SRI that led to the [[computer mouse]]. The public demonstration of a mouse-based user interface was later called \"[[the Mother of All Demos]].\" At the Fall 1968 [[Joint Computer Conference]] in [[San Francisco]], Engelbart, [[Bill English (computer engineer)|Bill English]], [[Jeff Rulifson]] and the rest of the Human [[Augmentation Research Center]]  team at SRI showed on a big screen how he could manipulate a computer remotely located in Menlo Park, while sitting on a San Francisco stage, using his mouse.<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |title= An Internet Pioneer Ponders the Next Revolution |date= December 20, 1999 |author= [[John Markoff]] |work= New York Times  |url= http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/12/biztech/articles/122099outlook-bobb.html }}</ref>\n\n===ARPA===\nIn 1965, Taylor moved from NASA to IPTO, first as a deputy to [[Ivan Sutherland]] (who returned to academia shortly thereafter) to fund large programs in advanced research in computing at major universities and corporate research centers throughout the United States. Among the computer projects that ARPA supported was [[time-sharing]], in which many users could work at terminals to share a single large computer. Users could work interactively instead of using [[punched card]]s or [[punched tape]] in a [[batch processing]] style. Taylor's office in [[the Pentagon]] had a terminal connected to time-sharing at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], a terminal connected to the [[Berkeley Timesharing System]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and a third terminal to the [[System Development Corporation]] in [[Santa Monica, California]].  He noticed each system developed a community of users, but was isolated from the other communities.<ref name=\"nyt\"/>\n\nTaylor hoped to build a [[computer network]] to connect the ARPA-sponsored projects together, if nothing else, to let him communicate to all of them through one terminal. By June 1966, Taylor had been named director of IPTO; in this capacity, he shepherded the [[ARPANET]] project until 1969.<ref name = Wizards12>Lyon, Matthew; Hafner, Katie (1999-08-19). Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet (p. 12). Simon & Schuster. Kindle Edition \"1965 to 1969\"</ref> Taylor had convinced ARPA director [[Charles M. Herzfeld]] to fund a network project earlier in February 1966, and Herzfeld transferred a million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylor's budget.<ref>Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and the mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A1</ref>  Taylor hired [[Lawrence Roberts (scientist)|Larry Roberts]] from [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]] to be its first program manager. Roberts first resisted moving to Washington DC, until Herzfeld reminded the director of Lincoln Laboratory that ARPA dominated its funding.<ref name=\"babbage\"/> Licklider continued to provide guidance, and [[Wesley A. Clark]] suggested the use of a dedicated computer, called the [[Interface Message Processor]] at each node of the network instead of centralized control. At the 1967 [[Symposium on Operating Systems Principles]], a member of [[Donald Davies]]' team ([[Roger Scantlebury]]) presented their research on [[packet switching]] and suggested it for use in the ARPANET.<ref name=Isaacson2014>{{cite book|last1=Isaacson|first1=Walter|title=The Innovators: How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution|date=2014|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=9781476708690|page=237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4V9koAEACAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA237#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Birthing the Internet: Letters From the Delivery Room; Disputing a Claim|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/22/technology/l-birthing-the-internet-letters-from-the-delivery-room-disputing-a-claim-325210.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=November 22, 2001|author= Robert Taylor|quote=Authors who have interviewed dozens of Arpanet pioneers know very well that the Kleinrock-Roberts claims are not believed.}}</ref> ARPA issued a [[request for quotation]] (RFQ) to build the system, which was awarded to [[BBN Technologies|Bolt, Beranek and Newman]] (BBN). ATT Bell Labs and [[IBM Research]] were invited to join, but were not interested. At a pivotal meeting in 1967 most participants resisted testing the new network; they thought it would slow down their research.\n\nIn 1968, Licklider and Taylor published \"The Computer as a Communication Device\". The article laid out the future of what the Internet would eventually become.<ref name=\"com68\">{{cite journal |title= The Computer as a Communication Device |author1= [[J. C. R.

Only 35 years old, he was given an identification card with the military rank equivalent to his civilian position ([[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]), thus ensuring protection under the [[Geneva convention]] if he were captured. Over the course of several trips to the area, he established a computer center at the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam]] base in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]]. In his words: \"After that the White House got a single report rather than several. That pleased them; whether the data was any more correct or not, I don't know, but at least it was more consistent.\"<ref name=\"babbage\">{{cite web |title= Oral history interview with Robert William Taylor |publisher= [[Charles Babbage Institute]], University of Minnesota |url= http://purl.umn.edu/107666 |access-date= April 1, 2011 }}</ref> The Vietnam project took him away from directing research, and \"by 1969 I knew ARPANET would work. So I wanted to leave.\"<ref name=\"babbage\"/> \n\nThe election of [[Richard Nixon]] to the presidency and ongoing tensions with Roberts (who, despite maintaining a putatively cordial relationship with Taylor, resented his lack of research experience and appointment to the IPTO directorship) also factored in his decision to leave ARPA. For about a year, he joined Sutherland and [[David C. Evans]] at the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]], where he had funded a center for research on computer graphics while at ARPA.\n\nUnable to acclimate to the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]-dominated milieu, Taylor moved to [[Palo Alto, California]] in 1970 to become associate manager of the Computer Science Laboratory (CSL) at [[Xerox Corporation]]'s new [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]].\n\n===Xerox===\nAlthough Taylor played an integral role in recruiting scientists for the laboratory from the ARPA network, physicist and Xerox PARC director [[George Pake]] felt that he was an unsuitable candidate to manage the group because he lacked a relevant doctorate and subsequent experience in academic research. While Taylor eschewed a Pake-proposed research program in computer graphics in favor of largely administering the day-to-day operations of the laboratory from its inception, he acquiesced to the appointment of BBN scientist and ARPA network acquaintance [[Jerome I. Elkind]] as titular CSL manager in 1971.<ref name=\"alto\">{{cite journal |title= Personal Distributed Computing: The Alto and Ethernet Software |journal= ACM Conference on the History of Personal Workstations |location= Palo Alto |date= January 1986 |author= [[Butler Lampson]] |url= http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/blampson/38-AltoSoftware/WebPage.html }}</ref>\n\nTechnologies developed at PARC under Taylor's aegis focused on reaching beyond ARPANET to develop what has become the Internet, and the systems that support today's personal computers. They included:\n\n*Powerful [[personal computer]]s (including the [[Xerox Alto]] and later \"D-machines\") with windowed displays and graphical user interfaces that inspired the [[Apple Lisa]] and [[Macintosh]]. The Computer Science Laboratory built the Alto, which was conceived by [[Butler Lampson]] and designed mostly by [[Charles P. Thacker]], [[Edward M. McCreight]], [[Bob Sproull]] and [[David Boggs]]. The Learning Research Group of PARC's Systems Science Laboratory (led by [[Alan Kay]]) added the software-based \"desktop\" metaphor.<ref>Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create PC, Internet and mouse, New York Times, April 15, 2017, p.A14</ref> \n*[[Ethernet]], which networks local computers within a building or campus; and the first [[Internet]], a network that connected the Ethernet to the ARPANET utilizing PUP (PARC Universal Protocol), forerunner to [[TCP/IP]]. It was primarily designed by [[Robert Metcalfe]], Boggs, Thacker and Lampson.\n*The electronics and software that led to the [[Laser printing|laser printer]] (spearheaded by optical engineer [[Gary Starkweather]], who transferred from Xerox's [[Webster, New York]] laboratory to work with CSL) and the  [[Interpress]] [[page description language]] that allowed [[John Warnock]] and [[Chuck Geschke]] to found [[Adobe Systems]].\n*\"What-you-see-is-what-you-get\" ([[WYSIWYG]]) word-processing programs, as exemplified by [[Bravo (software)|Bravo]], which [[Charles Simonyi]] took to [[Microsoft]] to serve as the basis for [[Microsoft Word]].\n*[[SuperPaint]], a pioneering [[graphics program]] and [[framebuffer]] computer system developed by [[Richard Shoup (programmer)|Richard Shoup]]. The software was written in consultation with future [[Pixar]] co-founder [[Alvy Ray Smith]], who could not secure an appointment at PARC and was retained as an independent contractor. Although Shoup received a special [[Emmy Award]] (shared with Xerox) in 1983 and an [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award|Academy Scientific Engineering Award]] (shared with Smith and [[Thomas Porter (Pixar)|Thomas Porter]]) in 1998 for his achievement, program development continued to be marginalized by PARC, ultimately precipitating Shoup's departure in 1979.\n\nBelying his lack of programming and engineering experience, Taylor was noted for his strident advocacy of Licklider-inspired distributed personal computing and his ability to maintain collegial and productive relationships between what was widely perceived as the foremost array of the epoch's leading computer scientists. This was exemplified by a weekly staff meeting at PARC (colloquially known as \"Dealer\" after [[Edward O. Thorp]]'s ''Beat the Dealer'') in which staff members would lead a discussion about myriad topics. They would sit in a circle of beanbag chairs and open debate was encouraged. According to Kay, the meeting \"was part of the larger ARPA community to learn how to argue to illuminate rather than merely to win. ... The main purposes of Dealer -- as invented and implemented by Bob Taylor -- were to deal with how to make things work and make progress without having a formal manager structure. The presentations and argumentation were a small part of a deal session (they did quite bother visiting Xeroids). It was quite rare for anything like a personal attack to happen (because people for the most part came into PARC having been blessed by everyone there -- another Taylor rule -- and already knowing how 'to argue reasonably').\"<ref>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14111999</ref>\n\nThroughout his tenure at PARC, Taylor frequently clashed with Elkind (who held budgetary responsibility for new projects but found his managerial authority undercut by Taylor's intimate relationships with the research staff) and Pake (who did not countenance Taylor's outsized influence in the laboratory and deprecatory attitude toward Xerox's physics research program, then directly overseen by Pake); as a result, he was not officially invited to the company's \"Futures Day\" demo (marking the public premiere of the Alto) in [[Boca Raton, Florida]] in 1977. However, after one of Elkind's extended absences (stemming from his ongoing involvement in other corporate and government projects), Taylor became the manager of the laboratory in early 1978.\n\nIn 1983, physicist and integrated circuit specialist William J. Spencer<!-- no article on this one --> became director of PARC. Spencer and Taylor disagreed about budget allocations for CSL (exemplified by the ongoing institutional divide between computer science and physics) and CSL's frustration with Xerox's inability to recognize and use what they had developed. By the end of the year, Taylor and most of the researchers at CSL left Xerox. A coterie of leading computer scientists (including Licklider, [[Donald Knuth]] and [[Dana Scott]]) expressed their displeasure with Xerox's decision not to retain Taylor in a letter-writing campaign to CEO [[David Kearns]].\n\n===DEC SRC===\n<!-- Xerox management could not be convinced of the possibilities of personal computing, and the researchers were frustrated.<ref>Smith, Douglas K. and Alexander, Robert C., \"Fumbling the Future: How Xerox Invented, Then Ignored, the First Personal Computer\" (1999)</ref> bit of a myth I think-->Taylor was hired by [[Ken Olsen]] of [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], and formed the [[DEC Systems Research Center|Systems Research Center]] in Palo Alto.  Many of the former CSL researchers came to work at SRC.  Among the projects at SRC were the [[Modula-3]] programming language; the snoopy cache, used in the Firefly multiprocessor workstation; the first multi-threaded Unix system; the first User Interface editor; the [[AltaVista]] search engine<ref>Markoff, John, Innovator who helped create the PC, Internet and the mouse, New York Times,\n April 15, 2017, p.A14</ref> and a networked Window System.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nTaylor retired from DEC in 1996. Following his divorce (coinciding with his departure from Xerox), he lived in a secluded house in [[Woodside, California]].\n\nIn 2000, he voiced two concerns about the future of the Internet: control and access. In his words:\n<blockquote>There are many worse ways of endangering a larger number of people on the Internet than on the highway. It's possible for people to generate networks that reproduce themselves and are very difficult or impossible to kill off. I want everyone to have the right to use it, but there's got to be some way to insure responsibility.<br /><br />Will it be freely available to everyone?  If not, it will be a big disappointment.<ref name=\"almanac\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn April 13, 2017, he died at his home in Woodside, California. His son said he had suffered from [[Parkinson's disease]] and other health problems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-robert-taylor-obit-20170414-story.html|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=14 April 2017|title=Robert W.

Unlike other BOINC projects, World Community Grid set the BOINC defaults conservatively, making the chances of computer damage extremely small. The default CPU throttle is 60%. The throttle is coarse-grained; for example, if usage is set to 60% it will work at 100% for 3 seconds, then at 0% for 2 seconds, resulting in an average decrease of processor use.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=cpuuse#33\n|title=CPU Usage: Why does my PC show high CPU use?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n}}</ref>\n\nAn add-on program for Windows computers \u2013 [http://efmer.eu/boinc/ TThrottle] \u2013 can solve the problem of overheating by directly limiting the BOINC project's use of the host computer.

It also uses a shorter switching time of less than one second, resulting in less temperature change during switching.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Statistics and competition==\nThe contributions of each user are recorded and user contribution statistics are publicly available.<ref name=\"Global Statistics\"/> Due to the fact that the processing time of each workunit varies from computer to computer, depending on the difficulty of the workunit, the speed of the computer, and the amount of idle resources available, contributions are usually measured in terms of ''points''. Points are awarded for each workunit depending on the effort required to process it.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#27\n|title=Points: What are points?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-07-28\n}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing a workunit, the [[BOINC]] client will request the number of points it thinks it deserves based on software [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s (''see [[BOINC Credit System#Cobblestones]]''). Since multiple computers process the same workunit to ensure accuracy, the World Community Grid servers can look at the points claimed by each of those computers. The WCG servers disregard statistical outliers, average the remaining values and award the resulting number of points to each computer.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#177\n|title=Points: How are points calculated for the BOINC agent?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/forums/wcg/viewthread?thread=9545\n|title=BOINC Points\n|author=knreed\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|date=2006-11-02\n|accessdate=2007-07-28\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the grid, users may join teams that have been created by organizations, groups, or individuals.

Unlike other BOINC projects, World Community Grid set the BOINC defaults conservatively, making the chances of computer damage extremely small. The default CPU throttle is 60%. The throttle is coarse-grained; for example, if usage is set to 60% it will work at 100% for 3 seconds, then at 0% for 2 seconds, resulting in an average decrease of processor use.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=cpuuse#33\n|title=CPU Usage: Why does my PC show high CPU use?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n}}</ref>\n\nAn add-on program for Windows computers \u2013 [http://efmer.eu/boinc/ TThrottle] \u2013 can solve the problem of overheating by directly limiting the BOINC project's use of the host computer.

During rule of dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] relations were strained because of the part that Albania played during [[World War II]] against Greece and also because of the material help that they provided to Greek communists during the [[Greek civil war]]. In addition there was controversy about the [[expulsion of Cham Albanians]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Albanian socialist regime in 1991, relations between the two countries got better but soon begun to deteriorate with accusations about mistreatment of minorities vice versa. To the latter problem it was added the widespread phenomenon of waves of illegal immigration from Albania towards Greece. High criminality numbers from one hand and alleged police brutality from the other became familiar subjects on the news of both neighbors, increasing eventually tensions. According to official Greek data around 450,000 Albanian immigrants work in Greece and it is believed the number will almost double if illegal immigrants are accounted too. This is a brand new situation, for both countries as Greece for the first time become a destination country for immigrants and Albanians for the first time got out of their country after the total isolation that the communist regime had imposed.\n\nToday, relations between the two countries are very close and are regarded as excellent, and, at the Albanian Government's request, about 250 [[Military of Greece|Greek military]] personnel are stationed in Albania to assist with the training and restructuring the [[Albanian Armed Forces]].

Moreover, Greek products account for 21% of Albania's imports, with Greece absorbing 12% of its neighboring country's exports.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/en-US/Policy/Geographic+Regions/South-Eastern+Europe/Balkans/Bilateral+Relations/Albania/ Bilateral Relations Between Greece And Albania<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the same time, low cost labor from Albania propelled the growth of the Greek economy, especially in the construction and agriculture sectors.

A wave of Albanian illegal economic migrants to Greece exacerbated tensions. The crisis in Greek\u2013Albanian relations reached its peak in late August 1994, when an Albanian court sentenced five members (a sixth member was added later) of the ethnic Greek political party ''Omonia'' to prison terms on charges of undermining the Albanian state. Greece responded by freezing all [[European Union|EU]] aid to Albania, and sealing its border with Albania. In December 1994, however, Greece began to permit limited EU aid to Albania, while Albania released two of the ''Omonia'' defendants and reduced the sentences of the remaining four. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are still other impending issues in the relations between the two countries, regarding many Albanian workers in Greece who have not received legal papers despite promises by the Greek government. In 1996, the two countries signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship and discussed the issues of the status of Albanian [[refugee]]s in Greece and [[education]] in the [[mother tongue]] for the ethnic Greek minority in southern Albania. In the 1990s, Greece preferred and assisted Fatos Nano as Albanian leader due to him being Orthodox over Sali Berisha a Muslim, as Nano was seen as being friendlier to Greek interests.<ref name=\"Konidaris80\">{{cite book|last=Konidaris|first=Gerasimos|chapter=Examining policy responses to immigration in the light of interstate relations and foreign policy objectives: Greece and Albania|editor1-last=King|editor1-first=Russell|editor2-last=Schwandner-Sievers|editor2-first=Stephanie |title=The new Albanian migration|year=2005|location=Brighton|publisher=Sussex Academic|isbn=9781903900789|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=05Mw4-b9oN0C|ref=harv}} pp. 80\u201381. \"Greece's favorite candidate in these elections was clearly MR.

During rule of dictator [[Enver Hoxha]] relations were strained because of the part that Albania played during [[World War II]] against Greece and also because of the material help that they provided to Greek communists during the [[Greek civil war]]. In addition there was controversy about the [[expulsion of Cham Albanians]].\n\nAfter the fall of the Albanian socialist regime in 1991, relations between the two countries got better but soon begun to deteriorate with accusations about mistreatment of minorities vice versa. To the latter problem it was added the widespread phenomenon of waves of illegal immigration from Albania towards Greece. High criminality numbers from one hand and alleged police brutality from the other became familiar subjects on the news of both neighbors, increasing eventually tensions. According to official Greek data around 450,000 Albanian immigrants work in Greece and it is believed the number will almost double if illegal immigrants are accounted too. This is a brand new situation, for both countries as Greece for the first time become a destination country for immigrants and Albanians for the first time got out of their country after the total isolation that the communist regime had imposed.\n\nToday, relations between the two countries are very close and are regarded as excellent, and, at the Albanian Government's request, about 250 [[Military of Greece|Greek military]] personnel are stationed in Albania to assist with the training and restructuring the [[Albanian Armed Forces]].

Settlements initially arose in the [[Brisbane]] and [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] areas with activity by European immigrants spreading in all directions from there.  Various industries such as timber cutting and agriculture quickly developed at locations around the region from the 1840s onwards.

Stone and Parker, who write the show, use the show frequently to lampoon [[Subject matter in South Park|a wide range of topics]] and both sides of contentious issues.\n\nParker and Stone usually reply to such controversies by regarding themselves as \"equal opportunity offenders\".<ref name=\"whois\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |title=Who is Kyle Broslofski? |accessdate=2009-02-04 |author=Raphael, Rebecca |date=1998-05-22 |work=[[New Voices (magazine)|New Voices]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815135956/http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |archivedate=2012-08-15 }}</ref> They reject the notion of [[political correctness]], and state that no particular topic or group of people will be exempt from mockery and satire, out of fairness to any person or group of people who have been ridiculed before.<ref name=\"abc1\">{{cite web|author1=Tapper, Jake|author2=Dan Morris|lastauthoramp=yes |  title=Secrets of 'South Park'| publisher=ABC News| date= 2006-09-22| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/Story?id=2479197&page=1| accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref><ref name=\"cornell\">{{cite news|first=William |last=Cohen |title=Respect Its Authoritah! |work=The Cornell American |date=2005-11-04 |url=http://www.cornellamerican.com/article/109/print/ |accessdate=2009-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20100129195812/http://www.cornellamerican.com/article/109/print/ |archivedate=2010-01-29 }}</ref><ref name=\"lowbrow\">{{cite news | author=Lim, Dennis| title = Television: Lowbrow and proud of it  | newspaper = independent.co.uk| date = 1998-03-29| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/television-lowbrow-and-proud-of-it-1153256.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref name=\"mcfarland2\">{{cite news|author=McFarland, Melanie| title= Oh my God, 'South Park' killed a decade!| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date= 2006-09-30|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/287052_southpark02.html| accessdate = 2009-05-09}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimesconserv\">{{cite news|author=Rich, Frank| title = Conservatives \u2665 'South Park' | work = The New York Times | date = 2005-05-01 | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/opinion/01rich.html | accessdate = 2009-05-03}}</ref><ref name=\"cityjournal\">{{cite news|author=Anderson, Brian C.| title = We\u2019re Not Losing the Culture Wars Anymore| publisher = [[Manhattan Institute]]| year = 2003| url = http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_4_were_not_losing.html | accessdate = 2009-05-03}}</ref>\n\n==Rating==\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], South Park is mainly rated [[TV-MA]]: This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17 and may contain one or more of the following: crude indecent language (L), strong sexual content (S), or graphic violence (V). To note, some episodes on syndication have been reclassified TV-14. However, starting in 2017, uncut airings of South Park on Comedy Central have been receiving a TV-14-DLSV rating, mainly from the first twenty seasons. Seasons 21\u201322, as well as particularly offensive episodes (i.e., [[Bloody Mary (South Park)|''Bloody Mary'']], [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|''Trapped in the Closet'']]) still carry a TV-MA rating.\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the first three seasons and some episodes in season 4, were rated [[Australian Classification Board|M]]: Recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over. The M rating is unrestricted and moderate in impact, and it is equivalent to America's TV-14 rating. The latter seasons are rated MA15+, which is a rating restricted for people over 15 years, and is strong in impact. Despite being rated M on television, the [[South Park (season 3)|season 3]] DVD set was the first season to receive an MA15+ rating. The consumer advice usually goes as follows; Adult themes (A), coarse language (L), sexual references (S) and/or animated violence (V). Depending on the rating, the terms \"moderate\" and \"strong\" precede these descriptions.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the show is generally rated [[BBFC|15]], until [[South Park (season 7)|season 7]] when it gets an 18 rating due to the audio commentaries (the episodes are only rated 15). However, some episodes, such as those in the first four seasons do have a 12 rating ([[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]). Furthermore, the [[South Park season 3|season 3]] DVD set was originally rated 18 in the UK, [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]], due to the content of the final episode, [[World Wide Recorder Concert]] (which contains references to [[child molestation]]). It was re-rated 15 in the UK upon its re-release in 2008, although in Ireland it is still rated 18, as a number of episodes in the latter seasons. Later in the series, [[South Park (season 20)|season 20]] was rated 18 due to strong sex references, along with [[South Park (season 22)|season 22]] was also rated 18 for child sexual abuse references.\n\n===Other countries===\nIn [[Canada]], the VHS/DVD sets were originally rated 18A, but later re-rated to a 14A rating. On Canadian streaming services such as [[CraveTV]], it carries an 18+ rating for violence (V), language (L), sex (S), nudity (N) and mature themes (M). [[South Park (season 4)|Season 4]] is the only season rated R13 in [[New Zealand]] and the first season is rated M, akin to Australia's rating. The rest of the seasons have a R16 rating. The television rating of the show in New Zealand is AO (adults only). In [[Spain]], the show is rated 18 (years and above).\n\n''South Park'' was banned in [[India]]. According to [[VH1 India]]'s channel head Ferzad Palia, after being reviewed by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Indian Ministry of Broadcasting]], the show was banned for its vulgarity.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/south-park-in-india-shuts-runs-into-trouble-in-us-too/article1-561421.aspx South Park in India shuts, runs into trouble in US too] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031151704/http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/south-park-in-india-shuts-runs-into-trouble-in-us-too/article1-561421.aspx |date=October 31, 2014 }}.

Stone commented that Hayes practiced a double standard regarding the treatment of religion on ''South Park'': \"[We] never heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we [lampooned] Scientology.

Stone discussed his experiences growing up in the [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] area and the social alienation that might have contributed to the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Stone, who is a gun-owner himself, said that Moore's presentation of their interview was fair, but he criticized the director for a short animated segment that followed the interview. The cartoon, which is about the history of guns in the United States, implies that there is a connection between the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the establishment of the [[National Rifle Association]]. Matt Stone, who did not have anything to do with that short cartoon, criticized Moore for making the cartoon \"very ''South Park''-esque\" and argued that Moore deliberately sought to give viewers the incorrect impression that he and Trey Parker had produced the animation, by playing these two completely separate segments consecutively. \"We have a very specific beef with Michael Moore.

To note, some episodes on syndication have been reclassified TV-14. However, starting in 2017, uncut airings of South Park on Comedy Central have been receiving a TV-14-DLSV rating, mainly from the first twenty seasons. Seasons 21-22, as well as particularly offensive episodes (i.e, [[Bloody Mary (South Park)|''Bloody Mary'']], [[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|''Trapped in the Closet'']]) still carry a TV-MA rating.\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the first three seasons and some episodes in season 4, were rated [[Australian Classification Board|M]]: Recommended for mature audiences 15 years and over. The M rating is unrestricted and moderate in impact, and it is equivalent to America's TV-14 rating. The latter seasons are rated MA15+, which is a rating restricted for people over 15 years, and is strong in impact. Despite being rated M on television, the [[South Park (season 3)|season 3]] DVD set was the first season to receive an MA15+ rating. The consumer advice usually goes as follows; Adult themes (A), coarse language (L), sexual references (S) and/or animated violence (V). Depending on the rating, the terms \"moderate\" and \"strong\" precede these descriptions.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the show is generally rated [[BBFC|15]], until [[South Park (season 7)|season 7]] when it gets an 18 rating due to the audio commentaries (the episodes are only rated 15). However, some episodes, such as those in the first four seasons do have a 12 rating ([[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]). Furthermore, the [[South Park season 3|season 3]] DVD set was originally rated 18 in the UK, [[Canada]] and [[Ireland]], due to the content of the final episode, [[World Wide Recorder Concert]] (which contains references to [[child molestation]]). It was re-rated 15 in the UK upon its re-release in 2008, although in Ireland it is still rated 18, as a number of episodes in the latter seasons. Later in the series, [[South Park (season 20)|season 20]] was rated 18 due to strong sex references, along with [[South Park (season 22)|season 22]] was also rated 18 for child sexual abuse references.\n\n===Other countries===\nIn [[Canada]], the VHS/DVD sets were originally rated 18A, but later re-rated to a 14A rating. On Canadian streaming services such as [[CraveTV]], it carries an 18+ rating for violence (V), language (L), sex (S), nudity (N) and mature themes (M). [[South Park (season 4)|Season 4]] is the only season rated R13 in [[New Zealand]] and the first season is rated M, akin to Australia's rating. The rest of the seasons have a R16 rating. The television rating of the show in New Zealand is AO (adults only). In [[Spain]], the show is rated 18 (years and above).\n\n''South Park'' was banned in [[India]]. According to [[VH1 India]]'s channel head Ferzad Palia, after being reviewed by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Indian Ministry of Broadcasting]], the show was banned for its vulgarity.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/south-park-in-india-shuts-runs-into-trouble-in-us-too/article1-561421.aspx South Park in India shuts, runs into trouble in US too] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031151704/http://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/television/south-park-in-india-shuts-runs-into-trouble-in-us-too/article1-561421.aspx |date=October 31, 2014 }}.

Residents of South Park panic, fearing a terrorist response and a repeat of the real-life violent protests and riots that occurred worldwide after some Muslims regarded Muhammad's cartoon depiction in a [[Denmark|Danish]] newspaper as insulting and blasphemous. The first episode had a cliffhanger ending instructing viewers to watch part two to find out whether the image of Muhammad would be shown uncensored. In the second episode, Kyle persuades a Fox executive to air the ''Family Guy'' with the image uncensored, while echoing Parker and Stone's sentiments regarding what should or should not be censored of \"[either] it's got to all be OK or none of it is\".<ref name=\"abc1\"/> Within the universe of the episode, the ''Family Guy'' episode is aired uncensored, despite a retaliation threat from [[Al-Qaeda]].

The studio advises that the episode is not available online because they do not have network clearance to air the uncensored episode.

Stone discussed his experiences growing up in the [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]] area and the social alienation that might have contributed to the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Stone, who is a gun-owner himself, said that Moore's presentation of their interview was fair, but he criticized the director for a short animated segment that followed the interview. The cartoon, which is about the history of guns in the United States, implies that there is a connection between the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the establishment of the [[National Rifle Association]].

After realizing that they all shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their own band. Masafumi Gotoh became the [[lead vocalist]] and played [[rhythm guitar]], Kensuke Kita played [[lead guitar]] and sang [[backup vocals|backup]] and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer [[Kiyoshi Ijichi]] joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local [[Yokohama]] area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having [[Caramelman and Asian Kung-Fu Generation|collaborated]] with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first [[Indie (music)|indie]] [[Extended play|EP]] in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in [[English (language)|English]]. The four spent the remainder of the year playing in clubs and hosting independent events.\n\nThe year after, the band made an attempt to attain airplay on indie radio stations for their first Japanese single, {{nihongo|\"Konayuki\"|\u7c89\u96ea|}}. The song was eventually picked up by a popular radio DJ and put into heavy rotation on the station [[FM Yokohama]] upon the demand of listeners. AKFG then released another indie EP, ''[[I'm Standing Here]]''. This time, however, the band wrote songs in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]. At this time, the band had begun drawing an increasingly large number of audiences to their shows held in clubs in the districts of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Shimokitazawa]], [[Kichij\u014dji]], and [[Tokyo]].<ref name=\"ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work= Sony Music Website |publisher=[[Ki/oon Records|Ki/oon Records Inc]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025080610/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html| archivedate= 25 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' and ''Kimi Tsunagi Five M''===\n{{Main|H\u014dkai Amplifier|Kimi Tsunagi Five M}}\nOn November 25, 2002, after contributing to the Under Flowers Records compilation, ''Whatch You Gonna Do?'', Asian Kung\u2013Fu Generation officially released their first major-label [[Extended play|mini-album]], {{nihongo|''[[H\u014dkai Amplifier]]''|\u5d29\u58ca\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |title=Under Flower Label \u2014 Release discography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work=Under Flower Label |publisher=Under-flower Co., Ltd |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107011123/http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |archivedate=2009-01-07 }} {{in lang|ja}}<!--Japanese--></ref> The group enlisted [[internet radio]] host and graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura to design and compose their single and album covers.<ref name=\"digmeout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |title=digmeout ARTISTS [Yusuke Nakamura] |accessdate=2007-04-07 |work=DigMeOut.net |publisher=digmeout |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006075642/http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |archivedate=2007-10-06 }}</ref> The critically acclaimed EP topped the High Line Records' weekly chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number thirty-five on the [[Oricon]] indies sales chart.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rhoades |first=Reginald |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 2004 |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume= |issue= |page=59 |id= |url=http://www.akfgfan.com/pictures/akfgmag02.jpg |accessdate=2008-12-14 |quote= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of its success, ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' was re-released on April 23, 2003, by the band's new record label, [[Ki/oon Records]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Japan]].

After realizing that they all shared similar musical tastes, the three decided to start their own band. Masafumi Gotoh became the [[lead vocalist]] and played [[rhythm guitar]], Kensuke Kita played [[lead guitar]] and sang [[backup vocals|backup]] and Takahiro Yamada played bass. Drummer [[Kiyoshi Ijichi]] joined them later on after parting with another college band he was in. The four then began providing performances at their university as well as throughout the local [[Yokohama]] area. After graduating from college, following years of playing in several small venues and having [[Caramelman and Asian Kung-Fu Generation|collaborated]] with fellow Japanese rock musician Caramelman, AKFG released their first [[Indie (music)|indie]] [[Extended play|EP]] in 2000. The six-track EP contained original lyrics written and sung almost entirely in [[English (language)|English]]. The four spent the remainder of the year playing in clubs and hosting independent events.\n\nThe year after, the band made an attempt to attain airplay on indie radio stations for their first Japanese single, {{nihongo|\"Konayuki\"|\u7c89\u96ea|}}. The song was eventually picked up by a popular radio DJ and put into heavy rotation on the station [[FM Yokohama]] upon the demand of listeners. AKFG then released another indie EP, ''[[I'm Standing Here]]''. This time, however, the band wrote songs in [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]]. At this time, the band had begun drawing an increasingly large number of audiences to their shows held in clubs in the districts of [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]], [[Shimokitazawa]], [[Kichij\u014dji]], and [[Tokyo]].<ref name=\"ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION: Biography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work= Sony Music Website |publisher=[[Ki/oon Records|Ki/oon Records Inc]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025080610/http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/AKG/eng/bio/index.html| archivedate= 25 October 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' and ''Kimi Tsunagi Five M''===\n{{Main|H\u014dkai Amplifier|Kimi Tsunagi Five M}}\nOn November 25, 2002, after contributing to the Under Flowers Records compilation, ''Whatch You Gonna Do?'', Asian Kung\u2013Fu Generation officially released their first major-label [[Extended play|mini-album]], {{nihongo|''[[H\u014dkai Amplifier]]''|\u5d29\u58ca\u30a2\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |title=Under Flower Label \u2014 Release discography |accessdate=2008-10-09 |work=Under Flower Label |publisher=Under-flower Co., Ltd |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107011123/http://www.under-flower.co.jp/uf/uf%20new%20top%20page/underflowerlabel/Uf%20disco5.html |archivedate=2009-01-07 }} {{in lang|ja}}<!--Japanese--></ref> The group enlisted [[internet radio]] host and graphic artist Yusuke Nakamura to design and compose their single and album covers.<ref name=\"digmeout\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |title=digmeout ARTISTS [Yusuke Nakamura] |accessdate=2007-04-07 |work=DigMeOut.net |publisher=digmeout |year=2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006075642/http://www.digmeout.net/artist_e.cfm?id=56 |archivedate=2007-10-06 }}</ref> The critically acclaimed EP topped the High Line Records' weekly chart for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number thirty-five on the [[Oricon]] indies sales chart.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rhoades |first=Reginald |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=July 2004 |title=ASIAN KUNG-FU GENERATION |journal=[[Animerica]] |volume= |issue= |page=59 |id= |url=http://www.akfgfan.com/pictures/akfgmag02.jpg |accessdate=2008-12-14 |quote= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of its success, ''H\u014dkai Amplifier'' was re-released on April 23, 2003, by the band's new record label, [[Ki/oon Records]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Japan]].
