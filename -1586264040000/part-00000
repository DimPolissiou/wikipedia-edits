While his other brothers continued with their education it was necessary for Brickhill, who was regarded as the least academic of the children, to get a job to assist his older brother Russell in bringing money into the family.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 37.</ref> He was sacked from his first two jobs due to his stutter. He then got a job as office boy and then lift boy at the Adelaide Steamship Company. That job did not last long, as Peter Finch, who was by now working as a copy boy, was able to convince a news editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]''  to interview Brickhill in 1932.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 39.</ref> Brickhill was hired as a copy boy, and within a year promoted to cadet journalist. Within a few years he had worked his way up to journalist, and by 1940 was a sub-editor.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 47.</ref>\n\n==World War II==\nBrickhill was initially unimpressed by war fever, until the shock of the invasion of France and subsequent withdrawal from Dunkirk, coupled with boredom with his deskbound sub-editor job, caused him to enlist on 6 January 1941 with the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF).<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 49.</ref>\nHis flight training commenced in March 1941 at the Number 8 Elementary Flying Training School at Narrandera, New South Wales as undertaken in Australia \nUnder the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]]. Brickhill undertook advanced training as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] pilot in Canada and the United Kingdom before being assigned to [[No. 92 Squadron RAF]], a unit equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s and part of the [[Desert Air Force]] in North Africa. \n\nOn 17 March 1943, he was shot down over [[Tunisia]] and became a [[prisoner of war]].<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 1 to 12.</ref> He was flown to Italy on 23 March, then sent by train to Germany. After initially being held at the [[Dulag Luft]] at [[Oberursel (Taunus) | Oberursel]], a central receiving and interrogation station for captured enemy airman for the [[Luftwaffe]], he was sent to [[Stalag Luft III]], in [[Lower Silesia]], 150 km southeast of Berlin, arriving there on 4 April 1943.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 84 to 85.</ref>\nBrickhill became involved with organizing the camp's escape, initially as a lookout or \"stoogie\", before volunteering to work as a digger on the \"Tom\" tunnel\".<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 102 to 105.</ref> He developed [[claustrophobia]], and as a result was eventually reassigned and put in charge of security for the forgers. Because of his claustrophobia and the risk that he would panic and block the escape of others behind him, he was not allowed to take part in the [[Stalag Luft III escape|mass escape attempt]], which is today known as \"The Great Escape\".<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 124.</ref>\n\nFollowing the announcement of the murder of the escapees who had been recaptured following the Great Escape, Brickhill became determined to document the event. Discussing the subject with fellow prisoner Conrad Norton, they identified that many of their fellow prisoners had other tales of daring escapes, and that they could provide the possibility of publishing a book following the end of the war. As Brickhill had been involved in \"The Great Escape\", he concentrated on that story, while Norton collected individual tales.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 138.</ref> As prisoners were forbidden from writing anything other than letters and postcards, they collected every piece of paper they could find and, writing in as small a hand as possible, they collected stories and hid them from the guards. \n\nOn [[D-Day]], while still in captivity, Brickhill heard on German radio of two huge Allied armadas heading towards [[Cap d'Antifer]] and [[Calais]].  These were diversions created by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] to fool the Germans, however, a fact he learned months later.\n\n==Return to journalism==\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the terms of his enlistment with the RAAF had been that he had to serve for 12 months following the cessation of hostilities, Brickhill was granted six months' leave without pay. During his leave he returned to journalism, working as a London-based correspondent for [[Associated Newspapers]]. Meanwhile outside of working hours he had typed up his and Norton's stories and selected David Higham as their literary agent.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 162.</ref> With Higham's help the manuscript was accepted by [[Faber & Faber]] and published as ''Escape to Danger'' in 1946.\n\nAfter working for Associated Newspapers for a period, Brickhill returned to Australia, taking a job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in Sydney, Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 194.</ref>\n\nBrickhill and Norton had agreed that each would retain the copyright to the chapters that they had written for ''Escape to Danger''. As a result while awaiting for sufficient stocks of paper to be obtained to print the book, Brickhill was able to sell a condensed version of his chapter on the Great Escape to several newspapers in Australia.\n\n==The Great Escape and The Dam Busters==\nAfter the end of World War II, John Nerney, head of the [[Air Historical Branch]] of the [[British Air Ministry]] identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. While trying to find a suitable author he discussed the issue with [[John Pudney]], who was an editor at ''[[News Review]]''. Pudney had liked ''Escape to Danger'' and suggested that Brickhill be considered.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 196.</ref>\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. While doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provide Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 197.</ref> In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book. None was interested so Brickhill was forced to decline Nerney's offer.<ref name=Dando-CollinsP198>Dando-Collins. Page 198.</ref>\n \nAt the same time Brickhill had been approached by John Pudney who had recently joined London based publisher [[Evans Brothers]] as an editor with a proposal to write a book on the Stalag Luft 3 mass escape. This was eventually to be published as ''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]''.<ref name= Dando-CollinsP198/>\nWith the advance that Evans Brothers offered Brickhill he left his job and sailed to England in May 1949.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 199.</ref>\n\nOnce in England Brickhill asked the RAF about the status of the proposed history of 617 squadron, offering his services if they were still required. As the RAF had made no further progress in finding an alternative author, his offer was accepted.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 200.</ref>\nBrickhill approached Evans Brothers about an advance for the proposed book on 617 Squadron, but they were not interested in providing any advance until they saw a manuscript.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 206.</ref> \nAlready working on ''The Great Escape'', Brickhill also commenced simultaneous work on the 617 squadron history.\n\n''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]'' was published in 1950 and brought the incident to wide public attention. \n\nThe history of 617 Squadron and in particular its involvement in [[Operation Chastise|Operation ''Chastise'']] and the destruction of dams in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] valley was published in 1951 as ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'', selling over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 233.</ref><ref name= RamsdenP20 >Ramsden. Page 20.</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Dam Busters'' [[Robert Clark (film executive)|Robert Clark]] the head of production at [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] approached Brickhill about acquiring the screen rights to the book. The company's production manager was of the opinion that there were too many people and raids involved, and that they would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result he requested that Brickhill provide a condensed film treatment. Brickhill agree to do it without payment in the hope of selling the screen rights. To assist , Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company's Director of Production.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 237.</ref>  Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on [[Operation Chastise]], and ignore the later raids.\n\nAssociated agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been \u20a45,000.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 241.</ref>\n\nThe subsequent film was released in 1954 as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.\n\n==''Reach for the Sky''==\nAfter reading ''The Dam Busters'', [[Battle of Britain]] ace [[Douglas Bader]] approached Brickhill in 1951 about collaborating on his biography.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 233 to 236.</ref> Brickhill agreed to undertake the project.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 239.</ref>\n\nAfter approaching several publishers about the proposed biography Brickhill's agent found that William Collins and Sons were prepared to offer the best terms, leading Brickhill to sign with them. However Brickhill felt guilty about not signing with John Pudney and Evans Brothers, who had previously been so supportive of him.  He consequently offered to write an anthology of escape stories for them, which they eventually published as ''Escape \u2013 Or Die''.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 240.</ref>\n\nThe resulting biography of Bader was published in 1954 as ''Reach for the Sky''. In the first few months alone, 172,000 copies were sold.<ref>Mackenzie. Page 164.</ref> The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain.\n\nThe book was subsequently adapted for the screen and released in 1956 as a [[Reach for the Sky (1956 film)|feature film]]. Starring [[Kenneth More]] as Bader, it topped the box office in Britain that year.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 303 to304.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBrickhill spent the rest of his life working on several unfinished film screenplays, novels and biographies, but was never able to repeat his successes of 1949 to 1954.\n\nIn 1969 he returned to live permanently in Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 355.</ref> Brickhill died in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] on 23 April 1991 aged 74.<ref name=ADB>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brickhill-paul-chester-14647 |title=Brickhill, Paul Chester (1916\u20131991) |first=Craig|last=Wilcox|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}</ref> See also John Ramsland's update.<ref>John A Ramsland.

As Brickhill had been involved in \"The Great Escape\", he concentrated on that story, while Norton collected individual tales.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 138.</ref> As prisoners were forbidden from writing anything other than letters and postcards, they collected every piece of paper they could find and, writing in as small a hand as possible, they collected stories and hid them from the guards. \n\nOn [[D-Day]], while still in captivity, Brickhill heard on German radio of two huge Allied armadas heading towards [[Cap d'Antifer]] and [[Calais]].  These were diversions created by [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] to fool the Germans, however, a fact he learned months later.\n\n==Returns to journalism==\n\nFollowing the end of the war, while the terms of his enlistment with the RAAF had been that he had to serve for 12 months following the cessation of hostilities, Brickhill was granted six months' leave without pay. During his leave he returned to journalism, working as a London-based correspondent for [[Associated Newspapers]]. Meanwhile outside of working hours he had typed up his and Norton's stories and selected David Higham as their literary agent.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 162.</ref> With Higham's help the manuscript was accepted by [[Faber & Faber]] and published as ''Escape to Danger'' in 1946.\n\nAfter working for Associated Newspapers for a period, Brickhill returned to Australia, taking a job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' newspaper in Sydney, Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 194.</ref>\n\nBrickhill and Norton had agreed that each would retain the copyright to the chapters that they had written for ''Escape to Danger''. As a result while awaiting for sufficient stocks of paper to be obtained to print the book, Brickhill was able to sell a condensed version of his chapter on the Great Escape to several newspapers in Australia.\n\n==The Great Escape and The Dam Busters==\nAfter the end of World War II, John Nerney, head of the [[Air Historical Branch]] of the [[British Air Ministry]] identified the need for a history of 617 Squadron. While trying to find a suitable author he discussed the issue with [[John Pudney]], who was an editor at ''[[News Review]]''. Pudney had liked ''Escape to Danger'' and suggested that Brickhill be considered.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 196.</ref>\n\nFollowing up Pudney's recommendation, Nerney approached Brickhill in February 1949, who jumped at the offer. While doing all it could to assist his research the Air Ministry could only provide Brickhill with a small honorarium, and no guarantee of publication other than as a government produced publication.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 197.</ref> In an attempt to obtain an advance which would pay enough for him to leave his current job as a sub-editor at ''[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]]'' and relocate to England Brickhill approached a number of Australian publishers to see if they were interested in an Australian edition of the book. None was interested so Brickhill was forced to decline Nerney's offer.<ref name=Dando-CollinsP198>Dando-Collins. Page 198.</ref>\n \nAt the same time Brickhill had been approached by John Pudney who had recently joined London based publisher [[Evans Brothers]] as an editor with a proposal to write a book on the Stalag Luft 3 mass escape. This was eventually to be published as ''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]''.<ref name= Dando-CollinsP198/>\nWith the advance that Evans Brothers offered Brickhill he left his job and sailed to England in May 1949.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 199.</ref>\n\nOnce in England Brickhill asked the RAF about the status of the proposed history of 617 squadron, offering his services if they were still required. As the RAF had made no further progress in finding an alternative author, his offer was accepted.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 200.</ref>\nBrickhill approached Evans Brothers about an advance for the proposed book on 617 Squadron, but they were not interested in providing any advance until they saw a manuscript.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 206.</ref> \nAlready working on ''The Great Escape'', Brickhill also commenced simultaneous work on the 617 squadron history.\n\n''[[The Great Escape (book)|The Great Escape]]'' was published in 1950 and brought the incident to wide public attention. \n\nThe history of 617 Squadron and in particular its involvement in [[Operation Chastise|Operation ''Chastise'']] and the destruction of dams in the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] valley was published in 1951 as ''[[The Dam Busters (book)|The Dam Busters]]'', selling over one million copies in its first 50 years.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 233.</ref><ref name= RamsdenP20 >Ramsden. Page 20.</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of ''The Dam Busters'' [[Robert Clark (film executive)|Robert Clark]] the head of production at [[Associated British Picture Corporation]] approached Brickhill about acquiring the screen rights to the book. The company's production manager was of the opinion that there were too many people and raids involved, and that they would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result he requested that Brickhill provide a condensed film treatment. Brickhill agree to do it without payment in the hope of selling the screen rights. To assist , Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company's Director of Production.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 237.</ref>  Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on [[Operation Chastise]], and ignore the later raids.\n\nAssociated agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been \u20a45,000.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 241.</ref>\n\nThe subsequent film was released in 1954 as ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.\n\n==''Reach for the Sky''==\nAfter reading ''The Dam Busters'', [[Battle of Britain]] ace [[Douglas Bader]] approached Brickhill in 1951 about collaborating on his biography.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 233 to 236.</ref> Brickhill agreed to undertake the project.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 239.</ref>\n\nAfter approaching several publishers about the proposed biography Brickhill's agent found that William Collins and Sons were prepared to offer the best terms, leading Brickhill to sign with them. However Brickhill felt guilty about not signing with John Pudney and Evans Brothers, who had previously been so supportive of him.  He consequently offered to write an anthology of escape stories for them, which they eventually published as ''Escape \u2013 Or Die''.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 240.</ref>\n\nThe resulting biography of Bader was published in 1954 as ''Reach for the Sky''. In the first few months alone, 172,000 copies were sold.<ref>Mackenzie. Page 164.</ref> The initial print run of 300,000 quickly sold out, as the biography became the biggest-selling hardback in post-war Britain.\n\nThe book was subsequently adapted for the screen and released in 1956 as a [[Reach for the Sky (1956 film)|feature film]]. Starring [[Kenneth More]] as Bader, it topped the box office in Britain that year.<ref>Dando-Collins. Pages 303 to304.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBrickhill spent the rest of his life working on several unfinished film screenplays, novels and biographies, but was never able to repeat his successes of 1949 to 1954.\n\nIn 1969 he returned to live permanently in Australia.<ref>Dando-Collins. Page 355.</ref> Brickhill died in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]] on 23 April 1991 aged 74.<ref name=ADB>{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/brickhill-paul-chester-14647 |title=Brickhill, Paul Chester (1916\u20131991) |first=Craig|last=Wilcox|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}</ref> See also John Ramsland's update.<ref>John A Ramsland.

[[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] was at that time sweeping the English-speaking nations as well, and it readily appealed to those in the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, as spirit contact, especially with the dead, is an essential part of many African religions.\n\nDuring the conflict between Myal and Obeah, the Myal men positioned themselves as the \"good\" opponents to \"evil\" Obeah.<ref>\"The Obeah men are hired to revenge some man's wrong, while Myal men profess to undo the work of Obeah men and to cure those subject to Obeah alarms.\" OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. \"The Outbreak In Jamaica.\" Times [London, England] 2 Apr. 1866: 10.

Myal men contacted spirits in order to expose the evil works they ascribed to the Obeah men, and led public parades which resulted in crowd-hysteria that engendered violent antagonism against Obeah men. The public \"discovery\" of buried Obeah charms, presumed to be of evil intent, led on more than one occasion to violence against the rival Obeah practitioners. Such conflicts between supposedly \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d spiritual work could sometimes be found within plantation communities.

''Moko'' was a common word for [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] slaves{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. In the Trinidad and Tobago Obeah tradition, a [[Douen]] is a child who has died before being baptized, and is said to be forced to forever walk the earth at night in English-speaking regions of the Caribbean.  Jewelry is made from deadly toxic red and black seeds called jumbies, jumbie eyes or jumbie beads (seeds of ''[[Abrus precatorius]]'') in the Caribbean and South America. By contrast, the moko-jumbie of Trinidad and Tobago is brightly colored, dances in the daylight, and is very much alive. The moko-jumbie also represents the flip side of spiritual darkness, as stilt-dancing is most popular around holy days and [[Carnival]].\n\nObeah in the Bahamas\nCurrently, the Bahamian Penal Code (Chapter 84:  Sections 232-234) allows for up to 3 months of incarceration for practicing obeah.  Interestingly, suspicion of possessing an instrument of obeah (vials, blood, bone, images) while in a courtroom, can result in immediate search without warrant and a fine where such item is found.\n\n\u00a0 Obeah Laws In Trinidad Trinidad has similar laws like Jamaica for Obeah as a crime. Trinidad did not have as many cases of people practicing Obeah compared to Jamaica. In Trinidad, there was discrimination of what was a religion practice or what was considered Obeah. The reason for this is the cultural differences of the Blacks and East Indian race living in Trinidad and Tobago (Page 68).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Rocklin|first=Alexander|title=Obeah and the Politics of Religion's Making and Unmaking in Colonial Trinidad|url=https://www.academia.edu/25436027|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|language=en|volume=83|issue=3|pages=697\u2013721|issn=0002-7189|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfv022|year=2015}}</ref>  These laws containing to obeah was set from the British laws.

In Jamaica, where there wasn't a high population of East Indian people, there was only 4 percent of prosecution for the crimes of obeah. In Jamaica and Trinidad there was more people that believed that the East Indian descendants were  known to be affiliated with being an \"obeahman\" because of their spiritual practices, that are connected to their religion. Some of those religions are Hindu and Muslim.  People that were convicted of obeah in Trinidad has serve six months as a maximum punishment. These two countries had other smaller punishments like fines or lashes. Lashes are beatings that the person being convicted of obeah would receive with whips. These lashes would also be reported in how many lashes the person would receive in documents.\n\n==Mentions in literature==\nAlthough 18th-century literature mentions Obeah often, one of the earliest references to Obeah in fiction can be found in 1800, in William Earle's novel ''Obi; or, The History of Three-Finger'd Jack'', a narrative inspired by true events that was also reinterpreted in several dramatic versions on the London stage in 1800 and following.<ref>[http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/obi/toc.html Obi]</ref> One of the next major books about Obeah was ''Hamel, the Obeah Man'' (1827).  Several early plantation novels also include Obeah plots.

[[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] was at that time sweeping the English-speaking nations as well, and it readily appealed to those in the Afro-Caribbean diaspora, as spirit contact, especially with the dead, is an essential part of many African religions.\n\nDuring the conflict between Myal and Obeah, the Myal men positioned themselves as the \"good\" opponents to \"evil\" Obeah.<ref>\"The Obeah men are hired to revenge some man's wrong, while Myal men profess to undo the work of Obeah men and to cure those subject to Obeah alarms.\" OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. \"The Outbreak In Jamaica.\" Times [London, England] 2 Apr. 1866: 10.

The public \"discovery\" of buried Obeah charms, presumed to be of evil intent, led on more than one occasion to violence against the rival Obeah practitioners. Such conflicts between supposedly \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d spiritual work could sometimes be found within plantation communities.

''Moko'' was a common word for [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]] slaves{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. In the Trinidad and Tobago Obeah tradition, a [[Douen]] is a child who has died before being baptized, and is said to be forced to forever walk the earth at night in English-speaking regions of the Caribbean.  Jewelry is made from deadly toxic red and black seeds called jumbies, jumbie eyes or jumbie beads (seeds of ''[[Abrus precatorius]]'') in the Caribbean and South America. By contrast, the moko-jumbie of Trinidad and Tobago is brightly colored, dances in the daylight, and is very much alive. The moko-jumbie also represents the flip side of spiritual darkness, as stilt-dancing is most popular around holy days and [[Carnival]].\n\nObeah in the Bahamas\nCurrently, the Bahamian Penal Code (Chapter 84:  Sections 232-234) allows for up to 3 months of incarceration for practicing obeah.  Interestingly, suspicion of possessing an instrument of obeah (vials, blood, bone, images) while in a courtroom, can result in immediate search without warrant and a fine where such item is found.\n\n\u00a0 Obeah Laws In Trinidad Trinidad has similar laws like Jamaica for Obeah as a crime. Trinidad did not have as many cases of people practicing Obeah compared to Jamaica. In Trinidad, there was discrimination of what was a religion practice or what was considered Obeah.

In Jamaica, where there wasn't a high population of East Indian people, there was only 4 percent of prosecution for the crimes of obeah. In Jamaica and Trinidad there was more people that believed that the East Indian descendants were  know to be affiliated with being an \"obeahman\" because of their spiritual practices, that are connected to their religion. Some of those religions are Hindu and Muslim.  People that were convicted of obeah in Trinidad has serve six months as a maximum punishment. These two countries had other smaller punishments like fines or lashes. Lashes are beatings that the person being convicted of obeah would receive with whips. These lashes would also be reported in how many lashes the person would receive in documents.\n\n==Mentions in literature==\nAlthough 18th-century literature mentions Obeah often, one of the earliest references to Obeah in fiction can be found in 1800, in William Earle's novel ''Obi; or, The History of Three-Finger'd Jack'', a narrative inspired by true events that was also reinterpreted in several dramatic versions on the London stage in 1800 and following.<ref>[http://www.rc.umd.edu/praxis/obi/toc.html Obi]</ref> One of the next major books about Obeah was ''Hamel, the Obeah Man'' (1827).

Prior to Islamic influence, Javanese already recognised several term to describe clothings, such as ''kulambi'' (clothes), ''sarwul'' (pants), and ''ken'' (''kain'' or long fabric wrapped around the waist).<ref name=\"Triyanto\"/> During the last period of Majapahit kingdom, Islamic influence began to grow in coastal Javanese towns, thus there was a need to adapt the Javanese fashion to the newly adopted [[Islam]] religion. The tailored blouse, often made from delicate sheer fabrics, were worn over ''kemban'' torso wrap to cover the back, shoulders and arms, in order for court ladies to appear more modest. The adoption of a more modest fashion was attributed to the Islamic influence upon the archipelago.<ref name=\"Triyanto\"/>\nAceh, Riau and Johor Kingdoms and Northern Sumatra adopted the Javanese style kebaya as a means of social expression of status with the more ''alus'' or refined Javanese overlords.<ref name=\"Chavalit\">Maenmas Chavalit, Maneepin Phromsuthirak: ''Costumes in ASEAN'': ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information: 2000: \n{{ISBN|974-7102-83-8}}, 293 pages</ref>\n\nThe name of Kebaya as a particular clothing type was noted by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] when they landed in [[Indonesia]].

Kebaya blouse can be tailored tight-fitting or loose-fitting, made from various materials, from cotton or velvet, to fine silk, exquisite lace and brocade, decorated with stitching or glittering sequins. \n\n;Undergarments: Because many of kebaya fabrics are made of fine, sheer and semi-transparent materials, there is a need to wear undergarments beneath to cover the breasts for modesty purpose. Traditionally, Javanese women wearing ''kemben'' torso wrap beneath their kebaya. Today however, the undergarment use under kebaya usually either [[corset]], [[bra]] or [[camisole]] with matching colour. The more simple and modest undergarment wore by common village women, usually elderly women, is called ''kutang'', which is a bra-like undergarment made from cotton. \n\n;Kerongsang brooch: Traditional kebaya had no buttons down the front. To secure the blouse openings in the front, a decorative metal [[brooch]] is applied on the chest. It can be made from brass, iron, silver or gold, decorated with semi-precious stones. A typical three-piece kerongsang is composed of a ''kerongsang ibu'' (mother piece) that is larger and heavier than the other two ''kerongsang anak'' (child piece). ''Kerongsang'' brooch often made from [[gold]] jewelry and considered as the sign of social status of aristocracy, wealth and nobility, however for commoners and peasant women, simple and plain kebaya often only fastened with modest [[safety pin]] (''peniti'').\n\n;Kain sarong or skirt: Kain is a long decorated clothes wrapped around the hips, secured with rope and wore as a kind of [[sarong]] or skirt.  The skirt or ''kain'' is an unstitched fabric wrap around three metres long. The term ''sarong'' in English is erroneous, the ''sarung'' (Malaysian accent: sarong) is actually stitched together to form a tube, ''kain'' is unstitched, requires a helper to dress (literally wrap) the wearer and is held in place with a string (''tali''), then folded this string at the waist, then held with a belt (''sabuk'' or ''ikat pinggang''), which may hold a decorative pocket. In Java, Bali and Sunda, the kain is commonly [[batik]] which may be from plain stamped cotton to elaborately hand-painted ''batik tulis'' embroidered silk with gold thread. In [[Lampung]], the kain is the traditional ''tapis'', an elaborate gold-thread embroidered ikat with small mica discs.<ref>Inger McCabe Elliott ''Batik: Fabled Cloth of Java'', Hong Kong: Periplus, 2004</ref> Sumatra, Flores, Lemata Timor, and other islands commonly use kain of ikat or songket.

The Sundanese and modern kebaya has U shaped collar edged with brocade and often decorated with sequins. Modern kebaya also might apply various shapes and curves of collars.\n\n;Fabrics: In fabrics aspect, the blouse known as ''baju kebaya'' may be of two main forms: the transparent or semi-transparent straighter cut blouse of Java, Bali, or the more plain and modest kebaya of Sumatra and Malaya.\n\n;Cut and fittings: In the cut aspect, two main varieties are; the more tightly tailored Java, Bali and Sunda kebaya, and the loose-fitting modest kebaya wore by more pious Muslim women, usually wore with hijab. The more Islamic compatible, a plainer and modest ''[[baju kurung]]'' is a loose-fitting, knee-length long-sleeved blouse worn in the more Muslim areas, including the former Kingdom of Johor-Riau (now Malaysia), Sumatra, Brunei and parts of coastal Borneo and Java.\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Kebaya Fanbo Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Indonesian woman in kebaya and kain [[batik]].

The adornment is quite minimal, only stitching or applied laces along the edges. The V-shaped collar cut of this type of kebaya is quite similar to the Peranakan Encim kebaya, however it is distinguishes by its distinctive fold on the chest. Another feature of the Kartini kebaya is the length of the kebaya that covers the hips, and the collar folds with a vertical line shape, which creates the tall and slender impression of the wearer.<ref name=\"Gosocio\">{{cite web | work = Go Socio | title = Mengenal Jenis-Jenis Kebaya di Indonesia| url = http://gosocio.co.id/mengenal-jenis-jenis-kebaya-di-indonesia.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> The Kartini-style kebaya inspired the cut and style of [[Garuda Indonesia]]'s flight attendants' uniform.\n\n===Kebaya Jawa===\nThis type of kebaya from Java has a simple shape with a V-neck. This straight and simple cut gives an impression of simple elegance. Usually a Javanese kebaya is made of semi-transparent fine fabric patterned with floral stitching or embroidery, sometimes adorned with sequins. Other fabrics might be used, including cotton, brocade, silk and velvet. The semi-transparent kebaya is worn over matching underwear, either corset, bra or camisole.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\n===Kebaya Kutubaru===\nThe basic form of Kutubaru kebaya is quite similar to other types of kebaya.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> What distinguishes it is the additional fabric called ''bef'' to connect the left and right side of the kebaya in the chest and abdomen.

The Balinese kebaya usually has V neck line with folded collar sometimes decorated with laces. They are usually tight-fitting made with colorful semi-transparent or plain fabrics either cotton or brocade, patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. Unlike traditional Javanese kebaya, Balinese kebaya might add buttons in the front opening, and kerongsang brooch is seldom used. The main difference is Balinese kebaya add [[Obi (sash)|obi-like]] [[sash]] upon kebaya, wrap around the waist.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\nThe Balinese kebaya is part of ''busana adat'' or customary dress, Balinese women are required to wear kebaya during [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindu]] rituals and ceremony in [[Balinese temple|pura]]. White kebaya are favoured for Balinese religious rituals. Other than religious ceremony, contemporary Balinese women also often wear kebaya for their daily activities. Because most Balinese people are Hindus, the Balinese kebaya usually has shorter sleeves compared to Javanese kebaya.\n\n===Kebaya Sunda===\n[[File:Seren Taun 1012 Bogor B.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Girls in white Sundanese kebaya during [[Seren Taun]] harvest festival.]]\nTight-fitting brocade [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kebaya allows more freedom in design, and much applied in modern kebaya and wedding kebaya in Indonesia. The semi-transparent fabrics is patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. The main difference with other kebaya style is the U collar neckline, often applying broad curves to cover shoulders and chest. Another difference is the extra long lower parts of kebaya, with hanging edges which covers hips and thigh.

The encim kebaya fit well with vibrant-colored kain [[Batik#Pesisir Batik (Coastal Batik)|batik pesisiran]] (Javan coastal batik).<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/>\n\nIn [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], a different variety of kebaya is called \"nyonya kebaya\" and worn by those of Chinese ancestry: the [[Peranakan]] people. The ''Nyonya kebaya'' is different in its famously intricately hand-beaded shoes (''kasut manek'') and use of kain with Chinese motive batik or imported printed or hand-painted Chinese silks. Other than Malacca, the ''nyonya kebaya'' is also popular in other straits settlements of [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]].

Colonial ladies abandon their tight  [[corset]] and wear light and comfortable undergarment under their kebaya. Indos and colonials probably adopted kebaya inherited from the clothing worn by [[Njai]], [[Native Indonesian|native]] women kept as housekeepers, companions, and concubines in the colonial households. Njai ladies were the ancestors of Indo people (mixed European and Asian ancestry).\n\nThe cut and style of kebaya worn by the Dutch and Indo ladies were actually derived from Javanese kebaya. Nevertheless, there are some slight differences, European women wore shorter sleeves and total length cotton in prints, adorned with laces often imported from Europe. The kebaya worn by colonials and Indo ladies mostly are white and has light fabrics, this was meant to provide pleasant and cooler clothing in hot and humid tropical climate, since dark colored fabrics attract and retain heat. \n\nThe day kebaya of the [[Indo people]] was of white cotton trimmed with oriental motif handmade lace, either locally made in East Indies, or imported from [[Bruges]] or the [[Netherlands]]. While black silk kebaya is used for evening wear.\n\n==Political significance==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM In juni 1950 organiseerde de leiding van de KOWANI (Kongres Wanita Indonesia) in Djakarta een congres dat door alle afdelingen in Indonesi\u00eb werd bijgewoond TMnr 10000216.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sukarno]] among Indonesian women in kebaya during Indonesian Women Congress 1950]]\nIn Japanese internment camps [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|during the Second World War]], Indonesian female prisoners refused to wear the western dress allocated them and instead wore ''kebaya'' as a display of nationalist and racial solidarity to separate them from fellow Chinese, Europeans and Eurasian inmates.<ref>Cattoni ''Reading The Kebaya'' paper was presented to the 15th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia in Canberra 29 June-2 July 2004: 8</ref>\n\nThe only woman present during Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence, Dutch-educated activist [[SK Trimurti]], wore ''kebaya,'' cementing it as the female dress of Nationalism.<br />\n\nAfter Indonesian independence, Sukarno appointed kebaya as a national costume of Indonesian women.<ref name=\"GNFI-Kebaya\"/> Kebayas as the national costume of Indonesian women were often featured by Indonesian first ladies.

Lace dresses are one of the best examples of Kebaya influence.\n\nApart from traditional kebaya, fashion designers are looking into ways of modifying the design and making kebaya a more fashionable outfit. Casual designed kebaya can even be worn with jeans or skirts. For weddings or formal events, many designers are exploring other types of fine fabrics like laces to create a bridal kebaya.\n\nModern-day kebaya now incorporate modern tailoring innovations such as clasps, zippers and buttons zippers, being a much appreciated addition for ladies' that promptly need a toilet break, without requiring being literally unwrapped by a helper\u2014to the extent the true traditional kain is near unanimously rejected. Other modern innovations have included the blouse ''baju kebaya'' worn without the restrictive kemben, and even the kebaya blouse worn with slacks or made of the fabric usually for the ''kain panjang''. The female flight attendants of [[Malaysia Airlines]] and [[Singapore Airlines]] also feature batik kebaya as their uniforms.\n\nThe female uniform of [[Garuda Indonesia]] flight attendants is a more authentic modern interpretation.

The tailored blouse, often made from delicate sheer fabrics, were worn over ''kemban'' torso wrap to cover the back, shoulders and arms, in order for court ladies to appear more modest. The adoption of a more modest fashion was attributed to the Islamic influence upon the archipelago.<ref name=\"Triyanto\"/>\nAceh, Riau and Johor Kingdoms and Northern Sumatra adopted the Javanese style kebaya as a means of social expression of status with the more ''alus'' or refined Javanese overlords.<ref name=\"Chavalit\">Maenmas Chavalit, Maneepin Phromsuthirak: ''Costumes in ASEAN'': ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information: 2000: \n{{ISBN|974-7102-83-8}}, 293 pages</ref>\n\nThe name of Kebaya as a particular clothing type was noted by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] when they landed in [[Indonesia]]. Kebaya is associated with a type of [[blouse]] worn by Indonesian women in 15th or 16th century. Prior to 1600, kebaya on Java island were considered as a reserved clothing to be worn only by [[royal family]], [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (''bangsawan'') and [[priyayi|minor nobility]], in an era when peasant men and many women walked publicly bare-chested.\n[[File:Sundanese Grandma.jpg|thumb|right|140px|An elderly [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] woman wearing simple kebaya, kain batik and batik headcloth, [[West Java]].]]\nLater on, the kebaya also being adopted by commoners, the peasant women in Java.

Kebaya blouse can be tailored tight-fitting or loose-fitting, made from various materials, from cotton or velvet, to fine silk, exquisite lace and brocade, decorated with stitching or glittering sequins. \n\n;Undergarments: Because many of kebaya fabrics are made of fine, sheer and semi-transparent materials, there is a need to wear undergarments beneath to cover the breasts for modesty purpose. Traditionally, Javanese women wearing ''kemben'' torso wrap beneath their kebaya. Today however, the undergarment use under kebaya usually either [[corset]], [[bra]] or [[camisole]] with matching colour. The more simple and modest undergarment wore by common village women, usually elderly women, is called ''kutang'', which is a bra-like undergarment made from cotton. \n\n;Kerongsang brooch: Traditional kebaya had no buttons down the front. To secure the blouse openings in the front, a decorative metal [[brooch]] is applied on the chest. It can be made from brass, iron, silver or gold, decorated with semi-precious stones. A typical three-piece kerongsang is composed of a ''kerongsang ibu'' (mother piece) that is larger and heavier than the other two ''kerongsang anak'' (child piece). ''Kerongsang'' brooch often made from [[gold]] jewelry and considered as the sign of social status of aristocracy, wealth and nobility, however for commoners and peasant women, simple and plain kebaya often only fastened with modest [[safety pin]] (''peniti'').\n\n;Kain sarong or skirt: Kain is a long decorated clothes wrapped around the hips, secured with rope and wore as a kind of [[sarong]] or skirt.  The skirt or ''kain'' is an unstitched fabric wrap around three metres long. The term ''sarong'' in English is erroneous, the ''sarung'' (Malaysian accent: sarong) is actually stitched together to form a tube, ''kain'' is unstitched, requires a helper to dress (literally wrap) the wearer and is held in place with a string (''tali''), then folded this string at the waist, then held with a belt (''sabuk'' or ''ikat pinggang''), which may hold a decorative pocket. In Java, Bali and Sunda, the kain is commonly [[batik]] which may be from plain stamped cotton to elaborately hand-painted ''batik tulis'' embroidered silk with gold thread. In [[Lampung]], the kain is the traditional ''tapis'', an elaborate gold-thread embroidered ikat with small mica discs.<ref>Inger McCabe Elliott ''Batik: Fabled Cloth of Java'', Hong Kong: Periplus, 2004</ref> Sumatra, Flores, Lemata Timor, and other islands commonly use kain of ikat or songket.

The Sundanese and modern kebaya has U shaped collar edged with brocade and often decorated with sequins. Modern kebaya also might apply various shapes and curves of collars.\n\n;Fabrics: In fabrics aspect, the blouse known as ''baju kebaya'' may be of two main forms: the transparent or semi-transparent straighter cut blouse of Java, Bali, or the more plain and modest kebaya of Sumatra and Malaya.\n\n;Cut and fittings: In the cut aspect, two main varieties are; the more tightly tailored Java, Bali and Sunda kebaya, and the loose-fitting modest kebaya wore by more pious Muslim women, usually wore with hijab. The more Islamic compatible, a plainer and modest ''[[baju kurung]]'' is a loose-fitting, knee-length long-sleeved blouse worn in the more Muslim areas, including the former Kingdom of Johor-Riau (now Malaysia), Sumatra, Brunei and parts of coastal Borneo and Java.\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Kebaya Fanbo Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Indonesian woman in kebaya and kain [[batik]].

The adornment is quite minimal, only stitching or applied laces along the edges. The V-shaped collar cut of this type of kebaya is quite similar to the Peranakan Encim kebaya, however it is distinguishes by its distinctive fold on the chest. Another feature of the Kartini kebaya is the length of the kebaya that covers the hips, and the collar folds with a vertical line shape, which creates the tall and slender impression of the wearer.<ref name=\"Gosocio\">{{cite web | work = Go Socio | title = Mengenal Jenis-Jenis Kebaya di Indonesia| url = http://gosocio.co.id/mengenal-jenis-jenis-kebaya-di-indonesia.html | language = Indonesian}}</ref> The Kartini-style kebaya inspired the cut and style of [[Garuda Indonesia]]'s flight attendants' uniform.\n\n===Kebaya Jawa===\nThis type of kebaya from Java has a simple shape with a V-neck. This straight and simple cut gives an impression of simple elegance. Usually a Javanese kebaya is made of semi-transparent fine fabric patterned with floral stitching or embroidery, sometimes adorned with sequins. Other fabrics might be used, including cotton, brocade, silk and velvet. The semi-transparent kebaya is worn over matching underwear, either corset, bra or camisole.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\n===Kebaya Kutubaru===\nThe basic form of Kutubaru kebaya is quite similar to other types of kebaya.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> What distinguishes it is the additional fabric called ''bef'' to connect the left and right side of the kebaya in the chest and abdomen.

The Balinese kebaya usually has V neck line with folded collar sometimes decorated with laces. They are usually tight-fitting made with colorful semi-transparent or plain fabrics either cotton or brocade, patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. Unlike traditional Javanese kebaya, Balinese kebaya might add buttons in the front opening, and kerongsang brooch is seldom used. The main difference is Balinese kebaya add [[Obi (sash)|obi-like]] [[sash]] upon kebaya, wrap around the waist.<ref name=\"Gosocio\"/>\n\nThe Balinese kebaya is part of ''busana adat'' or customary dress, Balinese women are required to wear kebaya during [[Balinese Hinduism|Balinese Hindu]] rituals and ceremony in [[Balinese temple|pura]]. White kebaya are favoured for Balinese religious rituals. Other than religious ceremony, contemporary Balinese women also often wear kebaya for their daily activities. Because most Balinese people are Hindus, the Balinese kebaya usually has shorter sleeves compared to Javanese kebaya.\n\n===Kebaya Sunda===\n[[File:Seren Taun 1012 Bogor B.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Girls in white Sundanese kebaya during [[Seren Taun]] harvest festival.]]\nTight-fitting brocade [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kebaya allows more freedom in design, and much applied in modern kebaya and wedding kebaya in Indonesia. The semi-transparent fabrics is patterned with floral stitching or embroidery. The main difference with other kebaya style is the U collar neckline, often applying broad curves to cover shoulders and chest. Another difference is the extra long lower parts of kebaya, with hanging edges which covers hips and thigh. The contemporary wedding kebaya dress even has sweeping long [[Train (clothing)|train]].\n\n===Kebaya Encim or Peranakan===\n[[File:Kebaya 1.jpg|thumb|left|A group of women posing in traditional [[Peranakan]] ''nonya'' kebaya]]\nIn Java, the kebaya worn by ladies of [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese ancestry]] is called ''kebaya encim'', derived from the name ''encim'' or ''enci'' to refer to a married Chinese woman.<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://female.kompas.com/read/2013/01/13/10574438/Tantangan.Bisnis.Kebaya.Encim\n |title      = Tantangan Bisnis Kebaya Encim\n |last       = Agnes Swetta Pandia & Nina Susilo\n |first      =\n |date       = 13 January 2013\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Female Kompas.com\n |accessdate = 19 January 2013\n}}\n</ref> It was commonly worn by Chinese ladies in Javan coastal cities with significant Chinese settlements, such as [[Semarang]], Lasem, Tuban, [[Surabaya]], [[Pekalongan]] and [[Cirebon]]. It marked differently from Javanese kebaya with its smaller and finer embroidery, lighter fabrics and more vibrant colors, made from imported materials such as silk and other fine fabrics. The encim kebaya fit well with vibrant-colored kain [[Batik#Pesisir Batik (Coastal Batik)|batik pesisiran]] (Javan coastal batik).<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/>\n\nIn [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], a different variety of kebaya is called \"nyonya kebaya\" and worn by those of Chinese ancestry: the [[Peranakan]] people. The ''Nyonya kebaya'' is different in its famously intricately hand-beaded shoes (''kasut manek'') and use of kain with Chinese motive batik or imported printed or hand-painted Chinese silks. Other than Malacca, the ''nyonya kebaya'' is also popular in other straits settlements of [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]]. The similar Nyonya Kebaya can also be found [[Phuket]], where they shared the similar Peranakan culture with the historical [[Strait Settlements]].\n\n===Kebaya Noni or Indo===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Portret van mevrouw Van der Willegen met haar zestien dagen oude baby Johan Harmen Rudolf TMnr 60054017.jpg|thumb|right|140px|Dutch colonial lady in kebaya and kain batik, Dutch East Indies 1920]]\nKebaya Indo is also known as kebaya Noni, derived from the term ''noni'' or ''nona'' which literally means \"miss\" to refer a young girl or unmarried woman of European descent.<ref name=\"Tempo-Aneka-Kebaya\"/> During the [[Dutch East Indies]] era of Indonesia, [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian) women also colonial European women of high status adopted the kebaya, which provided less restrictive and cooler clothing, as a formal or social dress. Colonial ladies abandon their tight  [[corset]] and wear light and comfortable undergarment under their kebaya. Indos and colonials probably adopted kebaya inherited from the clothing worn by [[Njai]], [[Native Indonesian|native]] women kept as housekeepers, companions, and concubines in the colonial households. Njai ladies were the ancestors of Indo people (mixed European and Asian ancestry).\n\nThe cut and style of kebaya worn by the Dutch and Indo ladies were actually derived from Javanese kebaya. Nevertheless, there are some slight differences, European women wore shorter sleeves and total length cotton in prints, adorned with laces often imported from Europe. The kebaya worn by colonials and Indo ladies mostly are white and has light fabrics, this was meant to provide pleasant and cooler clothing in hot and humid tropical climate, since dark colored fabrics attract and retain heat. \n\nThe day kebaya of the [[Indo people]] was of white cotton trimmed with oriental motif handmade lace, either locally made in East Indies, or imported from [[Bruges]] or the [[Netherlands]]. While black silk kebaya is used for evening wear.\n\n==Political significance==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM In juni 1950 organiseerde de leiding van de KOWANI (Kongres Wanita Indonesia) in Djakarta een congres dat door alle afdelingen in Indonesi\u00eb werd bijgewoond TMnr 10000216.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sukarno]] among Indonesian women in kebaya during Indonesian Women Congress 1950]]\nIn Japanese internment camps [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|during the Second World War]], Indonesian female prisoners refused to wear the western dress allocated them and instead wore ''kebaya'' as a display of nationalist and racial solidarity to separate them from fellow Chinese, Europeans and Eurasian inmates.<ref>Cattoni ''Reading The Kebaya'' paper was presented to the 15th Biennial Conference of the Asian Studies Association of Australia in Canberra 29 June-2 July 2004: 8</ref>\n\nThe only woman present during Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence, Dutch-educated activist [[SK Trimurti]], wore ''kebaya,'' cementing it as the female dress of Nationalism.<br />\n\nAfter Indonesian independence, Sukarno appointed kebaya as a national costume of Indonesian women.<ref name=\"GNFI-Kebaya\"/> Kebayas as the national costume of Indonesian women were often featured by Indonesian first ladies. The wives of [[Sukarno]], Indonesian first president; [[Fatmawati|Fatmawati Sukarno]] and [[Dewi Sukarno]] were known to wear kebaya everyday.\n\nThe 21st of April is celebrated in Indonesia as National Kartini Day where [[Kartini|Raden Ajeng Kartini]], the female suffragist and education advocate, is remembered by schoolgirls wearing traditional dress according to their region. In Java, Bali and Sunda it is the ''kebaya''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe [[Suharto]]-era bureaucrat wives' social organisation ''Dharma Wanita'' wears a uniform of gold kebaya, with a red sash (''selendang'') and stamped batik pattern on the ''kain'' unique to ''Dharma Wanita''. The late Indonesian first lady and also a minor aristocrat [[Tien Suharto]] was a prominent advocate of the ''kebaya''.\n\nFormer President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] is a public champion of ''kebaya'' and wears fine red ''kebaya'' whenever possible in public forums and 2009 Presidential election debates.\n\n==Modern usage and innovations==\n[[File:Garuda Indonesia Flight Attendants New Costumes 2010 Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Garuda Indonesia]] flight attendant uniform in kebaya and kain [[batik]].]]\n\nKebaya has been one of the important parts of oriental style of clothing that heavily influenced the world of modern fashion. Lace dresses are one of the best examples of Kebaya influence.\n\nApart from traditional kebaya, fashion designers are looking into ways of modifying the design and making kebaya a more fashionable outfit. Casual designed kebaya can even be worn with jeans or skirts. For weddings or formal events, many designers are exploring other types of fine fabrics like laces to create a bridal kebaya.\n\nModern-day kebaya now incorporate modern tailoring innovations such as clasps, zippers and buttons zippers, being a much appreciated addition for ladies' that promptly need a toilet break, without requiring being literally unwrapped by a helper\u2014to the extent the true traditional kain is near unanimously rejected. Other modern innovations have included the blouse ''baju kebaya'' worn without the restrictive kemben, and even the kebaya blouse worn with slacks or made of the fabric usually for the ''kain panjang''.

Milkmaids began working solely in the stables before large houses hired them to do housework as well rather than hiring out for more staff. Also on the table in front of the milkmaid are various types of bread. She is a young, sturdily built woman wearing a crisp linen cap, a blue apron and work sleeves pushed up from thick forearms. A foot warmer is on the floor behind her, near [[Delftware|Delft wall tiles]] depicting [[Cupid]] (to the viewer's left) and a figure with a pole (to the right). Intense light streams from the [[window]] on the left side of the canvas.<ref name=krhdcs>{{cite news  \n| last = Rosenberg | first = Karen \n| date = 11 September 2009 \n| title = A Humble Domestic Crosses the Sea \n| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] \n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/arts/design/11vermeer.html?em=&pagewanted=print \n| accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe painting is strikingly [[illusionistic]], conveying not just details but a sense of the weight of the woman and the table. \"The light, though bright, doesn't wash out the rough texture of the bread crusts or flatten the volumes of the maid's thick waist and rounded shoulders\", wrote Karen Rosenberg, an [[art critic]] for ''[[The New York Times]]''. Yet with half of the woman's face in shadow, it is \"impossible to tell whether her downcast eyes and pursed lips express wistfulness or concentration,\" she wrote.<ref name=krhdcs/>\n\n\"It's a little bit of a ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' effect\" in modern viewers' reactions to the painting, according to [[Walter Liedtke]], [[curator]] of the department of [[European painting]]s at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and organizer of two Vermeer exhibits. \"There's a bit of mystery about her for modern audiences.

Also shown is a detail from the maid's brilliant blue apron.]]\n\nThe woman would have been known as a \"kitchen maid\" or [[maid|maid-of-all-work]] rather than a specialised \"[[milkmaid]]\" at the time the painting was created: \"milk maids\" were women who milked cows; kitchen maids worked in kitchens.<ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/> For at least two centuries before the painting was created, milkmaids and kitchen maids had a reputation as being predisposed to love or sex, and this was [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|frequently reflected in Dutch paintings]] of kitchen and market scenes from [[Antwerp]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and Delft.<ref>See Schama, Chapter 6 on the housemaid, \"the most dangerous women of all\" (p. 455). See also Franits, 118-119 and 166, and the other passages under \"maids, sterotypes\" in his index.</ref>  Some of the paintings were slyly suggestive, like ''The Milkmaid'', others more coarsely so.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/>\n\nThe leading artists in this tradition were the Antwerp painters [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] (c. 1535\u20131575) and [[Frans Snyders]] (1579\u20131657), who had many followers and imitators, as well as [[Pieter Aertsen]] (who, like Beukelaer, had clients in Delft), the Utrecht [[Mannerist]] painter [[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566\u20131638), and his son, [[Peter Wtewael]] (1596\u20131660).<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/><ref name=delftschool/>  Closer to Vermeer's day, [[Nicolaes Maes]] painted several comic pictures now given titles such as ''The Lazy Servant''.  However by this time there was an alternative convention of painting women at work in the home as exemplars of Dutch domestic virtue, dealt with at length by [[Simon Schama]].<ref>Schama, Chapter 6.</ref>\n\nIn Dutch literature and paintings of Vermeer's time, maids were often depicted as subjects of male desire\u2014dangerous women threatening the honor and security of the home, the center of Dutch life\u2014although some Vermeer contemporaries, such as [[Pieter de Hooch]], had started to represent them in a more neutral way, as did [[Michael Sweerts]]. Vermeer's painting is one of the rare examples of a maid treated in an empathetic and dignified way,<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> although amorous symbols in this work still exemplify the tradition.<ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/>\n\nOther painters in this tradition, such as [[Gerard Dou|Gerrit Dou]] (1613\u20131675), depicted attractive maids with symbolic objects such as jugs and various forms of game and produce.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> \"In almost all the works of this tradition there is an erotic element, which is conveyed through gestures ranging from jamming chickens onto spits to gently offering &mdash; or so the direction of view suggests &mdash; an intimate glimpse of some vaguely uterine object,\" according to Liedtke. In Dou's 1646 painting, ''Girl Chopping Onions'' (now in the British [[Royal Collection]]), a pewter tankard may refer to both male and female anatomy, and the picture contains other contemporary symbols of lust, such as onions (said to have aphrodisical properties), and a dangling bird. Milk also had lewd connotations, from the slang term ''melken'', defined as \"to sexually attract or lure\" (a meaning that may have originated from watching farm girls working under cows, according to Liedtke). Examples of works using milk this way include [[Lucas van Leyden]]'s [[engraving]] ''The Milkmaid'' (1510) and [[Jacques de Gheyn II]]'s engraving ''The Archer and the Milkmaid'' (about 1610).<ref name=delftschool/> \n[[File:Gerrit Dou 1646 painting Girl Chopping Onions.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Gerrit Dou]], ''Girl Chopping Onions'']]\n\nVermeer's painting is even more understated, although the use of symbols remains: one of the Delft tiles at the foot of the wall behind the maid, near the foot warmer, depicts Cupid &ndash; which can imply arousal of a woman<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> or simply that while she is working she is daydreaming about a man.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009 /> Other amorous symbols in the painting include a wide-mouthed jug, often used as a symbol of the female anatomy. The foot warmer was often used by artists as a symbol for female sexual arousal because, when placed under a skirt, it heats the whole body below the waist, according to Liedtke.<ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/> The coals enclosed inside the foot warmer could symbolize \"either the heat of lust in tavern or brothel scenes, or the hidden but true burning passion of a woman for her husband\", according to Serena Cant, a British art historian and lecturer. Yet the whitewashed wall and presence of milk seem to indicate that the room was a \"cool kitchen\" used for cooking with dairy products, such as milk and butter, so the foot warmer would have a pragmatic purpose there. Since other Dutch paintings of the period indicate that foot warmers were used when seated, its presence in the picture may symbolize the standing woman's \"hardworking nature\", according to Cant.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009>{{Cite book | last1 = Cant | first1 = Serena| last2=Vermeer van Delft| first2=Jan | year = 2009 | title = Vermeer and His World 1632&ndash;1675 | publisher = Quercus Publishing Plc | location=London|ISBN = 978-1-849-16005-6|OCLC=699202293}}</ref>\n\nThe painting is part of a social context of the sexual or romantic interactions of maids and men of higher social ranks that has now disappeared in Europe and never commonly recognized in America, according to Liedtke, who offers as an example Vermeer's contemporary, [[Samuel Pepys]], whose diary records encounters with kitchen maids, oyster girls and, at an inn during a 1660 visit to Delft, with \"an exceedingly pretty lass and right for the sport\". The painting was first owned by (and may have been painted for) Pieter van Ruijven, owner of several other paintings by Vermeer which also depicted attractive young women and with themes of desire and self-denial quite different from the attitude of Pepys and many of the paintings in the Dutch \"kitchenmaid\" tradition.<ref>Liedtke, Walter, et al., ''Vermeer and the Delft School'', New Haven and London:[[Yale University Press]], 2001, p. 372; citing Samuel Pepys' ''Diary'', entry for May 19, 1660</ref>\n\nIn Dutch, ''Het Melkmeisje'' is the painting's most-used name. Although this title is less accurate in modern Dutch, the word \"meid\" (maid) has gained a negative tone that is not present in its [[diminutive]] form (\"meisje\")\u2014hence the use of the more friendly title for the work, used by the Rijksmuseum and others.\n\n===Narrative and thematic elements===\nAccording to art historian Harry Rand, the painting suggests the woman is making [[bread pudding]], which would account for the milk and the broken pieces of bread on the table. Rand assumed she would have already made [[custard]] in which the bread mixed with egg would be soaking at the moment depicted in the painting. She pours milk into the Dutch oven to cover the mixture because otherwise the bread, if not simmering in liquid while it is baking, will become an unappetizing, dry crust instead of forming the typical upper surface of the pudding. She is careful in pouring the trickle of milk because bread pudding can be ruined when the ingredients are not accurately measured or properly combined.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\nBy depicting the working maid in the act of careful cooking, the artist presents not just a picture of an everyday scene, but one with ethical and social value. The humble woman is using common ingredients and otherwise useless stale bread to create a pleasurable product for the household. \"Her measured demeanor, modest dress and judiciousness in preparing her food conveys eloquently yet unobtrusively one of the strongest values of 17th-century Netherlands, domestic virtue\", according to the Essential Vermeer website.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\n\"In the end, it is not the allusions to female sexuality that give this painting its romance or emotional resonance &mdash; it is the depiction of honest, hard work as something romantic in and of itself,\" Raquel Laneri wrote in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine. \"''The Milkmaid'' elevates the drudgery of housework and servitude to virtuous, even heroic, levels.\"<ref name=Forbes-MetMuseum-2009>{{Cite web | last = Laneri | first = Raquel | date = 12 September 2009| title = Vermeer's Timeless Heroine \u2013 A New Exhibit Recasts the Enduring Appeal of the Dutch Master's 'Milkmaid' | work = [[Forbes]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/11/vermeer-milkmaid-amsterdam-new-york-opinions-contributors-art.html | accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Compositional strategy ===\nAn impression of monumentality and \"perhaps a sense of dignity\" is lent to the image by the artist's choice of a relatively low vantage point and a pyramidal building up of forms from the left foreground to the woman's head, according to a web page of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> According to the Rijksmuseum, the painting \"is built up along two diagonal lines. They meet by the woman's right wrist.\" This focuses the attention of the viewer on the pouring of the milk.<ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid />\n\nThe photograph-like realism of the painting resembles that of Leiden artists such as Dou, [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Frans van Mieris]], and [[Gabri\u00ebl Metsu]].<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> Vermeer, who was age twenty-five when he painted this work, was \"shopping around in Dutch art for different styles and subjects\", according to Liedtke. \"He's looking, in this case, mainly at artists like Gerrit Dou and others who work in a meticulous, illusionistic way.\" Liedtke sees the work as either Vermeer's \"last early work or first mature work\". The curator added, \"I almost think he had to explore what you might call 'tactile illusionism' to understand where he really wanted to go, which was in the more optical, light-filled direction.\"<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009>{{cite web |title=Vermeer's The Milkmaid |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/59185-vermeers-the-milkmaid/ \n|date= 19 September 2009|last=Lopate|first=Leonard |work=[[The Leonard Lopate Show]] |publisher=[[WNYC]] radio station |format=Audio interview with [[Walter Liedtke]]|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of Delft artistry and of Vermeer's work, the painting also has a \"classic balance\" of figurative elements and an \"extraordinary treatment of light\", according to The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> The wall on the left, according to Liedtke, \"gets you very quickly in the picture&mdash;that recession from the left and then the openness to the right&mdash;and this sort of left-corner scheme was used for about 10 years before Vermeer, and he was very quick to pick up the latest thing.\"<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/>\n\n\"Nowhere else in his oeuvre does one find such a sculptural figure and such seemingly tangible objects, and yet the future painter of luminous interiors has already arrived,\" according to the museum. The \"''[[pointill\u00e9]]'' pattern of bright dots on the bread and basket\" are the \"most effusive\" use of that scheme in any Vermeer painting, and it appears to be used to suggest \"scintillating daylight and rough textures at the same time.\"<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/>\n\nVermeer painted over two items originally in the painting. One was a large wall map (a Rijksmuseum web page calls it a painting)<ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid/> behind the upper part of the woman's body. (A wall map may not have been very out of place in a humble workroom such as the cold kitchen where the maid toiled: large maps in 17th-century Holland were inexpensive ways of decorating bare walls.)<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> He originally placed a large, conspicuous clothes basket (the Rijksmuseum web page calls it a \"sewing basket\")<ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid/> near the bottom of the painting, behind the maid's red skirt, but then the artist painted it over, producing the slight shift in tone ([[pentimento]]) on the wall behind the foot warmer. The basket was later discovered with an [[X-ray]]. Other Vermeer paintings also have images removed. Some art critics have thought the removals may have been intended to provide the works with better thematic focus.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\n\"[I]ts rustic immediacy differs from Vermeer's later paintings,\" according to Laneri. \"There is a tactile, visceral quality to ''The Milkmaid'' &mdash; you can almost taste the thick, creamy milk escaping the jug, feel the cool dampness of the room and the starchy linen of the maid's white cap, touch her sculptural shoulders and corseted waist. She is not an apparition or abstraction. She is not the ideal, worldly housewife of Vermeer's later ''[[Woman with a Water Jug|Young Woman with a Water Pitcher]]'' or the ethereal beauty in ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. She is not the cartoonish buxom vixen in Leyden's drawing. She is real &mdash; as real as a painting can get anyway.\"<ref name=Forbes-MetMuseum-2009/>\n\n=== Technique and materials ===\nThis painting has \"perhaps, the most brilliant color scheme of his oeuvre\", according to the Essential Vermeer website. Already in the 18th century, English painter and critic [[Joshua Reynolds]] praised the work for its striking quality.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> One of the distinctions of Vermeer's [[Palette (painting)|palette]], compared with his contemporaries, was his preference for the expensive natural [[ultramarine]] (made from crushed [[lapis lazuli]]) where other painters typically used the much cheaper [[azurite]]. Along with the ultramarine, [[lead-tin-yellow]] is also a dominant color in an exceptionally luminous work (with a much less somber and conventional rendering of light than any of Vermeer's previous extant works).<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> Depicting white walls was a challenge for artists in Vermeer's time, with his contemporaries using various forms of gray pigment. Here the white walls reflect the daylight with different intensities, displaying the effects of uneven textures on the plastered surfaces. The artist here used [[white lead]], [[umber]] and [[charcoal black]]. Although the formula was widely known among Vermeer's contemporary genre painters, \"perhaps no artist more than Vermeer was able to use it so effectively\", according to the Essential Vermeer website.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\nThe woman's coarse features are painted with thick dabs of ''[[impasto]]''. The seeds on the crust of the bread, as well as the crust itself, along with the plaited handles of the bread basket, are rendered with ''pointill\u00e9'' dots. Soft parts of the bread are rendered with thin swirls of paint, with dabs of [[ochre]] used to show the rough edges of broken crust. One piece of bread to the viewer's right and close to the Dutch oven, has a broad band of yellow, different from the crust, which Cant believes is a suggestion that the piece is going stale. The small roll at the far right has thick impastoed dots that resemble a knobbly crust or a crust with seeds on it. The bread and basket, despite being closer to the viewer, are painted in a more diffuse way than the illusionistic realism of the wall, with its stains, shadowing, nail and nail hole, or the seams and fastenings of the woman's dress, the gleaming, polished brass container hanging from the wall. The panes of glass in the window are varied in a very realistic way, with a crack in one (fourth row from the bottom, far right) reflected on the wood of the window frame. Just below that pane, another has a scratch, indicated with a thin white line. Another pane (second row from the bottom, second from right) is pushed inward within its frame.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/>\n\nThe discrepancy between objects at various distances from the viewer may indicate Vermeer used a ''[[camera obscura]]'', according to Cant.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/> Liedtke points out that a pinhole discovered in the canvas \"has really punctured the theory of the ''camera obscura'' [...] The idea that Vermeer traced compositions in an optical device [...] is rather naive when you consider that the light lasts maybe 10 seconds, but the painting took at least months to paint.\" Instead, The pin in the canvas would have been tied to a string with chalk on it, which the painter would have snapped to get perspective lines, Liedtke said in a 2009 interview.<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009 />\n\nThe woman's bulky green oversleeves were painted with the same yellow and blue paint used in the rest of the woman's clothing, worked at the same time in a [[wet-on-wet]] method. Broad strokes in the painting of the clothing suggests coarse, thick texture of the work clothing. The blue cuff uses a lighter mixture of ultramarine and lead-white, together with a layer of ochre painted beneath it. The brilliant blue of the skirt or apron has been intensified with a glaze (a thin, transparent top layer) of the same color. The glazing helps suggest that the blue material is a less coarse fabric than the yellow bodice, according to Cant.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/>\n\n== Provenance ==\n[[File:CartoonsDeMinisterPRinkEnDeMilkmaid1907.jpg|thumb|350px|A 1907 Dutch cartoon by Jan Rinke, reflecting a controversy over whether the state should purchase the painting rather than let it possibly fall into the hands of some rich American art collector. The government bought the work for the [[Rijksmuseum]].]]\n[[Pieter van Ruijven]] (1624\u20131674), Vermeer's patron in Delft (and, at his death, the owner of twenty-one of the painter's works), probably bought the painting directly from the artist. Liedtke doubts that the patron ordered the subject matter.<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/> Ownership later passed on, perhaps to his widow, Maria de Knuijt, probably their daughter, Magdelene van Ruijven (1655&ndash;1681), and certainly to Van Ruijven's son-in-law, [[Jacob Dissius]] (1653\u20131695),<ref name=delftschool>{{cite book |last1=Liedtke |first1=Walter |first2= Michiel C. |last2=Plomp |first3=Axel |last3=Ruger |title=Vermeer and the Delft School |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2001 |location=New Haven and London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n386 372], 374 |isbn=0-87099-973-7}}</ref><ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/clients_patrons/the_dissius_collection.html Dissius collection sale] retrieved June 4, 2010</ref> whose estate sold it with other paintings by the artist in 1696.

In 1822 she married into the [[Six family]] of collectors, and in 1908 her two sons sold the painting (as part of the famous Six collection of thirty-nine works) to the Rijksmuseum, which acquired the works with support from the Dutch government and the [[Rembrandt Society]]<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> &mdash; but not before a good deal of public squabbling and the intervention of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]] or Dutch parliament.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe painting has been exhibited in western Europe and in the United States. In 1872 it was part of an Amsterdam exhibition of \"[[old masters]]\" (\"Tentoonstelling van zeldzame en belangrijke schilderijen van oude meesters\"), for Arti et Amicitiae, a society of visual artists and art lovers, and in 1900 it was part of an exhibition at [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]].

During this time it was displayed at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] in [[Michigan]] (the museum where the curator of the World's Fair exhibit was working), and was included in that museum's exhibition catalogues in 1939 and 1941. During the war, the work was also displayed at The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, where it was hanging as late as 1944, according to Leidtke.<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/> In 1953, the [[Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich]] displayed the painting in an exhibition, and the next year it traveled to Italy for an exhibition at the [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] in Rome and the [[Palazzo Reale]] in Milan. In 1966, it was part of an exhibition at the [[Mauritshuis]] in the Hague and the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie]] in Paris. In 1999 and 2000 the painting was at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington for its exhibition \"Johannes Vermeer: The Art of Painting\", and it was part of the \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" exhibition at the [[National Gallery]], London from June 20 to September 16, 2001 (it did not appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art venue of that exhibition, earlier that year).<ref name=delftschool/>\n\nThe painting returned to New York in 2009, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s historic voyage (Amsterdam to Manhattan), where it was the central feature of a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition, alongside several of the museum's five Vermeer works and other [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s.\n\nThe painting was exhibited online in a high-quality digital version after museum curators found that many people thought that a low-quality yellowed version of the image which was circulating on the Internet was a good reproduction of the image.<ref name=Europeana-Yellow-2011>{{cite web |url= https://pro.europeana.eu/files/Europeana_Professional/Publications/Whitepaper_2-The_Yellow_Milkmaid.pdf |title=The Problem of the Yellow Milkmaid |first1=Harry |last1=Verwayen |first2=Martijn |last2=Arnoldus |first3=Peter B. |last3=Kaufman |work=[[Europeana Foundation]] |format=PDF|date=November 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n* [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]\n* ''[[The Basket of Bread]]''\n* [[List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Monographs ===\n* [[Bonafoux, Pascal]], and Johannes Vermeer van Delft.

Milkmaids began working solely in the stables before large houses hired them to do housework as well rather than hiring out for more staff. Also on the table in front of the milkmaid are various types of bread. She is a young, sturdily built woman wearing a crisp linen cap, a blue apron and work sleeves pushed up from thick forearms. A foot warmer is on the floor behind her, near [[Delftware|Delft wall tiles]] depicting [[Cupid]] (to the viewer's left) and a figure with a pole (to the right). Intense light streams from the [[window]] on the left side of the canvas.<ref name=krhdcs>{{cite news  \n| last = Rosenberg | first = Karen \n| date = 11 September 2009 \n| title = A Humble Domestic Crosses the Sea \n| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] \n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/arts/design/11vermeer.html?em=&pagewanted=print \n| accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe painting is strikingly [[illusionistic]], conveying not just details but a sense of the weight of the woman and the table. \"The light, though bright, doesn't wash out the rough texture of the bread crusts or flatten the volumes of the maid's thick waist and rounded shoulders\", wrote Karen Rosenberg, an [[art critic]] for ''[[The New York Times]]''. Yet with half of the woman's face in shadow, it is \"impossible to tell whether her downcast eyes and pursed lips express wistfulness or concentration,\" she wrote.<ref name=krhdcs/>\n\n\"It's a little bit of a ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' effect\" in modern viewers' reactions to the painting, according to [[Walter Liedtke]], [[curator]] of the department of [[European painting]]s at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and organizer of two Vermeer exhibits. \"There's a bit of mystery about her for modern audiences.

Also shown is a detail from the maid's brilliant blue apron.]]\n\nThe woman would have been known as a \"kitchen maid\" or [[maid|maid-of-all-work]] rather than a specialised \"[[milkmaid]]\" at the time the painting was created: \"milk maids\" were women who milked cows; kitchen maids worked in kitchens.<ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/> For at least two centuries before the painting was created, milkmaids and kitchen maids had a reputation as being predisposed to love or sex, and this was [[Dutch Golden Age painting#Scenes of everyday life|frequently reflected in Dutch paintings]] of kitchen and market scenes from [[Antwerp]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and Delft.<ref>See Schama, Chapter 6 on the housemaid, \"the most dangerous women of all\" (p. 455). See also Franits, 118-119 and 166, and the other passages under \"maids, sterotypes\" in his index.</ref>  Some of the paintings were slyly suggestive, like ''The Milkmaid'', others more coarsely so.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/>\n\nThe leading artists in this tradition were the Antwerp painters [[Joachim Beuckelaer]] (c. 1535\u20131575) and [[Frans Snyders]] (1579\u20131657), who had many followers and imitators, as well as [[Pieter Aertsen]] (who, like Beukelaer, had clients in Delft), the Utrecht [[Mannerist]] painter [[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566\u20131638), and his son, [[Peter Wtewael]] (1596\u20131660).<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/><ref name=delftschool/>  Closer to Vermeer's day, [[Nicolaes Maes]] painted several comic pictures now given titles such as ''The Lazy Servant''.  However by this time there was an alternative convention of painting women at work in the home as exemplars of Dutch domestic virtue, dealt with at length by [[Simon Schama]].<ref>Schama, Chapter 6.</ref>\n\nIn Dutch literature and paintings of Vermeer's time, maids were often depicted as subjects of male desire\u2014dangerous women threatening the honor and security of the home, the center of Dutch life\u2014although some Vermeer contemporaries, such as [[Pieter de Hooch]], had started to represent them in a more neutral way, as did [[Michael Sweerts]]. Vermeer's painting is one of the rare examples of a maid treated in an empathetic and dignified way,<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> although amorous symbols in this work still exemplify the tradition.<ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/>\n\nOther painters in this tradition, such as [[Gerard Dou|Gerrit Dou]] (1613\u20131675), depicted attractive maids with symbolic objects such as jugs and various forms of game and produce.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> \"In almost all the works of this tradition there is an erotic element, which is conveyed through gestures ranging from jamming chickens onto spits to gently offering &mdash; or so the direction of view suggests &mdash; an intimate glimpse of some vaguely uterine object,\" according to Liedtke. In Dou's 1646 painting, ''Girl Chopping Onions'' (now in the British [[Royal Collection]]), a pewter tankard may refer to both male and female anatomy, and the picture contains other contemporary symbols of lust, such as onions (said to have aphrodisical properties), and a dangling bird. Milk also had lewd connotations, from the slang term ''melken'', defined as \"to sexually attract or lure\" (a meaning that may have originated from watching farm girls working under cows, according to Liedtke). Examples of works using milk this way include [[Lucas van Leyden]]'s [[engraving]] ''The Milkmaid'' (1510) and [[Jacques de Gheyn II]]'s engraving ''The Archer and the Milkmaid'' (about 1610).<ref name=delftschool/> \n[[File:Gerrit Dou 1646 painting Girl Chopping Onions.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Gerrit Dou]], ''Girl Chopping Onions'']]\n\nVermeer's painting is even more understated, although the use of symbols remains: one of the Delft tiles at the foot of the wall behind the maid, near the foot warmer, depicts Cupid &ndash; which can imply arousal of a woman<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> or simply that while she is working she is daydreaming about a man.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009 /> Other amorous symbols in the painting include a wide-mouthed jug, often used as a symbol of the female anatomy. The foot warmer was often used by artists as a symbol for female sexual arousal because, when placed under a skirt, it heats the whole body below the waist, according to Liedtke.<ref name=CTPost-Met-2009/> The coals enclosed inside the foot warmer could symbolize \"either the heat of lust in tavern or brothel scenes, or the hidden but true burning passion of a woman for her husband\", according to Serena Cant, a British art historian and lecturer. Yet the whitewashed wall and presence of milk seem to indicate that the room was a \"cool kitchen\" used for cooking with dairy products, such as milk and butter, so the foot warmer would have a pragmatic purpose there. Since other Dutch paintings of the period indicate that foot warmers were used when seated, its presence in the picture may symbolize the standing woman's \"hardworking nature\", according to Cant.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009>{{Cite book | last1 = Cant | first1 = Serena| last2=Vermeer van Delft| first2=Jan | year = 2009 | title = Vermeer and His World 1632&ndash;1675 | publisher = Quercus Publishing Plc | location=London|ISBN = 978-1-849-16005-6|OCLC=699202293}}</ref>\n\nThe painting is part of a social context of the sexual or romantic interactions of maids and men of higher social ranks that has now disappeared in Europe and never commonly recognized in America, according to Liedtke, who offers as an example Vermeer's contemporary, [[Samuel Pepys]], whose diary records encounters with kitchen maids, oyster girls and, at an inn during a 1660 visit to Delft, with \"an exceedingly pretty lass and right for the sport\". The painting was first owned by (and may have been painted for) Pieter van Ruijven, owner of several other paintings by Vermeer which also depicted attractive young women and with themes of desire and self-denial quite different from the attitude of Pepys and many of the paintings in the Dutch \"kitchenmaid\" tradition.<ref>Liedtke, Walter, et al., ''Vermeer and the Delft School'', New Haven and London:[[Yale University Press]], 2001, p. 372; citing Samuel Pepys' ''Diary'', entry for May 19, 1660</ref>\n\nIn Dutch, ''Het Melkmeisje'' is the painting's most-used name. Although this title is less accurate in modern Dutch, the word \"meid\" (maid) has gained a negative tone that is not present in its [[diminutive]] form (\"meisje\")\u2014hence the use of the more friendly title for the work, used by the Rijksmuseum and others.\n\n===Narrative and thematic elements===\nAccording to art historian Harry Rand, the painting suggests the woman is making [[bread pudding]], which would account for the milk and the broken pieces of bread on the table. Rand assumed she would have already made [[custard]] in which the bread mixed with egg would be soaking at the moment depicted in the painting. She pours milk into the Dutch oven to cover the mixture because otherwise the bread, if not simmering in liquid while it is baking, will become an unappetizing, dry crust instead of forming the typical upper surface of the pudding. She is careful in pouring the trickle of milk because bread pudding can be ruined when the ingredients are not accurately measured or properly combined.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\nBy depicting the working maid in the act of careful cooking, the artist presents not just a picture of an everyday scene, but one with ethical and social value. The humble woman is using common ingredients and otherwise useless stale bread to create a pleasurable product for the household. \"Her measured demeanor, modest dress and judiciousness in preparing her food conveys eloquently yet unobtrusively one of the strongest values of 17th-century Netherlands, domestic virtue\", according to the Essential Vermeer website.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\n\"In the end, it is not the allusions to female sexuality that give this painting its romance or emotional resonance &mdash; it is the depiction of honest, hard work as something romantic in and of itself,\" Raquel Laneri wrote in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine. \"''The Milkmaid'' elevates the drudgery of housework and servitude to virtuous, even heroic, levels.\"<ref name=Forbes-MetMuseum-2009>{{Cite web | last = Laneri | first = Raquel | date = 12 September 2009| title = Vermeer's Timeless Heroine \u2013 A New Exhibit Recasts the Enduring Appeal of the Dutch Master's 'Milkmaid' | work = [[Forbes]] | url = https://www.forbes.com/2009/09/11/vermeer-milkmaid-amsterdam-new-york-opinions-contributors-art.html | accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Compositional strategy ===\nAn impression of monumentality and \"perhaps a sense of dignity\" is lent to the image by the artist's choice of a relatively low vantage point and a pyramidal building up of forms from the left foreground to the woman's head, according to a web page of The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> According to the Rijksmuseum, the painting \"is built up along two diagonal lines. They meet by the woman's right wrist.\" This focuses the attention of the viewer on the pouring of the milk.<ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid />\n\nThe photograph-like realism of the painting resembles that of Leiden artists such as Dou, [[Frans van Mieris the Elder|Frans van Mieris]], and [[Gabri\u00ebl Metsu]].<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> Vermeer, who was age twenty-five when he painted this work, was \"shopping around in Dutch art for different styles and subjects\", according to Liedtke. \"He's looking, in this case, mainly at artists like Gerrit Dou and others who work in a meticulous, illusionistic way.\" Liedtke sees the work as either Vermeer's \"last early work or first mature work\". The curator added, \"I almost think he had to explore what you might call 'tactile illusionism' to understand where he really wanted to go, which was in the more optical, light-filled direction.\"<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009>{{cite web |title=Vermeer's The Milkmaid |url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/59185-vermeers-the-milkmaid/ \n|date= 19 September 2009|last=Lopate|first=Leonard |work=[[The Leonard Lopate Show]] |publisher=[[WNYC]] radio station |format=Audio interview with [[Walter Liedtke]]|accessdate=19 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nCharacteristic of Delft artistry and of Vermeer's work, the painting also has a \"classic balance\" of figurative elements and an \"extraordinary treatment of light\", according to The Metropolitan Museum of Art.<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> The wall on the left, according to Liedtke, \"gets you very quickly in the picture&mdash;that recession from the left and then the openness to the right&mdash;and this sort of left-corner scheme was used for about 10 years before Vermeer, and he was very quick to pick up the latest thing.\"<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/>\n\n\"Nowhere else in his oeuvre does one find such a sculptural figure and such seemingly tangible objects, and yet the future painter of luminous interiors has already arrived,\" according to the museum. The \"''[[pointill\u00e9]]'' pattern of bright dots on the bread and basket\" are the \"most effusive\" use of that scheme in any Vermeer painting, and it appears to be used to suggest \"scintillating daylight and rough textures at the same time.\"<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/>\n\nVermeer painted over two items originally in the painting. One was a large wall map (a Rijksmuseum web page calls it a painting)<ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid/> behind the upper part of the woman's body. (A wall map may not have been very out of place in a humble workroom such as the cold kitchen where the maid toiled: large maps in 17th-century Holland were inexpensive ways of decorating bare walls.)<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> He originally placed a large, conspicuous clothes basket (the Rijksmuseum web page calls it a \"sewing basket\")<ref name=Rijksmuseum-Milkmaid/> near the bottom of the painting, behind the maid's red skirt, but then the artist painted it over, producing the slight shift in tone ([[pentimento]]) on the wall behind the foot warmer. The basket was later discovered with an [[X-ray]]. Other Vermeer paintings also have images removed. Some art critics have thought the removals may have been intended to provide the works with better thematic focus.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\n\"[I]ts rustic immediacy differs from Vermeer's later paintings,\" according to Laneri. \"There is a tactile, visceral quality to ''The Milkmaid'' &mdash; you can almost taste the thick, creamy milk escaping the jug, feel the cool dampness of the room and the starchy linen of the maid's white cap, touch her sculptural shoulders and corseted waist. She is not an apparition or abstraction. She is not the ideal, worldly housewife of Vermeer's later ''[[Woman with a Water Jug|Young Woman with a Water Pitcher]]'' or the ethereal beauty in ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]''. She is not the cartoonish buxom vixen in Leyden's drawing. She is real &mdash; as real as a painting can get anyway.\"<ref name=Forbes-MetMuseum-2009/>\n\n=== Technique and materials ===\nThis painting has \"perhaps, the most brilliant color scheme of his oeuvre\", according to the Essential Vermeer website. Already in the 18th century, English painter and critic [[Joshua Reynolds]] praised the work for its striking quality.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> One of the distinctions of Vermeer's [[Palette (painting)|palette]], compared with his contemporaries, was his preference for the expensive natural [[ultramarine]] (made from crushed [[lapis lazuli]]) where other painters typically used the much cheaper [[azurite]]. Along with the ultramarine, [[lead-tin-yellow]] is also a dominant color in an exceptionally luminous work (with a much less somber and conventional rendering of light than any of Vermeer's previous extant works).<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/> Depicting white walls was a challenge for artists in Vermeer's time, with his contemporaries using various forms of gray pigment. Here the white walls reflect the daylight with different intensities, displaying the effects of uneven textures on the plastered surfaces. The artist here used [[white lead]], [[umber]] and [[charcoal black]]. Although the formula was widely known among Vermeer's contemporary genre painters, \"perhaps no artist more than Vermeer was able to use it so effectively\", according to the Essential Vermeer website.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\nThe woman's coarse features are painted with thick dabs of ''[[impasto]]''. The seeds on the crust of the bread, as well as the crust itself, along with the plaited handles of the bread basket, are rendered with ''pointill\u00e9'' dots. Soft parts of the bread are rendered with thin swirls of paint, with dabs of [[ochre]] used to show the rough edges of broken crust. One piece of bread to the viewer's right and close to the Dutch oven, has a broad band of yellow, different from the crust, which Cant believes is a suggestion that the piece is going stale. The small roll at the far right has thick impastoed dots that resemble a knobbly crust or a crust with seeds on it. The bread and basket, despite being closer to the viewer, are painted in a more diffuse way than the illusionistic realism of the wall, with its stains, shadowing, nail and nail hole, or the seams and fastenings of the woman's dress, the gleaming, polished brass container hanging from the wall. The panes of glass in the window are varied in a very realistic way, with a crack in one (fourth row from the bottom, far right) reflected on the wood of the window frame. Just below that pane, another has a scratch, indicated with a thin white line. Another pane (second row from the bottom, second from right) is pushed inward within its frame.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/>\n\nThe discrepancy between objects at various distances from the viewer may indicate Vermeer used a ''[[camera obscura]]'', according to Cant.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/> Liedtke points out that a pinhole discovered in the canvas \"has really punctured the theory of the ''camera obscura'' [...] The idea that Vermeer traced compositions in an optical device [...] is rather naive when you consider that the light lasts maybe 10 seconds, but the painting took at least months to paint.\" Instead, The pin in the canvas would have been tied to a string with chalk on it, which the painter would have snapped to get perspective lines, Liedtke said in a 2009 interview.<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009 />\n\nThe woman's bulky green oversleeves were painted with the same yellow and blue paint used in the rest of the woman's clothing, worked at the same time in a [[wet-on-wet]] method. Broad strokes in the painting of the clothing suggests coarse, thick texture of the work clothing. The blue cuff uses a lighter mixture of ultramarine and lead-white, together with a layer of ochre painted beneath it. The brilliant blue of the skirt or apron has been intensified with a glaze (a thin, transparent top layer) of the same color. The glazing helps suggest that the blue material is a less coarse fabric than the yellow bodice, according to Cant.<ref name=Cant-VermeerHisWorld-2009/>\n\n== Provenance ==\n[[File:CartoonsDeMinisterPRinkEnDeMilkmaid1907.jpg|thumb|350px|A 1907 Dutch cartoon by Jan Rinke, reflecting a controversy over whether the state should purchase the painting rather than let it possibly fall into the hands of some rich American art collector. The government bought the work for the [[Rijksmuseum]].]]\n[[Pieter van Ruijven]] (1624\u20131674), Vermeer's patron in Delft (and, at his death, the owner of twenty-one of the painter's works), probably bought the painting directly from the artist. Liedtke doubts that the patron ordered the subject matter.<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/> Ownership later passed on, perhaps to his widow, Maria de Knuijt, probably their daughter, Magdelene van Ruijven (1655&ndash;1681), and certainly to Van Ruijven's son-in-law, [[Jacob Dissius]] (1653\u20131695),<ref name=delftschool>{{cite book |last1=Liedtke |first1=Walter |first2= Michiel C. |last2=Plomp |first3=Axel |last3=Ruger |title=Vermeer and the Delft School |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2001 |location=New Haven and London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n386 372], 374 |isbn=0-87099-973-7}}</ref><ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/clients_patrons/the_dissius_collection.html Dissius collection sale] retrieved June 4, 2010</ref> whose estate sold it with other paintings by the artist in 1696.

In 1822 she married into the [[Six family]] of collectors, and in 1908 her two sons sold the painting (as part of the famous Six collection of thirty-nine works) to the Rijksmuseum, which acquired the works with support from the Dutch government and the [[Rembrandt Society]]<ref name=MetMuseum-Exhibition-2009/> &mdash; but not before a good deal of public squabbling and the intervention of the [[States General of the Netherlands|States-General]] or Dutch parliament.<ref name=EssentialVermeer-Milkmaid/>\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nThe painting has been exhibited in western Europe and in the United States. In 1872 it was part of an Amsterdam exhibition of \"[[old masters]]\" (\"Tentoonstelling van zeldzame en belangrijke schilderijen van oude meesters\"), for Arti et Amicitiae, a society of visual artists and art lovers, and in 1900 it was part of an exhibition at [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. Other European exhibits showing the work include the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] (\"Exhibition of Dutch Art\", London) in 1929; [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]] (\"Exposition hollandaise: Tableaux, aquarelles et dess\u00edns anciens et modernes\", Paris) in 1921; [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen]] (\"Vermeer, oorsprong en invloed: Fabritius, De Hooch, De Witte\", Rotterdam) in 1935.<ref name=delftschool/>\n\nIt was exhibited at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|1939 World's Fair]] in New York City,<ref name=HuffPo-MetMuseum-2009>{{cite news |agency= [[Associated Press]]| date = 14 August 2009 | title = \"Vermeer's 'Milkmaid' to Be Loaned to NYC Museum\" | work = [[Huffington Post]] | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20090812/us-vermeer-exhibition/ | accessdate = 13 September 2009}}</ref> and the outbreak of World War II during the fair \u2013 with the German occupation of the Netherlands \u2013 caused the work to remain in the U.S. until Holland was liberated. During this time it was displayed at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] in [[Michigan]] (the museum where the curator of the World's Fair exhibit was working), and was included in that museum's exhibition catalogues in 1939 and 1941. During the war, the work was also displayed at The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, where it was hanging as late as 1944, according to Leidtke.<ref name=WNYC-Lopate-Liedtke-2009/> In 1953, the [[Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich]] displayed the painting in an exhibition, and the next year it traveled to Italy for an exhibition at the [[Palazzo delle Esposizioni]] in Rome and the [[Palazzo Reale]] in Milan. In 1966, it was part of an exhibition at the [[Mauritshuis]] in the Hague and the [[Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie]] in Paris. In 1999 and 2000 the painting was at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington for its exhibition \"Johannes Vermeer: The Art of Painting\", and it was part of the \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" exhibition at the [[National Gallery]], London from June 20 to September 16, 2001 (it did not appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art venue of that exhibition, earlier that year).<ref name=delftschool/>\n\nThe painting returned to New York in 2009, on the occasion of the 400th anniversary of [[Henry Hudson]]'s historic voyage (Amsterdam to Manhattan), where it was the central feature of a Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition, alongside several of the museum's five Vermeer works and other [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]s.\n\nThe painting was exhibited online in a high-quality digital version after museum curators found that many people thought that a low-quality yellowed version of the image which was circulating on the Internet was a good reproduction of the image.<ref name=Europeana-Yellow-2011>{{cite web |url= http://pro.europeana.eu/documents/858566/2cbf1f78-e036-4088-af25-94684ff90dc5 |title=The Problem of the Yellow Milkmaid |first1=Harry |last1=Verwayen |first2=Martijn |last2=Arnoldus |first3=Peter B. |last3=Kaufman |work=[[Europeana Foundation]] |format=PDF|date=November 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also ==\n* [[Dutch Golden Age painting]]\n* ''[[The Basket of Bread]]''\n* [[List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== Monographs ===\n* [[Bonafoux, Pascal]], and Johannes Vermeer van Delft.

It reached No. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Within the music video producing process, they met producer [[Trevor Horn]], ex of the [[Buggles]] and now heading his own label [[ZTT Records]].<ref name=songfacts/>\n\nGodly & Creme asked Horn to produce their album, but had very little material that was recording studio ready. After their first track failed to produce the required effect, Horn asked what else they had? The pair had already written the first verse of Cry, and much as though the song came from a position - a man in a relationship where his partner lies and cheats on him - unlike 10cc's [[I'm Not in Love]], it didn't come from real-life experience. The three hence sat down and started writing down words and phrases which could be associated with the first verse, and then Horn put Godley in the recording booth to record them. Godley later described the song's creation process as \"patchwork like\", but it worked due to its envisaged simple production.<ref name=songfacts/>\n\nThe basic sound of the track was provided by electronic music specialist [[J. J. Jeczalik]] who used a Clavia synthesizer. Godley & Creme then created the full backing track, which was mixed and produced by Horn.<ref name=songfacts>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/godley-creme/cry|title=Cry by Godley & Creme - Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n;'''7\" - Polydor (UK) 881 786-7'''\n# \"Cry\" \u2013 3:55\n# \"Love Bombs\" \u2013 3:54\n\n;'''12\" - Polydor (UK) 881 786-1'''\n# \"Cry (Extended Version)\" \u2013 6:30\n# \"Love Bombs\" \u2013 4:52\n\n;'''12\" - Polydor (US) 881 786-1'''\n# \"Cry (Extended Remix)\" \u2013 7:25\n# \"Cry (Single Version)\" \u2013 3:55\n# \"Cry (Extended Version)\" \u2013 6:30\n\n;'''12\" - Polydor (CA) POLSXC 107'''\n1 \"Cry (Remix 12' Club Version)\"\n2 \"Cry (Extended Version)\"\n2 \"Love Bombs\"\n\n\n;'''CDV - Polydor (UK) 080 010-2'''\n# \"Cry (Extended Version)\" \u2013 6:30\n# \"Love Bombs\" \u2013 4:53\n# \"Under Your Thumb\" \u2013 3:45\n# \"Power Behind The Throne\" \u2013 3:31\n# \"Cry\" (Video) \u2013 3:36\n\n==Chart positions==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Within the music video producing process, they met producer [[Trevor Horn]], ex of the [[Buggles]] and now heading his own label [[ZTT Records]].<ref name=songfacts/>\n\nGodly & Creme asked Horn to produce their album, but had very little material that was recording studio ready. After their first track failed to produce the required effect, Horn asked what else they had? The pair had already written the first verse of Cry, and much as though the song came from a position - a man in a relationship where his partner lies and cheats on him - unlike 10cc's [[I'm Not in Love]], it didn't come from real-life experience. The three hence sat down and started writing down words and phrases which could be associated with the first verse, and then Horn put Godley in the recording booth to record them. Godley later described the song's creation process as \"patchwork like\", but it worked due to its envisaged simple production.<ref name=songfacts/>\n\nThe basic sound of the track was provided by electronic music specialist [[J. J. Jeczalik]] who used a Clavia synthesizer. Godley & Creme then created the full backing track, which was mixed and produced by Horn.<ref name=songfacts>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/godley-creme/cry|title=Cry by Godley & Creme - Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n;'''7\" - Polydor (UK) 881 786-7'''\n# \"Cry\" \u2013 3:55\n# \"Love Bombs\" \u2013 3:54\n\n;'''12\" - Polydor (UK) 881 786-1'''\n# \"Cry (Extended Version)\" \u2013 6:30\n# \"Love Bombs\" \u2013 4:52\n\n;'''12\" - Polydor (US) 881 786-1'''\n# \"Cry (Extended Remix)\" \u2013 7:25\n# \"Cry (Single Version)\" \u2013 3:55\n# \"Cry (Extended Version)\" \u2013 6:30\n\n;'''12\" - Polydor (CA) POLSXC 107'''\n1 \"Cry (Remix 12' Club Version)\"\n2 \"Cry (Extended Version)\"\n2 \"Love Bombs\"\n\n\n;'''CDV - Polydor (UK) 080 010-2'''\n# \"Cry (Extended Version)\" \u2013 6:30\n# \"Love Bombs\" \u2013 4:53\n# \"Under Your Thumb\" \u2013 3:45\n# \"Power Behind The Throne\" \u2013 3:31\n# \"Cry\" (Video) \u2013 3:36\n\n==Chart positions==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

As a consequence of the Bl\u0101zma withdrawal, no team was directly relegated.\n\n2011 [[Latvian First League]] champions [[FS METTA/Latvijas Universit\u0101te]] from [[Riga]] were directly promoted. The team, which was founded by the METTA football school and the [[University of Latvia]] in 2007, entered the Higher League for the first time in their history.\n\n[[JFK Olimps/RFS]] finished the 2011 season in ninth place and were therefore required to compete in a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off against First Division runners-up [[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|Spartaks J\u016brmala]]. Spartaks won the play-off 4\u20131 on aggregate and were therefore promoted to the Higher League. Similar to METTA/LU, they made their debut at the highest level of the Latvian football pyramid. Accordingly, Olimps/RFS were relegated to the First League after five seasons at the top flight.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{Location map+|Latvia|float=right|width=400|caption=Location of teams in the '''2012 Latvian Higher League'''|places=\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=57.416667|long=21.533333|label=[[FK Ventspils|Ventspils]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=57.1725|long=26.761111|label=[[FB Gulbene|Gulbene]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.966667|long=24.133333|label=[[FK Daugava (2003)|Daugava Riga]]<br />[[FS METTA/Latvijas Universit\u0101te|FS METTA]]<br />[[Skonto FC|Skonto]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.516667|long=21|label=[[FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs|Metalurgs]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.966667|long=23.75|label=[[FC J\u016brmala|J\u016brmala]]<br />[[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|Spartaks]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.58|long=23.716667|label=[[FK Jelgava|Jelgava]]|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=55.883333|long=26.533333|label=[[FC Daugava|Daugava]]|position=left}}\n}}\n\nFollowing the promotion of [[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|FK Spartaks]], the city of [[J\u016brmala]] should have featured three clubs during the 2012 season, one more than the capital, [[Riga]], but [[FK J\u016brmala-VV]] moved to Riga, changing their name to [[FK Daugava (2003)|Daugava Riga]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

As a consequence of the Bl\u0101zma withdrawal, no team was directly relegated.\n\n2011 [[Latvian First League]] champions [[FS METTA/Latvijas Universit\u0101te]] from [[Riga]] were directly promoted. The team, which was founded by the METTA football school and the [[University of Latvia]] in 2007, entered the Higher League for the first time in their history.\n\n[[JFK Olimps/RFS]] finished the 2011 season in ninth place and were therefore required to compete in a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off against First Division runners-up [[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|Spartaks J\u016brmala]]. Spartaks won the play-off 4\u20131 on aggregate and were therefore promoted to the Higher League. Similar to METTA/LU, they made their debut at the highest level of the Latvian football pyramid. Accordingly, Olimps/RFS were relegated to the First League after five seasons at the top flight.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{Location map+|Latvia|float=right|width=400|caption=Location of teams in the '''2012 Latvian Higher League'''|places=\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=57.416667|long=21.533333|label=[[FK Ventspils|Ventspils]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=57.1725|long=26.761111|label=[[FB Gulbene|Gulbene]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.966667|long=24.133333|label=[[FK Daugava (2003)|Daugava Riga]]<br />[[FS METTA/Latvijas Universit\u0101te|FS METTA]]<br />[[Skonto FC|Skonto]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.516667|long=21|label=[[FK Liep\u0101jas Metalurgs|Metalurgs]]}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.966667|long=23.75|label=[[FC J\u016brmala|J\u016brmala]]<br />[[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|Spartaks]]|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=56.58|long=23.716667|label=[[FK Jelgava|Jelgava]]|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Latvia|lat=55.883333|long=26.533333|label=[[FC Daugava|Daugava]]|position=left}}\n}}\n\nFollowing the promotion of [[FK Spartaks J\u016brmala|FK Spartaks]], the city of [[J\u016brmala]] should have featured three clubs during the 2012 season, one more than the capital, [[Riga]], but [[FK J\u016brmala-VV]] moved to Riga, changing their name to [[FK Daugava (2003)|Daugava Riga]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
