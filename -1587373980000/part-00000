Fascism was born in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] following [[World War I]], and other fascist movements, influenced by [[Italian Fascism]], subsequently emerged across Europe. Among the political doctrines identified as ideological origins of fascism in Europe are the combining of a traditional national unity and revolutionary anti-democratic rhetoric espoused by [[Integral nationalism|integral nationalist]] [[Charles Maurras]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/5576.html|title=French Literary Fascism|website=Princeton University Press}}</ref> and [[Sorelianism|revolutionary syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Avant_Garde_Fascism.html?id=ADTdniFtnuwC&redir_esc=y|title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France , 1909\u20131939|first=Mark|last=Antliff|date=September 3, 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> in [[France]].\n\nThe earliest foundations of fascism in practice can be seen in the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/birthoffascistid00ster|url-access=registration|title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|first1=Zeev|last1=Sternhell|first2=Mario|last2=Sznajder|first3=Maia|last3=Ash\u00e9ri|date=August 8, 1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> led by the Italian nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], many of whose politics and aesthetics were subsequently used by [[Benito Mussolini]] and his [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Italian Fasci of Combat]] which Mussolini had founded as the ''Fasci of Revolutionary Action'' in 1914. Despite the fact that its members referred to themselves as \"fascists\", the ideology was based around [[national syndicalism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7870.html|title=Mussolini's Intellectuals|website=Princeton University Press}}</ref> The ideology of fascism would not fully develop until 1921, when Mussolini transformed his movement into the [[National Fascist Party]], which then in 1923 incorporated the [[Italian Nationalist Association]]. The INA established fascist tropes such as [[Blueshirts (Italian Nationalist Association)|colored shirt uniforms]] and also received the support of important proto-fascists like D'Annunzio and [[Italian nationalism|nationalist intellectual]] [[Enrico Corradini]]. yes\n\nThe first declaration of the political stance of fascism was the [[Fascist Manifesto]], written by national syndicalist [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|futurist poet]] [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and published in 1919. Many of the policies advanced in the manifesto, such as centralization, abolition of the senate, formation of national councils loyal to the state, expanded military power, and support for militias ([[Blackshirts]], for example) were adopted by Mussolini's regime, while other calls such as [[universal suffrage]] and a peaceful foreign policy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webspace.tiscali.it/|title=Tiscali Webspace|website=webspace.tiscali.it}}</ref> were abandoned. De Ambris later became a prominent [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]. In 1932, \"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", an essay by Mussolini and [[Giovanni Gentile]], provided an outline of fascism that better represented Mussolini's regime.\n\n==Regimes and parties==\nSome scholars assert that the term \"fascism\" should only be used to mean the ideology of the National Fascist Party under [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, which ruled from 1922 to 1943. However, other European regimes that showed strong similarities to Mussolini's governing are also popularly described as fascist. European regimes often described as fascist or being strongly influenced by fascism include:<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\">For coverage of each one see Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World fascism: a historical encyclopedia'' (Abc-Clio, 2006).</ref>\n* The [[National Fascist Party]]/[[Republican Fascist Party]] in [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|Italy]] and the [[Italian Social Republic]] under [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922\u20131945)\n* The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] (1933\u20131945) (Based around the ideology of [[National Socialism]], which was heavily influenced by fascism)\n* The [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano]] (1933\u20131974) Salazar always rejected the label of fascist criticizing the \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the Estado Novo, however his regime adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa (Estado Novo)|Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa]] and [[Mocidade Portuguesa]] being the most prominent examples, however these institutions were a little more than window dressing and had no political influence; after the end of the Spanish Civil War Salazar distanced his regime from fascism due to its pro-British orientation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vm5by1Najj4C&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=salazar+mussolini+influence&source=bl&ots=Vh3_mjwAGd&sig=ACfU3U14xB_nTM8w3cFyVJYFMs_aSFlsGw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5PHqt9rhAhXRJVAKHamNAKEQ6AEwC3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=salazar+mussolini+influence&f=false|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |last2=Lloyd-Jones |first2=Stewart |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576079409 |page=528}}</ref>\n* The [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] in [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] under [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] (1934\u20131938) (Based around the ideology of [[Austrofascism]], which was heavily infleunced by [[Italian fascism]]) \n* The [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] (1935\u20131939) (Stojadinovi\u0107's regime lacked the fascist characteristics of being a mass movement and totalitarian; however, his regime was heavily inspired by fascism)<ref>{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|year=1996|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299148742|ref=Payne_1996|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780299148744}}</ref> \n* The [[4th of August Regime]] in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] under [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (1936\u20131941) (The Metaxist regime was not fully fascist however adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[National Youth Organisation (Greece)|EON]] being an example of this.

However all regimes listed presented fascist influence through authoritarianism, use of organised paramilitaries/youth movements loyal to the state, propaganda and rhetoric that opposed [[liberalism]], [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[communism]], etc, and built their economies around [[fascist corporatism|corporatism]]. These are all elements of governing popularised by Mussolini. The use of the Roman Salute and coloured shirt uniforms used by most of these regimes also shows how the aesthetics established by the National Fascist Party became adopted throughout Europe.\n\nThere were multiple regimes in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] that were influenced by fascism. These include the [[National Christian Party]] under [[Octavian Goga]] (1938), [[National Renaissance Front|Party of the Nation]] under [[Ion Gigurtu]] (1940) and the [[National Legionary State]] which was led by the [[Iron Guard]] under [[Horia Sima]] in conjunction with the Romanian military dictatorship under [[Ion Antonescu]] (1940-1941). The first two of these regimes were not completely fascist however used fascism to appeal to the growing far-right sympathies amongst the populace.<ref name = \"Report 51\">''Final Report'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nPrior to and during the Second World War, Nazi Germany imposed numerous fascist/fascist related regimes across occupied Europe, these may not fully espouse the form of fascism established by Mussolini however they were authoritarian, nationalist, anti-communist and staunchly pro-[[Axis powers]]:<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\"/>\n* The [[National Partnership]] in the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|Czech Republic]] under [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] (1939\u20131945)\n* The [[Slovak People's Party]] in [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovakia]] under [[Jozef Tiso]] (1939\u20131945)\n* The [[R\u00e9volution nationale|Vichy Regime]] supported by collaborationist parties ([[Marcel Bucard|Marcel Bucard's]] [[Mouvement Franciste]], [[Jacques Doriot|Jacques Doriot's]] [[French Popular Party]], [[Marcel D\u00e9at|Marcel D\u00e9at's]] [[National Popular Rally]]) and [[Joseph Darnand|Joseph Darnand's]] [[Milice]] in [[Vichy France|France]] under [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] and [[Pierre Laval]] (1940\u20131944)\n* The [[Usta\u0161e]] in [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] under [[Ante Paveli\u0107]] (1941\u20131945)\n* The Collaborationist government supported by Georgios Kosmidis's [[National Union of Greece]] in [[Hellenic State (1941\u20131944)|Greece]] under [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]] and [[Ioannis Rallis]] (1941\u20131944)\n* The [[Serbian State Guard|Collaborationist Serbian military]] supported by [[Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107|Dimitrije Ljoti\u0107's]] [[Yugoslav National Movement]] in [[Government of National Salvation|Serbia]] under [[Milan Nedi\u0107]] (1941\u20131944)\n* The [[Nasjonal Samling]] in [[Quisling regime|Norway]] under [[Vidkun Quisling]] (1942\u20131945)\n* The [[Arrow Cross Party]] in [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Hungary]] under [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]] (1944\u20131945)\n* [[Konrad Henlein|Konrad Henlein's]] [[Sudeten German Party]], [[Anton Mussert|Anton Mussert's]] [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]], [[L\u00e9on Degrelle|L\u00e9on Degrelle's]] [[Rexist Party]] and [[Staf De Clercq|Staf De Clercq's]] [[Vlaams Nationaal Verbond|VNV]] were also given significant power in occupied Europe.\n\nThere were also a number of political movements active in Europe that were influenced in part by some features of Mussolini's regime. These include: [[Le Faisceau]], [[British Fascists]], [[British Union of Fascists]], [[Imperial Fascist League]], [[Blueshirts]], [[French National-Collectivist Party]], [[Breton National Party]], [[Falange Espa\u00f1ola de las JONS|Falange Espa\u00f1ola]], [[Black Front]], [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|National Syndicalist Movement]], [[Verdinaso]], [[National Front (Switzerland)|Nationale Front]], [[Greek National Socialist Party]], [[Vlajka]], [[National Fascist Community]], [[National Radical Camp#Falanga|ONR-Falanga]], [[Patriotic People's Movement (Finland)|Patriotic People's Movement]], [[P\u0113rkonkrusts]], [[Union of Bulgarian National Legions]], [[Ratniks]] and the [[Russian Fascist Party]] (based in Manchuria).<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\"/>\n\nProminent figures associated with European fascism outside of the Axis include [[Oswald Mosley]], [[Rotha Lintorn-Orman]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], [[Joris Van Severen]], [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], [[Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto]], [[Hristo Lukov]], [[Aleksandar Tsankov]], [[Boles\u0142aw Piasecki]], [[Radola Gajda]], [[Eoin O'Duffy]], [[Sven Olov Lindholm]], [[Vihtori Kosola]] and [[Konstantin Rodzaevsky]].\n[[File:Oswald Mosley and Benito Mussolini 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] (left) with Oswald Mosley (right) during Mosley's visit to Italy in 1936.]]\n\nOther right-wing/far-right political parties such as the [[German National People's Party]], [[CEDA]], [[Unity Party (Hungary)|Party of Hungarian Life]], [[Mladorossi|Union of Mladorossi]] and the [[Fatherland League (Norway)|Fatherland League]] lacked the ideology of fascism but adopted some fascist characteristics. Far-right politicians like [[Alfred Hugenberg]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles]] and [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] represent fascism's influence on the right with these leaders adopting an ultra-nationalist and authoritarian rhetoric influenced by Mussolini and later Hitler's successes.\n\nThe nationalism espoused by these groups contrasted the internationalist focus of communism; there was little coordination between fascist movements prior to the Second World War however there was an attempt at unifying European fascists. The [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] was a meeting held by members of a number of European fascist parties and movements and was organised by the Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalit\u00e0 di Roma which received support from Mussolini. The first conference was open to many perspectives and failed to develop any unity amidst the many ideological conflicts among the delegates.  The second conference was equally ineffective and more meetings were attempted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&pg=PA232|year=1996|page=232}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, most fascist regimes were dismantled by the victors, with only those in [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] surviving. Parties, movements or politicians who carried the label \"fascist\" quickly became political pariahs with many nations across Europe banning any organisations or references relating to fascism and Nazism. With this came the rise of [[Neo-Fascism]], movements like the [[Italian Social Movement]], [[Socialist Reich Party]] and [[Union Movement]] attempted to continue fascism's legacy but failed to become mass movements.\n\nEuropean fascism influenced movements in the Americas. Both [[Fascism in North America|North America]] and [[Fascism in South America|South America]] would develop fascistic political groups rooted in the local European descended communities.  These included the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile|Chilean Nacistas]], [[Brazilian Integralist Action]], [[Nationalist Liberation Alliance|Argentine Civic Legion]], [[Revolutionary Union (Peru)|Peruvian Revolutionary Union]], [[National Synarchist Union]], [[Gold Shirts|Revolutionary Mexicanist Action]] and the [[Silver Legion of America]] along with figures like [[Pl\u00ednio Salgado]], [[Gustavo Barroso]], [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es|Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es]], [[Salvador Abascal]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Carrasco|Nicol\u00e1s Carrasco]], [[William Dudley Pelley]] and [[Adrien Arcand]]. Some historians also consider Argentine president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his ideology, [[Peronism]] as being influenced by European fascism,<ref name=\"peronism\">Brennan, James P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AsuoVCbF7DgC&q=Fayt#v=snippet&q=Fayt&f=false ''Peronism and Argentina'']. Rowman & Littlefield. 1998.</ref> however, this has been disputed. Brazilian president, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], and his corporate regime known as the [[Vargas Era|\"New State\"]] was also influenced by Mussolini's rule. European fascism was also influential in the European diaspora elsewhere in the world, in Australia [[Eric Campbell (political activist)|Eric Campbell's]] [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]] and the South African fascist movement, which included [[Oswald Pirow]], being examples of this.\n\n== Early relationship ==\nMussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] were not always allies. While Mussolini wanted the expansion of fascist ideology throughout the world, he did not initially appreciate Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]]. Hitler was an early admirer of Mussolini and asked for Mussolini's guidance on how the Nazis could pull off their own [[March on Rome]].<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography.'' New York: Vintage Books. p172</ref> Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy.<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. p172</ref> Mussolini did attempt to read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to find out what Hitler's Nazism was, but he was immediately disappointed, saying that ''Mein Kampf'' was \"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\" and claimed that Hitler's beliefs were \"little more than commonplace clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Smith. 1983. p172</ref>\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party in 1922 had praised the rise to power of Mussolini and sought a German-Italian alliance.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\">Christian Leitz. ''Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933-1941: The Road to Global War''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: P. 10.</ref> Upon Mussolini's rise to power, the Nazis declared their admiration and emulation of the Italian Fascists, with Nazi member [[Hermann Esser]] in November 1922 saying that \"what a group of brave men in Italy have done, we can also do in Bavaria. We\u2019ve also got Italy\u2019s Mussolini: his name is Adolf Hitler\".<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\"/>\n\nThe second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', p. 622}}\n\nIn a 1931 interview, Hitler spoke admirably about Mussolini, commending Mussolini's racial origins as being the same as that of Germans and claimed at the time that Mussolini was capable of building an [[Italian Empire]] that would outdo the [[Roman Empire]] and that he supported Mussolini's endeavors, saying: {{quote|They know that Benito Mussolini is constructing a colossal empire which will put the Roman Empire in the shade. We shall put up ... for his victories. Mussolini is a typical representative of our [[Alpine race]]...|Adolf Hitler, 1931.<ref>Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, \u00c9douard Calic (ed.). ''Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews''. John Day Co., 1971. Pp. 77.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini had personal reasons to oppose antisemitism as his longtime mistress and Fascist [[propaganda]] director [[Margherita Sarfatti]] was [[Jew]]ish. She had played an important role in the foundation of the fascist movement in Italy and promoting it to Italians and the world through supporting the arts. However, within the Italian fascist movement there were a minority who endorsed Hitler's antisemitism as [[Roberto Farinacci]], who was part of the far-right wing of the party.\n\nThere were also nationalist reasons why Germany and Italy were not immediate allies. [[Habsburg]] [[Austria]] (Hitler's birthplace) had an antagonistic relationship with Italy since it was formed, largely because [[Austria-Hungary]] had seized most of the territories once belonging to Italian states such as [[Venice]]. Italian [[irredentist]] claims sought the return of these lands to Italian rule (''[[Italia irredenta]]''). Although initially [[Neutral country|neutral]], Italy entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] against Germany and Austria-Hungary when promised several territories ([[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]). After the war had ended, Italy was rewarded with these territories under the terms of the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].\n\nIn Germany and Austria, the annexation of Alto Adige/South Tyrol was controversial as the province was made up of a large majority of German speakers. While Hitler did not pursue this claim, many in the Nazi Party felt differently. In 1939, Mussolini and Hitler agreed on the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]. When Mussolini's government collapsed in 1943 and the [[Italian Social Republic]] was created, Alto Adige/South Tyrol was annexed to Nazi Greater Germany, but was restored to Italy after the war.\n\n== Racism ==\n{{see also|Italian Fascism and racism}}\nThe most striking difference is the [[Racism|racialist]] ideology which was the central priority of [[Nazism]], but not a priority of the other ideologies. Fascism was founded on the principle of [[nationalist]] [[wikt:unity|unity]] which opposed the divisionist [[Class conflict|class war]] ideologies of [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist socialism]] and [[communism]]; therefore, the majority of the regimes viewed racialism as counterproductive to unity, with Mussolini asserting: that \"[[National pride]] has no need of the delirium of race\".<ref>{{cite book  |last=Montagu |first=Ashley |title=Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22+Nothing+will+ever+make+me+believe+that+biologically+pure+races+can+be+shown+to+exist+today%22&source=web&ots=ao7O_J0vr8&sig=22zZBSKlbcxbrBF1PXP3_PJygj0&hl=en |isbn=0-8039-4648-1}}</ref>\nNazism differed from Italian fascism in that it had a stronger emphasis on race in terms of social and economic policies. Though both ideologies denied the significance of the individual, Italian fascism saw the individual as subservient to the state whereas Nazism saw the individual as well as the state as ultimately subservient to the race.<ref>Grant, Moyra. Key Ideas in Politics. Nelson Thomas 2003. p. 21</ref> However, subservience to the Nazi state was also a requirement on the population. Mussolini's fascism held that cultural factors existed to serve the state and that it was not necessarily in the state's interest to interfere in cultural aspects of society. The only [[purpose of government]] in Mussolini's fascism was to uphold the state as supreme above all else, a concept which can be described as [[statolatry]].\n\nUnlike Hitler, Mussolini repeatedly changed his views on the issue of race according to the circumstances of the time. In 1921, Mussolini promoted the development of the Italian race such as when he said this: {{quote|text=The nation is not simply the sum of living individuals, nor the instrument of parties for their own ends, but an organism {{sic|comprised|hide=y|of}} the infinite series of generations of which the individuals are only transient elements; it is the supreme synthesis of all the material and immaterial values of the race.|sign=Benito Mussolini, 1921<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy.'' London: Routledge. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nLike Hitler, Mussolini publicly declared his support of a eugenics policy to improve the status of Italians in 1926 to the people of [[Reggio Emilia]]: {{quote|text=We need to create ourselves; we of this epoch and this generation, because it is up to us, I tell you, to make the face of this country unrecognizable in the next ten years.

We will create a new Italian, an Italian that does not recognize the Italian of yesterday...we will create them according to our own imagination and likeness. | sign=Benito Mussolini, 1926<ref>Gillette. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], Mussolini stated the following: \"Fascism was born [...] out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan]] and [[Mediterranean race]]\".<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.</ref><ref>Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''.

''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.</ref> However, Italian fascism initially strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized \"pure\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.</ref> The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus inferior.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/> Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/>\n\nIn a private conversation with Emil Ludwig in 1932, Mussolini derided the concept of a biologically superior race and denounced racism as being a foolish concept. Mussolini did not believe that race alone was that significant. Mussolini viewed himself as a modern-day [[Roman Emperor]], the [[Italians]] as a [[cultural]] [[elite]] and he also wished to \"[[Italianisation|Italianise]]\" the parts of the [[Italian Empire]] which he had desired to build.<ref name=\"cultural\">{{cite news|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/7/3/115|publisher=jch.sagepub.com|title=Mussolini's Cultural Revolution: Fascist or Nationalist?|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> A cultural superiority of Italians, rather than a view of racialism.<ref name=\"cultural\"/> Mussolini believed that the development of a race was insignificant in comparison to the development of a culture, but he did believe that a race could be improved through moral development, though he did not say that this would make a superior race: {{quote|Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. [...] National pride has no need of the delirium of race. Only a revolution and a decisive leader can improve a race, even if this is more a sentiment than a reality. But I repeat that a race can change itself and improve itself. I say that it is possible to change not only the somatic lines, the height, but really also the character. Influence of moral pressure can act deterministically also in the biological sense.| sign=Benito Mussolini, 1932.;<ref>Montagu, Ashley. Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&printsec=frontcover</ref><ref name=\"Gillette. p42\">Gillette. p. 42.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini believed that a biologically superior race was not possible, but that a more developed culture's superiority over the less developed ones warranted the destruction of the latter, such as the culture of [[Ethiopia]] and the neighboring [[Slavs|Slavic cultures]], such as those in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. He took advantage of the fact that no undertaking with regard to the rights of [[minorities]] such as those that lived in [[Istria]] and [[Trieste]]'s surroundings was made in either the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] or the [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] and after 1924 [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] these same treaties did not make any undertaking with regard to the rights of the minorities that lived in [[Rijeka]]. Croatian, Slovene, German and French [[toponyms]] were systematically Italianized.\n\nAgainst ethnic Slovenes, he imposed an especially violent [[fascist Italianization]] policy. To Italianize ethnic [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croatian people|Croatian]] children, Fascist Italy brought Italian teachers from [[Southern Italy]] to the ex Austro-Hungarian territories that had been given to Italy in exchange for its decision to join Great Britain in World War I such as Slovene Littoral and a big part of western [[Slovenia]] while Slovene and Croatian teachers, poets, writers, artists and clergy were exiled to [[Sardinia]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Acts of fascist violence were not hampered by the authorities, such as the burning down of the [[Narodni dom (Trieste)|Narodni dom]] (Community Hall of ethnic Slovenes in Trieste) in Trieste, which was carried out at night by fascists with the connivance of the police on 13 July 1920.\n\nAfter the complete destruction of all Slovene minority cultural, financial and other organizations and the continuation of violent fascist Italianization policies of ethnic cleansing, one of the first [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organizations in Europe, [[TIGR]], emerged in 1927, and it coordinated the Slovene resistance against Fascist Italy until it was dismantled by the fascist secret police in 1941, after which some ex-TIGR members joined the [[Slovene Partisans]].\n\nFor Mussolini, the inclusion of people in a fascist society depended upon their loyalty to the state. Meetings between Mussolini and [[Arab]] dignitaries from the colony of [[Libya]] convinced him that the Arab population was worthy enough to be given extensive civil rights and as a result, he allowed Muslims to join a [[Muslim]] section of the Fascist Party, namely the [[Muslim Association of the Lictor]].<ref>Sarti, Roland. 1974.

In Italy and Germany a movement came to power that sought to create national unity through the repression of national enemies and the incorporation of all classes and both genders into a permanently mobilized nation.<ref>[http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/ http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/]</ref></blockquote>\n\nNazi ideologues such as [[Alfred Rosenburg]] were highly skeptical of the Italian race and fascism, but he believed that the improvement of the Italian race was possible if major changes were made in order to convert it into an acceptable \"Aryan\" race and he also said that the Italian fascist movement would only succeed if it purified the Italian race into an Aryan one.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/> Nazi theorists believed that the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|downfall of the Roman Empire]] was due to the interbreeding of different races which created a \"polluted\" Italian race which was inferior.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nHitler believed this and he also believed that Mussolini represented an attempt to revive the pure elements of the former Roman civilization, such as the desire to create a strong and aggressive Italian people. However, Hitler was still audacious enough when meeting Mussolini for the first time in 1934 to tell him that all Mediterranean peoples were \"tainted\" by \"Negro blood\" and thus in his racist view they were degenerate.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nRelations between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were initially poor but they deteriorated even further after the assassination of Austria's fascist chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] by [[Austrian Nazis]] in 1934. Under Dollfuss Austria was a key ally of Mussolini and Mussolini was deeply angered by Hitler's attempt to take over Austria and he expressed it by angrily mocking Hitler's earlier remark on the impurity of the Italian race by declaring that a \"Germanic\" race did not exist and he also indicated that Hitler's repression of Germany's Jews proved that the Germans were not a pure race: {{quote|But which race? Does there exist a German race. Has it ever existed? Will it ever exist? Reality, myth, or hoax of theorists?

Nazi Germany was even more aggressive in expanding its borders in violation of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]].  The Nazis murdered the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] dictator Dollfuss, causing an uneasy relationship in Austria between fascism and Nazism at an early stage. [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] and [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] claims clashed over the issue of [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|Tyrol]].\n\nIn the 1920s, Hitler with only a small Nazi party at the time wanted to form an alliance with Mussolini's regime as he recognized that his pan-German nationalism was seen as a threat by Italy. In Hitler's unpublished sequel to ''Mein Kampf'', he attempts to address concerns among Italian fascists about Nazism. In the book, Hitler puts aside the issue of Germans in Tyrol by explaining that overall Germany and Italy have more in common than not and that the Tyrol Germans must accept that it is in Germany's interests to be allied with Italy. Hitler claims that Germany, like Italy, was subjected to oppression by its neighbours and he denounces the Austrian Empire as having oppressed Italy from completing national unification just as France oppressed Germany from completing its national unification. Hitler's denunciation of Austria in the book is important because Italian fascists were skeptical about him due to the fact that he was born in Austria which Italy had considered to be its primary enemy for centuries and Italy saw Germany as an ally of Austria. By declaring that the Nazi movement was not interested in the territorial legacy of the Austrian Empire, this is a way to assure the Italian fascists that Hitler, the Nazi movement and Germany were not enemies of Italy.\n\nDespite public attempts of goodwill by Hitler towards Mussolini, Germany and Italy came into conflict in 1934 when Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrofascist leader of Italy's ally Austria, was assassinated by Austrian Nazis on Hitler's orders in preparation for a planned [[Anschluss]] ([[annexation]] of Austria). Mussolini ordered troops to the Austrian-Italian border in readiness for war against Germany. Hitler backed down and defer plans to annex Austria.\n\nWhen Hitler and Mussolini first met, Mussolini referred to Hitler as \"a silly little monkey\" before the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] forced Mussolini into an agreement with Hitler. Mussolini also reportedly asked [[Pope Pius XII]] to [[excommunicate]] Hitler. From 1934 to [[1936]], Hitler continually attempted to win the support of Italy and the Nazi regime endorsed the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (leading to [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia's]] annexation as [[Italian East Africa]]) while the [[League of Nations]] condemned Italian aggression. With other countries opposing Italy, the fascist regime had no choice but to draw closer to Nazi Germany. Germany joined Italy in supporting the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] under [[Francisco Franco]] with forces and supplies in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nLater, Germany and Italy signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] committing the two regimes to oppose the [[Comintern]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[communism]]. By 1938, Mussolini allowed Hitler to carry out Anschluss in exchange for official German renunciation of claims to Tyrol. Mussolini supported the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation]] of the [[Sudetenland]] during the [[Munich Agreement]] talks later the same year.\n\nIn 1939, the [[Pact of Steel]] was signed, officially creating an alliance of Germany and Italy. The Nazi official newspaper ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' published articles extolling the mutually benefit of the alliance: {{quote|Firmly bound together through the inner unity of their ideologies and the comprehensive solidarity of their interests, the German and the Italian people are determined also in future to stand side by side and to strive with united effort for the securing of their [[Lebensraum]] [living space] and the maintenance of peace.|sign=''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (May 23, 1939)}}\n\nHitler and Mussolini recognized commonalities in their politics and the second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=''Mein Kampf'' (p. 622)}}\n\nBoth regimes despised [[French Third Republic|France]] (seen as an enemy which held territories claimed by both Germany and Italy) and [[Yugoslavia]] (seen by the Nazis as a racially degenerate Slavic state and holding lands such as [[Dalmatia]] claimed by the Italian fascists). Fascist territorial claims on Yugoslav territory meant that Mussolini saw the destruction of Yugoslavia as essential for Italian expansion. Hitler viewed Slavs as racially inferior, but he did not see importance in an immediate invasion of Yugoslavia, instead focusing on the threat from the Soviet Union.\n\nMussolini favored using the extremist [[Croatian people|Croatian]] nationalist [[Usta\u0161e]] as a useful tool to tear down Yugoslavia, led by the [[Serb]]s and with a Serbian [[dynasty]], the [[House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. In 1941, the Italian military campaign in [[Greece]] (the [[Greco-Italian War]], called the [[Battle of Greece]] for the period after the German intervention) was failing. Hitler reluctantly began the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] with the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. German, Italian, [[Bulgaria]]n, [[Hungary during World War II|Hungarian]] and Croatian [[Insurgency|insurgents]] (under the Axis [[Puppet state|puppet]] [[Independent State of Croatia]]) decisively defeated Yugoslavia.\n\nIn the aftermath, with the exception of Serbia and [[Vardar Macedonia]], most of Yugoslavia was reshaped based on Italian fascist foreign policy objectives. Mussolini demanded and received much of Dalmatia from the Croats in exchange for supporting the independence of Croatia. Mussolini's policy of creating an independent Croatia prevailed over Hitler's anti-Slavism and eventually, the Nazis and the Ustashe regime of Croatia would develop closer bonds due to the Ustashe's brutal effectiveness at suppressing Serb dissidents.\n\nThe question of religion also poses considerable conflicting differences as some forms of fascism, particularly the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] and [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] that were devoutly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The [[Religious aspects of Nazism|occultist and pagan]] elements of Nazi ideology were very hostile to the traditional Christianity found in the vast majority of fascist movements of the 20th century.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]''\n* [[Falange]]\n* [[Fascism in Africa]]\n* [[Fascism in Asia]]\n* [[Fascism in North America]]\n* [[Fascism in South America]]\n* [[Jingoism]]\n* [[National syndicalism]]\n* [[Radical right (Europe)|Radical right]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Atkins, Stephen E.

Fascism was born in [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] following [[World War I]], and other fascist movements, influenced by [[Italian Fascism]], subsequently emerged across Europe. Among the political doctrines identified as ideological origins of fascism in Europe are the combining of a traditional national unity and revolutionary anti-democratic rhetoric espoused by [[Integral nationalism|integral nationalist]] [[Charles Maurras]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/5576.html|title=French Literary Fascism|website=Princeton University Press}}</ref> and [[Sorelianism|revolutionary syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Avant_Garde_Fascism.html?id=ADTdniFtnuwC&redir_esc=y|title=Avant-Garde Fascism: The Mobilization of Myth, Art, and Culture in France , 1909\u20131939|first=Mark|last=Antliff|date=September 3, 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> in [[France]].\n\nThe earliest foundations of fascism in practice can be seen in the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/birthoffascistid00ster|url-access=registration|title=The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution|first1=Zeev|last1=Sternhell|first2=Mario|last2=Sznajder|first3=Maia|last3=Ash\u00e9ri|date=August 8, 1994|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> led by the Italian nationalist [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], many of whose politics and aesthetics were subsequently used by [[Benito Mussolini]] and his [[Fasci Italiani di Combattimento|Italian Fasci of Combat]] which Mussolini had founded as the ''Fasci of Revolutionary Action'' in 1914. Despite the fact that its members referred to themselves as \"fascists\", the ideology was based around [[national syndicalism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://press.princeton.edu/titles/7870.html|title=Mussolini's Intellectuals|website=Princeton University Press}}</ref> The ideology of fascism would not fully develop until 1921, when Mussolini transformed his movement into the [[National Fascist Party]], which then in 1923 incorporated the [[Italian Nationalist Association]]. The INA established fascist tropes such as [[Blueshirts (Italian Nationalist Association)|colored shirt uniforms]] and also received the support of important proto-fascists like D'Annunzio and [[Italian nationalism|nationalist intellectual]] [[Enrico Corradini]].\n\nThe first declaration of the political stance of fascism was the [[Fascist Manifesto]], written by national syndicalist [[Alceste De Ambris]] and [[Futurism|futurist poet]] [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and published in 1919. Many of the policies advanced in the manifesto, such as centralization, abolition of the senate, formation of national councils loyal to the state, expanded military power, and support for militias ([[Blackshirts]], for example) were adopted by Mussolini's regime, while other calls such as [[universal suffrage]] and a peaceful foreign policy<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webspace.tiscali.it/|title=Tiscali Webspace|website=webspace.tiscali.it}}</ref> were abandoned. De Ambris later became a prominent [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]]. In 1932, \"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", an essay by Mussolini and [[Giovanni Gentile]], provided an outline of fascism that better represented Mussolini's regime.\n\n==Regimes and parties==\nSome scholars assert that the term \"fascism\" should only be used to mean the ideology of the National Fascist Party under [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, which ruled from 1922 to 1943. However, other European regimes that showed strong similarities to Mussolini's governing are also popularly described as fascist. European regimes often described as fascist or being strongly influenced by fascism include:<ref name=\"Cyprian Blamires 2006\">For coverage of each one see Cyprian Blamires, ed., ''World fascism: a historical encyclopedia'' (Abc-Clio, 2006).</ref>\n* The [[National Fascist Party]]/[[Republican Fascist Party]] in [[Fascist Italy (1922-1943)|Italy]] and the [[Italian Social Republic]] under [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922\u20131945)\n* The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] under [[Adolf Hitler]] (1933\u20131945) (Based around the ideology of [[National Socialism]], which was heavily influenced by fascism)\n* The [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] in [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano]] (1933\u20131974) Salazar always rejected the label of fascist criticizing the \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the Estado Novo, however his regime adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa (Estado Novo)|Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa]] and [[Mocidade Portuguesa]] being the most prominent examples, however these institutions were a little more than window dressing and had no political influence; after the end of the Spanish Civil War Salazar distanced his regime from fascism due to its pro-British orientation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vm5by1Najj4C&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=salazar+mussolini+influence&source=bl&ots=Vh3_mjwAGd&sig=ACfU3U14xB_nTM8w3cFyVJYFMs_aSFlsGw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx5PHqt9rhAhXRJVAKHamNAKEQ6AEwC3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=salazar+mussolini+influence&f=false|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |last2=Lloyd-Jones |first2=Stewart |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576079409 |page=528}}</ref>\n* The [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] in [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] under [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and [[Kurt Schuschnigg]] (1934\u20131938) (Based around the ideology of [[Austrofascism]], which was heavily infleunced by [[Italian fascism]]) \n* The [[Yugoslav Radical Union]] in [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]] (1935\u20131939) (Stojadinovi\u0107's regime lacked the fascist characteristics of being a mass movement and totalitarian; however, his regime was heavily inspired by fascism)<ref>{{cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|year=1996|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=0299148742|ref=Payne_1996|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780299148744}}</ref> \n* The [[4th of August Regime]] in [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] under [[Ioannis Metaxas]] (1936\u20131941) (The Metaxist regime was not fully fascist however adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[National Youth Organisation (Greece)|EON]] being an example of this.

However all regimes listed presented fascist influence through authoritarianism, use of organised paramilitaries/youth movements loyal to the state, propaganda and rhetoric that opposed [[liberalism]], [[individualism]], [[democracy]], [[communism]], etc, and built their economies around [[fascist corporatism|corporatism]]. These are all elements of governing popularised by Mussolini. The use of the Roman Salute and coloured shirt uniforms used by most of these regimes also shows how the aesthetics established by the National Fascist Party became adopted throughout Europe.\n\nThere were multiple regimes in [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] that were influenced by fascism. These include the [[National Christian Party]] under [[Octavian Goga]] (1938), [[National Renaissance Front|Party of the Nation]] under [[Ion Gigurtu]] (1940) and the [[National Legionary State]] which was led by the [[Iron Guard]] under [[Horia Sima]] in conjunction with the Romanian military dictatorship under [[Ion Antonescu]] (1940-1941).

The [[1934 Montreux Fascist conference]] was a meeting held by members of a number of European fascist parties and movements and was organised by the Comitati d'Azione per l'Universalit\u00e0 di Roma which received support from Mussolini. The first conference was open to many perspectives and failed to develop any unity amidst the many ideological conflicts among the delegates.  The second conference was equally ineffective and more meetings were attempted.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=A History of Fascism, 1914\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&pg=PA232|year=1996|page=232}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, most fascist regimes were dismantled by the victors, with only those in [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] surviving. Parties, movements or politicians who carried the label \"fascist\" quickly became political pariahs with many nations across Europe banning any organisations or references relating to fascism and Nazism. With this came the rise of [[Neo-Fascism]], movements like the [[Italian Social Movement]], [[Socialist Reich Party]] and [[Union Movement]] attempted to continue fascism's legacy but failed to become mass movements.\n\nEuropean fascism influenced movements in the Americas. Both [[Fascism in North America|North America]] and [[Fascism in South America|South America]] would develop fascistic political groups rooted in the local European descended communities.  These included the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile|Chilean Nacistas]], [[Brazilian Integralist Action]], [[Nationalist Liberation Alliance|Argentine Civic Legion]], [[Revolutionary Union (Peru)|Peruvian Revolutionary Union]], [[National Synarchist Union]], [[Gold Shirts|Revolutionary Mexicanist Action]] and the [[Silver Legion of America]] along with figures like [[Pl\u00ednio Salgado]], [[Gustavo Barroso]], [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es|Gonz\u00e1lez von Mar\u00e9es]], [[Salvador Abascal]], [[Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Carrasco|Nicol\u00e1s Carrasco]], [[William Dudley Pelley]] and [[Adrien Arcand]]. Some historians also consider Argentine president [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] and his ideology, [[Peronism]] as being influenced by European fascism,<ref name=\"peronism\">Brennan, James P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AsuoVCbF7DgC&q=Fayt#v=snippet&q=Fayt&f=false ''Peronism and Argentina'']. Rowman & Littlefield. 1998.</ref> however, this has been disputed. Brazilian president, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], and his corporate regime known as the [[Vargas Era|\"New State\"]] was also influenced by Mussolini's rule. European fascism was also influential in the European diaspora elsewhere in the world, in Australia [[Eric Campbell (political activist)|Eric Campbell's]] [[Centre Party (New South Wales)|Centre Party]] and the South African fascist movement, which included [[Oswald Pirow]], being examples of this.\n\n== Early relationship ==\nMussolini and [[Adolf Hitler]] were not always allies. While Mussolini wanted the expansion of fascist ideology throughout the world, he did not initially appreciate Hitler and the [[Nazi Party]]. Hitler was an early admirer of Mussolini and asked for Mussolini's guidance on how the Nazis could pull off their own [[March on Rome]].<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. ''Mussolini: A Biography.'' New York: Vintage Books. p172</ref> Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy.<ref>Smith, Denis Mack. 1983. p172</ref> Mussolini did attempt to read ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to find out what Hitler's Nazism was, but he was immediately disappointed, saying that ''Mein Kampf'' was \"a boring tome that I have never been able to read\" and claimed that Hitler's beliefs were \"little more than commonplace clich\u00e9s\".<ref>Smith. 1983. p172</ref>\n\nHitler and the Nazi Party in 1922 had praised the rise to power of Mussolini and sought a German-Italian alliance.<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\">Christian Leitz. ''Nazi Foreign Policy, 1933-1941: The Road to Global War''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: P. 10.</ref> Upon Mussolini's rise to power, the Nazis declared their admiration and emulation of the Italian Fascists, with Nazi member [[Hermann Esser]] in November 1922 saying that \"what a group of brave men in Italy have done, we can also do in Bavaria. We\u2019ve also got Italy\u2019s Mussolini: his name is Adolf Hitler\".<ref name=\"Christian Leitz P. 10\"/>\n\nThe second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=Adolf Hitler, ''Mein Kampf'', p. 622}}\n\nIn a 1931 interview, Hitler spoke admirably about Mussolini, commending Mussolini's racial origins as being the same as that of Germans and claimed at the time that Mussolini was capable of building an [[Italian Empire]] that would outdo the [[Roman Empire]] and that he supported Mussolini's endeavors, saying: {{quote|They know that Benito Mussolini is constructing a colossal empire which will put the Roman Empire in the shade. We shall put up ... for his victories. Mussolini is a typical representative of our [[Alpine race]]...|Adolf Hitler, 1931.<ref>Richard Breiting, Adolf Hitler, \u00c9douard Calic (ed.). ''Secret conversations with Hitler:the two newly-discovered 1931 interviews''. John Day Co., 1971. Pp. 77.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini had personal reasons to oppose antisemitism as his longtime mistress and Fascist [[propaganda]] director [[Margherita Sarfatti]] was [[Jew]]ish. She had played an important role in the foundation of the fascist movement in Italy and promoting it to Italians and the world through supporting the arts. However, within the Italian fascist movement there were a minority who endorsed Hitler's antisemitism as [[Roberto Farinacci]], who was part of the far-right wing of the party.\n\nThere were also nationalist reasons why Germany and Italy were not immediate allies. [[Habsburg]] [[Austria]] (Hitler's birthplace) had an antagonistic relationship with Italy since it was formed, largely because [[Austria-Hungary]] had seized most of the territories once belonging to Italian states such as [[Venice]]. Italian [[irredentist]] claims sought the return of these lands to Italian rule (''[[Italia irredenta]]''). Although initially [[Neutral country|neutral]], Italy entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] against Germany and Austria-Hungary when promised several territories ([[Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]] and [[Dalmatia]]). After the war had ended, Italy was rewarded with these territories under the terms of the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].\n\nIn Germany and Austria, the annexation of Alto Adige/South Tyrol was controversial as the province was made up of a large majority of German speakers. While Hitler did not pursue this claim, many in the Nazi Party felt differently. In 1939, Mussolini and Hitler agreed on the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement]]. When Mussolini's government collapsed in 1943 and the [[Italian Social Republic]] was created, Alto Adige/South Tyrol was annexed to Nazi Greater Germany, but was restored to Italy after the war.\n\n== Racism ==\n{{see also|Italian Fascism and racism}}\nThe most striking difference is the [[Racism|racialist]] ideology which was the central priority of [[Nazism]], but not a priority of the other ideologies. Fascism was founded on the principle of [[nationalist]] [[wikt:unity|unity]] which opposed the divisionist [[Class conflict|class war]] ideologies of [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist socialism]] and [[communism]]; therefore, the majority of the regimes viewed racialism as counterproductive to unity, with Mussolini asserting: that \"[[National pride]] has no need of the delirium of race\".<ref>{{cite book  |last=Montagu |first=Ashley |title=Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22+Nothing+will+ever+make+me+believe+that+biologically+pure+races+can+be+shown+to+exist+today%22&source=web&ots=ao7O_J0vr8&sig=22zZBSKlbcxbrBF1PXP3_PJygj0&hl=en |isbn=0-8039-4648-1}}</ref>\nNazism differed from Italian fascism in that it had a stronger emphasis on race in terms of social and economic policies. Though both ideologies denied the significance of the individual, Italian fascism saw the individual as subservient to the state whereas Nazism saw the individual as well as the state as ultimately subservient to the race.<ref>Grant, Moyra. Key Ideas in Politics. Nelson Thomas 2003. p. 21</ref> However, subservience to the Nazi state was also a requirement on the population. Mussolini's fascism held that cultural factors existed to serve the state and that it was not necessarily in the state's interest to interfere in cultural aspects of society. The only [[purpose of government]] in Mussolini's fascism was to uphold the state as supreme above all else, a concept which can be described as [[statolatry]].\n\nUnlike Hitler, Mussolini repeatedly changed his views on the issue of race according to the circumstances of the time. In 1921, Mussolini promoted the development of the Italian race such as when he said this: {{quote|text=The nation is not simply the sum of living individuals, nor the instrument of parties for their own ends, but an organism {{sic|comprised|hide=y|of}} the infinite series of generations of which the individuals are only transient elements; it is the supreme synthesis of all the material and immaterial values of the race.|sign=Benito Mussolini, 1921<ref>Gillette, Aaron. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy.'' London: Routledge. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nLike Hitler, Mussolini publicly declared his support of a eugenics policy to improve the status of Italians in 1926 to the people of [[Reggio Emilia]]: {{quote|text=We need to create ourselves; we of this epoch and this generation, because it is up to us, I tell you, to make the face of this country unrecognizable in the next ten years.

We will create a new Italian, an Italian that does not recognize the Italian of yesterday...we will create them according to our own imagination and likeness. | sign=Benito Mussolini, 1926<ref>Gillette. p. 39.</ref>}}\n\nIn a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], Mussolini stated the following: \"Fascism was born [...] out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan]] and [[Mediterranean race]]\".<ref>Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.</ref><ref>Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''.

''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.</ref> However, Italian fascism initially strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized \"pure\" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\">Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.</ref> The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus inferior.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/> Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex.<ref name=\"Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 188\"/>\n\nIn a private conversation with Emil Ludwig in 1932, Mussolini derided the concept of a biologically superior race and denounced racism as being a foolish concept. Mussolini did not believe that race alone was that significant. Mussolini viewed himself as a modern-day [[Roman Emperor]], the [[Italians]] as a [[cultural]] [[elite]] and he also wished to \"[[Italianisation|Italianise]]\" the parts of the [[Italian Empire]] which he had desired to build.<ref name=\"cultural\">{{cite news|url=http://jch.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/7/3/115|publisher=jch.sagepub.com|title=Mussolini's Cultural Revolution: Fascist or Nationalist?|date=8 January 2008}}</ref> A cultural superiority of Italians, rather than a view of racialism.<ref name=\"cultural\"/> Mussolini believed that the development of a race was insignificant in comparison to the development of a culture, but he did believe that a race could be improved through moral development, though he did not say that this would make a superior race: {{quote|Race! It is a feeling, not a reality: ninety-five percent, at least, is a feeling. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today. [...] National pride has no need of the delirium of race. Only a revolution and a decisive leader can improve a race, even if this is more a sentiment than a reality. But I repeat that a race can change itself and improve itself. I say that it is possible to change not only the somatic lines, the height, but really also the character. Influence of moral pressure can act deterministically also in the biological sense.| sign=Benito Mussolini, 1932.;<ref>Montagu, Ashley. Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race|publisher=Rowman Altamira|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkHqP3vgYi4C&printsec=frontcover</ref><ref name=\"Gillette. p42\">Gillette. p. 42.</ref>}}\n\nMussolini believed that a biologically superior race was not possible, but that a more developed culture's superiority over the less developed ones warranted the destruction of the latter, such as the culture of [[Ethiopia]] and the neighboring [[Slavs|Slavic cultures]], such as those in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]]. He took advantage of the fact that no undertaking with regard to the rights of [[minorities]] such as those that lived in [[Istria]] and [[Trieste]]'s surroundings was made in either the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]] or the [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] and after 1924 [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Treaty of Rome]] these same treaties did not make any undertaking with regard to the rights of the minorities that lived in [[Rijeka]]. Croatian, Slovene, German and French [[toponyms]] were systematically Italianized.\n\nAgainst ethnic Slovenes, he imposed an especially violent [[fascist Italianization]] policy. To Italianize ethnic [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Croatian people|Croatian]] children, Fascist Italy brought Italian teachers from [[Southern Italy]] to the ex Austro-Hungarian territories that had been given to Italy in exchange for its decision to join Great Britain in World War I such as Slovene Littoral and a big part of western [[Slovenia]] while Slovene and Croatian teachers, poets, writers, artists and clergy were exiled to [[Sardinia]] and [[Southern Italy]]. Acts of fascist violence were not hampered by the authorities, such as the burning down of the [[Narodni dom (Trieste)|Narodni dom]] (Community Hall of ethnic Slovenes in Trieste) in Trieste, which was carried out at night by fascists with the connivance of the police on 13 July 1920.\n\nAfter the complete destruction of all Slovene minority cultural, financial and other organizations and the continuation of violent fascist Italianization policies of ethnic cleansing, one of the first [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organizations in Europe, [[TIGR]], emerged in 1927, and it coordinated the Slovene resistance against Fascist Italy until it was dismantled by the fascist secret police in 1941, after which some ex-TIGR members joined the [[Slovene Partisans]].\n\nFor Mussolini, the inclusion of people in a fascist society depended upon their loyalty to the state. Meetings between Mussolini and [[Arab]] dignitaries from the colony of [[Libya]] convinced him that the Arab population was worthy enough to be given extensive civil rights and as a result, he allowed Muslims to join a [[Muslim]] section of the Fascist Party, namely the [[Muslim Association of the Lictor]].<ref>Sarti, Roland. 1974. ''The Ax Within: Italian Fascism in Action.'' New York: New Viewpoints. p190.</ref> However, under pressure from Nazi Germany the fascist regime eventually embraced a racist ideology, such as promoting the belief that Italy was settling Africa in order to create a white civilization there<ref>Sarti, 1974. p189.</ref> and it imposed five-year prison sentences on any Italians who were caught having sexual or marital relationships with native Africans.<ref>Sarti, 1974. p190.</ref> Against those colonial peoples who were not loyal, vicious campaigns of repression were waged such as in Ethiopia, where native Ethiopian settlements were burned to the ground by the Italian armed forces in 1937.<ref>Sarti, 1974. p191.</ref> Under fascism, native Africans were allowed to join the Italian armed forces as colonial troops and they also appeared in [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy|fascist propaganda]].<ref>http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit13.jpg</ref><ref>http://www.germaniainternational.com/images/bookgijuinit14.jpg</ref>\n\nAt least in its overt ideology, the Nazi movement believed that the existence of a class-based society was a threat to its survival and as a result, it wanted to unify the racial element above the established classes, but the Italian fascist movement sought to preserve the class system and uphold it as the foundation of an established and desirable culture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Nevertheless, the Italian fascists did not reject the concept of [[social mobility]] and a central tenet of the fascist state was [[meritocracy]], yet fascism also heavily based itself on [[corporatism]], which was supposed to supersede [[class conflict]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Despite these differences, Kevin Passmore (2002 p.&nbsp;62) observes: <blockquote>There are sufficient similarities between Fascism and Nazism to make it worthwhile by applying the concept of fascism to both. In Italy and Germany a movement came to power that sought to create national unity through the repression of national enemies and the incorporation of all classes and both genders into a permanently mobilized nation.<ref>[http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/ http://www.cf.ac.uk/hisar/people/kp/]</ref></blockquote>\n\nNazi ideologues such as [[Alfred Rosenburg]] were highly skeptical of the Italian race and fascism, but he believed that the improvement of the Italian race was possible if major changes were made in order to convert it into an acceptable \"Aryan\" race and he also said that the Italian fascist movement would only succeed if it purified the Italian race into an Aryan one.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/> Nazi theorists believed that the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|downfall of the Roman Empire]] was due to the interbreeding of different races which created a \"polluted\" Italian race which was inferior.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nHitler believed this and he also believed that Mussolini represented an attempt to revive the pure elements of the former Roman civilization, such as the desire to create a strong and aggressive Italian people. However, Hitler was still audacious enough when meeting Mussolini for the first time in 1934 to tell him that all Mediterranean peoples were \"tainted\" by \"Negro blood\" and thus in his racist view they were degenerate.<ref name=\"Gillette. p42\"/>\n\nRelations between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were initially poor but they deteriorated even further after the assassination of Austria's fascist chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] by [[Austrian Nazis]] in 1934. Under Dollfuss Austria was a key ally of Mussolini and Mussolini was deeply angered by Hitler's attempt to take over Austria and he expressed it by angrily mocking Hitler's earlier remark on the impurity of the Italian race by declaring that a \"Germanic\" race did not exist and he also indicated that Hitler's repression of Germany's Jews proved that the Germans were not a pure race: {{quote|But which race? Does there exist a German race. Has it ever existed? Will it ever exist? Reality, myth, or hoax of theorists? (Another parenthesis: the theoretician of racism is a 100 percent Frenchman: Gobineau) Ah well, we respond, a Germanic race does not exist. Various movements. Curiosity. Stupor. We repeat. Does not exist. We don't say so. Scientists say so. Hitler says so. | sign=Benito Mussolini, 1934<ref>Gillette. p. 45.</ref>}}\n\n== Foreign affairs ==\n{{Nazism sidebar}}\nItalian Fascism was [[expansionist]] in its desires, looking to create a [[New Roman Empire]]. Nazi Germany was even more aggressive in expanding its borders in violation of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]].  The Nazis murdered the [[Austrofascism|Austrofascist]] dictator Dollfuss, causing an uneasy relationship in Austria between fascism and Nazism at an early stage. [[Italian nationalism|Italian nationalist]] and [[Pan-Germanism|pan-German]] claims clashed over the issue of [[Euroregion Tyrol-South Tyrol-Trentino|Tyrol]].\n\nIn the 1920s, Hitler with only a small Nazi party at the time wanted to form an alliance with Mussolini's regime as he recognized that his pan-German nationalism was seen as a threat by Italy. In Hitler's unpublished sequel to ''Mein Kampf'', he attempts to address concerns among Italian fascists about Nazism. In the book, Hitler puts aside the issue of Germans in Tyrol by explaining that overall Germany and Italy have more in common than not and that the Tyrol Germans must accept that it is in Germany's interests to be allied with Italy. Hitler claims that Germany, like Italy, was subjected to oppression by its neighbours and he denounces the Austrian Empire as having oppressed Italy from completing national unification just as France oppressed Germany from completing its national unification. Hitler's denunciation of Austria in the book is important because Italian fascists were skeptical about him due to the fact that he was born in Austria which Italy had considered to be its primary enemy for centuries and Italy saw Germany as an ally of Austria. By declaring that the Nazi movement was not interested in the territorial legacy of the Austrian Empire, this is a way to assure the Italian fascists that Hitler, the Nazi movement and Germany were not enemies of Italy.\n\nDespite public attempts of goodwill by Hitler towards Mussolini, Germany and Italy came into conflict in 1934 when Engelbert Dollfuss, the Austrofascist leader of Italy's ally Austria, was assassinated by Austrian Nazis on Hitler's orders in preparation for a planned [[Anschluss]] ([[annexation]] of Austria). Mussolini ordered troops to the Austrian-Italian border in readiness for war against Germany. Hitler backed down and defer plans to annex Austria.\n\nWhen Hitler and Mussolini first met, Mussolini referred to Hitler as \"a silly little monkey\" before the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] forced Mussolini into an agreement with Hitler. Mussolini also reportedly asked [[Pope Pius XII]] to [[excommunicate]] Hitler. From 1934 to [[1936]], Hitler continually attempted to win the support of Italy and the Nazi regime endorsed the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] (leading to [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia's]] annexation as [[Italian East Africa]]) while the [[League of Nations]] condemned Italian aggression. With other countries opposing Italy, the fascist regime had no choice but to draw closer to Nazi Germany. Germany joined Italy in supporting the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] under [[Francisco Franco]] with forces and supplies in the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\nLater, Germany and Italy signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] committing the two regimes to oppose the [[Comintern]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[communism]]. By 1938, Mussolini allowed Hitler to carry out Anschluss in exchange for official German renunciation of claims to Tyrol. Mussolini supported the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexation]] of the [[Sudetenland]] during the [[Munich Agreement]] talks later the same year.\n\nIn 1939, the [[Pact of Steel]] was signed, officially creating an alliance of Germany and Italy. The Nazi official newspaper ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' published articles extolling the mutually benefit of the alliance: {{quote|Firmly bound together through the inner unity of their ideologies and the comprehensive solidarity of their interests, the German and the Italian people are determined also in future to stand side by side and to strive with united effort for the securing of their [[Lebensraum]] [living space] and the maintenance of peace.|sign=''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (May 23, 1939)}}\n\nHitler and Mussolini recognized commonalities in their politics and the second part of Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' (\"The National Socialist Movement\", 1926) contains this passage: {{quote|I conceived the profoundest admiration for the great man south of the [[Alps]], who, full of ardent love for his people, made no pacts with the enemies of Italy, but strove for their annihilation by all ways and means. What will rank Mussolini among the great men of this earth is his determination not to share Italy with the [[Marxism|Marxists]], but to destroy [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] and save the [[fatherland]] from it.|sign=''Mein Kampf'' (p. 622)}}\n\nBoth regimes despised [[French Third Republic|France]] (seen as an enemy which held territories claimed by both Germany and Italy) and [[Yugoslavia]] (seen by the Nazis as a racially degenerate Slavic state and holding lands such as [[Dalmatia]] claimed by the Italian fascists). Fascist territorial claims on Yugoslav territory meant that Mussolini saw the destruction of Yugoslavia as essential for Italian expansion. Hitler viewed Slavs as racially inferior, but he did not see importance in an immediate invasion of Yugoslavia, instead focusing on the threat from the Soviet Union.\n\nMussolini favored using the extremist [[Croatian people|Croatian]] nationalist [[Usta\u0161e]] as a useful tool to tear down Yugoslavia, led by the [[Serb]]s and with a Serbian [[dynasty]], the [[House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]]. In 1941, the Italian military campaign in [[Greece]] (the [[Greco-Italian War]], called the [[Battle of Greece]] for the period after the German intervention) was failing. Hitler reluctantly began the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] with the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]]. German, Italian, [[Bulgaria]]n, [[Hungary during World War II|Hungarian]] and Croatian [[Insurgency|insurgents]] (under the Axis [[Puppet state|puppet]] [[Independent State of Croatia]]) decisively defeated Yugoslavia.\n\nIn the aftermath, with the exception of Serbia and [[Vardar Macedonia]], most of Yugoslavia was reshaped based on Italian fascist foreign policy objectives. Mussolini demanded and received much of Dalmatia from the Croats in exchange for supporting the independence of Croatia. Mussolini's policy of creating an independent Croatia prevailed over Hitler's anti-Slavism and eventually, the Nazis and the Ustashe regime of Croatia would develop closer bonds due to the Ustashe's brutal effectiveness at suppressing Serb dissidents.\n\nThe question of religion also poses considerable conflicting differences as some forms of fascism, particularly the [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]] and [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] that were devoutly [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The [[Religious aspects of Nazism|occultist and pagan]] elements of Nazi ideology were very hostile to the traditional Christianity found in the vast majority of fascist movements of the 20th century.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]''\n* [[Falange]]\n* [[Fascism in Africa]]\n* [[Fascism in Asia]]\n* [[Fascism in North America]]\n* [[Fascism in South America]]\n* [[Jingoism]]\n* [[National syndicalism]]\n* [[Radical right (Europe)|Radical right]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Atkins, Stephen E.

[[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.\n\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians<ref>See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ...\" in his ''History of Western Philosophy''</ref> feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science).

But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called \"[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]\".<ref name=wigner1960>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&nbsp;pages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].\n\nFor those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}</ref> Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments has been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.\n\nThe popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n==Notation, language, and rigor==\n{{main|Mathematical notation}}\n[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]] created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.]]\n\nMost of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.<ref>Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].</ref> [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707\u20131783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language.\"</ref> Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"What do I mean by abstractness?

But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after \u2013 the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''.\"</ref> Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition.\"</ref>\n\n[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for \"[[if and only if]]\" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".\n\n[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken \"[[theorem]]s\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!--This part needs improvement |>>-->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 \"A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly\", (in reference to the Haken\u2013Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref> On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the [[Feit\u2013Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}\n\n[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic.<ref>\"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.\" [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, \"Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.\"</ref>\n\n==Fields of mathematics==\n{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}\n[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].\n\n[[Discrete mathematics]] conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.\n\n===Foundations and philosophy===\nIn order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy]].\n\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, G\u00f6del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].\n\n[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model\u2014the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the \"[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]\" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|<math>p \\Rightarrow q </math>|| [[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|128px]] || [[File:Commutative diagram for morphism.svg|96px]] || [[File:DFAexample.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Mathematical logic]] || [[Set theory]] || [[Category theory]] || [[Theory of computation]]\n|}\n\n===Pure mathematics===\n{{main|Pure mathematics}}\n\n====Quantity====\n{{Main|Arithmetic}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.\n\nAs the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s (\"[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of \"[[infinity]]\". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|<math>(0), 1, 2, 3,\\ldots</math> || <math>\\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\,\\ldots</math> || <math> -2, \\frac{2}{3}, 1.21</math> || <math>-e, \\sqrt{2}, 3, \\pi</math> || <math>2, i, -2+3i, 2e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}</math> ||<math>\\aleph_0, \\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\ldots, \\aleph_{\\alpha}, \\ldots.\\ </math>\n|-\n|[[Natural number]]s|| [[Integer]]s || [[Rational number]]s || [[Real number]]s || [[Complex number]]s || [[Infinite cardinal]]s\n|}\n\n====Structure====\n{{Main|Algebra}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nMany mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].\n\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) \\\\ (2,1,3) & (2,3,1) \\\\ (3,1,2) & (3,2,1) \\end{matrix}</math> || [[File:Elliptic curve simple.svg|96px]] || [[File:Rubik's cube.svg|96px]] || [[File:Group diagdram D6.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|96px]] || [[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Combinatorics]] || [[Number theory]] || [[Group theory]] || [[Graph theory]] || [[Order theory]] || [[Algebra]]\n|}\n\n====Space====\n{{Main|Geometry}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nThe study of space originates with [[geometry]]\u2014in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|96px]] || [[File:Sinusv\u00e5g 400px.png|96px]] || [[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Torus.svg|96px]] || [[File:Mandel zoom 07 satellite.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Measure illustration (Vector).svg|70px]]\n|-\n|[[Geometry]] || [[Trigonometry]] || [[Differential geometry]] || [[Topology]] || [[Fractal|Fractal geometry]] || [[Measure theory]]\n|}\n\n====Change====\n{{Main|Calculus}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|-\n|[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|96px]] || [[File:Vector field.svg|96px]] || [[File:Navier Stokes Laminar.svg|96px]] || [[File:Limitcycle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lorenz attractor.svg|96px]] || [[File:Conformal grid after M\u00f6bius transformation.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Calculus]] || [[Vector calculus]]|| [[Differential equation]]s || [[Dynamical system]]s || [[Chaos theory]] || [[Complex analysis]]\n|}\n\n===Applied mathematics===\n{{Main|Applied mathematics}}\n[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[industry]]. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].\n\n====Statistics and other decision sciences====\n{{Main|Statistics}}\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that makes sense\" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];<ref>[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}</ref> the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians \"make sense of the data\" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]\u2014with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}\n\n[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.<ref name=\"RaoOpt\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

[[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:0 auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|-\n|[[File:Arbitrary-gametree-solved.svg|96px]]|| [[File:BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg|96px]] || [[File:Composite trapezoidal rule illustration small.svg|96px]] || [[File:Maximum boxed.png|96px]] || [[File:Two red dice 01.svg|96px]] || [[File:Oldfaithful3.png|96px]] || [[File:Caesar3.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Game theory]] || [[Fluid dynamics]] || [[Numerical analysis]] || [[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]] || [[Probability theory]] || [[Statistics]] || [[Cryptography]]\n|-\n|[[File:Market Data Index NYA on 20050726 202628 UTC.png|96px]] || [[File:Gravitation space source.svg|96px]] || [[File:CH4-structure.svg|96px]] || [[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|96px]] || [[File:GDP PPP Per Capita IMF 2008.svg|96px]] || [[File:Simple feedback control loop2.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Mathematical finance]] || [[Mathematical physics]] || [[Mathematical chemistry]] || [[Mathematical biology]]|| [[Mathematical economics]] || [[Control theory]]\n|}\n\n==Mathematical awards==\nArguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: \"The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics.\"}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778\u201382}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.\n\nA famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called \"[[Hilbert's problems]]\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"[[Millennium Prize Problems]]\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture]], has been solved.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]\n* [[Lists of mathematics topics]]\n* [[Mathematical sciences]]\n* [[Mathematics and art]]\n* [[Mathematics education]]\n* [[National Museum of Mathematics]]\n* [[Philosophy of mathematics]]\n* [[Relationship between mathematics and physics]]\n* [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n|refs=\n<ref name=future>[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]] (April 29, 1988).

[[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.\n\nThe opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians<ref>See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement \"Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ...\" in his ''History of Western Philosophy''</ref> feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science).

For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E.

But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]]. This remarkable fact, that even the \"purest\" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what [[Eugene Wigner]] has called \"[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]\".<ref name=wigner1960>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201314 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |ref=harv |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archivedate=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&nbsp;pages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |date= |accessdate=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].\n\nFor those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}</ref> Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments has been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.\n\nThe popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. And at the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n==Notation, language, and rigor==\n{{main|Mathematical notation}}\n[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]] created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.]]\n\nMost of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archivedate=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.<ref>Kline, p. 140, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].</ref> [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707\u20131783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language.\"</ref> Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c\u2013o\u2013w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after \u2013 the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''.\"</ref> Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.<ref>Oakley 2014, p. 16: \"By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition.\"</ref>\n\n[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for \"[[if and only if]]\" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as \"rigor\".\n\n[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken \"[[theorem]]s\", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!--This part needs improvement |>>-->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 \"A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly\", (in reference to the Haken\u2013Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref> On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of [[Feit\u2013Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}\n\n[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic.<ref>\"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil.\" [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|0-486-61630-4}}. p. 1, \"Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects.\"</ref>\n\n==Fields of mathematics==\n{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}\n[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]\nMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change (i.e. [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]). In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to [[mathematical logic|logic]], to [[set theory]] ([[foundations of mathematics|foundations]]), to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences ([[applied mathematics]]), and more recently to the rigorous study of [[uncertainty]]. While some areas might seem unrelated, the [[Langlands program]] has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as [[Galois groups]], [[Riemann surface]]s and [[number theory]].\n\n[[Discrete mathematics]] conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.\n\n===Foundations and philosophy===\nIn order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer\u2013Hilbert controversy]].\n\nMathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, G\u00f6del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].\n\n[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model\u2014the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the \"[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]\" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|<math>p \\Rightarrow q </math>|| [[File:Venn A intersect B.svg|128px]] || [[File:Commutative diagram for morphism.svg|96px]] || [[File:DFAexample.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Mathematical logic]] || [[Set theory]] || [[Category theory]] || [[Theory of computation]]\n|}\n\n===Pure mathematics===\n{{main|Pure mathematics}}\n\n====Quantity====\n{{Main|Arithmetic}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nThe study of quantity starts with numbers, first the familiar [[natural number]]s and [[integer]]s (\"whole numbers\") and arithmetical operations on them, which are characterized in [[arithmetic]]. The deeper properties of integers are studied in [[number theory]], from which come such popular results as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. The [[twin prime]] conjecture and [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are two unsolved problems in number theory.\n\nAs the number system is further developed, the integers are recognized as a [[subset]] of the [[rational number]]s (\"[[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\"). These, in turn, are contained within the [[real number]]s, which are used to represent [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. Real numbers are generalized to [[complex number]]s. These are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s. Consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the [[transfinite number]]s, which formalize the concept of \"[[infinity]]\". According to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] all solutions of equations in one unknown with complex coefficients are complex numbers, regardless of degree. Another area of study is the size of sets, which is described with the [[cardinal number]]s. These include the [[aleph number]]s, which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|<math>(0), 1, 2, 3,\\ldots</math> || <math>\\ldots,-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\,\\ldots</math> || <math> -2, \\frac{2}{3}, 1.21</math> || <math>-e, \\sqrt{2}, 3, \\pi</math> || <math>2, i, -2+3i, 2e^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}</math> ||<math>\\aleph_0, \\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\ldots, \\aleph_{\\alpha}, \\ldots.\\ </math>\n|-\n|[[Natural number]]s|| [[Integer]]s || [[Rational number]]s || [[Real number]]s || [[Complex number]]s || [[Infinite cardinal]]s\n|}\n\n====Structure====\n{{Main|Algebra}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nMany mathematical objects, such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].\n\nBy its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|<math>\\begin{matrix} (1,2,3) & (1,3,2) \\\\ (2,1,3) & (2,3,1) \\\\ (3,1,2) & (3,2,1) \\end{matrix}</math> || [[File:Elliptic curve simple.svg|96px]] || [[File:Rubik's cube.svg|96px]] || [[File:Group diagdram D6.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lattice of the divisibility of 60.svg|96px]] || [[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Combinatorics]] || [[Number theory]] || [[Group theory]] || [[Graph theory]] || [[Order theory]] || [[Algebra]]\n|}\n\n====Space====\n{{Main|Geometry}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nThe study of space originates with [[geometry]]\u2014in particular, [[Euclidean geometry]], which combines space and numbers, and encompasses the well-known [[Pythagorean theorem]]. [[Trigonometry]] is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions. The modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher-dimensional geometry, [[non-Euclidean geometries]] (which play a central role in [[general relativity]]) and [[topology]]. Quantity and space both play a role in [[analytic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. [[Convex geometry|Convex]] and [[discrete geometry]] were developed to solve problems in [[geometry of numbers|number theory]] and [[functional analysis]] but now are pursued with an eye on applications in [[convex optimization|optimization]] and [[computational geometry|computer science]]. Within differential geometry are the concepts of [[fiber bundles]] and calculus on [[manifold]]s, in particular, [[vector calculus|vector]] and [[tensor calculus]]. Within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of [[polynomial]] equations, combining the concepts of quantity and space, and also the study of [[topological groups]], which combine structure and space. [[Lie group]]s are used to study space, structure, and change. [[Topology]] in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in 20th-century mathematics; it includes [[point-set topology]], [[set-theoretic topology]], [[algebraic topology]] and [[differential topology]]. In particular, instances of modern-day topology are [[metrizability theory]], [[axiomatic set theory]], [[homotopy theory]], and [[Morse theory]]. Topology also includes the now solved [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]], and the still unsolved areas of the [[Hodge conjecture]]. Other results in geometry and topology, including the [[four color theorem]] and [[Kepler conjecture]], have been proved only with the help of computers.\n\n:{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"15\"\n|[[File:Illustration to Euclid's proof of the Pythagorean theorem.svg|96px]] || [[File:Sinusv\u00e5g 400px.png|96px]] || [[File:Hyperbolic triangle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Torus.svg|96px]] || [[File:Mandel zoom 07 satellite.jpg|96px]] || [[File:Measure illustration (Vector).svg|70px]]\n|-\n|[[Geometry]] || [[Trigonometry]] || [[Differential geometry]] || [[Topology]] || [[Fractal|Fractal geometry]] || [[Measure theory]]\n|}\n\n====Change====\n{{Main|Calculus}}\n<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->\nUnderstanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here, as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|-\n|[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|96px]] || [[File:Vector field.svg|96px]] || [[File:Navier Stokes Laminar.svg|96px]] || [[File:Limitcycle.svg|96px]] || [[File:Lorenz attractor.svg|96px]] || [[File:Conformal grid after M\u00f6bius transformation.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Calculus]] || [[Vector calculus]]|| [[Differential equation]]s || [[Dynamical system]]s || [[Chaos theory]] || [[Complex analysis]]\n|}\n\n===Applied mathematics===\n{{Main|Applied mathematics}}\n[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[industry]]. Thus, \"applied mathematics\" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the \"formulation, study, and use of mathematical models\" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.\n\nIn the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].\n\n====Statistics and other decision sciences====\n{{Main|Statistics}}\nApplied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) \"create data that makes sense\" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];<ref>[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|981-02-3111-3}}</ref> the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data be available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians \"make sense of the data\" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]\u2014with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}\n\n[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.<ref name=\"RaoOpt\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |authorlink=C.R.

[[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].\n\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #ddd; text-align:center; margin:0 auto\" cellspacing=\"20\"\n|-\n|[[File:Arbitrary-gametree-solved.svg|96px]]|| [[File:BernoullisLawDerivationDiagram.svg|96px]] || [[File:Composite trapezoidal rule illustration small.svg|96px]] || [[File:Maximum boxed.png|96px]] || [[File:Two red dice 01.svg|96px]] || [[File:Oldfaithful3.png|96px]] || [[File:Caesar3.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Game theory]] || [[Fluid dynamics]] || [[Numerical analysis]] || [[Mathematical optimization|Optimization]] || [[Probability theory]] || [[Statistics]] || [[Cryptography]]\n|-\n|[[File:Market Data Index NYA on 20050726 202628 UTC.png|96px]] || [[File:Gravitation space source.svg|96px]] || [[File:CH4-structure.svg|96px]] || [[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|96px]] || [[File:GDP PPP Per Capita IMF 2008.svg|96px]] || [[File:Simple feedback control loop2.svg|96px]]\n|-\n|[[Mathematical finance]] || [[Mathematical physics]] || [[Mathematical chemistry]] || [[Mathematical biology]]|| [[Mathematical economics]] || [[Control theory]]\n|}\n\n==Mathematical awards==\nArguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: \"The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics.\"}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778\u201382}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.\n\nA famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called \"[[Hilbert's problems]]\", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the \"[[Millennium Prize Problems]]\", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture]], has been solved.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[International Mathematical Olympiad]]\n* [[Lists of mathematics topics]]\n* [[Mathematical sciences]]\n* [[Mathematics and art]]\n* [[Mathematics education]]\n* [[National Museum of Mathematics]]\n* [[Philosophy of mathematics]]\n* [[Relationship between mathematics and physics]]\n* [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n|refs=\n<ref name=future>[[Lynn Steen|Steen, L.A.]] (April 29, 1988).

with death by hanging or up to 25 years in prison. However, only once case of marital rape has been reported in Pakistan despite it being a common problem. A woman in Lahore filed a marital rape complaint against her husband in 2007. The husband expressed deep remorse, confessed to his crime, and sought forgiveness from his wife saying that he was pressurized by the wife's mother to try and consummate their marriage as they had been married for three months, and he feared being labelled impotent. The wife initially turned down husband's pleas saying that being a highly educated man he should have known better, and sought maximum penalty under the law. However, the couple later agreed to a settlement in which the husband was given a punishment of 200 lashes with the whip and ordered to pay a fine of Rs 1 million to his wife. Wife attended the flogging and participated in whipping him before forgiving his crime and accepting him back. The case highlights several problems in Pakistani society. Firstly, the role of cultural pressures and expectations from a woman in marriage, with wife's own mother encouraging the husband to try and consummate the marriage against wife's will. Secondly, justice is only available to educated and resourceful Pakistani women with a higher social status than the husband, with access to female police willing to swiftly arrest the culprit. Finally, a combination of corporal punishment and fine is an appropriate sentence rather than a long jail sentence, as a wife may be financially dependent on the husband, and the husband may learn his lesson, in particular, if the act was committed under societal pressure to consummate the marriage.\n\n===Child sexual abuse===\n[[Child sexual abuse]] is widespread in Pakistani [[Madrasa|Islamic schools]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Gannon |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-probe-sex-abuse-pervasive-070436794.html |title=Sexual abuse is pervasive in Islamic schools in Pakistan |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> In a study of child sexual abuse in [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Islamabad]], out of a sample of 300 children 17% claimed to have been abused and in 1997 one child a day was reported as raped, gang raped or kidnapped for sexual gratification.<ref name=\"Rasheed\" /> In September 2014, the British [[Channel 4]] broadcast a [[documentary]] called ''Pakistan's Hidden Shame'', directed by [[Mohammed Ali Naqvi|Mohammed Naqvi]] and produced by [[Jamie Doran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/pakistans-hidden-shame/4od |title=Pakistan's Hidden Shame|publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Coilin |last=O'Connor |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/pakistan--hidden-shame-sex-abuse-peshawar/26574900.html |title=New Film Lays Bare 'Pakistan's Hidden Shame' |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |date=9 September 2014 }}</ref> which highlighted the problem of sexual abuse of street children in particular, an estimated 90 percent of whom have been sexually abused.\n\nThe NGO Sahil reported 3,832 cases of child abuse in 2018 which is an 11 per cent increase from 2017 (3,445 cases).

with death by hanging or up to 25 years in prison. However, only once case of marital rape has been reported in Pakistan despite it being a common problem. A woman in Lahore filed a marital rape complaint against her husband in 2007. The husband expressed deep remorse, confessed to his crime, and sought forgiveness from his wife saying that he was pressurized by the wife's mother to try and consummate their marriage as they had been married for three months, and he feared being labelled impotent. The wife initially turned down husband's pleas saying that being a highly educated man he should have known better, and sought maximum penalty under the law. However, the couple later agreed to a settlement in which the husband was given a punishment of 200 lashes with the whip and ordered to pay a fine of Rs 1 million to his wife. Wife attended the flogging and participated in whipping him before forgiving his crime and accepting him back. The case highlights several problems in Pakistani society. Firstly, the role of cultural pressures and expectations from a woman in marriage, with wife's own mother encouraging the husband to try and consummate the marriage against wife's will. Secondly, justice is only available to educated and resourceful Pakistani women with a higher social status than the husband, with access to female police willing to swiftly arrest the culprit. Finally, a combination of corporal punishment and fine is an appropriate sentence rather than a long jail sentence, as a wife may be financially dependent on the husband, and the husband may learn his lesson, in particular, if the act was committed under societal pressure to consummate the marriage. So, if the victim agrees, a whipping, with victim attending and participating in the flogging, and a hefty fine is suitable in the Pakistani context. Of course, if the wife does not agree, then an annulment of marriage, mandatory flogging with the victim's attendance and participation, heavy fine and a long jail sentence/hanging would be appropriate as a strong deterrent. Regardless of the mitigating circumstances, a repeat marital rapist should be severely whipped, then hanged.\n\n===Child sexual abuse===\n[[Child sexual abuse]] is widespread in Pakistani [[Madrasa|Islamic schools]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Gannon |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-probe-sex-abuse-pervasive-070436794.html |title=Sexual abuse is pervasive in Islamic schools in Pakistan |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> In a study of child sexual abuse in [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Islamabad]], out of a sample of 300 children 17% claimed to have been abused and in 1997 one child a day was reported as raped, gang raped or kidnapped for sexual gratification.<ref name=\"Rasheed\" /> In September 2014, the British [[Channel 4]] broadcast a [[documentary]] called ''Pakistan's Hidden Shame'', directed by [[Mohammed Ali Naqvi|Mohammed Naqvi]] and produced by [[Jamie Doran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/pakistans-hidden-shame/4od |title=Pakistan's Hidden Shame|publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Coilin |last=O'Connor |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/pakistan--hidden-shame-sex-abuse-peshawar/26574900.html |title=New Film Lays Bare 'Pakistan's Hidden Shame' |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |date=9 September 2014 }}</ref> which highlighted the problem of sexual abuse of street children in particular, an estimated 90 percent of whom have been sexually abused.\n\nThe NGO Sahil reported 3,832 cases of child abuse in 2018 which is an 11 per cent increase from 2017 (3,445 cases).

The pulp from ripe mangoes is also used to make jam called ''mangada''.'' Andhra [[aavakaaya]]'' is a pickle made from raw, unripe, pulpy, and sour mango, mixed with chili powder, [[fenugreek]] seeds, [[mustard powder]], salt, and [[groundnut oil]]. Mango is also used in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to make ''dahl'' preparations. [[Gujarat]]is use mango to make ''chunda'' (a spicy, grated mango delicacy).\n\nMangoes are used to make ''[[murabba]]'' (fruit preserves), ''muramba'' (a sweet, grated mango delicacy), ''amchur'' (dried and powdered unripe mango), and pickles, including a spicy mustard-oil pickle and alcohol. Ripe mangoes are often cut into thin layers, [[desiccate]]d, folded, and then cut. These bars are similar to dried [[guava]] fruit bars available in some countries. The fruit is also added to cereal products such as [[muesli]] and oat [[granola]]. Mangoes are often prepared charred in Hawaii.\n\nUnripe mango may be eaten with ''[[bagoong]]'' (especially in the [[Philippines]]), [[fish sauce]], vinegar, soy sauce, or with dash of salt (plain or spicy). Dried strips of sweet, ripe mango (sometimes combined with seedless [[tamarind]] to form ''mangorind'') are also popular. Mangoes may be used to make juices, mango [[nectar (drink)|nectar]], and as a flavoring and major ingredient in ice cream and ''[[sorbetes]]''.\n\nMango is used to make [[juices]], [[smoothie]]s, [[ice cream]], fruit bars, ''[[raspado]]s'', ''[[aguas frescas]]'', [[pie]]s, and sweet [[chili sauce]], or mixed with ''[[chamoy]]'', a sweet and spicy chili paste. It is popular on a stick dipped in hot chili powder and salt or as a main ingredient in fresh fruit combinations. In Central America, mango is either eaten green mixed with salt, [[vinegar]], [[black pepper]], and hot sauce, or ripe in various forms.\n\nPieces of mango can be mashed and used as a topping on ice cream or blended with milk and ice as [[milkshake]]s. Sweet glutinous rice is flavored with [[coconut]], then served with sliced mango as a dessert. In other parts of Southeast Asia, mangoes are pickled with [[fish sauce]] and [[rice vinegar]].

The pulp from ripe mangoes is also used to make jam called ''mangada''.'' Andhra [[aavakaaya]]'' is a pickle made from raw, unripe, pulpy, and sour mango, mixed with chili powder, [[fenugreek]] seeds, [[mustard powder]], salt, and [[groundnut oil]]. Mango is also used in [[Andhra Pradesh]] to make ''dahl'' preparations.

The fruit is also added to cereal products such as [[muesli]] and oat [[granola]]. Mangoes are often prepared charred in Hawaii.\n\nUnripe mango may be eaten with ''[[bagoong]]'' (especially in the [[Philippines]]), [[fish sauce]], vinegar, soy sauce, or with dash of salt (plain or spicy). Dried strips of sweet, ripe mango (sometimes combined with seedless [[tamarind]] to form ''mangorind'') are also popular. Mangoes may be used to make juices, mango [[nectar (drink)|nectar]], and as a flavoring and major ingredient in ice cream and ''[[sorbetes]]''.\n\nMango is used to make [[juices]], [[smoothie]]s, [[ice cream]], fruit bars, ''[[raspado]]s'', ''[[aguas frescas]]'', [[pie]]s, and sweet [[chili sauce]], or mixed with ''[[chamoy]]'', a sweet and spicy chili paste. It is popular on a stick dipped in hot chili powder and salt or as a main ingredient in fresh fruit combinations. In Central America, mango is either eaten green mixed with salt, [[vinegar]], [[black pepper]], and hot sauce, or ripe in various forms.\n\nPieces of mango can be mashed and used as a topping on ice cream or blended with milk and ice as [[milkshake]]s. Sweet glutinous rice is flavored with [[coconut]], then served with sliced mango as a dessert. In other parts of Southeast Asia, mangoes are pickled with [[fish sauce]] and [[rice vinegar]].
