The [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|thrower]] was not selected in the [[2007 NFL Draft]], but was signed by the [[New Orleans Saints]] as an [[undrafted free agent]]. After spending most of the 2007 season on the Saints practice squad and occasionally the active roster, Palko was waived and did not play in a game in 2008. He joined the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on a future contract in December 2008, but was waived again in September 2009. Palko then joined the [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] before receiving a release to sign with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in November 2009. He signed a future contract with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in 2010, but spent most of his time on the team's practice squad before joining the active roster near the end of the season. After entering the 2011 season as the backup to [[Matt Cassel]], Palko was elevated to starting quarterback after Cassel broke his hand.\n\n==Early years==\nPalko graduated from [[West Allegheny School District|West Allegheny High School]] in [[North Fayette, Pennsylvania]], where he was named [[Associated Press]] 2001 Pennsylvania Big School Player of the Year. He also sucked some dudes  weiner at West Allegheny in the bathrooms too. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/players/draft/418202|title=CBS Sportsline Tyler Palko profile|publisher=}}</ref> He was also a member of the ''USA Today'' All-America Team (Second-team) and three-time ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' WPIAL Class AAA Player of the Year. Palko led his West Allegheny Indians to a PIAA state title in 2001 for AAA in Pennsylvania.  At West Allegheny he played under his father, Bob Palko, earning four letters in football; additionally, he earned three letters in basketball and one in track and field.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In his high school senior year, he was named 2002 YMCA Tribune-Review Scholar-Athlete honoree.<ref name=\"pittsburghpanthers1\">{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=2080|title=Tyler Palko - Football|website=Pitt Panthers #H2P}}</ref> In 2002, Palko was selected to play in the [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]],<ref>[http://www.usarmyallamericanbowl.com/playersalumni.php U.S. Army All-American Bowl Player Alumni List] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216010904/http://usarmyallamericanbowl.com/playersalumni.php |date=2010-12-16 }}</ref> an all-star game for high school athletes.\n\n==College career==\nPalko played at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where his career began in [[2002 in sports|2002]] as a lettered true freshman. He completed 2-3 passes for 13 yards on the season, and rushed for an eight-yard touchdown late in Pitt's [[Insight Bowl]] victory over [[Oregon State]].\n\nPalko was [[redshirted]] the following season in 2003. As a redshirt-sophomore in 2004, Palko threw for 3,067 yards and 24 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions, earning him second-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] honors. He was also named Pitt's [[MVP]] and offensive captain as a first-year starter. Palko's 24 touchdowns led the Big East and were the third-highest single-season total in Pitt history, and his total passing yardage was the most ever for a sophomore and third-best overall in school history as well. Palko also had four 300-yard passing games and one 400-yard passing game during this season alone. In a game against the [[University of South Florida]], Palko threw for a career-high 411 yards, the fifth-highest in school history, and matched a personal best of five touchdowns with no interceptions. Palko threw another five touchdown passes and totaled 334 yards in the air with no interceptions against [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], becoming the first quarterback to throw for five touchdowns in a single game as a visiting team player against the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]]. Late in the fourth quarter against Notre Dame, the Panthers went on two late scoring drives: one for a touchdown and the second for a game-winning field goal with one second left to play. Palko also led three consecutive scoring drives against [[Temple University|Temple]] to overcome a 10-point fourth quarter deficit. They also surprised the [[West Virginia Mountaineers]] in the [[Backyard Brawl]] after being down 13-9 in the fourth quarter.  Palko led a drive that consisted of four third-down conversions, ending with his two-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh earned a bid to play in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] against the [[Utah Utes football|Utah Utes]], where Palko was sacked nine times in a 35-7 loss.\n\nAfter replacing Walt Harris as head coach in the spring of 2005, [[Dave Wannstedt]] chose Palko over [[Joe Flacco]] as the starting quarterback during Pitt's spring training. Flacco was left to run Pitt's second team and eventually transferred to Division I-AA [[University of Delaware]]. Flacco became the starting quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens in 2008, a year after Palko had been signed and subsequently waived by the Saints.<ref>{{cite web|last=Babb |first=Kent |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/11/14/3266837/palko-has-been-waiting-for-this.html |title=Palko has been waiting for this moment |publisher=KansasCity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref>\n\nAs a junior in [[2005 in sports|2005]], Palko earned second-team Big East honors for a second consecutive season and was also named Pitt's captain for the second year in a row. Palko's passing statistics were not as outstanding as the previous year's, with 2,392 yards and 17 touchdowns with nine interceptions. However, his six rushing touchdowns were a career-high and a team high for the season, and Palko was Pitt's third leading scorer with 36 points. Palko's 371 yards and four passing touchdowns against [[Rutgers University]] were season highs in 2005, while his 35 completions out of 58 attempts were both career highs. Against [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]], he threw for 308 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in a loss. Palko also threw for 198 yards and a touchdown against a strong opponent in the [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]]. In the season-opener against [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], Palko threw for 220 yards with one touchdown and one interception while rushing for a four-yard score as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn his final season as a Panther in 2006, Palko threw for 2,871 yards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2006-2007/teamcume.html#TEAM.IND|title=2006\u20132007 Panther's stats|publisher=}}</ref>  (less than his 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2004-2005/teamcume.html#TEAM.IND|title=2004\u20132005 Panther's stats|publisher=}}</ref> and 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2005-2006/teamcume.html#TEAM.IND|title=2005\u20132006 Panther's stats|publisher=}}</ref> totals), but set a new career high with 25 touchdowns; he only rushed for 77 yards and two scores on the season.

Later in the season against [[West Virginia]], Palko threw for a season high 341 yards along with two touchdowns in a 45-27 loss. In the season finale against [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]], Palko threw for 307 yards and a touchdown, but was picked off three times as well.

Palko's career totals of 8,343 passing yards with 66 touchdown passes rank him as one of the top three passers in Panther football history.\n\nPalko graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2007 with a bachelor's degree in Communications and Rhetoric.<ref name=\"pittsburghpanthers1\"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/pitt-football/palko-put-the-pass-in-passion-for-pitt-460726/ | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Paul | last=Zeise | title=Palko put the pass in passion for Pitt | date=November 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; border-color:#fff #fff #aaa #fff\" | &#160;\n! rowspan=99 style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; border-color:#fff #aaa\" | &#160;\n! colspan=8 | Passing\n! rowspan=99 style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; border-color:#fff #aaa\" | &#160;\n! colspan=3 | Rushing\n|-\n!

The [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|thrower]] was not selected in the [[2007 NFL Draft]], but was signed by the [[New Orleans Saints]] as an [[undrafted free agent]]. After spending most of the 2007 season on the Saints practice squad and occasionally the active roster, Palko was waived and did not play in a game in 2008. He joined the [[Arizona Cardinals]] on a future contract in December 2008, but was waived again in September 2009. Palko then joined the [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] before receiving a release to sign with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in November 2009. He signed a future contract with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] in 2010, but spent most of his time on the team's practice squad before joining the active roster near the end of the season. After entering the 2011 season as the backup to [[Matt Cassel]], Palko was elevated to starting quarterback after Cassel broke his hand.\n\n==Early years==\nPalko graduated from [[West Allegheny School District|West Allegheny High School]] in [[North Fayette, Pennsylvania]], where he was named [[Associated Press]] 2001 Pennsylvania Big School Player of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/players/draft/418202|title=CBS Sportsline Tyler Palko profile|publisher=}}</ref> He was also a member of the ''USA Today'' All-America Team (Second-team) and three-time ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' WPIAL Class AAA Player of the Year. Palko led his West Allegheny Indians to a PIAA state title in 2001 for AAA in Pennsylvania.  At West Allegheny he played under his father, Bob Palko, earning four letters in football; additionally, he earned three letters in basketball and one in track and field.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} In his high school senior year, he was named 2002 YMCA Tribune-Review Scholar-Athlete honoree.<ref name=\"pittsburghpanthers1\">{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=2080|title=Tyler Palko - Football|website=Pitt Panthers #H2P}}</ref> In 2002, Palko was selected to play in the [[U.S. Army All-American Bowl]],<ref>[http://www.usarmyallamericanbowl.com/playersalumni.php U.S. Army All-American Bowl Player Alumni List] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216010904/http://usarmyallamericanbowl.com/playersalumni.php |date=2010-12-16 }}</ref> an all-star game for high school athletes.\n\n==College career==\nPalko played at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], where his career began in [[2002 in sports|2002]] as a lettered true freshman. He completed 2-3 passes for 13 yards on the season, and rushed for an eight-yard touchdown late in Pitt's [[Insight Bowl]] victory over [[Oregon State]].\n\nPalko was [[redshirted]] the following season in 2003. As a redshirt-sophomore in 2004, Palko threw for 3,067 yards and 24 touchdowns, with only seven interceptions, earning him second-team All-[[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] honors. He was also named Pitt's [[MVP]] and offensive captain as a first-year starter. Palko's 24 touchdowns led the Big East and were the third-highest single-season total in Pitt history, and his total passing yardage was the most ever for a sophomore and third-best overall in school history as well. Palko also had four 300-yard passing games and one 400-yard passing game during this season alone. In a game against the [[University of South Florida]], Palko threw for a career-high 411 yards, the fifth-highest in school history, and matched a personal best of five touchdowns with no interceptions. Palko threw another five touchdown passes and totaled 334 yards in the air with no interceptions against [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], becoming the first quarterback to throw for five touchdowns in a single game as a visiting team player against the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Fighting Irish]]. Late in the fourth quarter against Notre Dame, the Panthers went on two late scoring drives: one for a touchdown and the second for a game-winning field goal with one second left to play. Palko also led three consecutive scoring drives against [[Temple University|Temple]] to overcome a 10-point fourth quarter deficit. They also surprised the [[West Virginia Mountaineers]] in the [[Backyard Brawl]] after being down 13-9 in the fourth quarter.  Palko led a drive that consisted of four third-down conversions, ending with his two-yard touchdown run. Pittsburgh earned a bid to play in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] against the [[Utah Utes football|Utah Utes]], where Palko was sacked nine times in a 35-7 loss.\n\nAfter replacing Walt Harris as head coach in the spring of 2005, [[Dave Wannstedt]] chose Palko over [[Joe Flacco]] as the starting quarterback during Pitt's spring training. Flacco was left to run Pitt's second team and eventually transferred to Division I-AA [[University of Delaware]]. Flacco became the starting quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens in 2008, a year after Palko had been signed and subsequently waived by the Saints.<ref>{{cite web|last=Babb |first=Kent |url=http://www.kansascity.com/2011/11/14/3266837/palko-has-been-waiting-for-this.html |title=Palko has been waiting for this moment |publisher=KansasCity.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-05}}</ref>\n\nAs a junior in [[2005 in sports|2005]], Palko earned second-team Big East honors for a second consecutive season and was also named Pitt's captain for the second year in a row. Palko's passing statistics were not as outstanding as the previous year's, with 2,392 yards and 17 touchdowns with nine interceptions. However, his six rushing touchdowns were a career-high and a team high for the season, and Palko was Pitt's third leading scorer with 36 points. Palko's 371 yards and four passing touchdowns against [[Rutgers University]] were season highs in 2005, while his 35 completions out of 58 attempts were both career highs. Against [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]], he threw for 308 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in a loss. Palko also threw for 198 yards and a touchdown against a strong opponent in the [[Louisville Cardinals football|University of Louisville]]. In the season-opener against [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], Palko threw for 220 yards with one touchdown and one interception while rushing for a four-yard score as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nIn his final season as a Panther in 2006, Palko threw for 2,871 yards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2006-2007/teamcume.html#TEAM.IND|title=2006\u20132007 Panther's stats|publisher=}}</ref>  (less than his 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2004-2005/teamcume.html#TEAM.IND|title=2004\u20132005 Panther's stats|publisher=}}</ref> and 2005<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghpanthers.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2005-2006/teamcume.html#TEAM.IND|title=2005\u20132006 Panther's stats|publisher=}}</ref> totals), but set a new career high with 25 touchdowns; he only rushed for 77 yards and two scores on the season.

Later in the season against [[West Virginia]], Palko threw for a season high 341 yards along with two touchdowns in a 45-27 loss. In the season finale against [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]], Palko threw for 307 yards and a touchdown, but was picked off three times as well.

Palko's career totals of 8,343 passing yards with 66 touchdown passes rank him as one of the top three passers in Panther football history.\n\nPalko graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 2007 with a bachelor's degree in Communications and Rhetoric.<ref name=\"pittsburghpanthers1\"/><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/pitt-football/palko-put-the-pass-in-passion-for-pitt-460726/ | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=Paul | last=Zeise | title=Palko put the pass in passion for Pitt | date=November 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; border-color:#fff #fff #aaa #fff\" | &#160;\n! rowspan=99 style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; border-color:#fff #aaa\" | &#160;\n! colspan=8 | Passing\n! rowspan=99 style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff; border-color:#fff #aaa\" | &#160;\n! colspan=3 | Rushing\n|-\n!

When the incident light in the experiment strikes the surface, localized surface plasmons are excited. The field enhancement is greatest when the [[plasmon]] frequency, \u03c9<sub>p</sub>, is in resonance with the radiation (<math>\\omega = \\omega_p/\\sqrt 3</math> for spherical particles). In order for scattering to occur, the plasmon oscillations must be perpendicular to the surface; if they are in-plane with the surface, no scattering will occur. It is because of this requirement that roughened surfaces or arrangements of [[nanoparticle]]s are typically employed in SERS experiments as these surfaces provide an area on which these localized collective [[oscillation]]s can occur.<ref name=\"Smith2005\">Smith, E.; Dent, G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpVcyQr_1DAC&printsec=frontcover Modern Raman Spectroscopy: A Practical Approach].

The dipolar term contributes to the plasmon oscillations, which leads to the enhancement.  The SERS effect is so pronounced because the field enhancement occurs twice. First, the field enhancement magnifies the intensity of incident light, which will excite the Raman [[normal mode|modes]] of the molecule being studied, therefore increasing the signal of the Raman scattering. The Raman signal is then further magnified by the surface due to the same mechanism that excited the incident light, resulting in a greater increase in the total output. At each stage the electric field is enhanced as E<sup>2</sup>, for a total enhancement of E<sup>4</sup>.<ref name=\"Moskovits\">Moskovits, M., [https://books.google.com/books?id=5xlTw9WCUwEC&printsec=frontcover Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy: a Brief Perspective].

For those frequencies for which the Raman signal is only slightly shifted from the incident light, both the incident [[laser]] light and the Raman signal can be near resonance with the plasmon frequency, leading to the E<sup>4</sup> enhancement. When the frequency shift is large, the incident light and the Raman signal cannot both be on resonance with \u03c9<sub>p</sub>, thus the enhancement at both stages cannot be maximal.<ref name=\"Campion, A. 1998\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/A827241Z|title=Surface-enhanced Raman scattering|date=1998|last1=Campion|first1=Alan|last2=Kambhampati|first2=Patanjali|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=27|issue=4|pages=241 |citeseerx=<!-- 10.1.1.531.9985-->}}</ref>\n\nThe choice of surface metal is also dictated by the plasmon resonance frequency.

Specific [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNP) can be identified using this technique. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating on the dye-labeled regions of DNA or RNA, allowing SERS to be performed. This has several potential applications: For example, Cao et al. report that gene sequences for HIV, Ebola, Hepatitis, and Bacillus Anthracis can be uniquely identified using this technique. Each spectrum was specific, which is advantageous over fluorescence detection; some fluorescent markers overlap and interfere with other gene markers. The advantage of this technique to identify gene sequences is that several Raman dyes are commercially available, which could lead to the development of non-overlapping probes for gene detection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.297.5586.1536|title=Nanoparticles with Raman Spectroscopic Fingerprints for DNA and RNA Detection|date=2002|last1=Cao|first1=Y.

While the spectra of most SERS experiments are similar to the non-surface enhanced spectra, there are often differences in the number of modes present. Additional modes not found in the traditional Raman spectrum can be present in the SERS spectrum, while other modes can disappear. The modes observed in any spectroscopic experiment are dictated by the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the molecules and are usually summarized by [[Selection rule]]s. When molecules are adsorbed to a surface, the symmetry of the system can change, slightly modifying the symmetry of the molecule, which can lead to differences in mode selection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150667a013|title=Surface selection rules for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy: calculations and application to the surface-enhanced Raman spectrum of phthalazine on silver|date=1984|last1=Moskovits|first1=M.|last2=Suh|first2=J. S.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|issue=23|pages=5526\u20135530}}</ref>\n\nOne common way in which selection rules are modified arises from the fact that many molecules that have a [[center of symmetry]] lose that feature when adsorbed to a surface. The loss of a center of symmetry eliminates the requirements of the [[Rule of mutual exclusion|mutual exclusion rule]], which dictates that modes can only be either Raman or infrared active. Thus modes that would normally appear only in the [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrum]] of the free molecule can appear in the SERS spectrum.<ref name=\"Smith2005\"/>\n\nA molecule's symmetry can be changed in different ways depending on the orientation in which the molecule is attached to the surface. In some experiments, it is possible to determine the orientation of adsorption to the surface from the SERS spectrum, as different modes will be present depending on how the symmetry is modified.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(03)00215-8|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~agbrolo/JECau111bipy.pdf|title=The orientation of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine adsorbed at a SERS-active Au(111) electrode surface|date=2003|last1=Brolo|first1=A.G.|last2=Jiang|first2=Z.|last3=Irish|first3=D.E.|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=547|issue=2|pages=163\u2013172 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Raman spectroscopy}}\n\n[[Category:Surface science]]\n[[Category:Raman scattering]]\n[[Category:Raman spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Plasmonics]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:sers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Raman spectrum of liquid 2-mercaptoethanol (below) and SERS spectrum of 2-mercaptoethanol monolayer formed on roughened silver (above).

When the incident light in the experiment strikes the surface, localized surface plasmons are excited. The field enhancement is greatest when the [[plasmon]] frequency, \u03c9<sub>p</sub>, is in resonance with the radiation (<math>\\omega = \\omega_p/\\sqrt 3</math> for spherical particles). In order for scattering to occur, the plasmon oscillations must be perpendicular to the surface; if they are in-plane with the surface, no scattering will occur. It is because of this requirement that roughened surfaces or arrangements of [[nanoparticle]]s are typically employed in SERS experiments as these surfaces provide an area on which these localized collective [[oscillation]]s can occur.<ref name=\"Smith2005\">Smith, E.; Dent, G., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IpVcyQr_1DAC&printsec=frontcover Modern Raman Spectroscopy: A Practical Approach].

The dipolar term contributes to the plasmon oscillations, which leads to the enhancement.  The SERS effect is so pronounced because the field enhancement occurs twice. First, the field enhancement magnifies the intensity of incident light, which will excite the Raman [[normal mode|modes]] of the molecule being studied, therefore increasing the signal of the Raman scattering. The Raman signal is then further magnified by the surface due to the same mechanism that excited the incident light, resulting in a greater increase in the total output.

Specific [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNP) can be identified using this technique. The gold nanoparticles facilitate the formation of a silver coating on the dye-labeled regions of DNA or RNA, allowing SERS to be performed. This has several potential applications: For example, Cao et al. report that gene sequences for HIV, Ebola, Hepatitis, and Bacillus Anthracis can be uniquely identified using this technique. Each spectrum was specific, which is advantageous over fluorescence detection; some fluorescent markers overlap and interfere with other gene markers. The advantage of this technique to identify gene sequences is that several Raman dyes are commercially available, which could lead to the development of non-overlapping probes for gene detection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.297.5586.1536|title=Nanoparticles with Raman Spectroscopic Fingerprints for DNA and RNA Detection|date=2002|last1=Cao|first1=Y.

While the spectra of most SERS experiments are similar to the non-surface enhanced spectra, there are often differences in the number of modes present. Additional modes not found in the traditional Raman spectrum can be present in the SERS spectrum, while other modes can disappear. The modes observed in any spectroscopic experiment are dictated by the [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the molecules and are usually summarized by [[Selection rule]]s. When molecules are adsorbed to a surface, the symmetry of the system can change, slightly modifying the symmetry of the molecule, which can lead to differences in mode selection.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150667a013|title=Surface selection rules for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy: calculations and application to the surface-enhanced Raman spectrum of phthalazine on silver|date=1984|last1=Moskovits|first1=M.|last2=Suh|first2=J.

The loss of a center of symmetry eliminates the requirements of the [[Rule of mutual exclusion|mutual exclusion rule]], which dictates that modes can only be either Raman or infrared active. Thus modes that would normally appear only in the [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrum]] of the free molecule can appear in the SERS spectrum.<ref name=\"Smith2005\"/>\n\nA molecule's symmetry can be changed in different ways depending on the orientation in which the molecule is attached to the surface. In some experiments, it is possible to determine the orientation of adsorption to the surface from the SERS spectrum, as different modes will be present depending on how the symmetry is modified.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0022-0728(03)00215-8|url=http://web.uvic.ca/~agbrolo/JECau111bipy.pdf|title=The orientation of 2,2\u2032-bipyridine adsorbed at a SERS-active Au(111) electrode surface|date=2003|last1=Brolo|first1=A.G.|last2=Jiang|first2=Z.|last3=Irish|first3=D.E.|journal=Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry|volume=547|issue=2|pages=163\u2013172 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Raman spectroscopy}}\n\n[[Category:Surface science]]\n[[Category:Raman scattering]]\n[[Category:Raman spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Plasmonics]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eApplications:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-enhanced_Raman_spectroscopy"}

She was transferred to [[HM Customs and Excise]] to control smuggling on the [[Essex]] coast in the navigable waterways beyond the north bank of the [[Thames Estuary]]. She was moored mid-river in the [[River Roach]] which forms part of an extensive maze of waterways and marshes known as The River Crouch and River Roach Tidal River System, located around and to the south and west of [[Burnham-on-Crouch]]. This large maritime area has a tidal coastline of {{convert|243|km|mi|abbr=on}}, part of Essex's {{convert|565|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline \u2013 the largest coastline in the United Kingdom. In 1851, [[oyster]] companies and traders who cultivated and harvested the \"Walflete\" or \"Walfleet\" oyster ''[[Ostrea edulis]]'', petitioned for the Customs and Excise watch vessel ''WV-7'' (ex HMS ''Beagle'') to be removed as she was obstructing the river and its oyster-beds. In the 1851 [[Navy List]] dated 25 May, it showed her renamed ''Southend \"W.V. No. 7\" at Paglesham''. In 1870, she was sold to \"Messrs Murray and Trainer\" to be broken up.\n\n==Possible resting place==\nInvestigations started in 2000 by a team led by Dr Robert Prescott of the [[University of St Andrews]] found documents confirming that ''\"W.V. 7\"'' was ''Beagle'', and noted a vessel matching her size shown midstream on the [[River Roach]] (in [[Paglesham]] Reach) on the 1847 hydrographic survey chart. A later chart showed a nearby indentation to the north bank of Paglesham Reach near the Eastend Wharf and near Waterside Farm. This could have been a dock for ''W.V. 7'' \u2013 ''Beagle''. Site investigations found an area of [[marsh]]y ground some {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep on the tidal river-bank, about 150 metres west of the boat-house.

The farmhouse was demolished in the 1940s, but a nearby boathouse incorporated timbers matching [[Knee (construction)|knee timbers]] used in ''Beagle''. Two more large anchors similar to the one excavated from the ship's present location are known to have been found in neighbouring villages. It is believed that there were four anchors in the ship.\n\nTheir investigations featured in a [[BBC]] [[television]] programme which showed how each watch ship would have accommodated seven coastguard officers, drawn from other areas to minimise collusion with the locals. Each officer had about three rooms to house his family, forming a small community. They would use small boats to intercept smugglers, and the investigators found a [[causeway]] giving access at low tide across the soft mud of the river bank.

To aid ''Beagle'' in her surveying operations in Bass Strait, the Colonial [[Cutter (ship)|cutter]] ''Vansittart'', of Van Diemen's Land, was most liberally lent by His Excellency Sir [[John Franklin]], and placed under the command of Mr Charles Codrington Forsyth, the senior mate, assisted by Mr Pasco, another of her mates. In May 1839, they sailed north to survey the shores of the [[Timor Sea|Arafura Sea]] opposite [[Timor]]. When Wickham fell ill and resigned, the command was taken over in March 1841 by Lieutenant John Lort Stokes who continued the survey. The third voyage was completed in 1843.\n\nNumerous places around the coast were named by Wickham, and subsequently by Stokes when he became captain, often honouring eminent people or the members of the crew. On 9 October 1839 Wickham named [[Port Darwin]], which was first sighted by Stokes, in honour of their former shipmate Charles Darwin.

She was transferred to [[HM Customs and Excise]] to control smuggling on the [[Essex]] coast in the navigable waterways beyond the north bank of the [[Thames Estuary]]. She was moored mid-river in the [[River Roach]] which forms part of an extensive maze of waterways and marshes known as The River Crouch and River Roach Tidal River System, located around and to the south and west of [[Burnham-on-Crouch]]. This large maritime area has a tidal coastline of {{convert|243|km|mi|abbr=on}}, part of Essex's {{convert|565|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline \u2013 the largest coastline in the United Kingdom. In 1851, [[oyster]] companies and traders who cultivated and harvested the \"Walflete\" or \"Walfleet\" oyster ''[[Ostrea edulis]]'', petitioned for the Customs and Excise watch vessel ''WV-7'' (ex HMS ''Beagle'') to be removed as she was obstructing the river and its oyster-beds. In the 1851 [[Navy List]] dated 25 May, it showed her renamed ''Southend \"W.V. No. 7\" at Paglesham''. In 1870, she was sold to \"Messrs Murray and Trainer\" to be broken up.\n\n==Possible resting place==\nInvestigations started in 2000 by a team led by Dr Robert Prescott of the [[University of St Andrews]] found documents confirming that ''\"W.V. 7\"'' was ''Beagle'', and noted a vessel matching her size shown midstream on the [[River Roach]] (in [[Paglesham]] Reach) on the 1847 hydrographic survey chart. A later chart showed a nearby indentation to the north bank of Paglesham Reach near the Eastend Wharf and near Waterside Farm. This could have been a dock for ''W.V. 7'' \u2013 ''Beagle''. Site investigations found an area of [[marsh]]y ground some {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep on the tidal river-bank, about 150 metres west of the boat-house. This discovery matched the chart position and many fragments of [[pottery]] of the correct period were found in the same area.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7819991.stm |title=Hunting the lost Beagle |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=9 January 2009 |access-date=14 February 2018 |last=Grange |first=Jeremy}} [https://goo.gl/maps/h6YRLeaXQNGZzPFi6/ Google Maps location]</ref>\n\nAn atomic dielectric resonance survey carried out in November 2003 found traces of timbers forming the size and shape of the lower hull, indicating a substantial amount of timbers from below the waterline still in place.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} An old [[anchor]] of 1841 pattern was excavated. It was also found that the 1871 [[census]] recorded a new [[farmhouse]] in the name of William Murray and Thomas Rainer, leading to speculation that the merchant's name was a misprint for T. Rainer. The farmhouse was demolished in the 1940s, but a nearby boathouse incorporated timbers matching [[Knee (construction)|knee timbers]] used in ''Beagle''. Two more large anchors similar to the one excavated from the ship's present location are known to have been found in neighbouring villages. It is believed that there were four anchors in the ship.\n\nTheir investigations featured in a [[BBC]] [[television]] programme which showed how each watch ship would have accommodated seven coastguard officers, drawn from other areas to minimise collusion with the locals. Each officer had about three rooms to house his family, forming a small community. They would use small boats to intercept smugglers, and the investigators found a [[causeway]] giving access at low tide across the soft mud of the river bank. Apparently the next coastguard station along was ''Kangaroo'', a sister ship of ''Beagle''.\n\n==Replica==\n\nOn 31 December 2011, the [[Nao Victoria Museum]] in [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]], announced the building of the first full-scale replica of HMS ''Beagle''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.laprensaaustral.cl/cronica/construiran-replicas-navegables-de-la-goleta-ancud-y-del-bergant-8579 |title=Construir\u00e1n r\u00e9plicas navegables de la goleta Ancud y del bergant\u00edn Beagle |access-date=16 November 2012 |date=31 December 2011 |newspaper=La Prensa Austral |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101185243/http://www.laprensaaustral.cl/cronica/construiran-replicas-navegables-de-la-goleta-ancud-y-del-bergant-8579 |archive-date=1 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://radiopolar.com/noticia_69488.html#0 |title=R\u00e9plica tama\u00f1o real de HMS Beagle |access-date=16 January 2013 |date=15 January 2013 |work=Radio Polar |location=Punta Arenas |language=es}}</ref> Construction began on 1 November 2012, using  ''[[Nothofagus dombeyi]]'' timber from the local rainforest.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.radiopolar.com/noticia_66964.html#1 |title=Construyen r\u00e9plica del HMS Beagle |accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=15 November 2012 |work=Radio Polar |location=Punta Arenas |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hmsbeagle.cl |title=HMS ''Beagle'' R\u00e9plica |access-date=27 January 2013 |year=2013 |work=[[Museo Nao Victoria]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217102307/http://hmsbeagle.cl/ |archive-date=17 December 2014}}</ref> In 2013, the Chilean national press started to take an interest in the work in progress.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://hmsbeagle.cl/primera-plana-en-el-mercurio/ |title=Construyen r\u00e9plica del HMS Beagle en Magallanes |accessdate=7 February 2013 |year=2013 |newspaper=[[El Mercurio]] |language=es |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101105753/http://hmsbeagle.cl/primera-plana-en-el-mercurio/ |archive-date=1 November 2013}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"HMS Beagle (replica 1:1)\">\nFile:Construcci\u00f3n de la r\u00e9plica del HMS Beagle 055.jpg|Stem, keel and stern of HMS ''Beagle'' 1:1 replica ready for installation in the [[Nao Victoria Museum]] in [[Punta Arenas]] \u2013 [[Chile]]\nFile:The construction of the HMS Beagle Full Size Replica in the Nao Victoria Museum - Punta Arenas - Chile.jpg|The first frames of HMS ''Beagle'' replica under construction at the [[Nao Victoria Museum]]\nFile:Construcci\u00f3n de la r\u00e9plica del HMS Beagle 143 - State of the art 2013 03 20 portside view from the Nao Victoria.jpg|Starboard view of HMS ''Beagle'' replica seen from Nao Victoria's aftcastle (20 March 2013)\nFile:Construcci\u00f3n de la r\u00e9plica del HMS Beagle 144 - State of the art 2013 03 21 starboard view.jpg|Portsideview of HMS ''Beagle'' replica (20 March 2013)\nFile:Portside View of the HMS Beagle replica as of february 27, 2014.jpg|The Nao Victoria Museum is completing the first ever replica of HMS ''Beagle''.\nFile:Construcci\u00f3n de la r\u00e9plica del HMS Beagle 195.jpg|View of complete and painted hull of HMS ''Beagle'' 1:1 replica in the [[Nao Victoria Museum]] in [[Punta Arenas]] \u2013 [[Chile]]\nFile:R\u00e9plica de HMS Beagle.jpg|The replica in February 2016\nFile:20170219-Punta Arenas-0022.jpg|Update on the construction of the replica in February 2017.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War|History}}\n* [[Beagle 2]] \u2013 [[Mars]] space probe, which was lost on 25 December 2003, was named after HMS ''Beagle''\n* [[Ship's chronometer from HMS Beagle|Ship's chronometer from HMS ''Beagle'']]\n* ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'', a [[science fiction]] adventure by [[A.

Historically, the growth of irreligion in the UK has followed a European-wide pattern of [[secularisation]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Europe and the legend of secularization|publisher= The New York Times|date=2006-03-31|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/arts/31iht-idlede1.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all|accessdate=2012-08-12|first=Mark|last=Lilla}}</ref>\n\nThe first British census to gather data on religion, [[2001 United Kingdom census|in 2001]], showed that there were 7.7 million irreligious people in the country. The wording of the question was criticised by humanist groups, and a revised question in the [[2011 United Kingdom census|next census in 2011]] counted 14.1 million irreligious people. This made irreligion the second-largest viewpoint on religion after Christianity, larger than the combined populations of non-Christian religions in the UK, and also the largest growth between the two censuses. [[Humanists UK]] is the secular charity that provides services for this community and lobbies government on their behalf.\n\nFreedom to be irreligious had been limited by the country's [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|blasphemy law]], which punished criticism and mockery of [[Christianity]], particularly the state [[Church of England]]. The last conviction was in [[Whitehouse v Lemon|1977]], with the law being abolished in England and Wales in 2008. Similar offences remain in statute in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and remain theoretically incompatible with the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights]].\n\n==1700\u20131850==\nOrganized activism for irreligion in the United Kingdom derived its roots from the legacy of British [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformists]]. The [[South Place Ethical Society|South Place Religious Society]], which would later become associated with the Ethical movement, was founded in 1793 as an organization of [[Philadelphians]] or Universalists.\n\nIn 1811 \u201cThe Necessity of Atheism\u201d was published by a young oxford student, Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was one of the first printed, open avowals of irreligion in England.\n\n''[[The Oracle of Reason]]'', the first avowedly-atheist periodical publication in British history, was published from 1841 to 1843 by [[Charles Southwell]]. It suffered from numerous imprisonments of its staff, including Southwell, George Holyoake and [[Thomas Paterson (publisher)|Thomas Paterson]], for missives deemed \"blasphemous\" by the authorities (Holyoake was the last person in Britain convicted of blasphemy in a public lecture). Holyoake took to publishing ''[[The Movement (magazine)|The Movement]]'' (1842-1845) following his six-month sentence, which later became ''[[The Reasoner]]'' (1845-1860) and shifted to a larger focus on social issues facing the British working class, increasing the publication's readership. It was during this time that Holyoake developed his idea for the replacement of Christianity with an ethical system based upon science and reason, terming his proposal \"secularism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/PRholyoak.htm |title=George Holyoake : Biography |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |date= |accessdate=2019-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==1850\u20131900==\n[[File:Charles Bradlaugh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Northampton]] and founder of the [[National Secular Society]] in 1866.]]\n[[George Holyoake]]'s coining of the word ''[[secularism]]'' in 1851 offered the English-speaking world the clarification of the nascent movement for separation of religion and state. The [[National Secular Society]], founded in 1866 by politician [[Charles Bradlaugh]], spearheaded the advocacy for freeing citizens from absolute government requirements involving religious observances; the [[Leicester Secular Society]] was founded in 1851. Bradlaugh's 1880 election to Parliament brought on a decade-long dispute over the demanded right to affirm declarations of office rather than swear oaths, as he was denied his seat for five years by a ruling that he had no right to affirm and resolutions preventing him from swearing an oath. When Bradlaugh was ultimately admitted in 1886, he took up the issue and saw the [[Oaths Act 1888]] passed, which confirmed the right to optionally affirm declarations for inaugurations to office and offering testimony to government bodies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oY0nsXwPJ3AC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Irreligion+in+the+netherlands&source=bl&ots=8y5AblhMnz&sig=Cszqj6FdZGj8OaIOWTChKZKtIJs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=roTvT5bsMoKe0QW8qZSSDg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=Irreligion%20in%20the%20netherlands&f=false |title=Religion and Mental Health - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1881, ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' began circulation as Britain's longest-running humanist periodical.

The wording of the question was criticised by humanist groups, and a revised question in the [[2011 United Kingdom census|next census in 2011]] counted 14.1 million irreligious people. This made irreligion the second-largest viewpoint on religion after Christianity, larger than the combined populations of non-Christian religions in the UK, and also the largest growth between the two censuses. [[Humanists UK]] is the secular charity that provides services for this community and lobbies government on their behalf.\n\nFreedom to be irreligious had been limited by the country's [[Blasphemy law in the United Kingdom|blasphemy law]], which punished criticism and mockery of [[Christianity]], particularly the state [[Church of England]]. The last conviction was in [[Whitehouse v Lemon|1977]], with the law being abolished in England and Wales in 2008.

The [[South Place Ethical Society|South Place Religious Society]], which would later become associated with the Ethical movement, was founded in 1793 as an organization of [[Philadelphians]] or Universalists.\n\nIn 1811 \u201cThe Necessity of Atheism\u201d was published by a young oxford student, Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was one of the first printed, open avowals of irreligion in England.\n\n''[[The Oracle of Reason]]'', the first avowedly-atheist periodical publication in British history, was published from 1841 to 1843 by [[Charles Southwell]]. It suffered from numerous imprisonments of its staff, including Southwell, George Holyoake and [[Thomas Paterson (publisher)|Thomas Paterson]], for missives deemed \"blasphemous\" by the authorities (Holyoake was the last person in Britain convicted of blasphemy in a public lecture). Holyoake took to publishing ''[[The Movement (magazine)|The Movement]]'' (1842-1845) following his six-month sentence, which later became ''[[The Reasoner]]'' (1845-1860) and shifted to a larger focus on social issues facing the British working class, increasing the publication's readership. It was during this time that Holyoake developed his idea for the replacement of Christianity with an ethical system based upon science and reason, terming his proposal \"secularism\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/PRholyoak.htm |title=George Holyoake : Biography |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |date= |accessdate=2019-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==1850\u20131900==\n[[File:Charles Bradlaugh.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Charles Bradlaugh]], [[Northampton (UK Parliament constituency)|Member of Parliament for Northampton]] and founder of the [[National Secular Society]] in 1866.]]\n[[George Holyoake]]'s coining of the word ''[[secularism]]'' in 1851 offered the English-speaking world the clarification of the nascent movement for separation of religion and state. The [[National Secular Society]], founded in 1866 by politician [[Charles Bradlaugh]], spearheaded the advocacy for freeing citizens from absolute government requirements involving religious observances; the [[Leicester Secular Society]] was founded in 1851. Bradlaugh's 1880 election to Parliament brought on a decade-long dispute over the demanded right to affirm declarations of office rather than swear oaths, as he was denied his seat for five years by a ruling that he had no right to affirm and resolutions preventing him from swearing an oath. When Bradlaugh was ultimately admitted in 1886, he took up the issue and saw the [[Oaths Act 1888]] passed, which confirmed the right to optionally affirm declarations for inaugurations to office and offering testimony to government bodies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oY0nsXwPJ3AC&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=Irreligion+in+the+netherlands&source=bl&ots=8y5AblhMnz&sig=Cszqj6FdZGj8OaIOWTChKZKtIJs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=roTvT5bsMoKe0QW8qZSSDg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=Irreligion%20in%20the%20netherlands&f=false |title=Religion and Mental Health - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-09}}</ref>\n\nIn 1881, ''[[The Freethinker (journal)|The Freethinker]]'' began circulation as Britain's longest-running humanist periodical.

Conway]] as minister of the congregation; Conway, an American Unitarian minister who served from 1864\u20131885 and 1892\u20131897, moved the congregation further away from doctrinal Unitarianism, and spent the break in his tenure (during which Stanton Coit served in his stead) writing a biography of American revolutionary ideologue [[Thomas Paine]].

In 1880, Kentucky University and [[Centre College]] played the first intercollegiate football game in [[Kentucky]]. Kentucky State first fielded a football team in [[1881 Kentucky State College football team|1881]], playing three games against [[Battle on Broadway|rival]] [[1881 Kentucky University football team|Kentucky University]].  The team was revived in 1891. Both the inaugural 1881 squad and the revived 1891 squad have unknown coaches according to university records in winning two games and losing three.<ref name=k177>''Kentucky Football Media Guide'', p. 177</ref> The 1891 team's colors were blue and light yellow, decided before the [[Centre College\u2013Kentucky rivalry|Centre\u2013Kentucky]] game on December 19. A student asked \"What color blue?\" and varsity letterman [[Richard C. Stoll]] pulled off his necktie, and held it up. This is still held as the origin of Kentucky's shade of blue.

They played the first four games of the renewed series at Commonwealth Stadium (now Kroger Field) until [[Papa John's Cardinal Stadium]] (PJCS) was completed in 1997, at which time they began rotating the series between Louisville, Kentucky and Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky leads the series 17-15, but trails the modern series 15-11. Kentucky played Louisville in the Cardinals' first 4 seasons and twice in the 1920s, holding the Cardinals scoreless in all contests. Kentucky then left the SIAA in 1922 to become a charter member of the Southeastern Conference and limited its play of in-state schools. It would be 70&nbsp;years before these two in-state rivals faced each other again.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that the game would be moved to the final game of the season following Louisville's 2014 move to the ACC. This scheduling change fits with other end-of-year SEC vs. ACC rivalry games, such as [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|Georgia vs. Georgia Tech]], [[Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry|Florida vs. Florida State]] and [[Clemson\u2013South Carolina rivalry|South Carolina vs. Clemson]].\n\nIn 2018, Kentucky beat Louisville 56-10, winning by the largest margin since the rivalry restarted in 1994. The largest ever win in the rivalry was also by Kentucky which they won 73-0 in 1922, before the series went dormant.\n\nIn 2019, Kentucky beat Louisville 45-13. Kentucky quarterback Lynn Bowden broke the SEC record for yards rushing by a QB in a game with 284 total individual rushing yards. Also, the Wildcats broke their single game rushing record with 517 rushing yards against the Cardinals.\n\nKentucky leads the series 17\u201315 as of the conclusion of the 2019 season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winsipedia.com/kentucky/vs/louisville |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028033705/http://www.winsipedia.com/kentucky/vs/louisville |archive-date=October 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Tennessee===\n{{Main|Kentucky\u2013Tennessee football rivalry}}\nLike many college football rivalries, the Tennessee-Kentucky game had its own trophy for many years: a wooden beer barrel painted half blue and half orange. The trophy was awarded to the winner of the game every year from 1925 to 1997. The Barrel was introduced in 1925 by a group of former Kentucky students who wanted to create a material sign of supremacy for the rivalry. It was rolled onto the field that year with the words \"Ice Water\" painted on it to avoid any outcries over a beer keg symbolizing a college rivalry. The barrel exchange was retired in 1998 after two Kentucky football players died in an alcohol-related crash.\n\nTennessee leads the series 81\u201325\u20139 as of the conclusion of the 2019 season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winsipedia.com/kentucky/vs/tennessee |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030035532/http://www.winsipedia.com/kentucky/vs/tennessee |archive-date=October 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Indiana===\n{{Main|The Bourbon Barrel}}\nMore known for its basketball rivalry, the Indiana-Kentucky series was played annually from 1987 until 2005 in what was known as the \"Battle for the Bourbon Barrel\" game.

Miller, Kentucky's first head football coach]]\nUntil about 1913, the modern University of Kentucky was referred to as \"Kentucky State College\" and nearby [[Transylvania University]] was known as \"Kentucky University\". In 1880, Kentucky University and [[Centre College]] played the first intercollegiate football game in [[Kentucky]]. Kentucky State first fielded a football team in [[1881 Kentucky State College football team|1881]], playing three games against [[Battle on Broadway|rival]] [[1881 Kentucky University football team|Kentucky University]].  The team was revived in 1891. Both the inaugural 1881 squad and the revived 1891 squad have unknown coaches according to university records in winning two games and losing three.<ref name=k177>''Kentucky Football Media Guide'', p. 177</ref> The 1891 team's colors were blue and light yellow, decided before the [[Centre College\u2013Kentucky rivalry|Centre\u2013Kentucky]] game on December 19. A student asked \"What color blue?\" and varsity letterman [[Richard C. Stoll]] pulled off his necktie, and held it up. This is still held as the origin of Kentucky's shade of blue.  The next year light yellow was dropped and changed to white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uky.edu/base/webuk/subpages/traditions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824191752/http://www.uky.edu/base/webuk/subpages/traditions.html |archivedate=August 24, 2015 }}</ref> The 1892 team was coached by [[A.

The next week, the Wildcats defeated the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their home opener at the newly renamed Kroger Field in Lexington. Following a road victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks, they failed to defeat the Florida Gators, whom they had not defeated since 1986. This extended the longest losing streak in SEC history to 31 years. Responding to the criticized loss to Florida, the Wildcats defeated Eastern Michigan and Missouri at Kroger Field, improving their record to 5\u20131.\n\nFollowing their bye week, the Kentucky Wildcats fell to #19-ranked Mississippi State team on the road, 45\u20137. However, the Wildcats improved to 6\u20132 by defeating the Tennessee Volunteers by a score of 29\u201326 at Kroger Field. The victory over Tennessee was Kentucky's second victory since 1984 over the Volunteers, and secured bowl eligibility. This was followed by a 37-34 home loss to Ole Miss and a dominating road win over unranked Vanderbilt. The Wildcats then lost to Georgia 42\u201313 in [[Sanford Stadium|Athens, Georgia]]. In their last regular season game against rival Louisville, Kentucky was beaten at home 44\u201317. Kentucky then proceeded to play [[2017 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] in [[Nissan Stadium|Nashville, Tennessee]] in the [[2017 Music City Bowl|Music City Bowl]] on December 29, and lost 24\u201323.\n\nIn 2018, after beating [[2018 Central Michigan Chippewas football team|Central Michigan]], Kentucky went to Gainesville to face the [[2018 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]], who had won 31 straight against Kentucky, and ended their losing streak with a 27\u201316 win at [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|The Swamp]], the Wildcats' first win in Gainesville since 1979. They added wins in the next two weeks over [[2018 Murray State Racers football team|Murray State]] and #14 [[2018 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]], the second of which put Kentucky into the Top 25, the Wildcats' first ranking since 2007. They then split the next two games, defeating [[2018 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]] for the fifth straight season before losing for the first time, an overtime loss to [[2018 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]] on the road. After the bye week, Kentucky defeated [[2018 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]] at home then beat [[2018 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri]] on the road thanks to a last second TD pass. Those wins put the Wildcats at 7\u20131 and #9 in the College Football Playoff Rankings leading in to a home game against the [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia Bulldogs]]. In a matchup that determined the SEC East Division champion, the Wildcats were defeated at home 34\u201317. Kentucky then went on the road at [[2018 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]], falling to the Volunteers by a score of 24\u20137, ending their final SEC record at 5\u20133, the team's first winning season in conference play since 1977. In Kentucky's final home game of the season, senior day, the Wildcats defeated [[2018 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team|Middle Tennessee]] by a score of 34\u201323. Kentucky closed the regular season with a 56\u201310 rout of [[2018 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]] to win back the Governor's Cup. Kentucky was selected to play in the [[2019 Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]] in [[Camping World Stadium|Orlando, Florida]] against #12 ranked [[2018 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]], and won 27-24. This capped only the third 10-win season in school history, and the first since 1977. The Wildcats finished ranked #12 in the AP poll, the first such end-season rank since the 1984 season.\n\n==Conference affiliations==\n* Independent (1881\u20131895)\n* [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (1896\u20131904){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n* Independent (1905\u20131911){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n* Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (1912\u20131921){{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n* [[Southern Conference]] (1922\u20131932)\n* [[Southeastern Conference]] (1933\u2013present)\n\n==Championships==\n\n===National championships===\nThe NCAA has never officially recognized a national champion from among the bowl coalition institutions, but in 2004 the NCAA commissioned [[Jeff Sagarin]] to use his computer model to retroactively determine the highest ranked teams for the years prior to the BCS.

They played the first four games of the renewed series at Commonwealth Stadium (now Kroger Field) until [[Papa John's Cardinal Stadium]] (PJCS) was completed in 1997, at which time they began rotating the series between Louisville, Kentucky and Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky leads the series 17-15, but trails the modern series 15-11. Kentucky played Louisville in the Cardinals' first 4 seasons and twice in the 1920s, holding the Cardinals scoreless in all contests. Kentucky then left the SIAA in 1922 to become a charter member of the Southeastern Conference and limited its play of in-state schools. It would be 70&nbsp;years before these two in-state rivals faced each other again.\n\nIn 2013, it was announced that the game would be moved to the final game of the season following Louisville's 2014 move to the ACC. This scheduling change fits with other end-of-year SEC vs. ACC rivalry games, such as [[Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate|Georgia vs. Georgia Tech]], [[Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry|Florida vs. Florida State]] and [[Clemson\u2013South Carolina rivalry|South Carolina vs. Clemson]].\n\nIn 2018, Kentucky beat Louisville 56-10, winning by the largest margin since the rivalry restarted in 1994. The largest ever win in the rivalry was also by Kentucky which they won 73-0 in 1922, before the series went dormant.\n\nIn 2019, Kentucky beat Louisville 45-13. Kentucky quarterback Lynn Bowden broke the SEC record for yards rushing by a QB in a game with 284 total individual rushing yards. Also, the Wildcats broke their single game rushing record with 517 rushing yards against the Cardinals.\n\nKentucky leads the series 17\u201315 as of the conclusion of the 2019 season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winsipedia.com/kentucky/vs/louisville |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 29, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181028033705/http://www.winsipedia.com/kentucky/vs/louisville |archive-date=October 28, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Tennessee===\n{{Main|Kentucky\u2013Tennessee football rivalry}}\nLike many college football rivalries, the Tennessee-Kentucky game had its own trophy for many years: a wooden beer barrel painted half blue and half orange. The trophy was awarded to the winner of the game every year from 1925 to 1997. The Barrel was introduced in 1925 by a group of former Kentucky students who wanted to create a material sign of supremacy for the rivalry.

Nubia is academically traditionally divided into two regions, the southern portion, which extended north to the southern end of the second cataract of the Nile was known as [[Upper Nubia]]; this was called Kush (Cush) under the 18th-dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt and was called Aethiopia by the ancient Greeks. [[Lower Nubia]] was the northern part of the region, located between the second and the first cataract of Asw\u0101n; this was called Wawat.\n\nLower Nubia is the northernmost part of [[Nubia]], downstream on the [[Nile]] from [[Upper Nubia]].  Sometimes, it overlapped [[Upper Egypt]] stretching to the [[First Cataract|First]] and [[Second Cataract]]s (the region known to [[Greco-Roman]] geographers as [[Triakontaschoinos]]), so roughly until [[Aswan]].  A great deal of Upper Egypt and northern Lower Nubia were flooded with the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] and the creation of [[Lake Nasser]]. However the intensive archaeological work conducted prior to the flooding means that the history of the area is much better known than that of Upper Nubia.  Its history is also known from its long relations with [[Egypt]].\n\nIn Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia there was present a series of cultures, the [[Badarian]], [[Amratian]], [[Gerzean]], [[A-Group]], [[B-Group]], and [[C-Group]].\n\nLinguistic evidence (according to Claude Rilly 2008, 2010, 2016 and Julien Copper 2017) indicates that in antiquity, peoples speaking [[Cushitic languages]] inhabited [[Lower Nubia]], a region between present day Southern [[Egypt]] and Northernmost [[Sudan]] (including ancient peoples such as the C-Group culture, the Blemmyes, and the Medjay), and that peoples speaking Nilo-Saharan languages of the [[Eastern Sudanic]] branch inhabited [[Upper Nubia]] to the south (such as the people of the ancient Kerma culture), before the spread of Eastern Sudanic languages further north into Lower Nubia.<ref name=\"Rilly2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Recent Research on Meroitic, the Ancient Language of Sudan | date = 2010 |url = http://www.ityopis.org/Issues-1_files/ITYOPIS-I-Rilly.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly200162\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C | title = The Wadi Howar Diaspora and its role in the spread of East Sudanic languages from the fourth to the first millenia BCE | journal = Faits de Langues | volume = 47 | pages = 151\u2013163 | date = January 2016 | doi = 10.1163/19589514-047-01-900000010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly2008\">{{cite book |doi=10.31338/uw.9788323533269.pp.211-226 |chapter=Enemy brothers.

The [[New Kingdom]] occupied all of Nubia and Lower Nubia was especially closely integrated into Egypt, but with the [[Second Intermediate Period]] it became the centre of the independent state of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] based around [[Napata]]. Perhaps around 591 BC the capital of Kush was transferred south to [[Meroe]]. It is also uncertain to which language family the ancient [[Meroitic language]] is related.

This evolved into the [[Christians|Christian]] state of [[Nobatia]] by the fifth century.  Nobatia was merged with the Upper Nubian state of [[Makuria]], but Lower Nubia became steadily more [[Arabized]] and [[Islam]]icized and eventually became de facto independent as the state of [[al-Maris (region)|al-Maris]]. Most of Lower Nubia was formally annexed by Egypt during the Ottoman conquest of 1517, and it has remained a part of Egypt since then, with only the far south being in [[Sudan]].\n\nGenetic evidence (a study by Dobon et al. 2015) suggests modern Nubians do not cluster with groups of the same linguistic affiliation, but with Sudanese Afro-Asiatic speaking groups (Sudanese Arabs and Cushitic Beja) and Afro-Asiatic Ethiopians. Nubians were reported to be more similar to Egyptians and Ethiopians in their Mitochondrial and Y-DNA lineages but close to Ethiopians in their overall genetic affinities. Also according to the study, \"Nubians were influenced by Arabs as a direct result of the penetration of large numbers of Arabs into the Nile Valley over long periods of time following the arrival of Islam around 651 A.D\".<ref name=pmid26017457>{{cite journal |last1=Dobon |first1=Bego\u00f1a |last2=Hassan |first2=Hisham Y. |last3=Laayouni |first3=Hafid |last4=Luisi |first4=Pierre |last5=Rica\u00f1o-Ponce |first5=Isis |last6=Zhernakova |first6=Alexandra |last7=Wijmenga |first7=Cisca |last8=Tahir |first8=Hanan |last9=Comas |first9=David |last10=Netea |first10=Mihai G. |last11=Bertranpetit |first11=Jaume |title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape |journal=Scientific Reports |date=28 May 2015 |volume=5 |pages=9996 |doi=10.1038/srep09996 |pmid=26017457 |pmc=4446898 |bibcode=2015NatSR...5E9996D }}</ref>\n\nOther studies have linked the ancient population of Sudan and parts of Egypt to the Horn of Africa, though this is not entirely conclusive and must be placed in the context of hypotheses informed by archaeological, linguistic, geographic and other data.

Their religion was centered in the temples of [[Kalabsha]] and [[Philae]]. The former edifice was a huge local architectural masterpiece, where a solar, lion-like divinity named [[Mandulis]] was worshipped.

Cushitic populations tend to combine in their ancestries both, genetic components indigenous to East Africa, and non-African components of [[West Asia]]n origin. According to an [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\" or \"Semitic-Cushitic\" in another study. This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Cushitic and Ethiosemitic populations in the Horn of Africa and reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.<ref name=pmid24921250/> Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lazaridis |first1=Iosif |last2=Nadel |first2=Dani |last3=Rollefson |first3=Gary |last4=Merrett |first4=Deborah C. |last5=Rohland |first5=Nadin |last6=Mallick |first6=Swapan |last7=Fernandes |first7=Daniel |last8=Novak |first8=Mario |last9=Gamarra |first9=Beatriz |last10=Sirak |first10=Kendra |last11=Connell |first11=Sarah |last12=Stewardson |first12=Kristin |last13=Harney |first13=Eadaoin |last14=Fu |first14=Qiaomei |last15=Gonzalez-Fortes |first15=Gloria |last16=Jones |first16=Eppie R. |last17=Roodenberg |first17=Song\u00fcl Alpaslan |last18=Lengyel |first18=Gy\u00f6rgy |last19=Bocquentin |first19=Fanny |last20=Gasparian |first20=Boris |last21=Monge |first21=Janet M. |last22=Gregg |first22=Michael |last23=Eshed |first23=Vered |last24=Mizrahi |first24=Ahuva-Sivan |last25=Meiklejohn |first25=Christopher |last26=Gerritsen |first26=Fokke |last27=Bejenaru |first27=Luminita |last28=Bl\u00fcher |first28=Matthias |last29=Campbell |first29=Archie |last30=Cavalleri |first30=Gianpiero |last31=Comas |first31=David |last32=Froguel |first32=Philippe |last33=Gilbert |first33=Edmund |last34=Kerr |first34=Shona M. |last35=Kovacs |first35=Peter |last36=Krause |first36=Johannes |last37=McGettigan |first37=Darren |last38=Merrigan |first38=Michael |last39=Merriwether |first39=D.

(2014), both the African ancestry (Ethiopic) and the non-African ancestry (Ethio-Somali) in Cushitic speaking populations is significantly differentiated from all neighboring African and non-African ancestries in East Africa, North Africa, the Levant and Arabia. The genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking populations in the Horn of Africa represents ancestries (Ethiopic and Ethio-Somali) not found outside of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations in any significance. Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al states:\n<blockquote>\"The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia.\"<ref name=pmid24921250/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Hodgson et al. (2014), the non-African ancestry (Ethio-Somali) in the Cushitic speaking populations is distinct and unique to Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations. Hodgson et al states:\n<blockquote>\"We find that most of the non-African ancestry in the HOA can be assigned to a distinct non-African origin Ethio-Somali ancestry component, which is found at its highest frequencies in Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\"<ref name=pmid24921250/></blockquote>\n\nWhen calculated the genetic distance (FST) between Ethiosemitic-speaking and Cushitic-speaking Ethiopians, and populations of the Levant, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula using two approaches: (1) the whole genome and (2) only the non-African component\u2014in the whole-genome analysis, Ethiopian Semitic and Cushitic populations appear to be closest to the Yemeni; when only the non-African component is used, they are closer to the Egyptians and populations inhabiting the Levant.<ref name=\"Pagani et al 2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Pagani |first1=Luca |last2=Kivisild |first2=Toomas |last3=Tarekegn |first3=Ayele |last4=Ekong |first4=Rosemary |last5=Plaster |first5=Chris |last6=Gallego\u00a0Romero |first6=Irene |last7=Ayub |first7=Qasim |last8=Mehdi |first8=S.

Known as the ''Coptic'' component, it peaks among Egyptian Copts who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. The Coptic component evolved out of a main Northeast African and Middle Eastern ancestral component that is shared by other Egyptians and also found at high frequencies among Cushites (\u224840\u201360%), with the remaining 40-60% of the ancestry of Cushites being of sub-Saharan East African origin. However, these percentages are not certain since Figure 3 of the study by Dobon et al. only features these percentages in the k=3 model.<ref name=pmid26017457/>\n\nAccording to Dobon et al (2015), the results were not conclusive and states that there needs to be more studies on the East African samples. Dobon et al states:\n<blockquote>\"Our main results add new and interesting features to the North East African genetic complexity, with new populations that define a genetic component in southern Nilo-Saharan speakers that cannot be related to a North-African or other sub-Saharan components. These populations should be included in further population genetics and epidemiological studies to have a representative sample of the genetic diversity of the region of East Africa.\"<ref name=pmid26017457/></blockquote>\n\nThe scientists involved in the study suggest that this points to a common origin for the general population of Egypt.<ref name=pmid26017457/> They also associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians.<ref name=pmid26017457/> The Coptic component is roughly equivalent with the Ethio-Somali component.<ref name=pmid24921250/>\n\n{{See also|Nilotic_peoples#Genetics}}\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Horn of Africa]]\n* [[Abyssinian people]]\n* [[Nilotic peoples]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cushitic-speaking peoples]]\n[[Category:Habesha peoples]]\n[[Category:Semitic-speaking peoples]]\n[[Category:Afroasiatic peoples]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|People primarily indigenous to Northeast Africa}}\n{{infobox ethnic group\n| group = Cushites <br> (Cushitic people)\n| image = Cushitic_languages.SVG<!--- Do not use pictures of individuals --->\n| caption = Areas where Modern [[Cushitic languages]] are currently prevalent <small>(Cushitic People subgroups that no longer speak Cushitic languages are not represented in this map)</small>.\n| poptime = \n| popplace = The [[Horn of Africa]], [[Nile|Nile Valley]] ([[Sudan]] and [[Egypt]]), parts of the [[African Great Lakes]] region, and due to immigration in parts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Israel]]<!--- Beta Israel are Agaw Cushites --->, and the [[Western world]].\n| langs = Predominantly various [[Cushitic languages]] <small>([[Oromo language|Oromo]] and [[Somali language|Somali]] being the largest)</small>, some [[Arabic]] <small>([[Sacred language|liturgical]], co-official, or [[Sudanese Arabic|language shifts]])</small>, [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiosemitic]] languages <small>([[Amharic language|Amharic]] and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]] primarily and [[Ge'ez]] for [[Sacred language|liturgical]] reasons)</small>, [[Modern Hebrew]] & [[Languages of Europe|European]] languages <small>(immigration)</small>, and [[Nilo-Saharan]] languages <small>(e.g. [[Nubian languages|Nubian]] due to [[language shift]]s)</small>\n| religions = Majority: [[Islam]] <small>([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]])</small>,   [[Christianity]] <small>([[Oriental Orthodox Christianity|Oriental Orthodoxy]]-[[Orthodox Tewahedo]]: [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodoxy]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean Orthodoxy]] \u00b7 [[P'ent'ay (Ethiopian Evangelicalism)|P'ent'ay: Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism]] \u00b7 [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]: [[Eritrean Catholic Church|Eritrean Catholicism]] and [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopian Catholicism]])</small> <br>Minority: [[Syncretism]], [[Judaism]] <small>([[Beta Israel]])</small> <br>Traditional Old Cushitic religion(s): ([[Waaqism]]/[[Waaqeffanna]])\n| native_name = \n| native_name_lang = \n| related-c = [[Afro-Asiatic languages|other Afro-Asiatic peoples]]<ref>Blench, Roger.

Nubia is academically traditionally divided into two regions, the southern portion, which extended north to the southern end of the second cataract of the Nile was known as [[Upper Nubia]]; this was called Kush (Cush) under the 18th-dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt and was called Aethiopia by the ancient Greeks. [[Lower Nubia]] was the northern part of the region, located between the second and the first cataract of Asw\u0101n; this was called Wawat.\n\nLower Nubia is the northernmost part of [[Nubia]], downstream on the [[Nile]] from [[Upper Nubia]].  Sometimes, it overlapped [[Upper Egypt]] stretching to the [[First Cataract|First]] and [[Second Cataract]]s (the region known to [[Greco-Roman]] geographers as [[Triakontaschoinos]]), so roughly until [[Aswan]].  A great deal of Upper Egypt and northern Lower Nubia were flooded with the construction of the [[Aswan High Dam]] and the creation of [[Lake Nasser]]. However the intensive archaeological work conducted prior to the flooding means that the history of the area is much better known than that of Upper Nubia.  Its history is also known from its long relations with [[Egypt]].\n\nIn Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia there was present a series of cultures, the [[Badarian]], [[Amratian]], [[Gerzean]], [[A-Group]], [[B-Group]], and [[C-Group]].\n\nLinguistic evidence (according to Claude Rilly 2008, 2010, 2016 and Julien Copper 2017) indicates that in antiquity, peoples speaking [[Cushitic languages]] inhabited [[Lower Nubia]], a region between present day Southern [[Egypt]] and Northernmost [[Sudan]] (including ancient peoples such as the C-Group culture, the Blemmyes, and the Medjay), and that peoples speaking Nilo-Saharan languages of the [[Eastern Sudanic]] branch inhabited [[Upper Nubia]] to the south (such as the people of the ancient Kerma culture), before the spread of Eastern Sudanic languages further north into Lower Nubia.<ref name=\"Rilly2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C  | title = Recent Research on Meroitic, the Ancient Language of Sudan | date = 2010 |url = http://www.ityopis.org/Issues-1_files/ITYOPIS-I-Rilly.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly200162\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rilly C | title = The Wadi Howar Diaspora and its role in the spread of East Sudanic languages from the fourth to the first millenia BCE | journal = Faits de Langues | volume = 47 | pages = 151\u2013163 | date = January 2016 | doi = 10.1163/19589514-047-01-900000010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Rilly2008\">{{cite book |doi=10.31338/uw.9788323533269.pp.211-226 |chapter=Enemy brothers.

This evolved into the [[Christians|Christian]] state of [[Nobatia]] by the fifth century.  Nobatia was merged with the Upper Nubian state of [[Makuria]], but Lower Nubia became steadily more [[Arabized]] and [[Islam]]icized and eventually became de facto independent as the state of [[al-Maris (region)|al-Maris]]. Most of Lower Nubia was formally annexed by Egypt during the Ottoman conquest of 1517, and it has remained a part of Egypt since then, with only the far south being in [[Sudan]].\n\nGenetic evidence (a study by Dobon et al. 2015) suggests modern Nubians do not cluster with groups of the same linguistic affiliation, but with Sudanese Afro-Asiatic speaking groups (Sudanese Arabs and Cushitic Beja) and Afro-Asiatic Ethiopians. Nubians were reported to be more similar to Egyptians and Ethiopians in their Mitochondrial and Y-DNA lineages but close to Ethiopians in their overall genetic affinities. Also according to the study, \"Nubians were influenced by Arabs as a direct result of the penetration of large numbers of Arabs into the Nile Valley over long periods of time following the arrival of Islam around 651 A.D\".<ref name=pmid26017457>{{cite journal |last1=Dobon |first1=Bego\u00f1a |last2=Hassan |first2=Hisham Y. |last3=Laayouni |first3=Hafid |last4=Luisi |first4=Pierre |last5=Rica\u00f1o-Ponce |first5=Isis |last6=Zhernakova |first6=Alexandra |last7=Wijmenga |first7=Cisca |last8=Tahir |first8=Hanan |last9=Comas |first9=David |last10=Netea |first10=Mihai G. |last11=Bertranpetit |first11=Jaume |title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape |journal=Scientific Reports |date=28 May 2015 |volume=5 |pages=9996 |doi=10.1038/srep09996 |pmid=26017457 |pmc=4446898 |bibcode=2015NatSR...5E9996D }}</ref>\n\nOther studies have linked the ancient population of Sudan and parts of Egypt to the Horn of Africa, though this is not entirely conclusive and must be placed in the context of hypotheses informed by archaeological, linguistic, geographic and other data. In such contexts, the physical anthropological evidence indicates that early Nile Valley populations can be identified as part of an African lineage, but exhibiting local variation.

Cushitic populations tend to combine in their ancestries both, genetic components indigenous to East Africa, and non-African components of [[West Asia]]n origin. According to an [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\" or \"Semitic-Cushitic\" in another study. This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Cushitic and Ethiosemitic populations in the Horn of Africa and reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.<ref name=pmid24921250/> Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lazaridis |first1=Iosif |last2=Nadel |first2=Dani |last3=Rollefson |first3=Gary |last4=Merrett |first4=Deborah C. |last5=Rohland |first5=Nadin |last6=Mallick |first6=Swapan |last7=Fernandes |first7=Daniel |last8=Novak |first8=Mario |last9=Gamarra |first9=Beatriz |last10=Sirak |first10=Kendra |last11=Connell |first11=Sarah |last12=Stewardson |first12=Kristin |last13=Harney |first13=Eadaoin |last14=Fu |first14=Qiaomei |last15=Gonzalez-Fortes |first15=Gloria |last16=Jones |first16=Eppie R. |last17=Roodenberg |first17=Song\u00fcl Alpaslan |last18=Lengyel |first18=Gy\u00f6rgy |last19=Bocquentin |first19=Fanny |last20=Gasparian |first20=Boris |last21=Monge |first21=Janet M. |last22=Gregg |first22=Michael |last23=Eshed |first23=Vered |last24=Mizrahi |first24=Ahuva-Sivan |last25=Meiklejohn |first25=Christopher |last26=Gerritsen |first26=Fokke |last27=Bejenaru |first27=Luminita |last28=Bl\u00fcher |first28=Matthias |last29=Campbell |first29=Archie |last30=Cavalleri |first30=Gianpiero |last31=Comas |first31=David |last32=Froguel |first32=Philippe |last33=Gilbert |first33=Edmund |last34=Kerr |first34=Shona M. |last35=Kovacs |first35=Peter |last36=Krause |first36=Johannes |last37=McGettigan |first37=Darren |last38=Merrigan |first38=Michael |last39=Merriwether |first39=D.

(2014), both the African ancestry (Ethiopic) and the non-African ancestry (Ethio-Somali) in Cushitic speaking populations is significantly differentiated from all neighboring African and non-African ancestries in East Africa, North Africa, the Levant and Arabia. The genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking populations in the Horn of Africa represents ancestries (Ethiopic and Ethio-Somali) not found outside of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations in any significance. Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al states:\n<blockquote>\"The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia.\"<ref name=pmid24921250/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Hodgson et al. (2014), the non-African ancestry (Ethio-Somali) in the Cushitic speaking populations is distinct and unique to Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations. Hodgson et al states:\n<blockquote>\"We find that most of the non-African ancestry in the HOA can be assigned to a distinct non-African origin Ethio-Somali ancestry component, which is found at its highest frequencies in Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\"<ref name=pmid24921250/></blockquote>\n\nWhen calculated the genetic distance (FST) between Ethiosemitic-speaking and Cushitic-speaking Ethiopians, and populations of the Levant, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula using two approaches: (1) the whole genome and (2) only the non-African component\u2014in the whole-genome analysis, Ethiopian Semitic and Cushitic populations appear to be closest to the Yemeni; when only the non-African component is used, they are closer to the Egyptians and populations inhabiting the Levant.<ref name=\"Pagani et al 2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Pagani |first1=Luca |last2=Kivisild |first2=Toomas |last3=Tarekegn |first3=Ayele |last4=Ekong |first4=Rosemary |last5=Plaster |first5=Chris |last6=Gallego\u00a0Romero |first6=Irene |last7=Ayub |first7=Qasim |last8=Mehdi |first8=S.

Known as the ''Coptic'' component, it peaks among Egyptian Copts who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. The Coptic component evolved out of a main Northeast African and Middle Eastern ancestral component that is shared by other Egyptians and also found at high frequencies among Cushites (\u224840\u201360%), with the remaining 40-60% of the ancestry of Cushites being of sub-Saharan East African origin. However, these percentages are not certain since Figure 3 of the study by Dobon et al. only features these percentages in the k=3 model.<ref name=pmid26017457/>\n\nAccording to Dobon et al (2015), the results were not conclusive and states that there needs to be more studies on the East African samples. Dobon et al states:\n<blockquote>\"Our main results add new and interesting features to the North East African genetic complexity, with new populations that define a genetic component in southern Nilo-Saharan speakers that cannot be related to a North-African or other sub-Saharan components. These populations should be included in further population genetics and epidemiological studies to have a representative sample of the genetic diversity of the region of East Africa.\"<ref name=pmid26017457/></blockquote>\n\nThe scientists involved in the study suggest that this points to a common origin for the general population of Egypt.<ref name=pmid26017457/> They also associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians.<ref name=pmid26017457/> The Coptic component is roughly equivalent with the Ethio-Somali component.<ref name=pmid24921250/>\n\n{{See also|Nilotic_peoples#Genetics}}\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Horn of Africa]]\n* [[Abyssinian people]]\n* [[Nilotic peoples]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Cushitic-speaking peoples]]\n[[Category:Habesha peoples]]\n[[Category:Semitic-speaking peoples]]\n[[Category:Afroasiatic peoples]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushitic_peoples"}
