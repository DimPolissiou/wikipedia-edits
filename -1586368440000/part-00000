The TV series was created for [[HBO]] by [[Damon Lindelof]], who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Andrew Howard]], Jacob Ming-Trent, [[Tom Mison]], [[Sara Vickers]], Dylan Schombing, [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Jean Smart]] and [[Hong Chau]] joining the cast in later episodes.\n\nLindelof likened the television series to a \"[[remix]]\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel, which takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts that create a new story within the ''Watchmen'' continuity, rather than creating a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 2019. A [[white supremacist]] group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the [[Tulsa Police Department]] because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and superior, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around [[vigilantism]].\n\nThe series, originally promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Watchmen'' takes place 34 years after the events of [[Watchmen|the comic series]]. Set in the comic's [[alternate history]] of the 20th century, [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], once seen as heroes, have been outlawed due to their violent methods. In 1985, Adrian Veidt, formerly known as the vigilante [[Ozymandias (Watchmen)|Ozymandias]], created a fake attack on [[New York City]] by a [[List of Watchmen characters#Alien Monster|squid-like alien]] that resulted in millions within New York being killed, coercing nations to work together against a common threat and to avert a [[nuclear holocaust]]. Veidt's actions disgusted his former companions, with [[Rorschach (character)|Rorschach]] planning to tell the world of Veidt's misdeeds before he is vaporized by [[Doctor Manhattan]], who subsequently left the planet, unaware Rorschach had sent his journal to be published beforehand.\n\nThe show takes place in 2019 [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. A [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] group, the Seventh Kavalry, inspired by Rorschach's writings and masked image, wage violent war against minorities and the police that enforce special [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] for victims of racial injustice. On Christmas Eve 2016, during an event that came to be known as the \"White Night\", the Kavalry attacked the homes of 40 [[police officer]]s working for the [[Tulsa Police Department]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Why the White Night Is a Chilling Turning Point in Watchmen's Alt-History |url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a29612697/white-night-watchmen-hbo-show-explained/ |website=Esquire |first=Brady |last=Langmann |date=October 28, 2019 |accessdate=October 29, 2019}}</ref> Of those who survived, only two stayed with the force: Detective Angela Abar and Police Chief Judd Crawford.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/10/27/20934540/watchmen-season-1-episode-2-recap-review-explained |title=Take a close look at Watchmen episode 2 |first=Eric |last=Thurm |date=October 28, 2019 |accessdate=October 28, 2019 |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref> As the police force was rebuilt, laws were passed that required police to not disclose their profession and to protect their identities while on the job by wearing masks, which includes allowing for costumed police officers.<ref name=\"ew deep dive\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Watchmen characters}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| total_width = 500\n| perrow    = 4\n| footer    = The principal cast for ''Watchmen'' includes (top row, left to right) [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Jean Smart]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], (bottom row, left to right) [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Hong Chau]], [[Louis Gossett Jr.]], and [[Jeremy Irons]].\n| image1    = Regina_King_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image2    = Don_Johnson_TIFF_2019.jpg\n| image3    = Jean_Smart_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image4    = Yahya_Abdul-Mateen_II_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg\n| image5    = Tim Blake Nelson 2016.jpg\n| image6    = Hong Chau 2016 cropped.jpg\n| image7    = Louis Gossett Jr. (Guadalajara Film Festival) 2.jpg\n| image8    = SDCC_2015_-_Jeremy_Irons_(19524260758)_(cropped).jpg\n}}\n\n===Main===\n<!--- Cast and order per closing credits, starting from pilot episode, new cast members will be add to bottom as closing credits change, per MOS:TVCAST--->\n* [[Regina King]] as Angela Abar / Sister Night, a Tulsa Police [[detective]] who wears a [[nun]]'s [[Religious habit|habit]] and a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].

Ninety-eight years later, masked Officer Charlie Sutton is hospitalized after being shot by a member of the Seventh Kavalry. Chief Judd Crawford calls for retaliation to hunt down the shooter. Angela Abar hears of the shooting and hunts down a suspect under her secret persona, Sister Night. With help from another costumed police officer, Wade Tillman/Looking Glass, Angela elicits the shooter's location at a cattle ranch used by the Kavalry. Angela, Judd and other officers hunt them down, instigating a shootout that results in the deaths of all Kavalry members present, including the shooter. Sometime after the shootout, Judd runs over a spike strip while driving to the hospital to visit Sutton. Angela receives a call from someone who instructs her to find something at a countryside tree. She heads to the location, where she finds an elderly black man in a wheelchair below a hanged Judd.

In the present, Angela takes the elderly man she found under the tree to her hideout. He says his name is Will and claims to be her grandfather, which she later validates.

Hooded Justice's identity was never established in the limited series, and Lindelof's suggestion that he was a black man created a challenge for the writers. One of the first tasks the writing staff had was to determine how Will would become Hooded Justice, effectively establishing the plot to the sixth episode \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\".<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> To further tie to the limited series, the writing staff only considered using the established characters that would best serve Angela's story so that she would remain the focus.<ref name=\"thr ep7\"/> To that end, they had established that characters like Doctor Manhattan, Laurie Blake, and Adrian Veidt were necessary to support Angela's discovery of her legacy. They had considered including Dan Dreiberg, the second [[Nite Owl]], as well, but Lindelof wanted to have a fair balance of old and new characters within the show, and felt that adding Dan would have tipped the balance too far away from the new characters. They did consider Dan's fate as part of the \"Peteypedia\" additional materials created by the show's writers, in which Dan remains in prison after he and Laurie were arrested for vigilantism in the past, and refusing to accept the FBI's offer to work with them as Laurie had done.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-dan-dreiberg-isnt-in-watchmen-hbo/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why Dan Dreiberg Wasn't in ''Watchmen'' |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nLindelof used his experience from his past shows to plot out the season prior to writing, stating \"What I've learned over time is you need to know the answers to the mysteries...If you don't know those, you're lost.

After completing the sixth episode, \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\", Lindelof felt the story was closer to its ending rather than as a midpoint, and that if they continued for four additional episodes, one of them would have been [[filler (media)|filler]], and instead opted to conclude the story with three episodes. The omitted episode would have likely covered more of Lady Trieu's backstory, according to Lindelof, though it would not have been exclusively devoted to that topic. Instead, some of this material was covered in conversations within the seventh episode \"[[An Almost Religious Awe]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-watchmen-was-9-episodes-instead-of-10/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why ''Watchmen'' Was Shortened to 9 Episodes Instead of the Original 10 |first=Adam |last=Chitwood |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nA show-within-the-show, ''American Hero Story'', was used to tell the purported backstory of Hooded Justice. Writer Cord Jefferson said ''American Hero Story'' was meant to be the opposite to what they were creating for the actual show, a \"cheesy\" production that perpetuated the in-universe myth of Hooded Justice being a white man.<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> Lindelof said the show was designed to be comparable to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[American Crime Story]]'', and had even considered bringing in Murphy to play himself as the producer of ''American Hero Story''. He opted against this, but still treated ''American Hero Story'' like a Murphy work, and taking its producer to be somewhat secretive and seclusive, like Murphy.<ref name=\"ahs\"/> Some media critics took the ''American Hero Story'' segments to be a parody of [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[Watchmen (film)|2009 live-action adaption of ''Watchmen'']], a work generally panned by fans of the comic, but Lindelof and Kassell asserted this was not their intent. Kassell said \"I fully admire [Snyder] as a filmmaker so to hear that it could even be used as a negative comment feels terrible. What I was wanting to do with those (American Hero Story scenes) is like, 'This is the version we could make,' and we are very concretely not making that version.

Peteypedia was developed after most of the filming was completed, with writer [[Jeff Jensen]] overseeing it. The writing team were aware they had developed too much information that would fit into the broadcast show and debated how to present this, including as post-credit scenes or through [[social media]]. At the same time, HBO was working with Reznor and Ross on how to release the albums and were considering including additional [[liner note]]s in the vinyl releases, which included the additional background material the writers had developed. This led to creating reports and clippings similar to those presented in the original ''Watchmen'' comic, and presenting this as part of Peteypedia.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/how-watchmen-made-peteypedia.html |title=How Watchmen Built Out Its Universe With Peteypedia |first=Jackson |last=McHenry |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref> Peteypedia allowed them, for example, to explain Laurie's trajectory from being the second Silk Spectre and fighting crime with Nite Owl at the end of the comic series, to becoming an FBI agent, elements of this that they had written briefly into the show but did not have broadcast time to spell out.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/> They also tied elements back to the original comic. Of note is the fictional novel ''Fogdancing'' written in-universe by Max Shea, one of the people that Veidt had used to device the squid attack in 1985. Jensen said that in the extra material with the graphic novel, ''Fogdancing'' had been made into a film at least twice, so the writers considered the work to be seminal to the characters in the television series, having the book appear at least twice during the show. Jensen created a whole plot summary of the work based on minimal clues from the comic, making the work to be about super-soldiers and having it tie to the idea of the ''Watchmen'' superhero culture.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/>\n\n===Continuation===\nWhile HBO had not yet confirmed a second season following the show's broadcast, Lindelof stated that if there were, he would not likely be back for it, but instead have another producer step forward to tell another story set in this universe.

The TV series was created for [[HBO]] by [[Damon Lindelof]], who also served as an executive producer and writer. Its [[ensemble cast]] includes [[Regina King]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Tim Blake Nelson]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], [[Andrew Howard]], Jacob Ming-Trent, [[Tom Mison]], [[Sara Vickers]], Dylan Schombing, [[Louis Gossett Jr.]] and [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Jean Smart]] and [[Hong Chau]] joining the cast in later episodes.\n\nLindelof likened the television series to a \"[[remix]]\" of the original comic series. While the series is technically a sequel, which takes place 34 years after the events of the comics within the same alternate reality, Lindelof wanted to introduce new characters and conflicts that create a new story within the ''Watchmen'' continuity, rather than creating a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. The series focuses on events surrounding racist violence in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], in 2019. A [[white supremacist]] group called the Seventh Kavalry has taken up arms against the [[Tulsa Police Department]] because of perceived racial injustices, causing the police to conceal their identities with masks to prevent the Seventh Kavalry from targeting them in their homes following the \"White Night\". Angela Abar (King), a detective known as Sister Night, investigates the murder of her friend and superior, Judd Crawford (Johnson), and discovers secrets regarding the situations around [[vigilantism]].\n\nThe series, originally promoted by HBO as an ongoing drama series, premiered on October 20, 2019, before concluding its nine-episode run on December 15. Lindelof left his role as showrunner after the first season, stating that he had completed his intended story. HBO subsequently confirmed there are no further plans for the show to continue without Lindelof returning in some capacity, and reclassified the work as a limited series with possible future installments.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Watchmen'' takes place 34 years after the events of [[Watchmen|the comic series]]. Set in the comic's [[alternate history]] of the 20th century, [[Vigilantism|vigilantes]], once seen as heroes, have been outlawed due to their violent methods.

In looking for a similar anxiety for contemporary times, Lindelof determined that [[Racism|racial tensions]] posed the same type of larger picture that would work well for the ''Watchmen'' universe, since it presented both historical and present conflicts.

Hooded Justice's identity was never established in the limited series, and Lindelof's suggestion that he was a black man created a challenge for the writers. One of the first tasks the writing staff had was to determine how Will would become Hooded Justice, effectively establishing the plot to the sixth episode \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\".<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> To further tie to the limited series, the writing staff only considered using the established characters that would best serve Angela's story so that she would remain the focus.<ref name=\"thr ep7\"/> To that end, they had established that characters like Doctor Manhattan, Laurie Blake, and Adrian Veidt were necessary to support Angela's discovery of her legacy. They had considered including Dan Dreiberg, the second [[Nite Owl]], as well, but Lindelof wanted to have a fair balance of old and new characters within the show, and felt that adding Dan would have tipped the balance too far away from the new characters. They did consider Dan's fate as part of the \"Peteypedia\" additional materials created by the show's writers, in which Dan remains in prison after he and Laurie were arrested for vigilantism in the past, and refusing to accept the FBI's offer to work with them as Laurie had done.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-dan-dreiberg-isnt-in-watchmen-hbo/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why Dan Dreiberg Wasn't in ''Watchmen'' |first=Matt |last=Goldberg |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nLindelof used his experience from his past shows to plot out the season prior to writing, stating \"What I've learned over time is you need to know the answers to the mysteries...If you don't know those, you're lost.

After completing the sixth episode, \"[[This Extraordinary Being]]\", Lindelof felt the story was closer to its ending rather than as a midpoint, and that if they continued for four additional episodes, one of them would have been [[filler (media)|filler]], and instead opted to conclude the story with three episodes. The omitted episode would have likely covered more of Lady Trieu's backstory, according to Lindelof, though it would not have been exclusively devoted to that topic. Instead, some of this material was covered in conversations within the seventh episode \"[[An Almost Religious Awe]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/why-watchmen-was-9-episodes-instead-of-10/ |title=Damon Lindelof Explains Why ''Watchmen'' Was Shortened to 9 Episodes Instead of the Original 10 |first=Adam |last=Chitwood |date=December 17, 2019 |access-date=December 17, 2019 |work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]}}</ref>\n\nA show-within-the-show, ''American Hero Story'', was used to tell the purported backstory of Hooded Justice. Writer Cord Jefferson said ''American Hero Story'' was meant to be the opposite to what they were creating for the actual show, a \"cheesy\" production that perpetuated the in-universe myth of Hooded Justice being a white man.<ref name=\"vulture ep6\"/> Lindelof said the show was designed to be comparable to [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s series ''[[American Horror Story]]'' and ''[[American Crime Story]]'', and had even considered bringing in Murphy to play himself as the producer of ''American Hero Story''. He opted against this, but still treated ''American Hero Story'' like a Murphy work, and taking its producer to be somewhat secretive and seclusive, like Murphy.<ref name=\"ahs\"/> Some media critics took the ''American Hero Story'' segments to be a parody of [[Zack Snyder]]'s [[Watchmen (film)|2009 live-action adaption of ''Watchmen'']], a work generally panned by fans of the comic, but Lindelof and Kassell asserted this was not their intent. Kassell said \"I fully admire [Snyder] as a filmmaker so to hear that it could even be used as a negative comment feels terrible. What I was wanting to do with those (American Hero Story scenes) is like, 'This is the version we could make,' and we are very concretely not making that version.

Peteypedia was developed after most of the filming was completed, with writer [[Jeff Jensen]] overseeing it. The writing team were aware they had developed too much information that would fit into the broadcast show and debated how to present this, including as post-credit scenes or through [[social media]]. At the same time, HBO was working with Reznor and Ross on how to release the albums and were considering including additional [[liner note]]s in the vinyl releases, which included the additional background material the writers had developed. This led to creating reports and clippings similar to those presented in the original ''Watchmen'' comic, and presenting this as part of Peteypedia.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/12/how-watchmen-made-peteypedia.html |title=How Watchmen Built Out Its Universe With Peteypedia |first=Jackson |last=McHenry |date=December 20, 2019 |accessdate=December 23, 2019 |work=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]}}</ref> Peteypedia allowed them, for example, to explain Laurie's trajectory from being the second Silk Spectre and fighting crime with Nite Owl at the end of the comic series, to becoming an FBI agent, elements of this that they had written briefly into the show but did not have broadcast time to spell out.<ref name=\"vulture peteypedia\"/> They also tied elements back to the original comic. Of note is the fictional novel ''Fogdancing'' written in-universe by Max Shea, one of the people that Veidt had used to device the squid attack in 1985. Jensen said that in the extra material with the graphic novel, ''Fogdancing'' had been made into a film at least twice, so the writers considered the work to be seminal to the characters in the television series, having the book appear at least twice during the show.

In regards to verb morphology, Romani follows exactly the same pattern of northwestern languages such as [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers, lending credence to the theory of their Central Indian origin and a subsequent migration to northwestern India.

In 1935, the [[Nuremberg laws]] stripped the Romani people living in [[Nazi Germany]] of their citizenship, after which they were subjected to violence, imprisonment in [[concentration camp]]s and later genocide in [[extermination camp]]s. The policy was extended in areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably the Independent State of Croatia, Romania, and Hungary.\n\nBecause no accurate pre-war census figures exist for the Romanis, it is impossible to accurately assess the actual number of victims. Most estimates for numbers of Romani victims of the Holocaust fall between 200,000 and 500,000, although figures ranging between 90,000 and 1.5 million have been proposed. Lower estimates do not include those killed in all Axis-controlled countries.

Sesky was driving a 1950s [[Brockway Motor Company|Brockway]] diesel [[Semi-trailer truck|truck]] tractor with a {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[semi-trailer]] and was headed down [[Pennsylvania Route 307|Rt. 307]] when he lost control. That section of Rt. 307 contains a two-mile descent extending from [[Lake Scranton]] to the bottom of Moosic Street that includes a drop in elevation of more than {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} in less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on|adj=on}}.

Sesky was thrown from the truck and killed<ref name=leader/> and bananas were spilled and strewn when the rig came to rest; 15 others were injured but only Sesky died. The road was closed for cleanup<ref name=scrtimes/> as Johnson's Towing Company helped out in the recovery. Trucks over 21,000 lbs were required to go down the hill in first, low gear. Trucks over 21,000 lb (10.5 t) are no longer allowed to travel that route (they must use [[Interstate 380 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 380]] via [[Dunmore, Pennsylvania|Dunmore]]).\n\n==Song==\nThe song portrays a [[fiction]]al account of the incident played in the form of a [[Country music|country song]]. With each verse, the song gets faster to, as Chapin explained in the live recording, \"build up intensity and excitement.\" During the chorus, Chapin sings the phrase \"thirty-thousand pounds\" followed by [[John Wallace (musician)|Big John Wallace]] singing the bass line \"of bananas.\" During concerts, the audience was encouraged to shout this refrain.\n\n===Content===\nA young truck driver is driving \"just after dark\" during his \"second job\" to deliver a load of bananas to Scranton, which is described as a \"[[Coal mining|coal-scarred]] city where children play without despair in back-yard [[slag]] piles,\" the population of which consumes about {{convert|30,000|lb|tonne|abbr=off}} of bananas daily. While approaching Scranton, he passes a sign he \"should have seen\" reading: \"Shift to [[low gear]] or [[Traffic ticket|fifty-dollar fine]], my friend,\" because he is too busy thinking about seeing his wife after his trip. He begins to travel down the \"two-mile drop\" road to the bottom of the hill. Suddenly, the truck begins to go faster down the hill, and the driver tries to apply the [[brake]]s, only to discover that they are not working.

The load was destined for the [[The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company|A&P produce Warehouse]] in South Side<ref name=leader/><ref name=leader/><ref>{{cite news|title=1 Killed and 15 Injured in Runaway Accident|last=Carden|first=Terry|date=1965-03-19|df=mdy|newspaper=The Scranton Times}}</ref>. Sesky was driving a 1950s [[Brockway Motor Company|Brockway]] diesel [[Semi-trailer truck|truck]] tractor with a {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[semi-trailer]] and was headed down [[Pennsylvania Route 307|Rt. 307]] when he lost control. That section of Rt. 307 contains a two-mile descent extending from [[Lake Scranton]] to the bottom of Moosic Street that includes a drop in elevation of more than {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} in less than {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=on|adj=on}}.  Sesky was unable to control the truck's speed down the hill due to a mechanical failure, variously attributed to the truck's brake system<ref name=leader/><ref name=scrtimes/> or its clutch.<ref name=wnep/>  As a result, the truck cruised into Scranton at approximately {{convert|90|mph||abbr=on}}, sideswiping a number of cars before it crashed into a house<ref name=leader/> at the southwest corner of Moosic St and S. Irving Ave ({{Coord|41.4000|N|75.6550|W|display=inline,title}}),<ref name=\"wnep\"/> close to the bottom of the hill.  Witnesses reported that Sesky did everything possible to avoid pedestrians and other motorists,<ref name=wnep/> including climbing out onto the truck's running board to try to warn people,<ref name=leader/> and some have suggested that he may have deliberately flipped the truck over to avoid striking either bystanders or an automotive [[Filling station|service station]]<ref name=songplaces>{{cite web|url=http://www.songplaces.com/30_000_Pounds_Of_Bananas/Moosic_Street_Scranton_Pennsylvania|title=30,000 Pounds Of Bananas by Harry Chapin in Moosic Street, Scranton, Pennsylvania|last=Suwak|first=Jeff|website=Songplaces.com|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> on Moosic Street that could have exploded in flames, causing a greater loss of life. Sesky was thrown from the truck and killed<ref name=leader/> and bananas were spilled and strewn when the rig came to rest; 15 others were injured but only Sesky died. The road was closed for cleanup<ref name=scrtimes/> as Johnson's Towing Company helped out in the recovery. Trucks over 21,000 lbs were required to go down the hill in first, low gear. Trucks over 21,000 lb (10.5 t) are no longer allowed to travel that route (they must use [[Interstate 380 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 380]] via [[Dunmore, Pennsylvania|Dunmore]]).\n\n==Song==\nThe song portrays a [[fiction]]al account of the incident played in the form of a [[Country music|country song]]. With each verse, the song gets faster to, as Chapin explained in the live recording, \"build up intensity and excitement.\" During the chorus, Chapin sings the phrase \"thirty-thousand pounds\" followed by [[John Wallace (musician)|Big John Wallace]] singing the bass line \"of bananas.\" During concerts, the audience was encouraged to shout this refrain.\n\n===Content===\nA young truck driver is driving \"just after dark\" during his \"second job\" to deliver a load of bananas to Scranton, which is described as a \"[[Coal mining|coal-scarred]] city where children play without despair in back-yard [[slag]] piles,\" the population of which consumes about {{convert|30,000|lb|tonne|abbr=off}} of bananas daily. While approaching Scranton, he passes a sign he \"should have seen\" reading: \"Shift to [[low gear]] or [[Traffic ticket|fifty-dollar fine]], my friend,\" because he is too busy thinking about seeing his wife after his trip. He begins to travel down the \"two-mile drop\" road to the bottom of the hill. Suddenly, the truck begins to go faster down the hill, and the driver tries to apply the [[brake]]s, only to discover that they are not working. He says, \"[[Christ]]!\" who ironically is \"the only Man who could save him now\" as the load of bananas push against the truck causing it to pick up speed. Cruising into Scranton at \"about ninety miles an hour,\" he almost strikes a passing bus. The driver then prays twice to God to make the event all a dream before he \"sideswiped nineteen neat-parked cars / Clipped off thirteen [[Utility pole|telephone poles]] / Hit two houses, bruised eight trees / And [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Association|Blue-Cross]]ed seven people.\" He is killed and [[decapitation|decapitated]] in the accident, and {{convert|400|yd|m|abbr=off}} of the hill is smeared with his load of bananas.<ref name=leader/>\n\nThe song's epilogue tells the story how Chapin first heard of the event aboard a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] coming out of Scranton some months later. An old man sitting next to Chapin implores him to imagine \"30,000 pounds of mashed bananas.\"\n\nMany details in the song correspond closely to the actual incident,<ref name=songplaces/> but others are invented or fictionalized.  In particular, Sesky was not actually decapitated in the accident.<ref name=leader/>\n\n===Alternate endings===\nIn the live performance from the album ''[[Greatest Stories Live]],'' Chapin sings two alternate endings to the song he originally had in mind, explaining to the audience that the rest of the band was less than enthusiastic about them, with his brothers [[Tom Chapin|Tom]] and [[Steve Chapin|Steve]] each offering the summary dismissal, \"Harry, it sucks!\" The first alternate ending uses ''[[Yes! We Have No Bananas]]'' as the punchline of the song.\n\nThe second ending is described by Chapin as a \"country-western\" ending about \"motherhood\", because the song \"already had a truck.\" It deals with a young mother crying while watching her child sleeping. The woman is presumably the truck driver's widow and, because of her sorrow over the accident, \"though she lives in Scranton, Pennsylvania / she never, ever eats bananas.\" During concerts, Chapin divided the audience during this ending, usually turning it into a contest between men and women with regard to singing skill. The second alternate ending has everyone sing \"of Bananas!\" in harmony, swelling to a climax and cutting off.\n\nA third alternate ending surfaced later, in which Chapin would often introduce with a monologue about [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]], and the technical definition of the word \"[[Wikt:suck|sucks]]\". The third alternate ending is a parody of a [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita banana]] commercial, done in \"[[Jimmy Buffett]] style,\" with the participation of the whole band.
