He drives to Birmingham New Street station, and boards the London train. After walking all day, he sleeps outside a shop. In the morning, he throws his phone into a lake, bins his bank cards (eventually retaining a family photo) but keeps his money. That night, drinking in the park, he is attacked by a gang; fleeing, he runs into a tree, injuring himself. The next morning, waiting in [[emergency department|A&E]], Aiden disturbs the receptionist, then starts talking to Tom before tom is called for examination. When Tom leaves, Aidan follows him.\n\nWalking together, Aidan goes to urinate. Tom, seeing his chance, flees, spots a couple having sex and runs into Aidan again. When Tom faints, Aidan takes him to his flat and gives him a beer. Aidan's 'girlfriend' Linda comes home, surprising Tom, who saw her having sex. She is displeased Aidan made little money, punches him and says to throw Tom out. Tom leaves and trys to buy a tea. Finding his pocket empty, he returns to the flat. Linda denies knowledge of the money, will not let him look for it and smirks as he leaves.\n\nAfter begging for change, he buys tea in a caf\u00e9. Aidan enters with a cat carrier and offers mousecatching. The manager takes him out the back and attacks him. Tom hears the assault and checks his health. Aidan realizes the cat, which belongs to Aidan\u2019s elderly neighbour, is missing. They find it dead and buy a kitten for the cat's owner, who yells at them to leave.\n\nAidan takes Tom to a shop to shows him a drum kit he is saving up for. Tom tells him to leave him alone. Depressed, he takes out the family picture, and a bank card falls out. Tom goes to a cash machine. He goes back to Aidan's flat, apologizes, and asks to stay, offering \u00a3200. Aidan tells Linda Tom is staying and has paid \u00a3100 pounds upfront (keeping the rest for his kit), and they all celebrate. However Aiden, drunk, tells Linda that he received \u00a3200 and is savings towards a drum kit. Linda also realizes that Tom is \"Mr. Moneybags\" and propositions him. Tom upset, goes to bed. \n\nThe next day, Aidan takes Tom to the [[Horniman Museum]], where they see the natural history and musical instrument collections, and enjoy making music with the instruments for public use. Another day, Aidan empties his savings account, but is seen with the money by the man Linda was having sex with, who may have been following him. As Aidan walks home, the man attacks and robs him. Tom finds out what happened and realizes it was Linda's friend. Linda returns home with bags full of designer clothes. Tom then tells Aidan that Linda stole his money. Aidan shouts at Linda and she hits and kicks him. When Tom protests, Linda threatens hims with relatiation. Tom then menaces Linda with a knife and half chokes her. She has an asthma attack. Aidan tries to get her inhaler, but drops it and knocks it under the fridge. Linda looks like she will die as they poke for it. Although she recovers, Aidan kicks her out.\n\nAidan goes to the shop to see the drum kit, but finds it has been sold. Aidan goes home and finds Tom gone, which makes him more upset. Entering his bedroom, he finds the kit with a thank you note from Tom. The film ends with Aidan drumming and Tom walking to a platform and boarding the train home.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]] as Tom\n*[[Aidan Gillen]] as Aidan\n*[[Riann Steele]] as Linda\n* Chris Wade as Drug Dealer (and the man who steals Aidan's money)\n* Judy Norman as Clairvoyant\n* Carrie Cohen as Mrs Brophy, the elderly neighbour\t\n* Cristina Catalina as Waitress\t\n* Taylan Halici as Caf\u00e9 Owner\t\n* Liz Fleming as Ruby\t\n* Spencer Cowan<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542486/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=''Full Cast & Crew''|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2014-09-21}}</ref> as Honeytrap Thug\n* Atli Gunnarsson as Thug\t\n* Lucas Hansen as Thug\t\n* Steven James Tyler as Thug\n\n==Reception==\n[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, writing, \"A low-key portrait of a south-east London odd-job man with a big performance by Aidan Gillen, and the return of promising film-maker Jamie Thraves.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/14/treacle-jr-review | title = ''Treacle Jr'' - review | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Peter Bradshaw]] | accessdate = 2017-01-09}}</ref> \nIt currently holds an 83% positive review on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/treacle_jr/|title=''Treacle Jr. Review''|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{allmovie|528098}}\n* {{IMDb title|1542486}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|treacle_jr}}\n\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:British independent films]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Treacle Jr.\n| image          =\n| caption        =\n| director       = [[Jamie Thraves]]\n| writer         = [[Jamie Thraves]]\n| starring       = [[Aidan Gillen ]]<br>[[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]]<br>[[Riann Steele]]\n| music          =\n| cinematography =\n| editing        =\n| producer       = Rob Small\n| distributor    = \n| released       = {{Start date|2011|7|11}}\n| runtime        = 85 minutes\n| country        = United Kingdom\n| language       = English\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n\n'''''Treacle Jr.''''' is a British 2011 film written and directed by [[Jamie Thraves]] and starring [[Aidan Gillen]], [[Tom Fisher (actor)|Tom Fisher]], and [[Riann Steele]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Clarke|first1=Cath|title=Treacle Jr|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/treacle-jr|accessdate=9 September 2014|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|date=12 July 2011}}</ref> It was filmed on location in [[Southwark]], [[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1542486/?ref_=nv_sr_1|title=''Treacle Jr. Review''|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2014-09-09}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with Tom eating breakfast with his family.

Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they can compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term \"gaming\" can refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional and digital forms, through [[online gambling]]. There are many different gamer communities around the world. Since the advent of the Internet, many communities take the form of [[Internet forum]]s or [[YouTube]] or [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[virtual communities]], as well as [[Real life#As distinct from the Internet|in-person]] [[social clubs]]. Originally a hobby, it has evolved into a [[Professional gamer|profession]] for some.\n\n== Origin of the term ''gamer'' ==\nThe term ''gamer'' originally meant ''[[gambling|gambler]]'', and has been in use since at least 1422, when the town laws of [[Walsall]], England, referred to \"any dice-player, carder, tennis player, or other unlawful gamer\". However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as [[wargame]]s. Wargames were originally created as a military and strategy tool.

However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online [[live streaming]] of their games. These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer.  Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Hitbox]], [[Mixer.com|Mixer]] and [[YouTube]]. Professional gamers with particularly large followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams. An example of this is shown through retired professional [[League of Legends]] player, Wei Han-Dong also known as \"CaoMei\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/3/7149137/league-of-legends-pro-player-retires-to-stream|title=League of Legends pro-player retires to stream games for more than $800,000|last=emilygera|date=2014-11-03|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Han-Dong had decided to retire from [[Esports]] due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming.

They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]].

They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it such as Atrox, the God of Knowledge..\nThe [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Avatar==\n{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}\n{{See also|Player character}}\nCreating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|title=26 Important Steps To Become A Pro Gamer|date=2018-08-13|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121040/https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a [[middle name]], such as [[Ninja (video game player)|Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins]] or [[sinatraa|Jay \"sinatraa\" Won]].\n\nSimilarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\n==Clans and guilds==\nA [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\n==Identity==\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].<ref name=\"overlandClueless\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"[[cinemaphile]]\".<ref name=\"escapistPublisherNote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming|access-date=2015-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117150925/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|archive-date=2016-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\">{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014|access-date=2015-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123185112/http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"newmediaDoYou\">{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

Some gamers are competitive, meaning that they can compete in some games for money. In some countries, such as the UK and Australia, the term \"gaming\" can refer to legalized [[gambling]], which can take both traditional and digital forms, through [[online gambling]].

However, this description has not been adopted in the United States, where it became associated with other pastimes. In the US, they made their appearance as [[wargame]]s. Wargames were originally created as a military and strategy tool.

However, oftentimes, these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options. One such option is found through online [[live streaming]] of their games. These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream, usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer.  Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], [[Hitbox]], [[Mixer.com|Mixer]] and [[YouTube]]. Professional gamers with particularly large followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams. An example of this is shown through retired professional [[League of Legends]] player, Wei Han-Dong also known as \"CaoMei\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/3/7149137/league-of-legends-pro-player-retires-to-stream|title=League of Legends pro-player retires to stream games for more than $800,000|last=emilygera|date=2014-11-03|website=Polygon|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref> Han-Dong had decided to retire from [[Esports]] due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming.

They may also be called ''classic gamers'' or ''[[wikt:old school|old-school]] gamers'', which are terms that are more prevalent in the [[United States]]. The games are played on the original hardware, on modern hardware via [[Video game console emulator|emulation]], or on modern hardware via [[Porting|ports]] or compilations (though those 'in the hobby' tend toward original hardware and emulation).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/articles/columns/game/gars-07142004.ars|title=NES Classics: retro gaming, at a price: Page 1|publisher=arstechnica.com|accessdate=2008-04-14|date=2004-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607203445/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2004/07/gars-07142004.ars|archive-date=2011-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Classification in taxonomies===\n\nA number of [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gaymers-Difference-Makes-Video-Players-ebook/dp/B0192KWP06/182-5342459-6520231|title=Gaymers: the Difference a 'Y' Makes: How (and Why) to Make Video Games LGBT Players Care About|last=Nowak|first=Paul S.|date=2015-12-07|publisher=Prince Pocket Press|edition=1|language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bartle taxonomy of player types]] classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game:\n* [[Achiever]]s, who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters, collecting all rewards and [[game badge]]s.\n* [[Explorers]], who like to discover all areas within the game, including [[Secret level|hidden areas]] and [[glitch]]es, and expose all game mechanics.\n* Socializers, who prefer to play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself.\n* Beaters, who thrive on competition with other players.\n* Completionists, who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types. They complete every aspect of the game (main story, side quests, achievements) while finding every secret within it such as Atrox, the God of Knowledge..\nThe [[MDA framework]] describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions (''Mechanics''), how they build up during game to develop the [[gameplay]] (''Dynamics''), and what emotional response they convey to the player (''Aesthetics''). The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation, Fantasy, Narrative, Challenge, Fellowship, Discovery, Expression and Submission. [[Jesse Schell]] extends this classification with Anticipation, [[Schadenfreude]], Gift giving, Humour, Possibility, Pride, Purification, Surprise, Thrill, Perseverance and Wonder, and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePcYCwAAQBAJ|title=The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses, Second Edition|last=Schell|first=Jesse|date=2015-09-15|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781498759564|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Avatar==\n{{Main|Avatar (computing)}}\n{{See also|Player character}}\nCreating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|title=26 Important Steps To Become A Pro Gamer|date=2018-08-13|website=TheGamer|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190119121040/https://www.thegamer.com/pro-gamer-steps-important/|archive-date=2019-01-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An avatar, username, game name, alias, gamer tag, screen name, or handle is a name (usually a [[pseudonym]]) adopted by a video gamer, used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community. Usage of user names is most prevalent in games with [[online multiplayer]] support, or at [[electronic sport]] conventions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle, a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a [[middle name]], such as [[Ninja (video game player)|Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins]] or [[sinatraa|Jay \"sinatraa\" Won]].\n\nSimilarly, a ''clan tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan. Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans.  They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another.  Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other.  A ''team tag'' is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team.  Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation.  These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League (C.A.L.) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League (C.P.L.) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans.\n\n==Clans and guilds==\nA [[Clan (video games)|clan]], squad or [[guild]] is a group of players that form, usually under an informal 'leader' or administrator.  Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests; many clans or guilds form to connect an 'offline' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic, cultural or physical barriers. Some clans are composed of [[E-sports|professional gamers]], who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes; most, however, are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose (for example, a gaming-related interest or social group).\n\n==Identity==\nThe identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly [[performativity]] of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games, but also preferences for certain types of games, as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> According to [[Graeme Kirkpatrick]], the \"true gamer\" is concerned first and foremost with [[gameplay]].<ref name=\"overlandClueless\"/> ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them, similar in connotation to \"[[cinemaphile]]\".<ref name=\"escapistPublisherNote\">{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|last=Macris|first=Alexander|work=The Escapist|title=Publisher's Note: The State of Gaming|access-date=2015-12-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117150925/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/12223-The-Escapist-Publisher-Issues-Public-Statement-on-Gamergate|archive-date=2016-01-17|url-status=live}}</ref> People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they don't play \"enough\" to qualify.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\"/> Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \"gamer\", even though they may play regularly.<ref name=\"adaNotGamers\">{{cite journal|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=On Not Becoming Gamers: Moving Beyond the Constructed Audience|journal=Ada|issue=2|date=October 2014|access-date=2015-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123185112/http://adanewmedia.org/2013/06/issue2-shaw/|archive-date=2015-11-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"newmediaDoYou\">{{cite journal|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/06/15/1461444811410394|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|title=Do you identify as a gamer?

On his return to Thailand he gained work experience at Siam Makro, a company in which C.P. Group was then a shareholder. He also gained financial experience by working with Soltext Federal Credit Union in the US and Vinylthai, one of Thailand's leading petrochemical companies. He joined TelecomAsia Corporation, Thailand's largest telecommunication company, in 1992 and worked his way up from a Senior Officer to senior management where his positions included chief operations and planning officer, executive vice-president for business, and senior vice-president for planning, project coordination and support.<ref name = TrueDream>Pattanapan Wongpan and Disanee Nakcharoen., Suphachai Chearavanont: Dream Catcher CEO Making of True.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe also served as chief operations officer of UTV Cable Television and founded a number of subsidiaries for the [[True Corporation|TelecomAsia Group]], such as Asia Wireless Communication Company Limited, a PCT (Person Communication Telephone) operator; Asia Infonet Company Limited, which operates internet businesses; Asia Multimedia Company Limited, a broadband operator; and Wire and Wireless Company Limited, a construction and distribution business.\n\n==Career==\n\n===True Corporation===\n\n====Starting the telecommunications business====\n\nThe years 1992 to 1996 were a boom era for the Thai telecommunications industry. The government had granted concessions to allow the private sector to invest in fixed-line, mobile and other new telecom services. Many private companies received both domestic and overseas loans to invest in the Thai telecom business. C.P. Group was one of the few privately owned Thai companies with the potential to operate such a business and it was invited to compete with foreign companies in a bid for concessions, which C.P. Group won.<ref name = RightMan>Supattha Sukchoo and Napaporn Chaikhankaew, May 3, 2012.  [http://www.gotomanager.com/news/printnews.aspx?id=94068 Print News]</ref>\n\nChearvanont first worked in the company's operations room and gradually gained knowledge about the fixed-line business where he worked as the senior officer for the president's office. He was promoted until he was responsible for managing network rollout, being responsible for the overview of the business and for leading the installation of a network of 2.6 million fixed-line phones. The network was successfully installed within two years.<ref name=\"TrueDream\"/>\n \nAs with most Thai companies, TelecomAsia was affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] which saw the Thai Baht collapse from 25 Baht/USD to 55 Baht/USD. The company's debt almost doubled to around 90 billion Baht and it was unable to repay its obligations within the due date and had to negotiate delayed repayment and enter a restructuring process.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nChearvanont explained to creditors that the fixed-line business was still growing and that evolving technology would lead to the development of data services which TelecomAsia would be able to commercially exploit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suphachai Chearavanont l Bio l Cambridge Institute for Family Enterprise - 17 Next Generation Leaders of 2017 |url=https://cfeg.com/nextgenleaders2017/bio/suphachai-chearavanont.html |accessdate=2018-12-17}}</ref>  The creditors approved TelecomAsia's restructured debt-repayment program. Once the economy had recovered from the Asian financial crisis, the company developed a diverse range of new marketing activities which helped improve its financial position and revenue base. In 1999, Chearvanont was promoted to the position of President and CEO.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Recovery and consolidation====\n\nIn 2003, Chearvanont and then TelecomAsia invested heavily in building up the country's third national wireless carrier, over a decade behind competitors. TA Orange grew rapidly during its first years under heavy and innovative marketing campaign. Chearvanont and TA Orange soon ran into trouble when [[France Telecom]] acquired Orange (UK) and France Telecom refused to increase capital and funding into the TA Orange joint venture. TA Orange, thus, was unable to keep up with competitor investments and expand its network fast enough. In 2005, TelecomAsia struck a deal to buy out France Telecom's stake in TA Orange for 1 Thai baht. Upon the buyback of TA Orange, TelecomAsia transformed itself into \"True Corporation\". Chearvanont soon also took a controlling stake in UBC, then the country's leading independent pay TV provider, and transformed it into True Visions.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder Chearvanont's leadership, TelecomAsia transformed from a fixed-line phone provider to Thailand's leading telecommunications conglomerate, being Thailand's largest internet service provider, cable TV and pay TV provider, and the country's third-largest wireless carrier with some 24 million subscribers. In June 2015, Chearvanont was elected President of The Telecommunications Association of Thailand under The Royal Patronage.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Charoen Pokphand Group===\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Chearavanont was appointed CEO with Soopakij Chearavanont appointed as Chairman and [[Dhanin Chearavanont]] progressing towards the position of Senior Chairman of the Charoen Pokphand Group.<ref name=\"XX>{{Citation |last=Ono |first=Yukako |date=January 17, 2017 |title=CP Group's Dhanin elevates 2 sons to chairman, CEO |publisher=[[Nikkei Asian Review]] |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CP-Group-s-Dhanin-elevates-2-sons-to-chairman-CEO |accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, Chearavanont was honored by [[Muhammad Yunus]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate, to give a keynote speech at the closing ceremony of \u20182019 Social Business Day\u2019, marking the ninth time the event was organized and the first of its kind in Thailand.

He joined TelecomAsia Corporation, Thailand's largest telecommunication company, in 1992 and worked his way up from a Senior Officer to senior management where his positions included chief operations and planning officer, executive vice-president for business, and senior vice-president for planning, project coordination and support.<ref name = TrueDream>Pattanapan Wongpan and Disanee Nakcharoen., Suphachai Chearavanont: Dream Catcher CEO Making of True.{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe also served as chief operations officer of UTV Cable Television and founded a number of subsidiaries for the [[True Corporation|TelecomAsia Group]], such as Asia Wireless Communication Company Limited, a PCT (Person Communication Telephone) operator; Asia Infonet Company Limited, which operates internet businesses; Asia Multimedia Company Limited, a broadband operator; and Wire and Wireless Company Limited, a construction and distribution business.\n\n==Career==\n\n===True Corporation===\n\n====Starting the telecommunications business====\n\nThe years 1992 to 1996 were a boom era for the Thai telecommunications industry. The government had granted concessions to allow the private sector to invest in fixed-line, mobile and other new telecom services. Many private companies received both domestic and overseas loans to invest in the Thai telecom business. C.P. Group was one of the few privately owned Thai companies with the potential to operate such a business and it was invited to compete with foreign companies in a bid for concessions, which C.P. Group won.<ref name = RightMan>Supattha Sukchoo and Napaporn Chaikhankaew, May 3, 2012.  [http://www.gotomanager.com/news/printnews.aspx?id=94068 Print News]</ref>\n\nChearvanont first worked in the company's operations room and gradually gained knowledge about the fixed-line business where he worked as the senior officer for the president's office. He was promoted until he was responsible for managing network rollout, being responsible for the overview of the business and for leading the installation of a network of 2.6 million fixed-line phones. The network was successfully installed within two years.<ref name=\"TrueDream\"/>\n \nAs with most Thai companies, TelecomAsia was affected by the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] which saw the Thai Baht collapse from 25 Baht/USD to 55 Baht/USD. The company's debt almost doubled to around 90 billion Baht and it was unable to repay its obligations within the due date and had to negotiate delayed repayment and enter a restructuring process.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nChearvanont explained to creditors that the fixed-line business was still growing and that evolving technology would lead to the development of data services which TelecomAsia would be able to commercially exploit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Suphachai Chearavanont l Bio l Cambridge Institute for Family Enterprise - 17 Next Generation Leaders of 2017 |url=https://cfeg.com/nextgenleaders2017/bio/suphachai-chearavanont.html |accessdate=2018-12-17}}</ref>  The creditors approved TelecomAsia's restructured debt-repayment program. Once the economy had recovered from the Asian financial crisis, the company developed a diverse range of new marketing activities which helped improve its financial position and revenue base. In 1999, Chearvanont was promoted to the position of President and CEO.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Recovery and consolidation====\n\nIn 2003, Chearvanont and then TelecomAsia invested heavily in building up the country's third national wireless carrier, over a decade behind competitors. TA Orange grew rapidly during its first years under heavy and innovative marketing campaign. Chearvanont and TA Orange soon ran into trouble when [[France Telecom]] acquired Orange (UK) and France Telecom refused to increase capital and funding into the TA Orange joint venture. TA Orange, thus, was unable to keep up with competitor investments and expand its network fast enough. In 2005, TelecomAsia struck a deal to buy out France Telecom's stake in TA Orange for 1 Thai baht. Upon the buyback of TA Orange, TelecomAsia transformed itself into \"True Corporation\". Chearvanont soon also took a controlling stake in UBC, then the country's leading independent pay TV provider, and transformed it into True Visions.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder Chearvanont's leadership, TelecomAsia transformed from a fixed-line phone provider to Thailand's leading telecommunications conglomerate, being Thailand's largest internet service provider, cable TV and pay TV provider, and the country's third-largest wireless carrier with some 24 million subscribers. In June 2015, Chearvanont was elected President of The Telecommunications Association of Thailand under The Royal Patronage.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Charoen Pokphand Group===\n\nOn January 9, 2017, Chearavanont was appointed CEO with Soopakij Chearavanont appointed as Chairman and [[Dhanin Chearavanont]] progressing towards the position of Senior Chairman of the Charoen Pokphand Group.<ref name=\"XX>{{Citation |last=Ono |first=Yukako |date=January 17, 2017 |title=CP Group's Dhanin elevates 2 sons to chairman, CEO |publisher=[[Nikkei Asian Review]] |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CP-Group-s-Dhanin-elevates-2-sons-to-chairman-CEO |accessdate=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, Chearavanont was honored by [[Muhammad Yunus]], [[Nobel Peace Prize]] Laureate, to give a keynote speech at the closing ceremony of \u20182019 Social Business Day\u2019, marking the ninth time the event was organized and the first of its kind in Thailand.

Areas of focus include: sustainable design and eco-design, social design, project management, digital design, new technologies, innovation, strategic design, game design, interaction design, service design, experience design and collaborative design.\n\n==History==\n=== From complexity theories to systemic design ===\n\nThe theories about complexity help the management of an entire system and the suggested design approaches help the planning of different divergent elements. The complexity theories evolved on the basis that living systems continually draw upon external sources of energy and maintain a stable state of low entropy, on the basis of the '''General Systems Theory''' by Karl Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1968).<ref>von Bertalanffy, K.L. (1968) General System theory: Foundations, Development, Applications, George Braziller, New York</ref> Some of the next rationales applied those theories also on artificial systems: complexity models of living systems address also '''productive models with their organizations and management''', where the relationships between parts are more important than the parts themselves. Treating productive organizations as complex adaptive systems allows a new management model to emerge in economical, social and environmental benefits (Pisek and Wilson, 2001 <ref>Pisek, P.E. and Wilson, T. (2001) Complexity, Leadership, And Management In Healthcare Organizations, British Medical Journal, Vol.323, pp.746-749.</ref>). In that field, '''Cluster Theory''' (Porter, 1990 <ref>Porter, M.E. (1990) Competitive Advantage of Nations, Free Press, New York.</ref>) evolved in more environmentally sensitive theories, like '''Industrial Ecology''' (Frosh and Gallopoulos, 1989 <ref>Frosh, R.A. and Gallopoulos, N.E. (1989) Strategies for Manufacturing, Scientific American, Vol.3 No.189, pp.94-102.\n</ref>) and '''Industrial Symbiosis''' (Chertow, 2000 <ref>Chertow, M.R. (2000) Industrial Symbiosis: Literature and Taxonomy, Annual Review of Energy and Environment, Vol.25, pp.313-337</ref>). \nIn 1994, '''Gunter Pauli''' and '''Heitor Gurgulino de Souza''' founded the research institute '''Zero Emission Research and Initiatives''' (ZERI),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeri.org/|title=Home|author=|date=|website=www.zeri.org|accessdate=18 April 2018}}</ref> starting from the idea that progress should embed respect for the environment and natural techniques that will allow production processes to be part of the ecosystem.\nThe '''design thinking''', as Buchanan (1992) said,<ref>Buchanan, R. (1992) Wicked Problems in Design Thinking, Design Issues, Vol.8 No.2, pp.5-21.</ref> means the way to creatively and strategically reconfigure a design concept on a situation with systemic integration. This needs a strong inter- and trans-disciplinarity during the design phase (Fuller, 1981 <ref>Fuller R.B. (1981), Critical Path, St. Martin\u2019s Press, New York.</ref>), with the increasing involvement of different disciplines including urban planning, public policy, business management and environmental sciences (Chertow et al., 2004 <ref>Chertow, M. R., Ashton, W. and Kuppali, R. (2004) The Industrial Symbiosis Research Symposium at Yale: Advancing the Study of Industry and Environment, Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, New Haven.</ref>). Systems and complexity theories and design thinking redesign a pretty new discipline: the Systemic Design, which is located as a '''human-centred systems-oriented design practice''' (Bistagnino, 2011;<ref>Bistagnino, L.

The lack of the LAL enzyme can lead to a build-up of fatty material in a number of body organs including the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[Intestine|gut]], in the wall of [[blood vessel]]s and other important organs.\n\nVery low levels of the LAL enzyme lead to LAL deficiency. LAL deficiency typically affects infants in the first year of life. The accumulation of [[fat]] in the walls of the gut in early onset disease leads to serious digestive problems including [[malabsorption]], a condition in which the gut fails to absorb [[nutrient]]s and [[calorie]]s from food. Because of these digestive complications, affected infants usually fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate for their age ([[failure to thrive]]). As the disease progresses, it can cause life-threatening [[liver dysfunction]] or [[liver failure]].<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nUntil 2015, there was no treatment, and very few infants with LAL-D survived beyond the first year of life. In 2015, an [[enzyme replacement therapy]], [[sebelipase alfa]], was approved in the US and EU.

The lack of the LAL enzyme can lead to a build-up of fatty material in a number of body organs including the [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[Intestine|gut]], in the wall of [[blood vessel]]s and other important organs.\n\nVery low levels of the LAL enzyme lead to LAL deficiency. LAL deficiency typically affects infants in the first year of life. The accumulation of [[fat]] in the walls of the gut in early onset disease leads to serious digestive problems including [[malabsorption]], a condition in which the gut fails to absorb [[nutrient]]s and [[calorie]]s from food. Because of these digestive complications, affected infants usually fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate for their age ([[failure to thrive]]). As the disease progresses, it can cause life-threatening [[liver dysfunction]] or [[liver failure]].<ref name=\"Jones\" />\n\nUntil 2015, there was no treatment, and very few infants with LAL-D survived beyond the first year of life. In 2015, an [[enzyme replacement therapy]], [[sebelipase alfa]], was approved in the US and EU. The therapy was additionally approved in [[Japan]] in 2016.\n\n==Symptoms ==\nInfants may present with feeding difficulties with frequent vomiting, diarrhea, [[Abdominal distension|swelling of the abdomen]], and failure to gain weight or sometimes weight loss.<ref name=2014revReiner/>\n\nAs the disease progresses in infants, increasing fat accumulation in the liver leads to other complications including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes ([[jaundice]]), and a persistent low-grade fever.

The paper was traditionally based in the town of [[Ballyshannon]] in the south of the county, but now has offices in [[Donegal Town]] (southern edition) and [[Letterkenny]] (northern edition). The ''Donegal Democrat'' is the largest paper focused solely on County Donegal, and its current editor is Michael Daly. The paper was the only one published in south Donegal from the mid-twentieth century on, and so has gained a reputation of being the local [[paper of record]] for that part of the county. Its main rivals in the north of the county are the ''[[Letterkenny Post]]'' and ''[[Derry Journal]]'', and in the south the ''[[Donegal Post]]'' and ''[[Finn Valley Post]]''.\n\nSince its launch, the paper has been published weekly on a Thursday in [[broadsheet]] format, and in recent years has become part of a chain of titles that are published three times per week in the county. The paper is now almost entirely integrated with the ''[[Donegal People's Press]]'', a paper published on Tuesdays in a [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] format. The ''People's Press'' was traditionally a north Donegal paper and so, with minor alterations, is published as a Tuesday edition of the ''Donegal Democrat'' in the south of the county.\n\nIn March 2004, the ''Sunday Democrat'' was launched as an edition of the ''[[Sunday Journal]]'', it changed its name later that year to ''[[Donegal on Sunday]]''. The ''Donegal Democrat'' group is owned by [[Iconic Newspapers]], which publishes several other titles in counties Donegal and [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe paper was first published on 16 June 1919,<ref name=\"CURRAN\">{{cite thesis |last=CURRAN |first=CONOR |date=April 2012 |title=WHY DONEGAL SLEPT: THE DEVELOPMENT OF GAELIC GAMES IN DONEGAL, 1884-1934 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=[[De Montfort University]]}}</ref> and was founded by [[John Downey (newspaper editor)|John Downey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/news/home/203887/Democrat-to-publish-four-part-series.html |title=Democrat to publish four-part series on 1916 rising |publisher=Donegal Democrat |date=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe editorial in the first issue set out that it was to be a \"non-political paper in a world of politics, but we believed that in doing so we are doing right. We are making our bow to the public at a critical period in our national and local history and it shall be ever our object to uphold anything that, will further the national and local interests.\"<ref name=\"CURRAN\"/>\n\nThe paper had a fairly militant [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] policy, which during the [[Irish War of Independence]] led to it being raided on several occasions by police and British soldiers,<ref name=\"CURRAN\"/> who on one occasion announced that they were looking for a \"typewriting machine\". But they left on being assured that there was no such machine on the premises.\n\nFor its first years, the paper was completely hand-set, with each letter of type being placed individually; it was not surprising therefore that there were only 10 pages, measuring 9 inches by 11 inches. Its front page contained mostly adverts, with no photos in the paper at all. Over the next few years the paper gradually increased in size and circulation, and in 1922 got its first typesetting machine.\n\nCecil King purchased the ''Democrat'' from the Downey family in 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballyshannon-musings.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/let-me-sing-of-what-i-know-2.html |title=Ballyshannon Musings: Let Me Sing of What I Know |publisher=Blogger |work=ballyshannon-musings |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2016 |author=Begley, Anthony}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nThe ''Democrat'' published a number of books between 1962 and 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Donegal_Democrat |title=Donegal Democrat Publisher |publisher=Open Library |accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe paper was put on the market in 1992 following the death of the then managing director, Cecil King jnr.<ref name=\"OKANE\">{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24920554.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911132245/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24920554.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 September 2016 |title=Donegal paper changes hands |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |work=highbeam.com |date=12 January 1995 |accessdate=30 April 2016 |author=O'KANE, PAUL}}</ref> In 1995, the paper was bought by the [[Derry Journal Newspapers]] group for an undisclosed sum thought to be in the region of 1 million.<ref name=\"OKANE\"/> The paper was purchased by the [[3i]] holding company [[Local Press Ltd]] in 2004, and changed hands again the following year, when [[Johnston Press]] took over Local Press.

The paper was traditionally based in the town of [[Ballyshannon]] in the south of the county, but now has offices in [[Donegal Town]] (southern edition) and [[Letterkenny]] (northern edition). The ''Donegal Democrat'' is the largest paper focused solely on County Donegal, and its current editor is Michael Daly. The paper was the only one published in south Donegal from the mid-twentieth century on, and so has gained a reputation of being the local [[paper of record]] for that part of the county. Its main rivals in the north of the county are the ''[[Letterkenny Post]]'' and ''[[Derry Journal]]'', and in the south the ''[[Donegal Post]]'' and ''[[Finn Valley Post]]''.\n\nSince its launch, the paper has been published weekly on a Thursday in [[broadsheet]] format, and in recent years has become part of a chain of titles that are published three times per week in the county. The paper is now almost entirely integrated with the ''[[Donegal People's Press]]'', a paper published on Tuesdays in a [[Compact (newspaper)|compact]] format. The ''People's Press'' was traditionally a north Donegal paper and so, with minor alterations, is published as a Tuesday edition of the ''Donegal Democrat'' in the south of the county.\n\nIn March 2004, the ''Sunday Democrat'' was launched as an edition of the ''[[Sunday Journal]]'', it changed its name later that year to ''[[Donegal on Sunday]]''. The ''Donegal Democrat'' group is owned by [[Iconic Newspapers]], which publishes several other titles in counties Donegal and [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe paper was first published on 16 June 1919,<ref name=\"CURRAN\">{{cite thesis |last=CURRAN |first=CONOR |date=April 2012 |title=WHY DONEGAL SLEPT: THE DEVELOPMENT OF GAELIC GAMES IN DONEGAL, 1884-1934 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=[[De Montfort University]]}}</ref> and was founded by [[John Downey (newspaper editor)|John Downey]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.donegaldemocrat.ie/news/home/203887/Democrat-to-publish-four-part-series.html |title=Democrat to publish four-part series on 1916 rising |publisher=Donegal Democrat |date=7 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe editorial in the first issue set out that it was to be a \"non-political paper in a world of politics, but we believed that in doing so we are doing right. We are making our bow to the public at a critical period in our national and local history and it shall be ever our object to uphold anything that, will further the national and local interests.\"<ref name=\"CURRAN\"/>\n\nThe paper had a fairly militant [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] policy, which during the [[Irish War of Independence]] led to it being raided on several occasions by police and British soldiers,<ref name=\"CURRAN\"/> who on one occasion announced that they were looking for a \"typewriting machine\". But they left on being assured that there was no such machine on the premises.\n\nFor its first years, the paper was completely hand-set, with each letter of type being placed individually; it was not surprising therefore that there were only 10 pages, measuring 9 inches by 11 inches. Its front page contained mostly adverts, with no photos in the paper at all. Over the next few years the paper gradually increased in size and circulation, and in 1922 got its first typesetting machine.\n\nCecil King purchased the ''Democrat'' from the Downey family in 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ballyshannon-musings.blogspot.com.au/2013/01/let-me-sing-of-what-i-know-2.html |title=Ballyshannon Musings: Let Me Sing of What I Know |publisher=Blogger |work=ballyshannon-musings |date=7 January 2013 |accessdate=30 April 2016 |author=Begley, Anthony}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\nThe ''Democrat'' published a number of books between 1962 and 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Donegal_Democrat |title=Donegal Democrat Publisher |publisher=Open Library |accessdate=30 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe paper was put on the market in 1992 following the death of the then managing director, Cecil King jnr.<ref name=\"OKANE\">{{cite web |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24920554.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911132245/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-24920554.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=11 September 2016 |title=Donegal paper changes hands |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |work=highbeam.com |date=12 January 1995 |accessdate=30 April 2016 |author=O'KANE, PAUL}}</ref> In 1995, the paper was bought by the [[Derry Journal Newspapers]] group for an undisclosed sum thought to be in the region of 1 million.<ref name=\"OKANE\"/> The paper was purchased by the [[3i]] holding company [[Local Press Ltd]] in 2004, and changed hands again the follwing year, when [[Johnston Press]] took over Local Press.

It contains a seven-day TV guide, a weekly contribution from the youth media website [http://www.spunout.ie 'Spun Out'], and columnists such as 'Pat's Patch' by Pat McArt.\n\n===Thursday===\nThe Thursday paper, which is available throughout the county, is a broadsheet in two sections, each of which are twenty-four pages in size, twenty of which are in colour. It includes features such as 'Mind Yourself', a series of stories on mental health supported by the [[Health Service Executive|HSE]], as well as an environmental contribution from [[Donegal County Council]] and a [[women's section]] compiled by the '[[Donegal Women's Network]]'. It also includes a series of columnists and editorials including 'It Occurs To Me' by Frank Galigan, and the 'Thursday Interview', in which high-profile local figures discuss important issues with the paper's journalists. ''The Big Donegal Weekend'' was launched on 6 March 2008. This paper comes free with the ''Democrat'' and includes features on topics such as entertainment, shopping, property, lifestyle.\n\n===Sport===\nSport stories form an important part of the newspaper, and coverage is given in both titles to the local GAA league and championship as well as Donegal's involvement in inter-county competitions.<ref name=\"CURRAN\"/> Soccer is also quite prominent, including the local leagues, and the progress of [[Finn Harps]], the only professional team in the county.

The department had responsibility for policies relating to transport, planning, [[Local government in Victoria|local government]] and sport, and oversaw a variety of other agencies in those functions.\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the resignation of [[Ted Ballieu]] as Premier on 6 May 2013, Denis Napthine was elected leader of the parliamentary [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] and sworn in as Premier in the following days. On 9 April, Napthine announced extensive machinery of government changes, reducing the number of departments from 11 to 9.

It was created in [[machinery of government]] changes in 2013 following [[Denis Napthine]]'s appointment as [[Premier of Victoria|premier]], and was abolished in 2015 following the election of a new government led by [[Daniel Andrews]]. The department had responsibility for policies relating to transport, planning, [[Local government in Victoria|local government]] and sport, and oversaw a variety of other agencies in those functions.\n\n== History ==\nFollowing the resignation of [[Ted Ballieu]] as Premier on 6 May 2013, Denis Napthine was elected leader of the parliamentary [[Liberal Party of Australia (Victorian Division)|Liberal Party]] and sworn in as Premier in the following days. On 9 April, Napthine announced extensive machinery of government changes, reducing the number of departments from 11 to 9. The [[Department of Transport (Victoria, 2008\u201313)|Department of Transport]] and [[Department of Planning and Community Development]] were merged, creating DTPLI, which also assumed responsibility for land use from the [[Department of Sustainability and Environment]], and minor functions from other departments.
