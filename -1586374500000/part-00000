It originally aired on April 15, 1998, in [[broadcast syndication]].\n\nIn this episode, Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) works with [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to trick the [[Romulan]]s into joining the war against the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].\n\nThe episode received Nielsen ratings of 4.8 points corresponding to nearly 4.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Ds9/Ratings/ratings6.html|title=WebTrek - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * SEASON 6 NIELSEN RATINGS|website=users.telenet.be}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]), conflicted over events of the last two weeks, recounts his experiences in a personal log entry, the details of which are revealed in flashbacks. The losses suffered by the Federation in the war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] are taking their toll, with Sisko noting that whenever a casualty list is posted at least one of his officers spots the name of a friend or loved one. A major advantage the Dominion has is their non-aggression pact with the [[Romulan]]s, who are allowing the Dominion free passage through their territory. Sisko decides that in order for the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and its allies to win the war, he must bring the Romulans in on their side no matter what.\n\nSisko enlists the help of former [[Cardassian]] spy [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to obtain intelligence from Cardassia, assuming the Dominion must be considering a conquest of Romulus eventually, but all of Garak's contacts end up dead shortly after communicating with him. Garak instead suggests they forge a recording of Dominion leaders discussing a surprise attack. Hesitant, but driven forward by the Dominion's recent conquest of [[Betazed]], Sisko obtains permission from [[Starfleet]] to proceed.\n\nOn Garak's request, Sisko secures the release of a forger named Grathon Tolar ([[Howard Shangraw]]) from a [[Klingon]] prison. Then, in order to obtain an authentic Cardassian secure data rod, he is forced to trade a large quantity of bio-mimetic gel, a rare, dangerous, and highly regulated material. [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] ([[Alexander Siddig]]) strongly objects, and relents only when Sisko orders him unequivocally; providing the doctor with the orders in writing, the doctor still vows to lodge a formal complaint. Matters are complicated when Tolar stabs [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) in an altercation while drunk. To keep Tolar out of trouble, he bribes Quark and convinces [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]) to drop the matter. At this point, Sisko recognizes the legal and ethical compromises he is making but presses on knowing it is for the greater good.\n\nTolar creates a [[holography|holographic]] record of a Dominion meeting between [[Damar (Star Trek)|Damar]] ([[Casey Biggs]]) and Weyoun ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) discussing plans involving the invasion of the Romulan Empire. Meanwhile, on Garak's advice, Sisko invites [[Vreenak]] ([[Stephen McHattie]]), an influential Romulan senator, to [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] in secret. Sisko shows Vreenak the recording and gives him the data rod, but the senator discovers the forgery and departs, furious and vowing to expose the deception. As Sisko faces the possibility that his actions may actually force the Romulans to join with the Dominion once Vreenak returns to the Empire, he learns that Vreenak's ship was destroyed en route.\n\nSisko angrily confronts Garak, who admits he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship in case the forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed Tolar in order to keep his work secret. Garak maintains that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan to do the things that Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha Quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.\n\nSubsequently, the Romulans join with the Federation and declare war against the Dominion, quickly striking at nearby Dominion outposts. At the end of his log entry, Sisko admits that Garak was right about a guilty conscience being a small price to pay, and states, somewhat uncertainly, that he can live with his decision for the good of the Alpha Quadrant. He then orders the computer to delete the entire personal log.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nThe episode has origins in a discussion the writing staff had about the [[Vietnam War]], which quickly moved onto the [[Watergate scandal]]. They began working on an idea in which [[Jake Sisko]] discovered some incriminating information regarding [[Shakaar]], the leader of the [[Bajoran]] Government. If revealed, it would bring down the Government, and so at a time of war, Captain Sisko would be forced to prevent his son from revealing the information. At this point, the episode was called \"Patriot\". The plot quickly evolved to become information on Sisko instead. Writer [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] wrote a screenplay which saw Jake Sisko attempting to interview Garak, but following the evasiveness of the Cardassian, he realises that something is amiss. Captain Sisko tells him to back off Garak, but Jake's investigation reveals that the duo were attempting to bring the Romulans into the war against the Dominion. The Captain tells his son that he would prevent the publishing of the story, but the writing team didn't buy into the conflict between those characters.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}}\n\n[[Ronald D. Moore]] began working with Taylor to revise the screenplay,{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} dropping Jake from the plot entirely. They were having trouble with the pacing of the story, but Moore realised while drinking late at night that it would work if it was told in flashbacks. He pitched the idea the following morning, and it was accepted by the writing team. The screenplay was entirely re-written.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} Taylor called the final version \"brilliant\" but admitted that it had mostly been written by Moore.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} Moore explained that the story needed something of weight in order to push Sisko along. The writing team discussed having the Dominion take one of the well known planets of the Federation. [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] was considered, but it was felt to be too important and so Betazed was chosen instead.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} [[Ira Steven Behr]] added the final line of the episode, \"I can live with it\", as a reference to the 1962 film ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]''.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}} The title of the episode came from the line in the 1989 \"[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]\" film, \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\".{{sfn | Jones|Parkin| 2003| p=253}}\n\n===Direction and casting===\nDirector [[Victor Lobl]] also planned out the mannerisms shown by Brooks as Sisko where he talks directly to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity to ensure that the audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}}\n\n\"In the Pale Moonlight\" featured several recurring characters and actors, with Combs as Weyoun, Biggs as Damar and Robinson as Garak. Joining them was McHattie, portraying Ambassador Vreenak. He made a second appearance in the ''Star Trek'' franchise in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[The Xindi]]\" as an alien foreman.<ref name=\"tormoonlight\">{{cite web|last1=DeCandido|first1=Keith|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Rewatch: \"In the Pale Moonlight\"|url=http://www.tor.com/2014/10/17/star-trek-deep-space-nine-rewatch-qin-the-pale-moonlightq/|publisher=Tor.com|accessdate=June 7, 2016|date=October 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nExecutive producer [[Rick Berman]] said that when creating ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], and compared the normal Starfleet officers to that of [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]]. Berman suggested that \"In the Pale Moonlight\" was the exception.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=555}} Taylor said that the episode \"pushes the boundaries in a realistic way\".{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} In an interview in 2011, when talking about \"In the Pale Moonlight\", Robinson compared Starfleet to Americans in general. He said \"we're not really willing to take the consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would never do that.

The review of the [[VHS]] release in ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' magazine describe the episode as \"probably the strongest of the season\" and among the best episodes of ''Deep Space Nine''. It called the plot \"original\", \"daring\" and \"unexpected\".<ref name=dreamwatchreview/> Frank M. Robinson in his 1999 book, ''Science Fiction of the 20th Century'', describes \"In the Pale Moonlight\" as \"Captain Sisko is forced to betray his ideals to save the lives of millions on a galactic scale at the cost of one petty criminal and one ambassador of an unfriendly nation. On the surface, no contest but Brooks (Sisko) played the role with depth and feeling unusual in a science-fiction series.\" He added that the ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine had described it as one of the best dramatic episodes of the season.{{sfn | Robinson| 1999| p=240}} [[Keith DeCandido]] reviewed the episode for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]], giving it a rating of ten out of ten. He called the fall of Betazed a \"masterstroke\" because it made the viewer invested in the conflict. He praised the suffering Sisko had for doing what he did, and said that both Brooks and Robinson were \"at their best\" with two \"bravura performances\".<ref name=\"tormoonlight\" />\n\nZack Handlen, in his review for [[The A.V. Club]], suggested that the most shocking aspect of \"In the Pale Moonlight\" was that Sisko's actions were not shocking but only provided a twist. He said that the script \"never overplays Sisko's deepening sense of crisis\", and avoided presenting any choices as right or wrong.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Handlen|first1=Zack|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: \"In The Pale Moonlight\"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/in-the-pale-moonlight-106610|publisher=The A.V.

It originally aired on April 15, 1998, in [[broadcast syndication]].\n\nIn this episode, Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]) works with [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to trick the [[Romulan]]s into joining the war against the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]].\n\nThe episode received Nielsen ratings of 4.8 points corresponding to nearly 4.7 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/WebTrek/Ds9/Ratings/ratings6.html|title=WebTrek - Star Trek: Deep Space Nine * SEASON 6 NIELSEN RATINGS|website=users.telenet.be}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nCaptain [[Benjamin Sisko]] ([[Avery Brooks]]), conflicted over events of the last two weeks, recounts his experiences in a personal log entry, the details of which are revealed in flashbacks. The losses suffered by the Federation in the war with the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] are taking their toll, with Sisko noting that whenever a casualty list is posted at least one of his officers spots the name of a friend or loved one. A major advantage the Dominion has is their non-aggression pact with the [[Romulan]]s, who are allowing the Dominion free passage through their territory. Sisko decides that in order for the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] and its allies to win the war, he must bring the Romulans in on their side no matter what.\n\nSisko enlists the help of former [[Cardassian]] spy [[Elim Garak]] ([[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]]) to obtain intelligence from Cardassia, assuming the Dominion must be considering a conquest of Romulus eventually, but all of Garak's contacts end up dead shortly after communicating with him. Garak instead suggests they forge a recording of Dominion leaders discussing a surprise attack. Hesitant, but driven forward by the Dominion's recent conquest of [[Betazed]], Sisko obtains permission from [[Starfleet]] to proceed.\n\nOn Garak's request, Sisko secures the release of a forger named Grathon Tolar ([[Howard Shangraw]]) from a [[Klingon]] prison. Then, in order to obtain an authentic Cardassian secure data rod, he is forced to trade a large quantity of bio-mimetic gel, a rare, dangerous, and highly regulated material. [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] ([[Alexander Siddig]]) strongly objects, and relents only when Sisko orders him unequivocally; providing the doctor with the orders in writing, the doctor still vows to lodge a formal complaint. Matters are complicated when Tolar stabs [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ([[Armin Shimerman]]) in an altercation while drunk. To keep Tolar out of trouble, he bribes Quark and convinces [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]] ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]) to drop the matter. At this point, Sisko recognizes the legal and ethical compromises he is making but presses on knowing it is for the greater good.\n\nTolar creates a [[holography|holographic]] record of a Dominion meeting between [[Damar (Star Trek)|Damar]] ([[Casey Biggs]]) and Weyoun ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) discussing plans involving the Romulan invasion. Meanwhile, on Garak's advice, Sisko invites [[Vreenak]] ([[Stephen McHattie]]), an influential Romulan senator, to [[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]] in secret. Sisko shows Vreenak the recording and gives him the data rod, but the senator discovers the forgery and departs, furious and vowing to expose the deception. As Sisko faces the possibility that his actions may actually force the Romulans to join with the Dominion once Vreenak returns to the Empire, he learns that Vreenak's ship was destroyed en route.\n\nSisko angrily confronts Garak, who admits he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship in case the forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed Tolar in order to keep his work secret. Garak maintains that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan to do the things that Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha Quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.\n\nSubsequently, the Romulans join with the Federation and declare war against the Dominion, quickly striking at nearby Dominion outposts. At the end of his log entry, Sisko admits that Garak was right about a guilty conscience being a small price to pay, and states, somewhat uncertainly, that he can live with his decision for the good of the Alpha Quadrant. He then orders the computer to delete the entire personal log.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Writing===\nThe episode has origins in a discussion the writing staff had about the [[Vietnam War]], which quickly moved onto the [[Watergate scandal]]. They began working on an idea in which [[Jake Sisko]] discovered some incriminating information regarding [[Shakaar]], the leader of the [[Bajoran]] Government. If revealed, it would bring down the Government, and so at a time of war, Captain Sisko would be forced to prevent his son from revealing the information. At this point, the episode was called \"Patriot\". The plot quickly evolved to become information on Sisko instead. Writer [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] wrote a screenplay which saw Jake Sisko attempting to interview Garak, but following the evasiveness of the Cardassian, he realises that something is amiss. Captain Sisko tells him to back off Garak, but Jake's investigation reveals that the duo were attempting to bring the Romulans into the war against the Dominion. The Captain tells his son that he would prevent the publishing of the story, but the writing team didn't buy into the conflict between those characters.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}}\n\n[[Ronald D. Moore]] began working with Taylor to revise the screenplay,{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} dropping Jake from the plot entirely. They were having trouble with the pacing of the story, but Moore realised while drinking late at night that it would work if it was told in flashbacks. He pitched the idea the following morning, and it was accepted by the writing team. The screenplay was entirely re-written.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} Taylor called the final version \"brilliant\" but admitted that it had mostly been written by Moore.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=556}} Moore explained that the story needed something of weight in order to push Sisko along. The writing team discussed having the Dominion take one of the well known planets of the Federation. [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] was considered, but it was felt to be too important and so Betazed was chosen instead.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} [[Ira Steven Behr]] added the final line of the episode, \"I can live with it\", as a reference to the 1962 film ''[[The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance]]''.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}} The title of the episode came from the line in the 1989 \"[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]\" film, \"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?\".{{sfn | Jones|Parkin| 2003| p=253}}\n\n===Direction and casting===\nDirector [[Victor Lobl]] also planned out the mannerisms shown by Brooks as Sisko where he talks directly to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=557}} All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity to ensure that the audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.{{sfn | Erdmann|Block| 2000| p=558}}\n\n\"In the Pale Moonlight\" featured several recurring characters and actors, with Combs as Weyoun, Biggs as Damar and Robinson as Garak. Joining them was McHattie, portraying Ambassador Vreenak. He made a second appearance in the ''Star Trek'' franchise in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode \"[[The Xindi]]\" as an alien foreman.<ref name=\"tormoonlight\">{{cite web|last1=DeCandido|first1=Keith|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Rewatch: \"In the Pale Moonlight\"|url=http://www.tor.com/2014/10/17/star-trek-deep-space-nine-rewatch-qin-the-pale-moonlightq/|publisher=Tor.com|accessdate=June 7, 2016|date=October 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nExecutive producer [[Rick Berman]] said that when creating ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', he had to obey the rules as set out by franchise creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], and compared the normal Starfleet officers to that of [[Scouting|Boy Scouts]].

He said \"we're not really willing to take the consequences of our actions, and sometimes we have to do very dirty things, and we have to hurt people, and we pretend that that doesn't exist, that Americans would never do that.

The review of the [[VHS]] release in ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' magazine describe the episode as \"probably the strongest of the season\" and among the best episodes of ''Deep Space Nine''. It called the plot \"original\", \"daring\" and \"unexpected\".<ref name=dreamwatchreview/> Frank M. Robinson in his 1999 book, ''Science Fiction of the 20th Century'', describes \"In the Pale Moonlight\" as \"Captain Sisko is forced to betray his ideals to save the lives of millions on a galactic scale at the cost of one petty criminal and one ambassador of an unfriendly nation. On the surface, no contest but Brooks (Sisko) played the role with depth and feeling unusual in a science-fiction series.\" He added that the ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine had described it as one of the best dramatic episodes of the season.{{sfn | Robinson| 1999| p=240}} [[Keith DeCandido]] reviewed the episode for [[Tor Books|Tor.com]], giving it a rating of ten out of ten. He called the fall of Betazed a \"masterstroke\" because it made the viewer invested in the conflict. He praised the suffering Sisko had for doing what he did, and said that both Brooks and Robinson were \"at their best\" with two \"bravura performances\".<ref name=\"tormoonlight\" />\n\nZack Handlen, in his review for [[The A.V. Club]], suggested that the most shocking aspect of \"In the Pale Moonlight\" was that Sisko's actions were not shocking but only provided a twist. He said that the script \"never overplays Sisko's deepening sense of crisis\", and avoided presenting any choices as right or wrong.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Handlen|first1=Zack|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: \"In The Pale Moonlight\"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/in-the-pale-moonlight-106610|publisher=The A.V.

In general, crisis is the situation of a \"complex system\" (family, economy, society. Note that simple systems do not enter crises. We can speak about a crisis of moral values, an economical or political crisis, but not a motor crisis) when the system functions poorly (the system still functions, but does not break down), an immediate decision is necessary to stop the further disintegration of the system, but the causes of the dysfunction are not immediately identified (the causes are so many, or unknown, that it is impossible to take a rational, informed decision to reverse the situation).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bundy|first=J.|author2=Pfarrer, M.

J. (2003). Risk communication in a High Reliability Organization: APHIS PPQ's inclusion of risk in decision making. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Proquest Information and Learning.</ref> argues that \"crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained.\" Therefore the fourth defining quality is the need for change. If change is not needed, the event could more accurately be described as a failure.\n\nApart from natural crises that are inherently unpredictable (volcanic eruptions, tsunami etc.) most of the crises that we face are created by man. Hence the requirements of their being 'unexpected' depends upon man failing to note the onset of crisis conditions. Some of our inability to recognise crises before they become dangerous is due to denial and other psychological responses <ref>Mitroff.I. (2005) Why some companies emerge stronger and better from a crisis, p36</ref> that provide succour and protection for our emotions.\n\nA different set of reasons for failing to notice the onset of crises is that we allow ourselves to be 'tricked' into believing that we are doing something for reasons that are false. In other words, we are doing the wrong things for the right reasons. For example, we might believe that we are solving the threats of climate change by engaging in economic trading activity that has no real impact on the climate. Mitroff and Silvers <ref>Mitroff & Silvers, (2009) Dirty rotten strategies</ref> posit two reasons for these mistakes, which they classify as Type 3 (inadvertent) and Type 4 (deliberate) errors.\n\nThe effect of our inability to attend to the likely results of our actions can result in crisis.\n\nFrom this perspective we might usefully learn that failing to understand the real causes of our difficulties is likely to lead to repeated downstream 'blowback'. Where [[Nation state|states]] are concerned, Michael Brecher, based on [[Case study|case studies]] of the [[International Crisis Behavior]] (ICB) project, suggested a different way of defining crisis as conditions are perceptions held by the highest level [[Decision making|decision-makers]] of the actor concerned:<ref>Shlaim, Avi, ''The United States and the Berlin Blockade, 1948\u20131949: a study in crisis decision-making'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, p.5</ref>\n1. [[threat]] to basic values, with a [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] or subsequent\n2. high [[probability]] of involvement in [[combat|military hostilities]], and the awareness of\n3. finite time for response to the external value threat.\n\n===Chinese word for \"crisis\"===\n{{main|Chinese word for \"crisis\"}}\n<nowiki>It is frequently said in Western motivational speaking that the Chinese word for \"crisis\" is composed of two Chinese characters signifying \"danger\" and \"opportunity\" respectively. This is, however, considered by linguists to be a misperception. {{</nowiki>[[Template:Citation needed|Citation needed]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>\n\n==Political crisis==\n{{see also|Constitutional crisis}}\n{{category see also|Government crises}}\n\n== Economic ==\n{{main|Crisis (economic)|l1=Economic crisis|Financial crisis}}\nAn ''economic crisis'' is a sharp transition to a [[recession]]. See for example [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)]], [[South American economic crisis of 2002]], [[Economic crisis of Cameroon]]. [[Crisis theory]] is a central achievement in the conclusions of [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of Capital.\n\nA [[financial crisis]] may be a [[banking crisis]] or [[currency crisis]].\n\n== Environmental ==\nCrises pertaining to the environment include:\n\n=== Environmental disaster ===\n{{main|Environmental disaster}}\n\nAn '''environmental disaster''' is a [[disaster]] that is due to human activity and should not be confused with [[natural disaster]]s ''([[#Natural disaster|see below]])''. In this case, the impact of humans' alteration of the [[ecosystem]] has led to widespread and/or long-lasting consequences. It can include the deaths of animals (including humans) and plant systems, or severe disruption of human life, possibly requiring migration.\n\n=== Natural disaster ===\n{{main|Natural disaster}}\n\nA ''natural disaster'' is the consequence of a '''natural [[hazard]]''' (e.g. [[volcanic eruption]], [[earthquake]], [[landslide]]) which moves from potential into an active phase, and as a result affects human activities.  Human vulnerability, exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate [[emergency management]], leads to financial, structural, and human losses.  The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster, their resilience.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=G. Bankoff, G. Frerks, D.

An endangered species is usually a taxonomic [[species]], but may be another [[evolutionary significant unit]]. The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) has classified 38 percent of the 44,837 species assessed by 2008 as threatened.<ref name = \"IUCN\">[http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/the_iucn_red_list_a_key_conservation_tool_factsheet_en.pdf Factsheet: The IUCN Red List a key conservation tool (2008)]</ref>\n\n== International ==\n{{main|International crisis|Crisis management}}\n\nFor information about crises in the field of study in [[international relations]], see [[crisis management]] and [[international crisis]]. In this context, a crisis can be loosely defined as a situation where there is a perception of threat, heightened anxiety, expectation of possible violence and the belief that any actions will have far-reaching consequences (Lebow, 7\u201310).\n\n== Personal ==\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_131.png|thumb|right|Messengers going to Job, each with bad news, 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nA personal crisis occurs when an individual can no longer cope with a situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\">Lanceley, F. J. (2003). On-Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators, Second Edition (2nd ed.). London: CRC Press.</ref> This is preceded by events of an extraordinary nature triggering extreme tension and stress within an individual, i.e., the crisis, which then requires major decisions or actions to resolve. Crises can be triggered by a wide range of situations including, but not limited to, [[extreme weather]] conditions, sudden change in employment/financial state, medical emergencies, long-term illness, and social or familial turmoil. Crises are simply a change in the events that comprise the day-to-day life of a person and those in their close circle, such as the loss of a job, extreme financial hardship, substance addiction/abuse and other situations that are life altering and require action that is outside the \"normal\" daily routine. A person going through a crisis experiences a state of mental disequilibrium, in which the ego struggles to balance both internal and external demands.<ref name=\"Woolley\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woolley | first1 = N | year = 1990 | title = Crisis theory: A paradigm of effective intervention with families of critically ill people | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 1402\u20131408 | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2648.1990.tb01782.x}}</ref> In this case, said person resorts to [[coping mechanism]]s to deal with the stress. Various coping mechanisms include:<ref name=\"NBPG\">Nursing Best Practice Guideline: Shaping the future of Nursing. (Electronic book). Appendix C - Assessment of coping skills and support systems. (Page 53). Executive Director: Doris Grispun, RN, MScN, PhD. Date: August 2002.</ref>\n* High emotions (crying, physical withdrawal)\n* Defence mechanisms (denial, repression)\n* Making rash decisions\n* Acting out\n* Putting things on hold\n\nIn some cases, it is difficult for an individual undergoing a crisis to adapt to the situation. As it is outside of their normal range of functioning, it is common that one endures a struggle to control emotions. This lack of control can lead to suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, trouble with the law and general avoidance of resources available for help. One such resource used to aid an individual in crisis is their social support system, which can come in the form of family, friends, coworkers, or health professionals. It is important that a support system consists of people that the individual trusts. Although these support systems play a crucial role in aiding an individual through a crisis, they are also the underlying cause of two thirds of mental health crises.<ref name=\"NBPG\"/> The aforementioned mental health crises can include marital issues, abandonment, parental conflict and family struggles.\n\nIn order to aid someone in a crisis, it is crucial to be able to identify the signs that indicate they are undergoing an internal conflict. These signs, as well as the aforementioned coping mechanisms, include:<ref name=\"Lancely\"/><ref>Vecchi, G. M. (2009). Conflict and crisis communication. Annals of the American Psychotherapy Association, 12(2), 32-29.</ref>\n* Irrational and/or narrow thinking\n* Lowered attention span\n* Unclear motives\n* Disorganized approach to problem solving\n* Resistance to communication\n* Inability to differ between large and small issues\n* Change/alteration to social networks\n\n===Ways to manage a crisis===\nAs aforementioned, a crisis to this day can be overcome by implementing mechanisms such as: [[sleep]], [[Social rejection|rejection]], physical [[exercise]], [[meditation]] and [[thinking]]. To assist individuals in regaining emotional equilibrium, intervention can be used. The overall goal of a crisis intervention is to get the individual back to a pre-crisis level of functioning or higher with the help of a social support group. As said by Judith Swan, there's a strong correlation between the client's emotional balance and the trust in their support system in helping them throughout their crisis.<ref>Swan, J., & Hamilton, P.M. (2014). Mental health crisis management. Wild Iris Medical Education, Inc.</ref> The steps of crisis intervention are: to assess the situation based on behaviour patterns of the individual, decide what type of help is needed (make a plan of action) and finally to take action/intervention, based on the individual's skills to regain equilibrium.<ref name=\"Woolley\"/>\n\nThe Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario proposed the ABC model for dealing with client's interventions in crises:<ref>Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario. (2006). Crisis intervention. Toronto, ON: Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario.</ref>\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n    |1=<!--A-->Basic attending skills (making the person comfortable, remaining calm, etc.)\n    |2=<!--B-->Identifying the problem and therapeutic interaction (explore their perceptions, identify sources of emotional distress, identify impairments in behavioural functioning, use therapeutic interactions)\n    |3=<!--C-->Coping (identify coping attempts, present alternative coping strategies, follow up post-crisis)\n}}\n\n===Benefits of listening in a crisis===\nMoreover, another method for helping individuals who are suffering in a crisis is active listening; it is defined as seeing circumstances from another perspective and letting the other person know that the negotiator (the helper) understands their perspective. Through this, they establish trust and rapport by demonstrating empathy, understanding and objectivity in a non-judgmental way. It is important for the negotiator to listen to verbal and non-verbal reactions of the person in need, in order to be able to label the emotion that the individual is showing. Thus, this demonstrates that the helper is tuned in emotionally. Furthermore, there are other techniques that can be used to demonstrate actively listening such as: paraphrasing, silence and reflecting or mirroring. The goal in active listening is to keep the person talking about their situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\" />\n\n== In chaos theory==\n{{main| Crisis (dynamical systems)}}\n\nWhen the control parameter of a chaotic system is modified, the chaotic [[attractor]] touches an unstable\nperiodic orbit inside the basin of attraction inducing a sudden expansion in the attractor.\nThis phenomenon is termed as interior crisis in a chaotic system.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Constitutional crisis]]\n* [[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Crisis state]]\n* [[Crisis management]]\n* [[Hostage crisis]]\n* [[Distress signal]]\n** [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]\n** [[SOS]]\n{{col-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Ecological crisis]]\n* [[Energy crisis]]\n* [[Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management]]\n* [[Mid-life crisis]]\n* [[Revolution]]\n* [[War]]\n* [[Crysis]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Borodzicz, E.

Crises are deemed to be negative changes in the [[security]], [[economic]], [[political]], [[societal]], or [[Environmental policy|environmental]] [[affair]]s, especially when they occur abruptly, with little or no [[Warning system|warning]]. More loosely, it is a term meaning \"a testing time\" or an \"[[emergency]] event\".\n\n[[File:War-of-the-worlds-tripod.jpg|thumb|The [[Alien (franchise)|alien]] invasion in [[War of the Worlds]] was a fictitious crisis]]\n\n== Definition ==\nCrisis is often linked to the concept of [[psychological stress]] and used to suggest a frightening or fraught experience. In general, crisis is the situation of a \"complex system\" (family, economy, society. Note that simple systems do not enter crises. We can speak about a crisis of moral values, an economical or political crisis, but not a motor crisis) when the system functions poorly (the system still functions, but does not break down), an immediate decision is necessary to stop the further disintegration of the system, but the causes of the dysfunction are not immediately identified (the causes are so many, or unknown, that it is impossible to take a rational, informed decision to reverse the situation).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bundy|first=J.|author2=Pfarrer, M.

J. (2003). Risk communication in a High Reliability Organization: APHIS PPQ's inclusion of risk in decision making. Ann Arbor, MI: UMI Proquest Information and Learning.</ref> argues that \"crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained.\" Therefore the fourth defining quality is the need for change. If change is not needed, the event could more accurately be described as a failure.\n\nApart from natural crises that are inherently unpredictable (volcanic eruptions, tsunami etc.) most of the crises that we face are created by man. Hence the requirements of their being 'unexpected' depends upon man failing to note the onset of crisis conditions. Some of our inability to recognise crises before they become dangerous is due to denial and other psychological responses <ref>Mitroff.I. (2005) Why some companies emerge stronger and better from a crisis, p36</ref> that provide succour and protection for our emotions.\n\nA different set of reasons for failing to notice the onset of crises is that we allow ourselves to be 'tricked' into believing that we are doing something for reasons that are false. In other words, we are doing the wrong things for the right reasons. For example, we might believe that we are solving the threats of climate change by engaging in economic trading activity that has no real impact on the climate. Mitroff and Silvers <ref>Mitroff & Silvers, (2009) Dirty rotten strategies</ref> posit two reasons for these mistakes, which they classify as Type 3 (inadvertent) and Type 4 (deliberate) errors.\n\nThe effect of our inability to attend to the likely results of our actions can result in crisis.\n\nFrom this perspective we might usefully learn that failing to understand the real causes of our difficulties is likely to lead to repeated downstream 'blowback'. Where [[Nation state|states]] are concerned, Michael Brecher, based on [[Case study|case studies]] of the [[International Crisis Behavior]] (ICB) project, suggested a different way of defining crisis as conditions are perceptions held by the highest level [[Decision making|decision-makers]] of the actor concerned:<ref>Shlaim, Avi, ''The United States and the Berlin Blockade, 1948\u20131949: a study in crisis decision-making'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1983, p.5</ref>\n1. [[threat]] to basic values, with a [[Simultaneity|simultaneous]] or subsequent\n2. high [[probability]] of involvement in [[combat|military hostilities]], and the awareness of\n3. finite time for response to the external value threat.\n\n===Chinese word for \"crisis\"===\n{{main|Chinese word for \"crisis\"}}\n<nowiki>It is frequently said in Western motivational speaking that the Chinese word for \"crisis\" is composed of two Chinese characters signifying \"danger\" and \"opportunity\" respectively. This is, however, considered by linguists to be a misperception. {{</nowiki>[[Template:Citation needed|Citation needed]]<nowiki>}}</nowiki>\n\n==Political crisis==\n{{see also|Constitutional crisis}}\n{{category see also|Government crises}}\n\n== Economic ==\n{{main|Crisis (economic)|l1=Economic crisis|Financial crisis}}\nAn ''economic crisis'' is a sharp transition to a [[recession]]. See for example [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico]], [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)]], [[South American economic crisis of 2002]], [[Economic crisis of Cameroon]]. [[Crisis theory]] is a central achievement in the conclusions of [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of Capital.\n\nA [[financial crisis]] may be a [[banking crisis]] or [[currency crisis]].\n\n== Environmental ==\nCrises pertaining to the environment include:\n\n=== Environmental disaster ===\n{{main|Environmental disaster}}\n\nAn '''environmental disaster''' is a [[disaster]] that is due to human activity and should not be confused with [[natural disaster]]s ''([[#Natural disaster|see below]])''. In this case, the impact of humans' alteration of the [[ecosystem]] has led to widespread and/or long-lasting consequences. It can include the deaths of animals (including humans) and plant systems, or severe disruption of human life, possibly requiring migration.\n\n=== Natural disaster ===\n{{main|Natural disaster}}\n\nA ''natural disaster'' is the consequence of a '''natural [[hazard]]''' (e.g. [[volcanic eruption]], [[earthquake]], [[landslide]]) which moves from potential into an active phase, and as a result affects human activities.  Human vulnerability, exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate [[emergency management]], leads to financial, structural, and human losses.  The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster, their resilience.<ref>{{cite book\n | author=G. Bankoff, G. Frerks, D.

An endangered species is usually a taxonomic [[species]], but may be another [[evolutionary significant unit]]. The [[World Conservation Union]] (IUCN) has classified 38 percent of the 44,837 species assessed by 2008 as threatened.<ref name = \"IUCN\">[http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/the_iucn_red_list_a_key_conservation_tool_factsheet_en.pdf Factsheet: The IUCN Red List a key conservation tool (2008)]</ref>\n\n== International ==\n{{main|International crisis|Crisis management}}\n\nFor information about crises in the field of study in [[international relations]], see [[crisis management]] and [[international crisis]]. In this context, a crisis can be loosely defined as a situation where there is a perception of threat, heightened anxiety, expectation of possible violence and the belief that any actions will have far-reaching consequences (Lebow, 7\u201310).\n\n== Personal ==\n[[File:Schnorr_von_Carolsfeld_Bibel_in_Bildern_1860_131.png|thumb|right|Messengers going to Job, each with bad news, 1860 woodcut by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nA personal crisis occurs when an individual can no longer cope with a situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\">Lanceley, F. J. (2003). On-Scene Guide for Crisis Negotiators, Second Edition (2nd ed.). London: CRC Press.</ref> This is preceded by events of an extraordinary nature triggering extreme tension and stress within an individual, i.e., the crisis, which then requires major decisions or actions to resolve. Crises can be triggered by a wide range of situations including, but not limited to, [[extreme weather]] conditions, sudden change in employment/financial state, medical emergencies, long-term illness, and social or familial turmoil. Crises are simply a change in the events that comprise the day-to-day life of a person and those in their close circle, such as the loss of a job, extreme financial hardship, substance addiction/abuse and other situations that are life altering and require action that is outside the \"normal\" daily routine. A person going through a crisis experiences a state of mental disequilibrium, in which the ego struggles to balance both internal and external demands.<ref name=\"Woolley\">{{cite journal | last1 = Woolley | first1 = N | year = 1990 | title = Crisis theory: A paradigm of effective intervention with families of critically ill people | url = | journal = Journal of Advanced Nursing | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 1402\u20131408 | doi =  10.1111/j.1365-2648.1990.tb01782.x}}</ref> In this case, said person resorts to [[coping mechanism]]s to deal with the stress. Various coping mechanisms include:<ref name=\"NBPG\">Nursing Best Practice Guideline: Shaping the future of Nursing. (Electronic book). Appendix C - Assessment of coping skills and support systems. (Page 53). Executive Director: Doris Grispun, RN, MScN, PhD. Date: August 2002.</ref>\n* High emotions (crying, physical withdrawal)\n* Defence mechanisms (denial, repression)\n* Making rash decisions\n* Acting out\n* Putting things on hold\n\nIn some cases, it is difficult for an individual undergoing a crisis to adapt to the situation. As it is outside of their normal range of functioning, it is common that one endures a struggle to control emotions. This lack of control can lead to suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, trouble with the law and general avoidance of resources available for help. One such resource used to aid an individual in crisis is their social support system, which can come in the form of family, friends, coworkers, or health professionals. It is important that a support system consists of people that the individual trusts. Although these support systems play a crucial role in aiding an individual through a crisis, they are also the underlying cause of two thirds of mental health crises.<ref name=\"NBPG\"/> The aforementioned mental health crises can include marital issues, abandonment, parental conflict and family struggles.\n\nIn order to aid someone in a crisis, it is crucial to be able to identify the signs that indicate they are undergoing an internal conflict. These signs, as well as the aforementioned coping mechanisms, include:<ref name=\"Lancely\"/><ref>Vecchi, G. M. (2009). Conflict and crisis communication. Annals of the American Psychotherapy Association, 12(2), 32-29.</ref>\n* Irrational and/or narrow thinking\n* Lowered attention span\n* Unclear motives\n* Disorganized approach to problem solving\n* Resistance to communication\n* Inability to differ between large and small issues\n* Change/alteration to social networks\n\n===Ways to manage a crisis===\nAs aforementioned, a crisis to this day can be overcome by implementing mechanisms such as: [[sleep]], [[Social rejection|rejection]], physical [[exercise]], [[meditation]] and [[thinking]]. To assist individuals in regaining emotional equilibrium, intervention can be used. The overall goal of a crisis intervention is to get the individual back to a pre-crisis level of functioning or higher with the help of a social support group. As said by Judith Swan, there's a strong correlation between the client's emotional balance and the trust in their support system in helping them throughout their crisis.<ref>Swan, J., & Hamilton, P.M. (2014). Mental health crisis management. Wild Iris Medical Education, Inc.</ref> The steps of crisis intervention are: to assess the situation based on behaviour patterns of the individual, decide what type of help is needed (make a plan of action) and finally to take action/intervention, based on the individual's skills to regain equilibrium.<ref name=\"Woolley\"/>\n\nThe Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario proposed the ABC model for dealing with client's interventions in crises:<ref>Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario. (2006). Crisis intervention. Toronto, ON: Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario.</ref>\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n    |1=<!--A-->Basic attending skills (making the person comfortable, remaining calm, etc.)\n    |2=<!--B-->Identifying the problem and therapeutic interaction (explore their perceptions, identify sources of emotional distress, identify impairments in behavioural functioning, use therapeutic interactions)\n    |3=<!--C-->Coping (identify coping attempts, present alternative coping strategies, follow up post-crisis)\n}}\n\n===Benefits of listening in a crisis===\nMoreover, another method for helping individuals who are suffering in a crisis is active listening; it is defined as seeing circumstances from another perspective and letting the other person know that the negotiator (the helper) understands their perspective. Through this, they establish trust and rapport by demonstrating empathy, understanding and objectivity in a non-judgmental way. It is important for the negotiator to listen to verbal and non-verbal reactions of the person in need, in order to be able to label the emotion that the individual is showing. Thus, this demonstrates that the helper is tuned in emotionally. Furthermore, there are other techniques that can be used to demonstrate actively listening such as: paraphrasing, silence and reflecting or mirroring. The goal in active listening is to keep the person talking about their situation.<ref name=\"Lancely\" />\n\n== In chaos theory==\n{{main| Crisis (dynamical systems)}}\n\nWhen the control parameter of a chaotic system is modified, the chaotic [[attractor]] touches an unstable\nperiodic orbit inside the basin of attraction inducing a sudden expansion in the attractor.\nThis phenomenon is termed as interior crisis in a chaotic system.\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Chinese word for \"crisis\"]]\n* [[Constitutional crisis]]\n* [[Coup d'\u00e9tat]]\n* [[Crisis state]]\n* [[Crisis management]]\n* [[Hostage crisis]]\n* [[Distress signal]]\n** [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]\n** [[SOS]]\n{{col-break|width=25%}}\n* [[Ecological crisis]]\n* [[Energy crisis]]\n* [[Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management]]\n* [[Mid-life crisis]]\n* [[Revolution]]\n* [[War]]\n* [[Crysis]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Borodzicz, E.

{"title_page": "Liberal hawk", "text_new": "The term '''liberal hawk''' refers to a politically liberal person (in [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the American sense of the term]]) who supports a [[hawkish]], [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]] foreign policy. \n\n==Overview==\nPast U.S. presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry S. Truman]], [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] have been described as liberal hawks for their roles in bringing about the US's status as the world's premier military power. The [[Clinton Doctrine]] can also be considered as consistent with this vision. Today the term is most frequently used to describe liberals and [[leftists]] who supported or still support the decision to [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invade Iraq]] in 2003, which was authorized by the [[United States Congress]] and ordered by president [[George W. Bush]]. The war has stirred heated controversy among all political sides of the debate. The American left was divided over the issue of whether going to war in Iraq was the right decision, as some liberals felt that they should support the war, in accordance with the philosophy of [[liberal internationalism]], which had caused them to support military intervention in the past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Liberal-quandary.htm|title=The Liberal Quandary Over Iraq|date=December 8, 2002|work=The New York Times Magazine}}</ref>\n\nOne document often cited as promoting a liberal hawkish point of view is ''[[Progressive Internationalism: A Democratic National Security Strategy]]'', published by the Progressive Policy Institute in October 2003.<ref name=\"Liberal Hawk Down\"/> Another document related to this philosophy is a letter to President Bush sent by [[Social Democrats USA]] in February 2003, urging the military overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime.<ref>[http://www.socialdemocrats.org/IraqLetter3.html Letter to President Bush] sent by [[Social Democrats USA]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509134106/http://www.socialdemocrats.org/IraqLetter3.html |date=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004, [[Paul Berman]], [[Thomas Friedman]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[George Packer]], [[Kenneth Pollack]], [[Jacob Weisberg]], [[Fareed Zakaria]] and [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]] participated in a five-day online forum entitled ''Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War'', in which they discussed whether they had been correct in advocating military action against [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.

Vauxhall was part of [[Surrey]] until 1889 when the [[County of London]] was created.\n\nFrom the Victorian period until the mid-20th century, Vauxhall was a mixed industrial and residential area, of predominantly manual workers' homes, many demolished and replaced by [[Lambeth Council]] with [[social housing]] after the [[Second World War]], and business premises, including large railway, gas, and water works. These industries contrasted with the mostly residential neighbouring districts of [[Kennington]] and [[Pimlico]]. As in neighbouring [[Battersea]] and [[Nine Elms]], riverside redevelopment has converted most former industrial sites into residential properties and new office space.\n\nVauxhall has given its name to the [[Vauxhall (UK Parliament constituency)|Vauxhall]] parliamentary constituency, [[Vauxhall Motors]], and \u2013 most likely apocryphally \u2013 the Russian word {{lang|ru|[[:ru:\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b|\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b]]}} (''vokzal''), meaning a large railway station.\n\n==Geography==\nVauxhall is 2.1&nbsp;km south of Charing Cross and 1.5&nbsp;km southwest of the actual centre of London at Frazier Street near [[Lambeth North tube station]]. Vauxhall is adjacent to the [[River Thames]], on the opposite side of the river to Pimlico. To the north is the district of [[Lambeth]] and to the northeast is the district of Kennington. South Lambeth, [[Stockwell]], and the [[Patmore Estate]] are to the south of Vauxhall. Many of the roads of Vauxhall converge at an area known as [[Vauxhall Cross]], where both [[Vauxhall station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] and the bus station are located. To the northeast of Vauxhall Cross is the [[Vauxhall Gardens|Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens]] and to the southeast is the large [[Vauxhall Park]].\n==Local politics==\nVauxhall is located within the [[London Borough of Lambeth]]. It is within and also has given its name to the [[Vauxhall_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Vauxhall parliamentary constituency]]. After [[Kate Hoey]] was deselected from the Labour Party, [[Florence Eshalomi]] was elected in 2019[https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/general-election-2019-florence-eshalomi-leanne-wernerp/]. \n\nThe [[Oval, London|subdistrict of Oval]] is located within the eastern part of Vauxhall Parliamentary constituency, but the [[Lambeth Council]] electoral ward for Vauxhall is named [[Oval (ward)|Oval]].<ref name=\"LambethCouncil1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ec-%20ELECTORAL%20Polling%20Districts%20and%20Stations%20%28Oval%29.pdf|title=Oval Electoral Ward|publisher=[[Lambeth Council]]|access-date=April 11, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814102934/http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/ec-%20ELECTORAL%20Polling%20Districts%20and%20Stations%20%28Oval%29.pdf|archivedate=14 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"LambethCouncil2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/State-of-the-borough-2012.pdf|title=Overview of the Borough|publisher=[[Lambeth Council]]|access-date=April 11, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192410/http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/sites/default/files/State-of-the-borough-2012.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>. The ward has historically been a marginal ward, meaning candidates from either the Liberal Democrats or Labour are elected. As of the [[2018 Lambeth London Borough Council election|2018 local elections]], the ward is represented by three Labour Party councillors.\n\nSince the 2014 Council Elections, Labour has held and won all 24 council seats in the Vauxhall constituency, doing the same in 2018. However, in the 2019 EU Elections, the Liberal Democrats won every ward in the constituency.<ref>https://twitter.com/georgenturner/status/1132925177669533696?s=21</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lambeth Met.

It has long been suggested that a Russian delegation visited the area to inspect the construction of the [[London & South Western Railway]] (L&SWR) in 1840, and mistook the name of the station for the generic name of the building type.  This was further embellished into a story that Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], visiting London in 1844, was taken to see the trains at Vauxhall and made the same mistake.  Alternatively, the locality of the L&SWR's original railway terminus, Nine Elms Station, was shown boldly and simply as \"Vauxhall\" in the 1841 ''[[Bradshaw's Guide|Bradshaw]]'' timetable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantscat/html/h0106442.htm |title=1841 Railway guide for Vauxhall |publisher=Geog.port.ac.uk |date=26 September 2001 |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305013633/http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantscat/html/h0106442.htm |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBoth these explanations can probably be dismissed, since the [[Tsarskoye_Selo_Railway|first public railway in Russia]] had already been built by 1837.  This line ran from [[Saint Petersburg]] via [[Tsarskoye Selo]] to [[Pavlovsk Palace]], where extensive [[pleasure gardens]] had earlier been established. In 1838, a music and entertainment pavilion was constructed at the railway terminus. This pavilion was called the ''Vokzal'' in homage to the [[Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens]] in London. The name soon came to be applied to the station itself, which was the gateway that most visitors used to enter the gardens. It later came to mean any substantial railway station building (a different Russian word, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f (''stantsiya''), is used for minor stations).\n\nThe word ''voksal'' (\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043b) had been known in the Russian language with the meaning of \"amusement park\" long before the 1840s and may be found, e.g. in the poetry of [[Aleksandr Pushkin]]: {{lang|ru|\u041d\u0430 \u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u043d\u044c\u044f\u0445 \u0438\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445 / \u041b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0437\u0435\u0444\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b}} (\"To Natalie\" (1813): \"At [[f\u00eate]]s or in ''voksals'', /I've been flitting like a gentle [[Zephirus|Zephyrus]]\" [<small>here \"Zephyrus\" is an [[allegory]] of a gentle, warm and pleasant wind </small>]) According to [[Vasmer]], the word is first attested in the ''[[Saint Petersburg Vedomosti]]'' for 1777 in the form \u0444\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043b, which may reflect the earlier English spelling of Fox Hall/Faukeshall. Englishman [[Michael Maddox]] established a Vauxhall Gardens in the Saint Petersburg suburbs (Pavlovsk) in 1783, with pleasure gardens, a small theatre/concert hall, and places for refreshment. Archdeacon [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]] describes the place as a \"sort of Vauxhall\" in that year, in his ''Travels into Russia''.\n\n===Early history===\nNo mention of Vauxhall is made in the 1086 ''[[Domesday Book]]''.

Many companies and organisations were attracted in the past by Vauxhall's central location and comparatively cheap rent compared to [[Westminster]] on the other side of the river. In recent years, Vauxhall's riverside has undergone major redevelopment with the construction of a number of modern residential and office blocks, most notably the distinctive [[SIS Building]] at Vauxhall Cross. Also, a number of new commercial businesses have moved  into the area.\n\n===Gay Village and \"Voho\"===\n[[Image:Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Vauxhall, SE11 (2866697236).jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]], a well-known gay venue]]\nVauxhall is home to a number of gay bars and nightclubs, such as Area, Chariots, The Eagle, Fire, and the [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]], as well as other venues often holding special events for gay clubbers, such as Club Colosseum, Hidden, and Renaissance Rooms. The aforementioned Royal Vauxhall Tavern dates back to at least the late 19th century, and was for many years a traditional English music hall and cabaret venue. In recent years, the building has come under constant threat of buyout and demolition from property developers, as it stands alone on a prime piece of grassland adjacent to Vauxhall railway station. However, the pub was bought in 2004 by sympathetic owners who have announced, \"business as usual\".\n\nVauxhall was originally the home of the more underground gay clubs with the arrival of Crash in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/gay/features/220/Vauxhall_gay_village.html |title=Vauxhall gay village |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516175404/http://www.timeout.com/london/gay/features/220/Vauxhall_gay_village.html |archivedate=16 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Over the years, more clubs and gay businesses have followed Crash's lead by opening up in the railway arches underneath the main line out of [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]]. One of the most notable venues to open in the area is Fire Night Club, which is located on Parry Street and currently occupies six of the arches aforementioned. Fire was the scene of a drugs raid by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] on 28 April 2007 where nine people were arrested. The tactics used in the raid (namely photographing all the persons leaving the venue) were strongly criticised by the gay press at the time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Writer |first=Staff |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4249.html/ |title=Concerns raised over police tactics during gay club raid |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date=28 April 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821064641/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4249.html/ |archivedate=21 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe burgeoning club scene and the lure of the more trendy railway arches once made Vauxhall a prime destination for businesses to open up in, including London's only exclusively gay gym, Paris Gym, another branch of Chariots gay sauna and the Sunday Morning Afterhours venue, Beyond hosted at 'Area' club. The area at the time earned the nickname \"Vauxhall Gay Village\". During the mid-2010s, many venues have closed due to gentrification, amongst them The Hoist and Barcode.\n\nBefore Vauxhall earned its reputation as a gay village, it was regarded among the underground gay club scene as the place to go to avoid the more commercial nights elsewhere in central London. However, the market has become more and more lucrative with the arrival of more venues and more nights, and Vauxhall has been criticised as becoming increasingly commercial, diluting its once underground appeal. The demise of other club venues in London, such as [[Turnmills]], the [[London Astoria|Astoria]] and [[The Fridge (nightclub)|The Fridge]], have led to the gay club scene to become more centralised in Vauxhall, turning it into an alternative destination from Soho for gay people to socialise. Vauxhall has also become colloquially known as \"Voho\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londongayman.co.uk/article-keep-it-gay-59.html |title=Keep it glad, Keep it mad, Keep it gay! |publisher=Londongayman.co.uk |date=30 April 1999 |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> (a portmanteau of the names Vauxhall and Soho) within the gay community, due to the emergence of Vauxhall as a gay village after Soho.\n\nEntertainment in the Vauxhall area is not exclusively aimed at gay clientele; the oldest strip pub in London (the Queen Anne) sitting at Vauxhall Walk has now closed to be replaced with The Tea Theatre, a 1940s-themed tea room.\n\n==Features==\n[[File:SIS building (26327425611).jpg|thumb|The [[SIS building|Vauxhall Cross headquarters]] of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]]]]\n[[File:Vauxhall Cross roundel.svg|thumb|Vauxhall Cross, the fictional Tube station featured in [[James Bond films]] ]]\nBy Vauxhall Bridge stands [[SIS Building|the central headquarters]] of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (more commonly referred to as MI6), which occupies offices built between 1989 and 1992 and commonly referred to as Vauxhall Cross. Since 1992, a large complex of apartments and offices has been built to the south of Vauxhall Bridge at St George Wharf. Part of this development includes the [[St George Wharf Tower]], completed in 2014.\n\nThe MI6 building has featured in several [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond films]], initially filmed without permission, but then condoned by then Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] with his memorable \"After all James Bond has done for Britain...\" quip. It appears in ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (wherein it suffers a fictional terrorist attack that prefigured a genuine incident), ''[[Die Another Day]]'', ''[[Skyfall]]'' (where it also comes under a fictional terrorist attack), and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015) (wherein it is demolished). ''Die Another Day'' featured a [[List of fictional London Underground stations|fictional London Underground station]], Vauxhall Cross, a fictional closed stop on the [[Piccadilly line]] now employed by MI6 as an extension to its HQ. (In fact, the Piccadilly line does not come south of the river at all; only the [[Victoria line]] passes anywhere nearby, and the secret entrance to the station shown in the film is on the east side of Westminster Bridge, some considerable distance downriver.)\n\nVauxhall is also home to [[Brunswick House]], a listed [[Georgian era|Georgian]] mansion and former home to the [[Duke of Brunswick|Dukes of Brunswick]]. Built in 1758, it once stood in three acres of riverside parkland; now it sits overshadowed by the St George Wharf complex. The building was in a state of disrepair and was on the [[English Heritage]] 'Buildings at Risk' list until the London Architectural Salvage and Supply Company acquired it in 2004 and restored it as a premises from which to sell architectural salvage.

Next to St Peter's is [[Vauxhall City Farm]].\n\n==Transport==\nVauxhall is well connected even by central London standards. [[London Underground]], [[National Rail]] trains, and [[London buses]] are all available at [[Vauxhall station]]. The tube stop is on the boundary of zones 1 and 2 of the London [[Travelcard]] area on the [[Victoria line]], and [[Northern line]] stations are within walking distance of many parts of Vauxhall, though the nearest is [[Oval tube station|Oval]]. The railway station is served by [[South Western Railway (train operating company)|South Western Railway]] to and from [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]], which is one stop away. [[Vauxhall bus station]] has 14 routes serving various parts of London.\n\nThe availability of underground, trains, and buses has given Vauxhall a [[Public transport accessibility level|PTAL]] rating of 6b at its centre.<ref name=\"Local Development Framework\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:dvGpz9qaV2MJ:www.lambeth.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5E2E4469-CDC6-4D71-A9EF-CCAEBF478103/0/TopicPaper5DeliveryOfPublicTransportInfrastructureInVauxhallMarch2010.pdf+ptal+rating+vauxhall&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShZRWcnER_oJHyQN62y6rODotBnJQOHXISGXY5nuZ5h-ZstttUZkAbxzKjf39nasEWMbr3R-CvIkI61JcyOOyw8K43iRtgybEd35Ah5h0RGx-r2MUJqu8wRx_wCMXS8DSj-O7o0&sig=AHIEtbRuuKkQKmwLbtygORPWK_Rcy4wtBg |title=London Borough of Lambeth, 'Delivery of public transport infrastructure in Vauxhall', LDF Core Strategy topic paper 5, Lambeth: London, p. 2.

Vauxhall also has two 17-space [[Santander Cycles]] docking stations and [[Cycle Superhighway]] 7 runs through the area.\n\n===Vauxhall Cross===\n[[Image:Vauxhall cross.jpg|thumb|The Vauxhall Cross transport interchange, 2005: The solar panels supply energy for 60% of the bus station's lighting.]]\nVauxhall Cross is immediately to the southeast of Vauxhall Bridge, where six major roads converge, including the [[Albert Embankment]], which exits the Cross to the north and is the southernmost point of entry into the [[London congestion charge]] area. Vauxhall Cross was described as \"one of the most unpleasant road junctions in South London\" in [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s architectural guide to London. Through 2002 to 2004, the Cross underwent a gradual redesign to accommodate a bus interchange linked to the [[Vauxhall station|Vauxhall mainline railway and tube stations]], both of which are located to the southeastern end of the cross.\n\nWork has involved design changes to traffic lanes, improved pedestrian and cycle crossings, refurbishment of walkways beneath the mainline railway viaduct, and the construction of a bus station, completed in December 2004 featuring an undulating steel-frame canopy and ribbed steel walls. An interesting feature of the canopy is a series of photoelectric cells generating electricity to offset the energy used by the bus station.\n\nVauxhall Cross bus station<!-- , built only 13 years ago, --> will be redeveloped to create a new mixed-use development consisting of offices, hotels, and shopping areas. The project will be managed by Great Marlborough Estates and has an apparent budget of \u00a3600 million, and is estimated to make the developers over \u00a345 million. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/huge-towers-to-replace-vauxhall-bus-station/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207013428/https://www.londonnewsonline.co.uk/huge-towers-to-replace-vauxhall-bus-station/ |archivedate=7 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }},\n Huge towers to replace Vauxhall bus station, South London Press & Mercury</ref>\n\n===Nearest tube stations===\n* [[Vauxhall tube station|Vauxhall]]\n* [[Kennington tube station|Kennington]]\n* [[Oval tube station|Oval]]\n* [[Pimlico tube station|Pimlico]]\n* [[Stockwell tube station|Stockwell]]\n\n==Community facilities==\nVauxhall Park<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vauxhallpark.org.uk/ |title=Friends of Vauxhall Park |publisher=Vauxhallpark.org.uk |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413170941/http://www.vauxhallpark.org.uk/ |archivedate=13 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> contains an area of miniature model houses (also in [[Fitzroy Gardens, Melbourne]]) as well as tennis courts, day care in the \"one o'clock club\", and children's playground.

Vauxhall was part of [[Surrey]] until 1889 when the [[County of London]] was created.\n\nFrom the Victorian period until the mid-20th century, Vauxhall was a mixed industrial and residential area, of predominantly manual workers' homes, many demolished and replaced by [[Lambeth Council]] with [[social housing]] after the [[Second World War]], and business premises, including large railway, gas, and water works. These industries contrasted with the mostly residential neighbouring districts of [[Kennington]] and [[Pimlico]]. As in neighbouring [[Battersea]] and [[Nine Elms]], riverside redevelopment has converted most former industrial sites into residential properties and new office space.\n\nVauxhall has given its name to the [[Vauxhall (UK Parliament constituency)|Vauxhall]] parliamentary constituency, [[Vauxhall Motors]], and - most likely apocryphally - the Russian word {{lang|ru|[[:ru:\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b|\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b]]}} (''vokzal''), meaning a large railway station.\n\n==Geography==\nVauxhall is 2.1&nbsp;km south of Charing Cross and 1.5&nbsp;km southwest of the actual centre of London at Frazier Street near [[Lambeth North tube station]]. Vauxhall is adjacent to the [[River Thames]], on the opposite side of the river to Pimlico. To the north is the district of [[Lambeth]] and to the northeast is the district of Kennington. South Lambeth, [[Stockwell]], and the [[Patmore Estate]] are to the south of Vauxhall. Many of the roads of Vauxhall converge at an area known as [[Vauxhall Cross]], where both [[Vauxhall station]] on the [[South Western Main Line]] and the bus station are located. To the northeast of Vauxhall Cross is the [[Vauxhall Gardens|Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens]] and to the southeast is the large [[Vauxhall Park]].\n==Local politics==\nVauxhall is located within the [[London Borough of Lambeth]].

This was further embellished into a story that Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], visiting London in 1844, was taken to see the trains at Vauxhall and made the same mistake.  Alternatively, the locality of the L&SWR's original railway terminus, Nine Elms Station, was shown boldly and simply as \"Vauxhall\" in the 1841 ''[[Bradshaw's Guide|Bradshaw]]'' timetable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantscat/html/h0106442.htm |title=1841 Railway guide for Vauxhall |publisher=Geog.port.ac.uk |date=26 September 2001 |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305013633/http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantscat/html/h0106442.htm |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBoth these explanations can probably be dismissed, since the [[Tsarskoye_Selo_Railway|first public railway in Russia]] had already been built by 1837.  This line ran from [[Saint Petersburg]] via [[Tsarskoye Selo]] to [[Pavlovsk Palace]], where extensive [[pleasure gardens]] had earlier been established. In 1838, a music and entertainment pavilion was constructed at the railway terminus. This pavilion was called the ''Vokzal'' in homage to the [[Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens]] in London. The name soon came to be applied to the station itself, which was the gateway that most visitors used to enter the gardens. It later came to mean any substantial railway station building (a different Russian word, \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f (''stantsiya''), is used for minor stations).\n\nThe word ''voksal'' (\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043b) had been known in the Russian language with the meaning of \"amusement park\" long before the 1840s and may be found, e.g. in the poetry of [[Aleksandr Pushkin]]: {{lang|ru|\u041d\u0430 \u0433\u0443\u043b\u044f\u043d\u044c\u044f\u0445 \u0438\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u0432\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445 / \u041b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0437\u0435\u0444\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043c \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b}} (\"To Natalie\" (1813): \"At [[f\u00eate]]s or in ''voksals'', /I've been flitting like a gentle [[Zephirus|Zephyrus]]\" [<small>here \"Zephyrus\" is an [[allegory]] of a gentle, warm and pleasant wind </small>]) According to [[Vasmer]], the word is first attested in the ''[[Saint Petersburg Vedomosti]]'' for 1777 in the form \u0444\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043b, which may reflect the earlier English spelling of Fox Hall/Faukeshall.

Prior to this, it provided market garden produce for the nearby [[City of London]]. [[Vauxhall Bridge]] and [[Inner Ring Road, London#Vauxhall Bridge Road|Vauxhall Bridge Road]] were opened in 1816. By 1860, the village had been subsumed by the town of Lambeth.<ref name=\"Lon Ency\" /> Many of Vauxhall's streets were destroyed during the construction of the railway to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]] via the [[Nine Elms to Waterloo Viaduct]], by German bombing in [[World War II]] or ravaged through poor city planning.\n\n==Demography==\nThe explosion in London property prices during the late 1990s and early 2000s has led to a boom in riverside construction, such as the large [[St George Wharf]] development by Vauxhall Bridge.

Many companies and organisations were attracted in the past by Vauxhall's central location and comparatively cheap rent compared to [[Westminster]] on the other side of the river. In recent years, Vauxhall's riverside has undergone major redevelopment with the construction of a number of modern residential and office blocks, most notably the distinctive [[SIS Building]] at Vauxhall Cross. Also, a number of new commercial businesses have moved  into the area.\n\n===Gay Village and \"Voho\"===\n[[Image:Royal Vauxhall Tavern, Vauxhall, SE11 (2866697236).jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]], a well-known gay venue]]\nVauxhall is home to a number of gay bars and nightclubs, such as Area, Chariots, The Eagle, Fire, and the [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]], as well as other venues often holding special events for gay clubbers, such as Club Colosseum, Hidden, and Renaissance Rooms. The aforementioned Royal Vauxhall Tavern dates back to at least the late 19th century, and was for many years a traditional English music hall and cabaret venue. In recent years, the building has come under constant threat of buyout and demolition from property developers, as it stands alone on a prime piece of grassland adjacent to Vauxhall railway station. However, the pub was bought in 2004 by sympathetic owners who have announced, \"business as usual\".\n\nVauxhall was originally the home of the more underground gay clubs with the arrival of Crash in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/gay/features/220/Vauxhall_gay_village.html |title=Vauxhall gay village |publisher=Timeout.com |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516175404/http://www.timeout.com/london/gay/features/220/Vauxhall_gay_village.html |archivedate=16 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Over the years, more clubs and gay businesses have followed Crash's lead by opening up in the railway arches underneath the main line out of [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]]. One of the most notable venues to open in the area is Fire Night Club, which is located on Parry Street and currently occupies six of the arches aforementioned. Fire was the scene of a drugs raid by the [[Metropolitan Police Service]] on 28 April 2007 where nine people were arrested. The tactics used in the raid (namely photographing all the persons leaving the venue) were strongly criticised by the gay press at the time.<ref>{{cite web |last=Writer |first=Staff |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4249.html/ |title=Concerns raised over police tactics during gay club raid |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date=28 April 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821064641/http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-4249.html/ |archivedate=21 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe burgeoning club scene and the lure of the more trendy railway arches once made Vauxhall a prime destination for businesses to open up in, including London's only exclusively gay gym, Paris Gym, another branch of Chariots gay sauna and the Sunday Morning Afterhours venue, Beyond hosted at 'Area' club. The area at the time earned the nickname \"Vauxhall Gay Village\". During the mid-2010s, many venues have closed due to gentrification, amongst them The Hoist and Barcode.\n\nBefore Vauxhall earned its reputation as a gay village, it was regarded among the underground gay club scene as the place to go to avoid the more commercial nights elsewhere in central London. However, the market has become more and more lucrative with the arrival of more venues and more nights, and Vauxhall has been criticised as becoming increasingly commercial, diluting its once underground appeal. The demise of other club venues in London, such as [[Turnmills]], the [[London Astoria|Astoria]] and [[The Fridge (nightclub)|The Fridge]], have led to the gay club scene to become more centralised in Vauxhall, turning it into an alternative destination from Soho for gay people to socialise.

Since 1992, a large complex of apartments and offices has been built to the south of Vauxhall Bridge at St George Wharf. Part of this development includes the [[St George Wharf Tower]], completed in 2014.\n\nThe MI6 building has featured in several [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond films]], initially filmed without permission, but then condoned by then Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] with his memorable \"After all James Bond has done for Britain...\" quip. It appears in ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' (wherein it suffers a fictional terrorist attack that prefigured a genuine incident), ''[[Die Another Day]]'', ''[[Skyfall]]'' (where it also comes under a fictional terrorist attack), and ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'' (2015) (wherein it is demolished). ''Die Another Day'' featured a [[List of fictional London Underground stations|fictional London Underground station]], Vauxhall Cross, a fictional closed stop on the [[Piccadilly line]] now employed by MI6 as an extension to its HQ. (In fact, the Piccadilly line does not come south of the river at all; only the [[Victoria line]] passes anywhere nearby, and the secret entrance to the station shown in the film is on the east side of Westminster Bridge, some considerable distance downriver.)\n\nVauxhall is also home to [[Brunswick House]], a listed [[Georgian era|Georgian]] mansion and former home to the [[Duke of Brunswick|Dukes of Brunswick]]. Built in 1758, it once stood in three acres of riverside parkland; now it sits overshadowed by the St George Wharf complex.

Vauxhall Cross was described as \"one of the most unpleasant road junctions in South London\" in [[Nikolaus Pevsner]]'s architectural guide to London. Through 2002 to 2004, the Cross underwent a gradual redesign to accommodate a bus interchange linked to the [[Vauxhall station|Vauxhall mainline railway and tube stations]], both of which are located to the southeastern end of the cross.\n\nWork has involved design changes to traffic lanes, improved pedestrian and cycle crossings, refurbishment of walkways beneath the mainline railway viaduct, and the construction of a bus station, completed in December 2004 featuring an undulating steel-frame canopy and ribbed steel walls. An interesting feature of the canopy is a series of photoelectric cells generating electricity to offset the energy used by the bus station.\n\nVauxhall Cross bus station<!-- , built only 13 years ago, --> will be redeveloped to create a new mixed-use development consisting of offices, hotels, and shopping areas.

She is a former provincial junior champion and is currently a skip on the [[World Curling Tour]].\n\n==Junior career==\nScheidegger's junior career involved winning the 2009 Alberta Junior Curling championships with teammates [[Kalynn Park]], younger sister [[Jessie Scheidegger|Jessie Haughian]], and [[Jayme Coutts]]. The rink represented Alberta at the [[2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships]] where they finished the round robin in 2nd place with a 9\u20133 record. However, they ended up losing the semi-final to Manitoba's [[Kaitlyn Lawes]].\n\n==Women's career==\nScheidegger has been playing in World Curling Tour events since the 2004\u201305 season. She has played in 16 [[Grand Slam of Curling|Grand Slam]] events, including the 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 editions of the [[Autumn Gold Curling Classic]], which is no longer a Grand Slam event.\n\nScheidegger qualified for her first [[Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|women's provincial championship]] [[2011 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|in 2011]] where she won two games before being eliminated after five matches. Sheidegger qualified for her second provincials [[2012 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|in 2012]] where she had the same result. She qualified once again [[2013 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|in 2013]] where she would again win her first two games, and then lose three straight. At the [[2014 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], she improved upon her usual result, by winning three games before being knocked out of competition in the triple knock-out event. At the [[2015 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], she finally led her team to the playoffs, before she lost to [[Chelsea Carey]]. She was not as lucky at the [[2016 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] where she was knocked out in the playoff qualifying game. \n\nScheidegger won her first grand slam event at the [[2017 Meridian Canadian Open]], which was also the first major slam she played in. Later that month, at the [[2017 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], she made it all the way to the semifinal, where she lost to Chelsea Carey. \n\nScheidegger and team played in the [[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials]], finishing the event with a 3\u20135 record. Later that season, at the [[2018 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], Scheidegger would win the B event in the triple knockout, putting her in the A vs B page playoff against [[Chelsea Carey]]. She would win that game and play [[Shannon Kleibrink]] in the final. In an extra end, she would steal the win, and the right to represent Alberta at the Scotties. At the national [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Scotties]], Scheidegger would have a strong week, starting the tournament with a 7\u20131 record, but her team would take 3 key losses to finish the combined round robin at 7\u20134, just out of the playoffs.\n\nScheidegger was less successful at the [[2019 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts]], failing to even qualify for the playoffs. However, strong play that season qualified her rink for a second chance in the [[2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] wild card game, where they beat Team [[Kerri Einarson]], qualifying the team for the main event. At the Scotties, Scheidegger led her team to a 7\u20134 record, for a fifth-place finish, just outside the playoffs.\n\n==Year-by-year statistics==\n{| BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"3\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" ID=\"Table3\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Year\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Team\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Position\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Event\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Finish\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Record\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Pct.*\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 2009\n| Scheidegger\n| Skip\n| Alberta Juniors\n| 1st\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2009\n|| Alberta (Scheidegger)\n|| Skip\n|| [[2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships|Canadian Juniors]]\n|| 3rd\n|| 9\u20133\n|| 81\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2011\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2011 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 2\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2012\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2012 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 2\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2013\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2013 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 2\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2014\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2014 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 3\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2015\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2015 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| 4th\n|| 5\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2016\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2016 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 3\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2017\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2017 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| 3rd\n|| 5\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| '''2017'''\n|| '''Scheidegger'''\n|| '''Skip'''\n|| '''[[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials|2017 COCT]]'''\n|| '''6th'''\n|| '''3\u20135'''\n|| '''80'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2018\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2018 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| 1st\n|| 6\u20131\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| '''2018'''\n|| '''Alberta (Scheidegger)'''\n|| '''Skip'''\n|| '''[[2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts|2018 STOH]]'''\n|| '''5th'''\n|| '''7\u20134'''\n|| '''81'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2018\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2018 Canada Cup|Canada Cup]]\n|| 4th\n|| 4\u20133\n|| 76\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2019\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2019 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 3\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2019\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts#Wildcard game|STOH Wildcard]]\n|| 1st\n|| 1\u20130\n|| 68<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Scotties Wild Card Game |url=https://www.curling.ca/scoreboard/#!/competitions/4449/reports/cumulative_statistics_by_team/22865/draws/17370 |website=Curling Canada |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| '''2019'''\n|| '''Wild Card (Scheidegger)'''\n|| '''Skip'''\n|| '''[[2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts|2019 STOH]]'''\n|| '''5th'''\n|| '''7\u20134'''\n|| '''75'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2020\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2020 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| T5th\n|| 2\u20135\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | '''Scotties Tournament of Hearts Totals'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''14\u20138'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''78'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | '''Olympic Curling Trial Totals'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''3\u20135'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''80'''\n|}\n<nowiki>\n*</nowiki> Round robin only\n\n==Grand Slam record==\nScheidegger won her first ever Grand Slam event (excluding defunct events, which are not counted by media reports) when she won the [[2017 Meridian Canadian Open]].\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

At the Scotties, Scheidegger led her team to a 7\u20134 record, for a fifth-place finish, just outside the playoffs.\n\n==Year-by-year statistics==\n{| BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"3\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" ID=\"Table3\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Year\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Team\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Position\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Event\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Finish\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Record\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Pct.*\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 2009\n| Scheidegger\n| Skip\n| Alberta Juniors\n| 1st\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2009\n|| Alberta (Scheidegger)\n|| Skip\n|| [[2009 Canadian Junior Curling Championships|Canadian Juniors]]\n|| 3rd\n|| 9\u20133\n|| 81\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2011\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2011 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 2\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2012\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2012 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 2\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2013\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2013 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 2\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2014\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2014 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 3\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2015\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2015 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| 4th\n|| 5\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2016\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2016 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 3\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2017\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2017 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| 3rd\n|| 5\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| '''2017'''\n|| '''Scheidegger'''\n|| '''Skip'''\n|| '''[[2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials|2017 COCT]]'''\n|| '''6th'''\n|| '''3\u20135'''\n|| '''80'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2018\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2018 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| 1st\n|| 6\u20131\n|| \u2013\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| '''2018'''\n|| '''Alberta (Scheidegger)'''\n|| '''Skip'''\n|| '''[[2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts|2018 STOH]]'''\n|| '''5th'''\n|| '''7\u20134'''\n|| '''81'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2018\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2018 Canada Cup|Canada Cup]]\n|| 4th\n|| 4\u20133\n|| 76\n|- style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| 2019\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2019 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| DNQ\n|| 3\u20133\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2019\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts#Wildcard game|STOH Wildcard]]\n|| 1st\n|| 1\u20130\n|| 68<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Scotties Wild Card Game |url=https://www.curling.ca/scoreboard/#!/competitions/4449/reports/cumulative_statistics_by_team/22865/draws/17370 |website=Curling Canada |accessdate=February 11, 2020}}</ref>\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|| '''2019'''\n|| '''Wild Card (Scheidegger)'''\n|| '''Skip'''\n|| '''[[2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts|2019 STOH]]'''\n|| '''5th'''\n|| '''7\u20134'''\n|| '''75'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 2020\n|| Scheidegger\n|| Skip\n|| [[2020 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Alberta STOH]]\n|| T5th\n|| 2\u20135\n|| \u2013\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | '''Scotties Tournament of Hearts Totals'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''14\u20138'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''78'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#e0e0e0;\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | '''Olympic Curling Trial Totals'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''3\u20135'''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| '''80'''\n|}\n<nowiki>\n*</nowiki> Round robin only\n\n==Grand Slam record==\nScheidegger won her first ever Grand Slam event (excluding defunct events, which are not counted by media reports) when she won the [[2017 Meridian Canadian Open]].\n{{Curling GS key}}\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!
