One week later, both Van Dam and Benjamin picked mystery opponents for one another, with the loser placing their respective prize on the line in a bout at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]] on April 30. Benjamin lost to the returning [[Charlie Haas]], while Van Dam was defeated by all five members of the [[Spirit Squad]]. As a result, both the Intercontinental Championship and the Money in the Bank title shot were contested at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]].

At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], Van Dam cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship. After two referees were knocked out, [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] appeared from underneath the ring to attack Cena, [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spearing]] him through a table. Van Dam then hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Five Star Frog Splash]] and the pinfall was counted by Paul Heyman, who suddenly ran down the aisle. On the following episode of ''Raw'', [[Vince McMahon]] confirmed that the title change was official due to the match being held under \"extreme rules\". For the past few weeks, Heyman had hinted that the WWE Championship would be \"rechristened\" the ECW World Heavyweight Championship when Van Dam won. On the debut of ''[[ECW on Sci Fi]]'', Van Dam was awarded the reinstated [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] by Heyman and decided to defend the WWE Championship separately and simultaneously, joking that \"this one spins\", becoming the first wrestler in history to hold both the WWE Championship and the ECW World Heavyweight Championship as well as the only one to hold them at the same time, making him a double world champion. He would  become the fifteenth WWE [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown Champion]] as a result of his WWE Championship win.\n\nAt [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]], Van Dam defeated Edge to retain the WWE Championship.

His return to the ring came a week later, in a losing effort to Sabu in a [[ladder match]] for number one contendership to the now renamed ECW World Championship. Van Dam slowly worked his way back into the championship picture. In October, Van Dam defeated Big Show in a non-title match to regain the number one contendership. Having the option to pick a date, Van Dam announced the title match would occur at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]. However, Heyman had the option of picking the match type and announced that the main event would be a six-man [[Elimination Chamber#Variations|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] match. At the event on December 3, Van Dam was the third participant eliminated. Later in December, Van Dam once again earned the number one contendership to the ECW World Championship, but this time by a fan poll. Van Dam got three matches against ECW World Champion [[Bobby Lashley]], coming up short each time.\n\n[[File:ECW originals313.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], Van Dam and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] ([[ECW Originals]]) performing their signature poses]]\nRob Van Dam later joined the [[ECW Originals]] along with Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]].

The two teams faced off at [[WrestleMania 23]] in a match which the ECW Originals won. After Vince McMahon won the ECW World Championship at [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], RVD and the other ECW Originals made statements on WWE.com about McMahon killing ECW. The ECW Originals all competed in a four-way dance to decide who would take on McMahon the next week on ECW in a title match, which Van Dam won after a five-star frog splash on Sandman. Van Dam, however, had to face McMahon, [[Shane McMahon]], and [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] in a 3-on-1 handicap match, which Van Dam was unable to win.\n\nVan Dam received a concussion during a match with [[Randy Orton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/3960574/rvdupdate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083102/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/3960574/rvdupdate|archivedate=May 31, 2007|title=RVD gets concussed}}</ref> Orton further attacked Van Dam after the match due to the comments Van Dam made on WWE.com about the lack of respect Orton displayed towards [[Shawn Michaels]], who also suffered a concussion at the hands of Orton. Van Dam once again faced Orton at [[One Night Stand (2007)|One Night Stand]], this time in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]]. Although it looked as if Orton was going to win again, Van Dam gave him a [[roundhouse kick]] to the head and was able to push the stretcher across the line for the win. Despite winning the match, Orton continued to attack Van Dam, ending with an [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Elevated DDT|elevated DDT]] off the barricade and onto the concrete floor.

One week later, both Van Dam and Benjamin picked mystery opponents for one another, with the loser placing their respective prize on the line in a bout at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]] on April 30. Benjamin lost to the returning [[Charlie Haas]], while Van Dam was defeated by all five members of the [[Spirit Squad]]. As a result, both the Intercontinental Championship and the Money in the Bank title shot were contested at [[Backlash (2006)|Backlash]].

At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|One Night Stand]], Van Dam cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated John Cena to win the WWE Championship. After two referees were knocked out, [[Adam Copeland|Edge]] appeared from underneath the ring to attack Cena, [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spearing]] him through a table. Van Dam then hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Frog splash|Five Star Frog Splash]] and the pinfall was counted by Paul Heyman, who suddenly ran down the aisle. On the following episode of ''Raw'', [[Vince McMahon]] confirmed that the title change was official due to the match being held under \"extreme rules\". For the past few weeks, Heyman had hinted that the WWE Championship would be \"rechristened\" the ECW World Heavyweight Championship when Van Dam won. On the debut of ''[[ECW on Sci Fi]]'', Van Dam was awarded the reinstated [[ECW World Heavyweight Championship]] by Heyman and decided to defend the WWE Championship separately and simultaneously, joking that \"this one spins\", becoming the first wrestler in history to hold both the WWE Championship and the ECW World Heavyweight Championship as well as the only one to hold them at the same time, making him a double world champion. He would  become the fifteenth WWE [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#WWE|Triple Crown Champion]] as a result of his WWE Championship win.\n\nAt [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]], Van Dam defeated Edge to retain the WWE Championship.

His return to the ring came a week later, in a losing effort to Sabu in a [[ladder match]] for number one contendership to the now renamed ECW World Championship. Van Dam slowly worked his way back into the championship picture. In October, Van Dam defeated Big Show in a non-title match to regain the number one contendership. Having the option to pick a date, Van Dam announced the title match would occur at [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]. However, Heyman had the option of picking the match type and announced that the main event would be a six-man [[Elimination Chamber#Variations|Extreme Elimination Chamber]] match. At the event on December 3, Van Dam was the third participant eliminated. Later in December, Van Dam once again earned the number one contendership to the ECW World Championship, but this time by a fan poll. Van Dam got three matches against ECW World Champion [[Bobby Lashley]], coming up short each time.\n\n[[File:ECW originals313.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], [[Tommy Dreamer]], Van Dam and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]] ([[ECW Originals]]) performing their signature poses]]\nRob Van Dam later joined the [[ECW Originals]] along with Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, and [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]].

The two teams faced off at [[WrestleMania 23]] in a match which the ECW Originals won. After Vince McMahon won the ECW World Championship at [[Backlash (2007)|Backlash]], RVD and the other ECW Originals made statements on WWE.com about McMahon killing ECW. The ECW Originals all competed in a four-way dance to decide who would take on McMahon the next week on ECW in a title match, which Van Dam won after a five-star frog splash on Sandman. Van Dam, however, had to face McMahon, [[Shane McMahon]], and [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]] in a 3-on-1 handicap match, which Van Dam was unable to win.\n\nVan Dam received a concussion during a match with [[Randy Orton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/3960574/rvdupdate|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531083102/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/articles/3960574/rvdupdate|archivedate=May 31, 2007|title=RVD gets concussed}}</ref> Orton further attacked Van Dam after the match due to the comments Van Dam made on WWE.com about the lack of respect Orton displayed towards [[Shawn Michaels]], who also suffered a concussion at the hands of Orton. Van Dam once again faced Orton at [[One Night Stand (2007)|One Night Stand]], this time in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]]. Although it looked as if Orton was going to win again, Van Dam gave him a [[roundhouse kick]] to the head and was able to push the stretcher across the line for the win. Despite winning the match, Orton continued to attack Van Dam, ending with an [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Elevated DDT|elevated DDT]] off the barricade and onto the concrete floor.
