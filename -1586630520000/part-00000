The team's home venue is the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium|Vasil Levski Stadium]] in [[Sofia]], and is currently managed by [[Georgi Dermendzhiev]]. \n\nTheir best achievements are reaching the final in the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] semi-finals in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. They have also competed at the [[Balkan Cup]], winning four titles. However, Bulgaria has failed to qualify for any major tournament since [[Euro 2004]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe Bulgarian national football team was formed in 1922. In 1923, the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] was formed and the team's first match was held in [[Vienna]] on 21 May 1924, which resulted in a 6\u20130 defeat against [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/bulgarien-team/1924/3/index.html|title=1924 friendly Austria v Bulgaria|website=worldfootball.net}}</ref> Bulgaria also participated in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris a few days later.\n\n====Years of international wilderness====\nAfter being unable to compete in the 1930 World Cup, the Bulgarian side did not qualify for any major tournament for nearly 30 years, narrowly falling short of qualification on numerous occasions. The national team had gone on a streak of finishing 2nd or 3rd in their qualifying groups along with proceeding to the play-offs, but in the end, failing to qualify. Despite their qualifying problems, the national team  did manage to defeat many elite teams during memorable international friendlies during those years. It also seemed as if the only tournaments they managed to qualify for were smaller tournaments, such as the [[Balkan Cup]], which they won four times.\n\n===1960s and 1970s: Rising to prominence===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0615-0022, Fu\u00dfball-WM, Schweden - Bulgarien 0-0.jpg|315px|right|thumb|Bulgaria vs. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 0 \u2013 0, [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nBulgaria qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the second time in its history in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and followed that up with consecutive appearances in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]. The team, however, did not have much success and finished in third place in their group three out of the four times. \n\nBulgaria took part in qualifiers for the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying#Group 2|1968]] and went on to win their group with impressive wins over [[Norway national football team|Norway]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. Although they would go on to lose to the eventual champions and hosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in a [[two-legged]] qualifying play-off.\n\nAt the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]], the team won the silver medal. They finished first in [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics#Group D|Group D]] by defeating [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] 7\u20130, [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] 2\u20131, and drawing 2\u20132 against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and then the semi-finals by defeating favored hosts [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. In the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal match|Olympic Final]], the team was defeated by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], in what many would say was a hard-fought match for both sides.\n\nDespite winning the [[Balkan Cup]] twice in 1931 and 1932, the Bulgaria national team added two more trophies to their case as they went on to win the tournament in 1973 and 1976. In both 1973 and 1976, Bulgaria had used their previous World Cup experience to create a very tactical team. This paid off quite well, as they had many decisive victories over Hungary, Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Poland, Albania and Romania. In fact, the team won the 1976 Balkan Cup by beating [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the two-legged final 1\u20130 and 3\u20132.\n\n===1962 World Cup===\nBulgaria finally qualified for their second world cup. Bulgaria was drawn in a tough group with elite opponents in [[England national football team|England]], powerhouse [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Bulgaria opened up their campaign with a narrow 0\u20131 loss to Argentina. Later on, Bulgaria would lose their second group match by a 6\u20131 score to Hungary. Bulgaria's hopes of qualifying were over, but the national team impressively drew with future [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] champions England 0-0 and finished fourth in the group with only one point.\n\n===1966 World Cup===\nBulgaria qualified for their second straight World Cup, drawn into an even tougher group compared to the previous World Cup. They were placed in the [[group of death]] with superpowers Hungary, [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], with [[Pele]] at the helm. Bulgaria opened their campaign match with a 0\u20132 loss to Brazil thanks to two free kick goals by Pele and [[Garrincha]]. In their second match Bulgaria loss 0-3 to [[Eusebio]]'s Portugal. Finally, Bulgaria with no chance of advancing to the next round, finished their last match with a 1\u20133 loss to Hungary. Bulgaria once again finished fourth with zero points in the group.\n \n===Euro 1968 qualification===\nAfter their poor World Cup performance, Bulgaria was determined to redeem themselves. Bulgaria was drawn in a very tough group for qualifying, with Norway and Sweden, along with Eusebio's Portugal. Bulgaria started off with a 4\u20132 win over Norway. They would add to their winning streak with a 2\u20130 victory against Sweden. In their next two matches Bulgaria would draw 0\u20130 against Norway, and dominate Sweden 3\u20130. In their final two group fixtures Bulgaria played Portugal to a 1\u20130 victory at home and an 0\u20130 draw on the road, but it was enough to advance to the two-legged qualifying play-off. There Bulgaria were drawn against eventual Euro 1968 host Italy. Italy were defeated in the first leg 3\u20132, but won the second by a 0\u20132 score to advance 4\u20133 on aggregate. Italy would win the playoff and go on to win the tournament, while Bulgaria was eliminated from reaching the finals.\n\n===1968 Summer Olympics: Road to the final===\nA month and a half after the European Championship qualifying came the Olympics, which Bulgaria had qualified for the fifth time in their history. They were drawn in a simple group with Thailand, Guatemala and Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria started off with a 7\u20130 thrashing of Thailand.  They later went on and drew with Czechoslovakia 2\u20132 to increase their point standards.  Their final match once again determined if they would carry on to the quarter-finals. Needing a decisive win, Bulgaria went on to defeat Guatemala 2\u20131 and win their Olympic group. They qualified directly to the quarter-finals facing underdogs, Israel.  The game remained 1\u20131 for most of the match until a drawing of lots determined who would go on to the semi-finals of the tournament. Winning the draw Bulgaria advanced to the semi-finals against Mexico. After a very hard-fought match, Bulgaria proved stronger as they came out on top with a 3\u20132 victory.  Bulgaria advanced to the finals for the first time in their Olympic history. They were determined to win the gold medal, but fell short with a 1\u20134 loss to Hungary.  Although battling hard, Bulgaria came out with the silver medal.\n\n===1970 World Cup===\nBulgaria qualified for their third straight World Cup, held in Mexico, just like the 1968 Olympics. They were drawn in a very tricky group with [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Bulgaria played their first match against Peru, losing 3\u20132. Germany won Bulgaria's second match, 5\u20132. The last group stage match ended 1\u20131; Bulgaria ended up in 3rd place.\n\n===1974 World Cup===\nThe [[1974 World Cup]] was held in West Germany. They were drawn in a decently tough group, with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], Sweden and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].  Bulgaria started off with a goalless draw with Sweden. They drew again, this time 1\u20131 with Uruguay. As the final match came, Bulgaria fell by a 4\u20131 score. Bulgaria remained in third place in the group stages.\n\n===1986 World Cup: The knockout rounds===\nBulgaria qualified for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in [[Mexico]] by finishing second in Group Four, behind [[France national football team|France]] with 11 points, but ahead of powerful rivals [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and [[East Germany national football team|Germany]]. This was their fifth World Cup appearance. They were drawn in Group A with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the opening match of the World Cup, the Bulgarians held the defending champions Italy to an impressive 1\u20131 draw. [[Alessandro Altobelli]] gave the Italians the lead, but an 85th-minute equalizer by [[Nasko Sirakov]] gave the Bulgarians the point they needed. The next match was another 1\u20131 draw against South Korea with the goal for Bulgaria coming from [[Plamen Getov]] in the 11th minute. They lost the final match of the group 2\u20130 against Argentina, who eventually won the tournament. Despite not recording a win, the Bulgarians advanced to the knockout stage by being the third-best third-placed team. By doing so, Bulgaria along with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] became the first nations to qualify for the knockout stage without winning a game in the first round. In the Round of 16, they faced World Cup hosts [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], who were looking for revenge due to their previous home Olympic semi-final loss to Bulgaria in Mexico City in 1968. The match was hard-fought from both sides of the scale but ultimately, Mexico came away with the 2\u20130 win.\n\n====Stoichkov's reign of the Golden Generation====\n[[File:Stoichkov in 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Hristo Stoichkov]] won the [[Ballon D'Or]], World and European Golden Boots in 1994. His incredible style of play led Bulgaria to the semi-finals of the [[1994 World Cup]], along with leading [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to their first ever [[UEFA Champions League]] in 1992.]]\n\n====1994 World Cup: Final four triumph====\nCertainly one of the most important dates in Bulgarian football history is 17 November 1993, a date where [[Emil Kostadinov]] scored two goals in the 90th minute to beat [[French national football team|France]] in [[Paris]], allowing Bulgaria to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Under the management of [[Dimitar Penev]], the Bulgarians, led by players such as [[Hristo Stoichkov]], [[Yordan Lechkov]], and [[Krasimir Balakov]], along with a multitude of other talented players remembered in Bulgaria as the \"[[Golden Generation#Bulgaria national football team|Golden Generation]]\", made a strong impression by surprisingly reaching the semi-finals. They entered a very tough Group D with [[1990 World Cup]] runners-up [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] with [[Diego Maradona]] at the helm, African Nations Cup champions [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], and Balkan rivals [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. The first match ended with a 3\u20130 defeat to [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. Despite the bad start, the team made quite a huge statement by winning 4\u20130 against their [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and increasing their goal difference. Their third and final match came against Argentina. The powerful Bulgarian side came away with a shocking 2\u20130 victory. Going into injury-time, Argentina was leading the group. A 91st-minute strike from [[Nasko Sirakov]], however, meant that they'd drop two places and finish third. \n\nBulgaria continued to the round of 16, where they faced [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Stoichkov opened the scoring in the sixth minute with an incredible strike off a break away from outside the box, tallying his fourth goal. The match ended 1\u20131 and after no goals were scored in extra time, penalties decided which team would go through. Team captain [[Borislav Mihaylov]] saved the first three penalty kicks in a row, breaking the World Cup record. Bulgaria won 3\u20131 on penalties. In the quarter-finals, Bulgaria faced the defending world champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. At the start of the match held in [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], the Bulgarians dominated impressively, hitting the post twice in the process. The Bulgarians, however, managed to turn the game over with a swerving free kick by [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and a flying header by [[Yordan Lechkov]], giving them a 2\u20131 win. In the semi-finals, they controversially lost 2\u20131 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Stoichkov scored Bulgaria's only goal in the first half to tally his seventh goal, which led the tournament. In the second half, Bulgaria were waved off a penalty in which an Italian defender had clearly committed a handball in the box, off a Kostadinov cross.\n\nHristo Stoichkov was awarded the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] shared with [[Oleg Salenko]] as the top scorer in the tournament with his six goals. [[Krasimir Balakov]] was named in the 1994 World Cup Dream Team along with Stoichkov. Later on in December, Stoichkov was awarded the FIFA Ballon D'Or trophy for his great skill and leadership, becoming the first Bulgarian and third Barcelona player to win it in history.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Euro 1996: Controversial quarter-final call===\nIn 1996, the team qualified for the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]] for the first time. They were drawn in Group B with [[France national football team|France]], [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Bulgaria started with a 1\u20131 draw against the Spain. Stoichkov scored his second goal with a wonderful volley, ruled offside. Bulgaria defeated Romania 1\u20130 in the next group stage match. Stoichkov scored in the third minute. In the final group match, the Bulgarian side lost 3\u20131 against France; Stoichkov scored a free kick to give Bulgaria their only goal of the game, along with their only loss. At the same time, Spain defeated Romania 2\u20131, and Bulgaria were eliminated.\n\n===1998 World Cup: The Last Stand of the \"Golden Team\"===\nBulgaria qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] in France by finishing first in Group 5, with decisive wins over [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. They entered the competition with new manager [[Hristo Bonev]]. Bulgaria drew [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in Group D. The first match ended decently, in a goalless draw against eventual group winners Paraguay. In the second match, the Bulgarians lost 1\u20130 for a second-straight World Cup to Nigeria. The final match ended with a 6\u20131 defeat to Spain. Following the bad results, Bulgaria finished fourth in the group, with only one point. This was the last World Cup appearance for Bulgaria.\n\n====2000s====\n===Euro 2000 qualification: The end of a legendary era===\nBulgaria was drawn in a tough qualifying group with teams [[England national football team|England]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. The campaign started slow with a draw and a defeat by Poland and Sweden. The most memorable match for Bulgaria in the group was the 1\u20131 draw against England, which was also the last match for Stoichkov before his international retirement.  Bulgaria finished fourth with eight points and failed to make the final stages of [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\n====Berbatov's era====\n\n===2002 World Cup qualification: Beginning of the World Cup drought===\nBulgaria was once again drawn into a tough group with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. The group was also the debut of Bulgaria's top scoring legend [[Dimitar Berbatov]]. Bulgaria won the matches against the weaker teams, but lost once and drew once with both Denmark and the Czech Republic. Bulgaria finished third with 17 points, three points behind second-placed Czech Republic, thus failing to make the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in South Korea and Japan.\n\n===Euro 2004===\nBulgaria managed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] in Portugal by finishing first with wins over [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. They drew [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in Group C. All three group stage matches ended up in losses for Bulgaria.\n\n===2006 World Cup qualification: Failure===\nBulgaria failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]] in Germany after a run of poor results. They tied with Sweden and Croatia the first run but lost the other meetings to the two sides. Although Berbatov scored many goals in the qualifiers including a last-minute equalizer against Croatia, Bulgaria still finished third in qualifying with 15 points.\n\n===2006 Kirin Cup===\nBulgaria found themselves in a minor tournament in Japan known as the Kirin Cup. They started off well with a 2\u20131 victory over the hosts [[Japan national football team|Japan]]. However, Bulgaria lost 5\u20131 to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], the eventual cup champions. Bulgaria finished as the runners-up and received the silver medal.\n\n===Euro 2008 qualification===\n[[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group G|Group G of Euro 2008 qualification]] had [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and Bulgaria attempting to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], hosted by Switzerland and Austria. Bulgaria performed well after a run of good results against Romania which gave them the first place. Bulgaria went on to the playoffs but drew the first match 1\u20131 along with losing their second match 2\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup qualification===\n[[File:Bulgaria national football team 2010.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Bulgaria in 2010]]\nBulgaria were drawn against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] in qualifying in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 8|Group 8]]. Bulgaria started the campaign with a series of draws. Manager [[Plamen Markov]] was replaced by [[Stanimir Stoilov]] in January 2009. The Bulgarians then recorded their first wins of the group over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]]. They finished in third place with 14 points, therefore failing to qualify to a play-off spot.\n\n===Euro 2012===\n[[File:Bulgarian national football team.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The national team in 2012]]\nBulgaria were drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G|Group G]] along with [[England national football team|England]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], and [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]]. Bulgaria finished in last place in the group.\n\n===2014 World Cup qualification===\nIn the qualification phase for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil, Bulgaria were placed in Group B together with the teams of [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] and [[Malta national football team|Malta]]. Under the guidance of former player [[Lyuboslav Penev]] as head coach, Bulgaria enjoyed a revival and some noteworthy performances in friendly matches before the start of the qualifying, including a 2\u20131 victory over [[2010 World Cup]] runners-up [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Amsterdam. The qualifying began with a 2\u20132 draw against [[Euro 2012]] runners-up Italy. Bulgaria then edged a tight match against Armenia, which ended 1\u20130. Next, Bulgaria drew 1\u20131 against Denmark. Four days later, Bulgaria earning a hard-fought 0\u20130 draw away to the Czech Republic. As a result, the team climbed from 96th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], their lowest position in history, to 40th in November 2012.\n\nPenev's players hosted and defeated Malta 6\u20130 under heavy snowfall. Four days later, Bulgaria drew Denmark 1\u20131 in Copenhagen. This result left Bulgaria second in the group with 10 points, still undefeated. Bulgaria traveled to Italy, losing 1\u20130. After a series of poor results, Bulgaria ended up failing to qualify for Brazil 2014.\n\n===Euro 2016 qualification: Continuation of the drought ===\nBulgaria were placed in a group with Italy, Croatia, Norway, Azerbaijan, and Malta. Bulgaria opened up their first match with a 2\u20131 victory over Azerbaijan. They were defeated 1\u20130 by Croatia, following another 2\u20131 defeat to Norway. To make it worse, Bulgaria drew with Malta 1\u20131 at home, which would cause manager [[Lyuboslav Penev]] his position.

football|football]] and is administered by the [[Bulgarian Football Union]], a member association of [[UEFA]]. The team's home venue is the [[Vasil Levski National Stadium|Vasil Levski Stadium]] in [[Sofia]], and is currently managed by [[Georgi Dermendzhiev]]. \n\nTheir best achievements are reaching the final in the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]] [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] semi-finals in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. They have also competed at the [[Balkan Cup]], winning four titles. However, Bulgaria has failed to qualify for any major tournament since [[Euro 2004]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe Bulgarian national football team was formed in 1922. In 1923, the [[Bulgarian Football Union]] was formed and the team's first match was held in [[Vienna]] on 21 May 1924, which resulted in a 6\u20130 defeat against [[Austria national football team|Austria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/teams/bulgarien-team/1924/3/index.html|title=1924 friendly Austria v Bulgaria|website=worldfootball.net}}</ref> Bulgaria also participated in the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris a few days later.\n\n====Years of international wilderness====\nAfter being unable to compete in the 1930 World Cup, the Bulgarian side did not qualify for any major tournament for nearly 30 years, narrowly falling short of qualification on numerous occasions. The national team had gone on a streak of finishing 2nd or 3rd in their qualifying groups along with proceeding to the play-offs, but in the end, failing to qualify. Despite their qualifying problems, the national team  did manage to defeat many elite teams during memorable international friendlies during those years. It also seemed as if the only tournaments they managed to qualify for were smaller tournaments, such as the [[Balkan Cup]], which they won four times.\n\n===1960s and 1970s: Rising to prominence===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0615-0022, Fu\u00dfball-WM, Schweden - Bulgarien 0-0.jpg|315px|right|thumb|Bulgaria vs. [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] 0 \u2013 0, [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]]]\nBulgaria qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the second time in its history in [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and followed that up with consecutive appearances in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]], [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]]. The team, however, did not have much success and finished in third place in their group three out of the four times. \n\nBulgaria took part in qualifiers for the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 1968 qualifying#Group 2|1968]] and went on to win their group with impressive wins over [[Norway national football team|Norway]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]]. Although they would go on to lose to the eventual champions and hosts [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in a [[two-legged]] qualifying play-off.\n\nAt the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]], the team won the silver medal. They finished first in [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics#Group D|Group D]] by defeating [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] 7\u20130, [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] 2\u20131, and drawing 2\u20132 against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]]. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and then the semi-finals by defeating favored hosts [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. In the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics#Gold Medal match|Olympic Final]], the team was defeated by [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], in what many would say was a hard-fought match for both sides.\n\nDespite winning the [[Balkan Cup]] twice in 1931 and 1932, the Bulgaria national team added two more trophies to their case as they went on to win the tournament in 1973 and 1976. In both 1973 and 1976, Bulgaria had used their previous World Cup experience to create a very tactical team. This paid off quite well, as they had many decisive victories over Hungary, Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Poland, Albania and Romania. In fact, the team won the 1976 Balkan Cup by beating [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in the two-legged final 1\u20130 and 3\u20132.\n\n===1962 World Cup===\nBulgaria finally qualified for their second world cup. Bulgaria was drawn in a tough group with elite opponents in [[England national football team|England]], powerhouse [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Bulgaria opened up their campaign with a narrow 0\u20131 loss to Argentina. Later on, Bulgaria would lose their second group match by a 6\u20131 score to Hungary. Bulgaria's hopes of qualifying were over, but the national team impressively drew with future [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]] champions England 0-0 and finished fourth in the group with only one point.\n\n===1966 World Cup===\nBulgaria qualified for their second straight World Cup, drawn into an even tougher group compared to the previous World Cup. They were placed in the [[group of death]] with superpowers Hungary, [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], with [[Pele]] at the helm. Bulgaria opened their campaign match with a 0\u20132 loss to Brazil thanks to two free kick goals by Pele and [[Garrincha]]. In their second match Bulgaria loss 0-3 to [[Eusebio]]'s Portugal. Finally, Bulgaria with no chance of advancing to the next round, finished their last match with a 1\u20133 loss to Hungary. Bulgaria once again finished fourth with zero points in the group.\n \n===Euro 1968 qualification===\nAfter their poor World Cup performance, Bulgaria was determined to redeem themselves. Bulgaria was drawn in a very tough group for qualifying, with Norway and Sweden, along with Eusebio's Portugal. Bulgaria started off with a 4\u20132 win over Norway. They would add to their winning streak with a 2\u20130 victory against Sweden. In their next two matches Bulgaria would draw 0\u20130 against Norway, and dominate Sweden 3\u20130. In their final two group fixtures Bulgaria played Portugal to a 1\u20130 victory at home and an 0\u20130 draw on the road, but it was enough to advance to the two-legged qualifying play-off. There Bulgaria were drawn against eventual Euro 1968 host Italy. Italy were defeated in the first leg 3\u20132, but won the second by a 0\u20132 score to advance 4\u20133 on aggregate. Italy would win the playoff and go on to win the tournament, while Bulgaria was eliminated from reaching the finals.\n\n===1968 Summer Olympics: Road to the final===\nA month and a half after the European Championship qualifying came the Olympics, which Bulgaria had qualified for the fifth time in their history. They were drawn in a simple group with Thailand, Guatemala and Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria started off with a 7\u20130 thrashing of Thailand.  They later went on and drew with Czechoslovakia 2\u20132 to increase their point standards.  Their final match once again determined if they would carry on to the quarter-finals. Needing a decisive win, Bulgaria went on to defeat Guatemala 2\u20131 and win their Olympic group. They qualified directly to the quarter-finals facing underdogs, Israel.  The game remained 1\u20131 for most of the match until a drawing of lots determined who would go on to the semi-finals of the tournament. Winning the draw Bulgaria advanced to the semi-finals against Mexico. After a very hard-fought match, Bulgaria proved stronger as they came out on top with a 3\u20132 victory.  Bulgaria advanced to the finals for the first time in their Olympic history. They were determined to win the gold medal, but fell short with a 1\u20134 loss to Hungary.  Although battling hard, Bulgaria came out with the silver medal.\n\n===1970 World Cup===\nBulgaria qualified for their third straight World Cup, held in Mexico, just like the 1968 Olympics. They were drawn in a very tricky group with [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]]. Bulgaria played their first match against Peru, losing 3\u20132. Germany won Bulgaria's second match, 5\u20132. The last group stage match ended 1\u20131; Bulgaria ended up in 3rd place.\n\n===1974 World Cup===\nThe [[1974 World Cup]] was held in West Germany. They were drawn in a decently tough group, with the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], Sweden and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].  Bulgaria started off with a goalless draw with Sweden. They drew again, this time 1\u20131 with Uruguay. As the final match came, Bulgaria fell by a 4\u20131 score. Bulgaria remained in third place in the group stages.\n\n===1986 World Cup: The knockout rounds===\nBulgaria qualified for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in [[Mexico]] by finishing second in Group Four, behind [[France national football team|France]] with 11 points, but ahead of powerful rivals [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and [[East Germany national football team|Germany]]. This was their fifth World Cup appearance. They were drawn in Group A with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. In the opening match of the World Cup, the Bulgarians held the defending champions Italy to an impressive 1\u20131 draw. [[Alessandro Altobelli]] gave the Italians the lead, but an 85th-minute equalizer by [[Nasko Sirakov]] gave the Bulgarians the point they needed. The next match was another 1\u20131 draw against South Korea with the goal for Bulgaria coming from [[Plamen Getov]] in the 11th minute. They lost the final match of the group 2\u20130 against Argentina, who eventually won the tournament. Despite not recording a win, the Bulgarians advanced to the knockout stage by being the third-best third-placed team. By doing so, Bulgaria along with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] became the first nations to qualify for the knockout stage without winning a game in the first round. In the Round of 16, they faced World Cup hosts [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], who were looking for revenge due to their previous home Olympic semi-final loss to Bulgaria in Mexico City in 1968. The match was hard-fought from both sides of the scale but ultimately, Mexico came away with the 2\u20130 win.\n\n====Stoichkov's reign of the Golden Generation====\n[[File:Stoichkov in 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Hristo Stoichkov]] won the [[Ballon D'Or]], World and European Golden Boots in 1994. His incredible style of play led Bulgaria to the semi-finals of the [[1994 World Cup]], along with leading [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] to their first ever [[UEFA Champions League]] in 1992.]]\n\n====1994 World Cup: Final four triumph====\nCertainly one of the most important dates in Bulgarian football history is 17 November 1993, a date where [[Emil Kostadinov]] scored two goals in the 90th minute to beat [[French national football team|France]] in [[Paris]], allowing Bulgaria to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Under the management of [[Dimitar Penev]], the Bulgarians, led by players such as [[Hristo Stoichkov]], [[Yordan Lechkov]], and [[Krasimir Balakov]], along with a multitude of other talented players remembered in Bulgaria as the \"[[Golden Generation#Bulgaria national football team|Golden Generation]]\", made a strong impression by surprisingly reaching the semi-finals. They entered a very tough Group D with [[1990 World Cup]] runners-up [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] with [[Diego Maradona]] at the helm, African Nations Cup champions [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], and Balkan rivals [[Greece national football team|Greece]]. The first match ended with a 3\u20130 defeat to [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. Despite the bad start, the team made quite a huge statement by winning 4\u20130 against their [[Greece national football team|Greece]] and increasing their goal difference. Their third and final match came against Argentina. The powerful Bulgarian side came away with a shocking 2\u20130 victory. Going into injury-time, Argentina was leading the group. A 91st-minute strike from [[Nasko Sirakov]], however, meant that they'd drop two places and finish third. \n\nBulgaria continued to the round of 16, where they faced [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Stoichkov opened the scoring in the sixth minute with an incredible strike off a break away from outside the box, tallying his fourth goal. The match ended 1\u20131 and after no goals were scored in extra time, penalties decided which team would go through. Team captain [[Borislav Mihaylov]] saved the first three penalty kicks in a row, breaking the World Cup record. Bulgaria won 3\u20131 on penalties. In the quarter-finals, Bulgaria faced the defending world champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. At the start of the match held in [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]], the Bulgarians dominated impressively, hitting the post twice in the process. The Bulgarians, however, managed to turn the game over with a swerving free kick by [[Hristo Stoichkov]] and a flying header by [[Yordan Lechkov]], giving them a 2\u20131 win. In the semi-finals, they controversially lost 2\u20131 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Stoichkov scored Bulgaria's only goal in the first half to tally his seventh goal, which led the tournament. In the second half, Bulgaria were waved off a penalty in which an Italian defender had clearly committed a handball in the box, off a Kostadinov cross.\n\nHristo Stoichkov was awarded the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] shared with [[Oleg Salenko]] as the top scorer in the tournament with his six goals. [[Krasimir Balakov]] was named in the 1994 World Cup Dream Team along with Stoichkov. Later on in December, Stoichkov was awarded the FIFA Ballon D'Or trophy for his great skill and leadership, becoming the first Bulgarian and third Barcelona player to win it in history.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Euro 1996: Controversial quarter-final call===\nIn 1996, the team qualified for the [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Football Championship]] for the first time. They were drawn in Group B with [[France national football team|France]], [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and [[Romania national football team|Romania]]. Bulgaria started with a 1\u20131 draw against the Spain. Stoichkov scored his second goal with a wonderful volley, ruled offside. Bulgaria defeated Romania 1\u20130 in the next group stage match.

At the same time, Spain defeated Romania 2\u20131, and Bulgaria were eliminated.\n\n===1998 World Cup: The Last Stand of the \"Golden Team\"===\nBulgaria qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup 1998|1998 World Cup]] in France by finishing first in Group 5, with decisive wins over [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. They entered the competition with new manager [[Hristo Bonev]]. Bulgaria drew [[Spain national football team|Spain]], [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in Group D. The first match ended decently, in a goalless draw against eventual group winners Paraguay. In the second match, the Bulgarians lost 1\u20130 for a second-straight World Cup to Nigeria. The final match ended with a 6\u20131 defeat to Spain. Following the bad results, Bulgaria finished fourth in the group, with only one point. This was the last World Cup appearance for Bulgaria.\n\n====2000s====\n===Euro 2000 qualification: The end of a legendary era===\nBulgaria was drawn in a tough qualifying group with teams [[England national football team|England]], [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], and [[Poland national football team|Poland]]. The campaign started slow with a draw and a defeat by Poland and Sweden. The most memorable match for Bulgaria in the group was the 1\u20131 draw against England, which was also the last match for Stoichkov before his international retirement.  Bulgaria finished fourth with eight points and failed to make the final stages of [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\n====Berbatov's era====\n\n===2002 World Cup qualification: Beginning of the World Cup drought===\nBulgaria was once again drawn into a tough group with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. The group was also the debut of Bulgaria's top scoring legend [[Dimitar Berbatov]]. Bulgaria won the matches against the weaker teams, but lost once and drew once with both Denmark and the Czech Republic. Bulgaria finished third with 17 points, three points behind second-placed Czech Republic, thus failing to make the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in South Korea and Japan.\n\n===Euro 2004===\nBulgaria managed to qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]] in Portugal by finishing first with wins over [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. They drew [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in Group C. All three group stage matches ended up in losses for Bulgaria.\n\n===2006 World Cup qualification: Failure===\nBulgaria failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|World Cup]] in Germany after a run of poor results. They tied with Sweden and Croatia the first run but lost the other meetings to the two sides. Although Berbatov scored many goals in the qualifiers including a last-minute equalizer against Croatia, Bulgaria still finished third in qualifying with 15 points.\n\n===2006 Kirin Cup===\nBulgaria found themselves in a minor tournament in Japan known as the Kirin Cup. They started off well with a 2\u20131 victory over the hosts [[Japan national football team|Japan]]. However, Bulgaria lost 5\u20131 to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], the eventual cup champions. Bulgaria finished as the runners-up and received the silver medal.\n\n===Euro 2008 qualification===\n[[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group G|Group G of Euro 2008 qualification]] had [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], [[Romania national football team|Romania]], and Bulgaria attempting to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], hosted by Switzerland and Austria. Bulgaria performed well after a run of good results against Romania which gave them the first place. Bulgaria went on to the playoffs but drew the first match 1\u20131 along with losing their second match 2\u20130.\n\n===2010 World Cup qualification===\n[[File:Bulgaria national football team 2010.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Bulgaria in 2010]]\nBulgaria were drawn against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] in qualifying in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - UEFA Group 8|Group 8]].

The Bulgarians then recorded their first wins of the group over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]], [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]]. They finished in third place with 14 points, therefore failing to qualify to a play-off spot.\n\n===Euro 2012===\n[[File:Bulgarian national football team.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The national team in 2012]]\nBulgaria were drawn in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group G|Group G]] along with [[England national football team|England]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], [[Wales national football team|Wales]], and [[Montenegro national football team|Montenegro]].

Under the guidance of former player [[Lyuboslav Penev]] as head coach, Bulgaria enjoyed a revival and some noteworthy performances in friendly matches before the start of the qualifying, including a 2\u20131 victory over [[2010 World Cup]] runners-up [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Amsterdam. The qualifying began with a 2\u20132 draw against [[Euro 2012]] runners-up Italy. Bulgaria then edged a tight match against Armenia, which ended 1\u20130.

Cossacks were warriors organised into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670\u201371, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.\n\nIn the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast.

The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles.

In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas.

In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]].

Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on 7 January, because the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]], and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] (9 May); [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.\n\n[[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nPopular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (the New Year according to the Julian Calendar on 14 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on 7 July) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (which takes place on 8 July and is the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, focusing, however, on family love and fidelity).\n\n[[File:Russian Dolls (4891096981).jpg|thumb|A [[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russia's main architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and [[Mother Russia]] a [[national personification]] of Russia, though the bear image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\n[[File:Peterhof Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russia (44408938295).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peterhof Palace#The Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain|Grand Cascade]] in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], a popular tourist destination in Saint Petersburg]]\n\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet period, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country.

Recognised as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renowned museums as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]], [[Nevsky Prospect]], and [[Arbat Street]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of [[Moscow]] ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, canals and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].\n\nThe warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts such as [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''.

In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670\u201371, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.\n\nIn the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648, the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].\n\n=== Imperial Russia ===\n{{Main|Russian Empire}}\n[[File:Peter de Grote.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter the Great]], [[Tsar of All Russia]] in 1682\u20131721 and the first [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721\u20131725]]\nUnder [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognised as a world power.

In the south, after successful [[Russo-Turkish Wars]] against [[Ottoman Turkey]], Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the [[Crimean Khanate]]. As a result of victories over [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] through the [[Russo-Persian Wars]], by the first half of the 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in [[Transcaucasia]] and the [[North Caucasus]], forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Dagestan]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]] to Russia.<ref>Timothy C.

The [[French invasion of Russia]] at the height of Napoleon's power in 1812 reached Moscow, but eventually failed miserably as the obstinate resistance in combination with the bitterly cold [[Russian winter]] led to a disastrous defeat of invaders, in which more than 95% of the pan-European [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] perished.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ruling the Empire|publisher=Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/russia/5.htm|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> Led by [[Mikhail Kutuzov]] and [[Barclay de Tolly]], the Russian army ousted Napoleon from the country and drove through Europe in the [[war of the Sixth Coalition]], finally entering Paris.

These ''Great Reforms'' spurred industrialization and modernised the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the [[1877\u201378 Russo-Turkish War]].\n\nThe late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son\n[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881\u201394) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894\u20131917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]]. The [[Stolypin reform|Stolypin agrarian reform]] led to a massive peasant migration and settlement into [[Siberia]].

In 1916, the [[Brusilov Offensive]] of the Russian Army almost completely destroyed the military of Austria-Hungary. However, the already-existing public distrust of the regime was deepened by the rising costs of war, [[World War I casualties|high casualties]], and rumors of corruption and treason. All this formed the climate for the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, carried out in two major acts.\n\nThe [[February Revolution]] forced [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to abdicate; he and his family were imprisoned and [[Shooting of the Romanov family|later executed in Yekaterinburg]] during the [[Russian Civil War]].

[[Luftwaffe]] bombed the cities of the Soviet Union from the air. [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]] suffered the most from the [[Bombing of Gorky in World War II|bombing]]. This city was the main industrial center of the USSR and was located near the [[Moscow Defence Zone]]. The bombing of the [[Volga Military District|Volga]] capital destroyed the largest automobile plant [[GAZ]]. This plant supplied tanks for the front. Whole residential areas and other large factories of the city were destroyed. From 1941 to 1943, German pilots bombed different areas of the city. This bombardment is comparable to the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]]. Some damage remained until this time.\n\n====Cold War====\n[[File:Soviet Union - Russian SFSR.svg|thumb|The RSFSR in 1956\u20131991, mostly after territorial acquisitions according to WWII treaties, the accession of [[Tuvan People's Republic|Tuva]] in 1944, the [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transfer of the Crimean Oblast in 1954]] and the incorporation of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]] in 1956. In 1991, the borders of the Russian SFSR became the Russian Federation's international borders with sovereign states.]]\n\nAfter the war, Eastern and Central Europe including [[East Germany]] and part of [[Austria]] was occupied by [[Red Army]] according to the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''.

The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916205-2,00.html|work=TIME|accessdate=1 August 2008|title=Great Escapes from the Gulag|date=5 June 1978}}</ref> The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]]. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States [[PGM-19 Jupiter|Jupiter missiles]] in Turkey and Soviet [[Cuban Missile Crisis|missiles in Cuba]].\n\n[[File:Sputnik asm.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]] was the world's first artificial satellite.]]\n\nIn 1957, the [[Soviet Union]] launched the world's first artificial [[satellite]], ''[[Sputnik&nbsp;1]]'', thus starting the [[Space Age]]. Russia's [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].\n\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]] but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.\n\nIn 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\n\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in one-to-one discussions with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]]. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements.

On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].\n\n[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|The neoclassical [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]\n\n[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917\u20131941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken.

Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nSoviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country.

The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas.

In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]].

Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on 7 January, because the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]], and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] (9 May); [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.\n\n[[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nPopular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (the New Year according to the Julian Calendar on 14 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on 7 July) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (which takes place on 8 July and is the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, focusing, however, on family love and fidelity).\n\n[[File:Russian Dolls (4891096981).jpg|thumb|A [[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russia's main architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and [[Mother Russia]] a [[national personification]] of Russia, though the bear image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\n[[File:Peterhof Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russia (44408938295).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peterhof Palace#The Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain|Grand Cascade]] in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], a popular tourist destination in Saint Petersburg]]\n\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet period, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country.

Recognised as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renowned museums as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]], [[Nevsky Prospect]], and [[Arbat Street]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of [[Moscow]] ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, canals and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].\n\nThe warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts such as [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, the oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clear waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tuva]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Russia|Europe}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Russia}}\n* [[Outline of Russia]]\n* [[Index of Soviet Union-related articles]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Russia}}\n{{Wiktionary|Russia|\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n;Government\n* [http://www.gov.ru/index_en.html Official Russian governmental portal]\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/RS.html Chief of State and Cabinet Members]\n* [http://en.rian.ru/ Russian News Agency \"Ria Novosti\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110513104203/http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/09/24/22168374.html Russian radio \"Voice of Russia\"]\n\n; General information\n* {{curlie|Regional/Europe/Russia}}\n* {{wikiatlas|Russia}}\n* {{osmrelation-inline|60189}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|rs|Russia}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081022164202/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/russia.htm Russia] at ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17839672 Russia] from the [[BBC News]]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia Russia] at ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=RU Key Development Forecasts for Russia] from [[International Futures]]\n\n;Other\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121215070149/http://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552653 Post-Soviet Problems] from the [https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552494/browse?type=title Dean Peter Krogh Foreign Affairs Digital Archives]\n* [http://rbth.ru/ Russia Beyond the Headlines] International news project about Russia\n* [http://www.russia-travel.com/ Official Russia Travel Guide]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101111023616/http://russianconsulate.com/ Russian Consulate]\n\n{{Russia topics}}\n{{Navboxes|title=Articles related to Russia\n|list=\n{{Russian souvenirs}}\n{{Subdivisions of Russia}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Russia}}\n{{Lists of Russians}}\n{{Sovereign states of Europe}}\n{{Countries of Asia}}\n{{Countries bordering the Baltic Sea}}\n{{Countries bordering the Black Sea}}\n{{APEC}}\n{{BRICS}}\n{{Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)}}\n{{Council of Europe}}\n{{East Asia Summit (EAS)}}\n{{Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)}}\n{{G8 nations}}\n{{G20}}\n{{Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)}}\n{{Quartet on the Middle East}}\n{{Shanghai Cooperation Organisation}}\n{{UN Security Council}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Russia]]\n[[Category:Federal republics]]\n[[Category:Countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Countries in Asia]]\n[[Category:Northeast Asian countries]]\n[[Category:North Asian countries]]\n[[Category:Eastern European countries]]\n[[Category:BRICS nations]]\n[[Category:G20 nations]]\n[[Category:E7 nations]]\n[[Category:Christian states]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Council of Europe]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Russian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1991]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Kievan Rus']]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY audit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}

It stars [[Marlon Brando]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Frederic Forrest]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Sam Bottoms]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Dennis Hopper]]. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and [[John Milius]] and narration written by [[Michael Herr]], was loosely based on the 1899 novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. The setting was changed from late 19th-century [[Congo Free State|Congo]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. The film follows a river journey from [[South Vietnam]] into [[Cambodia]] undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard (a character based on Conrad's [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]] and played by Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate [[Colonel Kurtz]] (Brando, with the character being based on Conrad's [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]]), a renegade [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane.\n\nMilius became interested in adapting ''Heart of Darkness'' for a Vietnam War setting, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and [[George Lucas]] as director. After Lucas became unavailable, Coppola took over directoral control, and was influenced by [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) in his approach to the material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html |title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary |last=Peary |first=Gerald |publisher=Gerald Peary |accessdate=March 14, 2007}}</ref> Initially set to be a five-month shoot, the film became noted for the problems encountered while making it for over a year, as chronicled in the documentary ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'' (1991).

The film performed well at the box office, grossing $78 million domestically and going on to gross over $150 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed; while [[Vittorio Storaro]]'s cinematography was widely acclaimed, several critics found Coppola's handling of the story's major themes to be anticlimactic and intellectually disappointing. ''Apocalypse Now'' is today considered to be [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]]. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] at the [[52nd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Coppola), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Duvall, and went on to win for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].

Kurtz]] has apparently gone insane and is waging a brutal but successful guerilla war against terrified [[People's_Army_of_Vietnam#Vietnam_War|NVA]] and [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam|PLAF]] forces without permission, directions or resupply from his commanders. At an outpost in [[Cambodia]], he commands American and [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops who see him as a [[demigod]]. Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to [[I Field Force, Vietnam|I Field Force]] headquarters in Nha Trang, briefed on the situation by two Army commanders and a CIA officer, and ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command... with [[Summary execution|extreme prejudice]]\". Willard, initially ambivalent, joins a U.S. Navy [[Patrol Boat, River|river patrol boat]] (PBR) commanded by [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] \"Chief\" Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\", and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)#Vietnam War|1st Squadron]], [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], a helicopter-borne air assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng's [[Viet Cong]]-held coastal mouth. The squadron raids at dawn, with Kilgore ordering a [[napalm]] strike on the Viet Cong. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly-conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\n\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard's. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice he made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join the Special Forces, which afforded no prospect of advancing in rank past Colonel. The third-generation West Point graduate could have pursued more conventional command assignments to eventually rise to four-star general. \n\nWeeks later, the PBR reaches the remote U.S. Army outpost by the Do Lung Bridge. Willard and Lance enter the outpost after nightfall, seeking information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer at Do Lung, Willard orders the Chief to continue as an unseen enemy assaults the bridge. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz.{{efn|A few days before Willard received this dispatch, Chief had told him that about six months prior to Willard's mission, he (Chief) had taken another man north of the Do Long Bridge. Chief had heard this man shot himself in the head.}}\n\nAs the crew read letters from home, Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting the attention of an unseen enemy, and Mr. Clean is killed. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by impaling him on the spear point protruding from his own chest. Willard suffocates Chief and Lance buries him in the river. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR, but despite Chef's anger about the mission, he rejects Willard's offer to cut the sailors loose and continue alone and insists that they complete the mission together.\n\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz's outpost, located on the site of a long abandoned [[Angkor Empire]] temple compound, teeming with Montagnards and strewn with corpses and severed heads. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American freelance photojournalist, who manically praises Kurtz's genius. As they wander through, they come across a near-catatonic Colby, along with other US servicemen now in Kurtz's renegade army. Willard returns to the moored PBR to leave Chef with the boat, ordering him to call in a pre-arranged airstrike on the outpost if Willard and Lance do not return.\n\nIn the camp, Willard is subdued, bound and brought before Kurtz in a darkened temple. Willard is detained and tortured for several days, during which time Kurtz kills Chef, preventing the airstrike from occurring. Willard is soon released and allowed to roam the compound. Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, the [[human condition]] and civilization, while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of his adversaries, the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\n\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially slaughter a [[water buffalo]], Willard stealthily enters Kurtz's chamber as he is making a voice recording and attacks him with a machete. Mortally wounded, Kurtz utters \"...{{nbsp}}The horror ... the horror {{nbsp}}...\" and dies. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard then leads Lance to the boat and they sail away. Kurtz's final words echo eerily as everything [[Fade (lighting)|fades to black]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{About||a list of the rest of the cast members not included in the 153-minute version of the film that was released in theaters|Apocalypse Now Redux#Cast}}\n[[File:Marlon Brando (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The performance of [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz]] was critically acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chas |last=Gerretsen|author-link=Chas Gerretsen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/the-horror-apocalypse-now-unseen-in-pictures |title=The horror!

The novella, based on Conrad's experience as a steamboat captain in Africa, is set in the [[Congo Free State]] during the 19th century.<ref>Murfin, Ross C (ed.) (1989): ''Joseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness. A Case Study in Contemporary Criticism''. Boston: St. Martin's Press, pp. 3\u201316.</ref> Kurtz and Marlow (whose corresponding character in the movie is Capt. Willard) work for a Belgian trading company that brutally exploits its native African workers.\n\nAfter arriving at Kurtz's outpost, Marlow concludes that Kurtz has gone insane and is lording over a small tribe as a god. The novella ends with Kurtz dying on the trip back and the narrator musing about the darkness of the human psyche: \"the heart of an immense darkness\".\n\nIn the novella, Marlow is the pilot of a river boat sent to collect ivory from Kurtz's outpost, only gradually becoming infatuated with Kurtz. In fact, when he discovers Kurtz in terrible health, Marlow makes an effort to bring him home safely. In the film, Willard is an assassin dispatched to kill Kurtz. Nevertheless, the depiction of Kurtz as a god-like leader of a tribe of natives and his malarial fever, Kurtz's written exclamation \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (which appears in the film as \"Drop the bomb. Exterminate them all!\") and his last words \"The horror! The horror!\" are taken from Conrad's novella.\n\nCoppola argues that many episodes in the film\u2014the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example\u2014respect the spirit of the novella and in particular its critique of the concepts of civilization and progress. Other episodes adapted by Coppola, the  Playboy Playmates' (Sirens) exit, the lost souls, \"take me home\" attempting to reach the boat and Kurtz's tribe of (white-faced) natives parting the canoes (gates of Hell) for Willard, (with Chef and Lance) to enter the camp are likened to Virgil and \"The Inferno\" ([[Divine Comedy]]) by [[Dante]]. While Coppola replaced European [[colonialism]] with American [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], the message of Conrad's book is still clear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberpat.com/essays/coppola.html |title=Heart of Darkness & Apocalypse Now: A comparative analysis of novella and film |publisher=Cyberpat.com |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIt is often speculated that Coppola's interpretation of the [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] character was modeled after [[Tony Poe]], a highly decorated Vietnam-era paramilitary officer from the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]].<ref>Leary, William L. \"Death of a Legend\". Air America Archive. Retrieved June 10, 2007.</ref> Poe's actions in Vietnam and in the \"Secret War\" in neighboring Laos, in particular his highly unorthodox and often savage methods of waging war, show many similarities to those of the fictional Kurtz; for example, Poe was known to drop severed heads from helicopters into enemy-controlled villages as a form of [[psychological warfare]] and use human ears to record the number of enemies his indigenous troops had killed. He would send these ears back to his superiors as proof of the efficacy of his operations deep inside Laos.<ref>Warner, Roger. Shooting at the Moon.</ref><ref>Ehrlich, Richard S.

By early 1976, Coppola had persuaded Marlon Brando to play Kurtz for an enormous fee of $3.5 million for a month's work on location in September 1976. Dennis Hopper was cast as a war correspondent and observer of Kurtz; when Coppola heard Hopper talking nonstop on location, he remembered putting \"the cameras and the Montagnard shirt on him, and [shooting] the scene where he greets them on the boat\".<ref name=\"Cowie3\" /> James Caan was the first choice to play Colonel Lucas.

The Playboy Playmate set had been destroyed, ruining a month's shooting that had been scheduled. Most of the cast and crew went back to the United States for six to eight weeks. Tavoularis and his team stayed on to scout new locations and rebuild the Playmate set in a different place. Also, the production had bodyguards watching constantly at night and one day the entire payroll was stolen.

He read a book about [[Genghis Khan]] to get a better handle on the character of Kurtz.<ref name=\"Cowie4\" /> After filming commenced, Marlon Brando arrived in Manila very overweight and began working with Coppola to rewrite the ending. The director downplayed Brando's weight by dressing him in black, photographing only his face, and having another, taller actor double for him in an attempt to portray Kurtz as an almost mythical character.<ref name=\"Cowie5\">Cowie 1990, p. 124.</ref>\n\nAfter Christmas 1976, Coppola viewed a rough assembly of the footage but still needed to improvise an ending. He returned to the Philippines in early 1977 and resumed filming.<ref name=\"Cowie5\" /> On March 5 of that year, Sheen had a heart attack and struggled for a quarter of a mile to reach help. By that time, the film was already so over-budget, even he worried funding would be halted if word about his condition were to reach the investors, and claimed he suffered heat stroke instead. He was back on the set on April 19, and during the interim, his brother [[Joe Estevez]] filled in for him and provided voice overs needed for his character. Coppola later admitted that he can no longer tell which scenes are Joe and which are Martin.<ref>{{Citation |last=DeadBySense |title=Apocalypse Now \u2013 Conversation Martin Sheen and Francis Ford Coppola Rus sub |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BkChat11cE|access-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref> A major sequence in a French plantation cost hundreds of thousands of dollars but was cut from the final film. Rumors began to circulate that ''Apocalypse Now'' had several endings but Richard Beggs, who worked on the sound elements, said, \"There were never ''five'' endings, but just the one, even if there were differently ''edited'' versions\". These rumors came from Coppola departing frequently from the original screenplay. Coppola admitted that he had no ending because Brando was too fat to play the scenes as written in the original script{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. With the help of Dennis Jakob, Coppola decided that the ending could be \"the classic myth of the murderer who gets up the river, kills the king, and then himself becomes the king&nbsp;\u2013 it's the [[Fisher King]], from ''The Golden Bough''\".<ref name=\"Cowie6\">Cowie 1990, p. 125.</ref>\n\nA [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] was slaughtered with a machete for the climactic scene.

The Author Michael Herr received a call from Zoetrope in January 1978 and was asked to work on the film's narration based on his well-received book about Vietnam, ''[[Dispatches (book)|Dispatches]]''.<ref name=\"Cowie9\" /> Herr said that the narration already written was \"totally useless\" and spent a year writing various narrations with Coppola giving him very definite guidelines.<ref name=\"Cowie9\" />\n\nMurch had problems trying to make a stereo soundtrack for ''Apocalypse Now'' because sound libraries had no stereo recordings of weapons. The sound material brought back from the Philippines was inadequate, because the small location crew lacked the time and resources to record jungle sounds and ambient noises. Murch and his crew fabricated the mood of the jungle on the soundtrack. ''Apocalypse Now'' had novel sound techniques for a movie, as Murch insisted on recording the most up-to-date gunfire and employed the [[Dolby Stereo 70&nbsp;mm Six Track]] system for the 70&nbsp;mm release. This used two channels of sound from behind the audience as well as three channels of sound from behind the movie screen.<ref name=\"Cowie9\" /> The 35&nbsp;mm release used the new [[Dolby Stereo]] optical stereo system, but due to the limitations of the technology at the time, this 35&nbsp;mm release that played in the majority of theaters did not include any surround sound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eric Dienstfrey |title=The Myth of the Speakers: A Critical Reexamination of Dolby History |journal=Film History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=167\u2013193 |publisher=Film HIstory: An International Journal |jstor=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06|year=2016 |doi=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1978, Coppola postponed the opening until spring of 1979 and screened a \"work in progress\" for 900 people in April 1979 that was not well received.<ref name=\"Cowie10\">Cowie 1990, p. 128.</ref> That same year, he was invited to screen ''Apocalypse Now'' at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Cowie11\">Cowie 1990, p. 129.</ref> United Artists were not keen on showing an unfinished version in front of so many members of the press. Since his 1974 film ''[[The Conversation]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]], Coppola agreed to screen ''Apocalypse Now'' with only a month before the festival. The week prior to Cannes, Coppola arranged three sneak previews of slightly different versions. He allowed critics to attend the screenings and believed that they would honor the embargo placed on reviews. On 14 May, [[Rona Barrett]] reviewed the film on television and called it \"a disappointing failure\".<ref name=\"Cowie11\" /> At Cannes, Zoetrope technicians worked during the night before the screening to install additional speakers on the theater walls, to achieve Murch's [[5.1 Surround Sound|5.1]] soundtrack.<ref name=\"Cowie11\" /> On August 15, 1979 ''Apocalypse Now'' was released in the U.S. in only 15 theaters equipped to play the Dolby Stereo 70 mm prints with stereo [[surround sound]].<ref>Dienstfrey 2016, p. 171</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Alternative and varied endings ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n\nAt the time of its release, discussion and rumors circulated about the supposed various endings for ''Apocalypse Now''. Coppola said the original ending was written in haste, where Kurtz convinced Willard to join forces and together they repelled the air strike on the compound. Coppola said he never fully agreed with the Kurtz and Willard dying in fatalistic explosive intensity, preferring to end the film in a more encouraging manner.\n\nWhen Coppola originally organized the ending, he considered two significantly different ends to the movie. One involved Willard leading Lance by the hand as everyone in Kurtz's base throws down their weapons, and ends with images of Willard piloting the PBR slowly away from Kurtz's compound, this final scene superimposed over the face of a stone idol, which then fades into black. The other option showed an air strike being called and the base being blown to bits in a spectacular display, consequently killing everyone left within it.\n\nThe original 1979 {{nowrap|70mm}} exclusive theatrical release ended with Willard's boat, the stone statue, then fade to black with no credits, save for '\"Copyright 1979 Omni Zoetrope\"' right after the film ends. This mirrors the lack of any opening titles and supposedly stems from Coppola's original intention to \"tour\" the film as one would a play: the credits would have appeared on printed programs provided before the screening began.<ref name=\"Cowie14\">Cowie 1990, p. 132.</ref>\n\nThere have been, to date, many variations of the end credit sequence, beginning with the 35&nbsp;mm general release version, where Coppola elected to show the credits superimposed over shots of the jungle exploding into flames.<ref name=\"Cowie14\" /> Rental prints circulated with this ending, and can be found in the hands of a few collectors. Some versions of this had the subtitle \"A United Artists release\", while others had \"An Omni Zoetrope release\". The network television version of the credits ended with \"...{{nbsp}}from MGM/UA Entertainment Company\" (the film made its network debut shortly after the merger of [[MGM]] and UA). One variation of the end credits can be seen on both YouTube and as a supplement on the current [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment|Lionsgate]] Blu-ray.\n\nLater when Coppola heard that audiences interpreted this as an air strike called by Willard, Coppola pulled the film from its {{nowrap|35 mm}} run and put credits on a black screen. However, the \"air strike\" footage continued to circulate in repertory theaters well into the 1980s, and it was included in the 1980s LaserDisc release. In the DVD commentary, Coppola explains that the images of explosions had not been intended to be part of the story; they were intended to be seen as completely separate from the film. He had added the explosions to the credits as a graphic background to the credits.<ref>Destruction of the Kurtz Compound w/ commentary by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]'' DVD extras. November 20, 2001.</ref>\n\nCoppola explained he had captured the now-iconic footage during demolition of the sets (set destruction and removal was required by the Philippine government). Coppola filmed the demolition with multiple cameras fitted with different film stocks and lenses to capture the explosions at different speeds. He wanted to do something with the dramatic footage and decided to add them to the credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreview1/a/apocalypsenowra.htm |title=DVD Review Apocalypse Now \u2013 Apocalypse Now DVD Review |publisher=Homevideo.about.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' ===\n{{Main|Apocalypse Now Redux}}\nIn 2001, Coppola released ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' in cinemas and subsequently on DVD. This is an extended version that restores 49 minutes of scenes cut from the original film. Coppola has continued to circulate the original version as well: the two versions are packaged together in the ''Complete Dossier'' DVD, released on August 15, 2006 and in the Blu-ray edition released on October 19, 2010.\n\nThe longest section of added footage in the ''Redux'' version is the \"French Plantation\" sequence, a chapter involving the de Marais family's rubber plantation, a holdover from the colonization of [[French Indochina]], featuring Coppola's two sons [[Gian-Carlo Coppola|Gian-Carlo]] and [[Roman Coppola|Roman]] as children of the family. Around the dinner table, a young French child recites a poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]] entitled ''[[L'albatros (poem)|L'albatros]]''. The French family patriarch is not satisfied with the child's recitation. The child is sent away. These scenes were removed from the 1979 cut, which premiered at [[Festival de Cannes|Cannes]]. In behind-the-scenes footage in ''Hearts of Darkness'', Coppola expresses his anger, on the set, at the technical limitations of the scenes, the result of shortage of money. At the time of the ''Redux'' version, it was possible to digitally enhance the footage to accomplish Coppola's vision. In the scenes, the French family patriarchs argue about the positive side of colonialism in Indochina and denounce the betrayal of the military men in the [[First Indochina War]]. Hubert de Marais argues that French politicians sacrificed entire battalions at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], and tells Willard that the US created the Viet Cong (as the [[Viet Minh]]) to fend off Japanese invaders.\n\nOther added material includes extra combat footage before Willard meets Kilgore, a humorous scene in which Willard's team steals Kilgore's surfboard (which sheds some light on the hunt for the mangoes), a follow-up scene to the dance of the ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates, in which Willard's team finds the Playmates stranded after their helicopter has run out of fuel (trading two barrels of fuel for two hours with the Bunnies), and a scene of Kurtz reading from a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about the war, surrounded by Cambodian children.\n\nA deleted scene titled \"Monkey Sampan\" shows Willard and the PBR crew suspiciously eyeing an approaching [[sampan]] juxtaposed to Montagnard villagers joyfully singing \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. As the sampan gets closer, Willard realizes there are monkeys on it and no helmsman. Finally, just as the two boats pass, the wind turns the sail and exposes a naked dead [[Viet Cong]] (VC) nailed to the sail boom. His body is mutilated and looks as though the man had been [[flogged]] and [[castrated]]. The singing stops. As they pass on by, Chief notes out loud, \"That's comin' from where we goin', Captain.\" The boat then slowly passes the giant tail of a shot down [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] as the noise of engines high in the sky is heard. Coppola said that he made up for cutting this scene by having the PBR pass under an aircraft tail in the final cut.\n\n=== First Assembly ===\nA 289-minute First Assembly circulates as a video bootleg, containing extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version.<ref name=\"Coates\">{{cite news |last=Coates |first=Gordon |title=Coppola's slow boat on the Nung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/17/1 |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018214153/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/17/1|archive-date=October 18, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' ===\nIn April 2019, Coppola showed ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' for the 40th anniversary screening at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Gordon |title=Tribeca: Danny Boyle's Beatles Movie 'Yesterday' Set as Closing Night Film |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/beatles-movie-yesterday-say-anything-apocalypse-now-set-tribeca-2019-1194756|access-date=April 24, 2019 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> This new version is Coppolla's preferred version of the film and has a runtime of three hours and three minutes, with Coppola having cut 20 minutes of the added material from ''Redux''; the scenes deleted include the second encounter with the Playmates, parts of the plantation sequence, and Kurtz's reading of ''Time'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=442569 |title=\t\nApocalypse Now Comparison: Final Cut - Redux Version |website=Movie Censorship |date=September 15, 2019 |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> It is also the first time the film has been restored from the original camera negative at 4K; previous transfers were made from an [[interpositive]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Falt |first1=Chris |title='Apocalypse Now': 5 Things You Need to Know About Coppola's New 'Final Cut' |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/apocalypse-now-final-cut-5-things-to-know-francis-for-coppola-new-version-1202129340/ |website=IndieWire|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> It was released in autumn 2019, along with an extended cut of ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleming Jr. |first1=Mike |title=Francis Ford Coppola: How Winning Cannes 40 Years Ago Saved 'Apocalypse Now,' Making 'Megalopolis,' Why Scorsese Almost Helmed 'Godfather Part II' & Re-Cutting Three Past Films |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-cannes-40-anniversary-megalopolis-scorsese-godfather-part-ii-re-cutting-godfather-iii-cotton-club-interview-1202613659/ |date=May 13, 2019 |website=Deadline|access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref> It also had a release in select [[IMAX]] theaters on August 15 and 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/apocalypse-now-final-cut-imax-theaters/ |title=Restored 'Apocalypse Now Final Cut' Coming to IMAX Theaters for the 40th Anniversary |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 25, 2019 |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Cannes screening ===\n[[File:Palmed'or.jpg|thumb|The [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] Palme d'Or was awarded to ''Apocalypse Now''.]]\nA three-hour version of ''Apocalypse Now'' was screened as a \"work in progress\" at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and met with prolonged applause.<ref name=\"Cowie12\">Cowie 1990, p. 130.</ref> At the subsequent press conference, Coppola criticized the media for attacking him and the production during their problems filming in the Philippines and said, \"We had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane\", and \"My film is not about Vietnam, it ''is'' Vietnam\".<ref name=\"Cowie12\" /> The filmmaker upset newspaper critic [[Rex Reed]] who reportedly stormed out of the conference.

The first [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] appearance, on [[Laserdisc]] on December 29, 1991, cropped the film to a 2:1 aspect ratio (conforming to the [[Univisium]] spec created by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), and included a small degree of pan-and-scan processing at the insistence of Coppola and Storaro. The end credits, from a videotape source rather than a film print, were still crushed for 1.33:1 and zoomed to fit the anamorphic video frame. All DVD releases have maintained this aspect ratio in anamorphic widescreen, but present the film without the end credits, which were treated as a separate feature. The Blu-ray releases of ''Apocalypse Now'' restore the film to a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, making it the first home video release to display the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nAs a DVD extra, the footage of the explosion of the Kurtz compound was featured without text credits but included commentary by Coppola, explaining the various endings based on how the film was screened.\n\nOn the cover of the ''Redux'' DVD, Willard is erroneously listed as \"Lieutenant Willard\".\n\nLionsgate released a 6-disc 40th anniversary edition on August 27, 2019.

It stars [[Marlon Brando]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Frederic Forrest]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Sam Bottoms]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Dennis Hopper]]. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and [[John Milius]] and narration written by [[Michael Herr]], was loosely based on the 1899 novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. The setting was changed from late 19th-century [[Congo Free State|Congo]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. The film follows a river journey from [[South Vietnam]] into [[Cambodia]] undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard (a character based on Conrad's [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]] and played by Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate [[Colonel Kurtz]] (Brando, with the character being based on Conrad's [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]]), a renegade [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane.\n\nMilius became interested in adapting ''Heart of Darkness'' for a Vietnam War setting, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and [[George Lucas]] as director. After Lucas became unavailable, Coppola took over directoral control, and was influenced by [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) in his approach to the material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html |title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary |last=Peary |first=Gerald |publisher=Gerald Peary |accessdate=March 14, 2007}}</ref> Initially set to be a five-month shoot, the film became noted for the problems encountered while making it for over a year, as chronicled in the documentary ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'' (1991).

The film performed well at the box office, grossing $78 million domestically and going on to gross over $150 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed; while [[Vittorio Storaro]]'s cinematography was widely acclaimed, several critics found Coppola's handling of the story's major themes to be anticlimactic and intellectually disappointing. ''Apocalypse Now'' is today considered to be [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]]. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] at the [[52nd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Coppola), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Duvall, and went on to win for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].

Kurtz]] has apparently gone insane and is waging a brutal but successful guerilla war against terrified [[People's_Army_of_Vietnam#Vietnam_War|NVA]] and [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam|PLAF]] forces without permission, directions or resupply from his commanders. At an outpost in [[Cambodia]], he commands American and [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops who see him as a [[demigod]]. Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to [[I Field Force, Vietnam|I Field Force]] headquarters in Nha Trang, briefed on the situation by two Army commanders and a CIA officer, and ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command... with [[Summary execution|extreme prejudice]]\". Willard, initially ambivalent, joins a U.S. Navy [[Patrol Boat, River|river patrol boat]] (PBR) commanded by [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] \"Chief\" Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\", and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)#Vietnam War|1st Squadron]], [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], a helicopter-borne air assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng's [[Viet Cong]]-held coastal mouth. The squadron raids at dawn, with Kilgore ordering a [[napalm]] strike on the Viet Cong. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly-conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\n\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard's. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice he made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join the Special Forces, which afforded no prospect of advancing in rank past Colonel. The third-generation West Point graduate could have pursued more conventional command assignments to eventually rise to four-star general. \n\nWeeks later, the PBR reaches the remote U.S. Army outpost by the Do Lung Bridge. Willard and Lance enter the outpost after nightfall, seeking information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer at Do Lung, Willard orders the Chief to continue as an unseen enemy assaults the bridge. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz.{{efn|A few days before Willard received this dispatch, Chief had told him that about six months prior to Willard's mission, he (Chief) had taken another man north of the Do Long Bridge. Chief had heard this man shot himself in the head.}}\n\nAs the crew read letters from home, Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting the attention of an unseen enemy, and Mr. Clean is killed. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by impaling him on the spear point protruding from his own chest. Willard suffocates Chief and Lance buries him in the river. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR, but despite Chef's anger about the mission, he rejects Willard's offer to cut the sailors loose and continue alone and insists that they complete the mission together.\n\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz's outpost, located on the site of a long abandoned [[Angkor Empire]] temple compound, teeming with Montagnards and strewn with corpses and severed heads. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American freelance photojournalist, who manically praises Kurtz's genius. As they wander through, they come across a near-catatonic Colby, along with other US servicemen now in Kurtz's renegade army. Willard returns to the moored PBR to leave Chef with the boat, ordering him to call in a pre-arranged airstrike on the outpost if Willard and Lance do not return.\n\nIn the camp, Willard is subdued, bound and brought before Kurtz in a darkened temple. Willard is detained and tortured for several days, during which time Kurtz kills Chef, preventing the airstrike from occurring. Willard is soon released and allowed to roam the compound. Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, the [[human condition]] and civilization, while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of his adversaries, the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\n\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially slaughter a [[water buffalo]], Willard stealthily enters Kurtz's chamber as he is making a voice recording and attacks him with a machete. Mortally wounded, Kurtz utters \"...{{nbsp}}The horror ... the horror {{nbsp}}...\" and dies. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard then leads Lance to the boat and they sail away. Kurtz's final words echo eerily as everything [[Fade (lighting)|fades to black]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{About||a list of the rest of the cast members not included in the 153-minute version of the film that was released in theaters|Apocalypse Now Redux#Cast}}\n[[File:Marlon Brando (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The performance of [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz]] was critically acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chas |last=Gerretsen|author-link=Chas Gerretsen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/the-horror-apocalypse-now-unseen-in-pictures |title=The horror!

The novella, based on Conrad's experience as a steamboat captain in Africa, is set in the [[Congo Free State]] during the 19th century.<ref>Murfin, Ross C (ed.) (1989): ''Joseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness. A Case Study in Contemporary Criticism''. Boston: St. Martin's Press, pp. 3\u201316.</ref> Kurtz and Marlow (whose corresponding character in the movie is Capt. Willard) work for a Belgian trading company that brutally exploits its native African workers.\n\nAfter arriving at Kurtz's outpost, Marlow concludes that Kurtz has gone insane and is lording over a small tribe as a god. The novella ends with Kurtz dying on the trip back and the narrator musing about the darkness of the human psyche: \"the heart of an immense darkness\".\n\nIn the novella, Marlow is the pilot of a river boat sent to collect ivory from Kurtz's outpost, only gradually becoming infatuated with Kurtz. In fact, when he discovers Kurtz in terrible health, Marlow makes an effort to bring him home safely. In the film, Willard is an assassin dispatched to kill Kurtz. Nevertheless, the depiction of Kurtz as a god-like leader of a tribe of natives and his malarial fever, Kurtz's written exclamation \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (which appears in the film as \"Drop the bomb. Exterminate them all!\") and his last words \"The horror! The horror!\" are taken from Conrad's novella.\n\nCoppola argues that many episodes in the film\u2014the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example\u2014respect the spirit of the novella and in particular its critique of the concepts of civilization and progress. Other episodes adapted by Coppola, the  Playboy Playmates' (Sirens) exit, the lost souls, \"take me home\" attempting to reach the boat and Kurtz's tribe of (white-faced) natives parting the canoes (gates of Hell) for Willard, (with Chef and Lance) to enter the camp are likened to Virgil and \"The Inferno\" ([[Divine Comedy]]) by [[Dante]]. While Coppola replaced European [[colonialism]] with American [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], the message of Conrad's book is still clear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberpat.com/essays/coppola.html |title=Heart of Darkness & Apocalypse Now: A comparative analysis of novella and film |publisher=Cyberpat.com |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIt is often speculated that Coppola's interpretation of the [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] character was modeled after [[Tony Poe]], a highly decorated Vietnam-era paramilitary officer from the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]].<ref>Leary, William L. \"Death of a Legend\".

Eliot's original epigraph for \"The Waste Land\" was this passage from ''Heart of Darkness'', which ends with Kurtz's final words:<ref>Davidson, Harriet. \"Improper desire: reading ''The Waste Land''\" in Anthony David Moody (ed.).

On 14 May, [[Rona Barrett]] reviewed the film on television and called it \"a disappointing failure\".<ref name=\"Cowie11\" /> At Cannes, Zoetrope technicians worked during the night before the screening to install additional speakers on the theater walls, to achieve Murch's [[5.1 Surround Sound|5.1]] soundtrack.<ref name=\"Cowie11\" /> On August 15, 1979 ''Apocalypse Now'' was released in the U.S. in only 15 theaters equipped to play the Dolby Stereo 70 mm prints with stereo [[surround sound]].<ref>Dienstfrey 2016, p. 171</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Alternative and varied endings ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n\nAt the time of its release, discussion and rumors circulated about the supposed various endings for ''Apocalypse Now''. Coppola said the original ending was written in haste, where Kurtz convinced Willard to join forces and together they repelled the air strike on the compound. Coppola said he never fully agreed with the Kurtz and Willard dying in fatalistic explosive intensity, preferring to end the film in a more encouraging manner.\n\nWhen Coppola originally organized the ending, he considered two significantly different ends to the movie. One involved Willard leading Lance by the hand as everyone in Kurtz's base throws down their weapons, and ends with images of Willard piloting the PBR slowly away from Kurtz's compound, this final scene superimposed over the face of a stone idol, which then fades into black. The other option showed an air strike being called and the base being blown to bits in a spectacular display, consequently killing everyone left within it.\n\nThe original 1979 {{nowrap|70mm}} exclusive theatrical release ended with Willard's boat, the stone statue, then fade to black with no credits, save for '\"Copyright 1979 Omni Zoetrope\"' right after the film ends. This mirrors the lack of any opening titles and supposedly stems from Coppola's original intention to \"tour\" the film as one would a play: the credits would have appeared on printed programs provided before the screening began.<ref name=\"Cowie14\">Cowie 1990, p. 132.</ref>\n\nThere have been, to date, many variations of the end credit sequence, beginning with the 35&nbsp;mm general release version, where Coppola elected to show the credits superimposed over shots of the jungle exploding into flames.<ref name=\"Cowie14\" /> Rental prints circulated with this ending, and can be found in the hands of a few collectors. Some versions of this had the subtitle \"A United Artists release\", while others had \"An Omni Zoetrope release\". The network television version of the credits ended with \"...{{nbsp}}from MGM/UA Entertainment Company\" (the film made its network debut shortly after the merger of [[MGM]] and UA). One variation of the end credits can be seen on both YouTube and as a supplement on the current [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment|Lionsgate]] Blu-ray.\n\nLater when Coppola heard that audiences interpreted this as an air strike called by Willard, Coppola pulled the film from its {{nowrap|35 mm}} run and put credits on a black screen. However, the \"air strike\" footage continued to circulate in repertory theaters well into the 1980s, and it was included in the 1980s LaserDisc release. In the DVD commentary, Coppola explains that the images of explosions had not been intended to be part of the story; they were intended to be seen as completely separate from the film. He had added the explosions to the credits as a graphic background to the credits.<ref>Destruction of the Kurtz Compound w/ commentary by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]'' DVD extras. November 20, 2001.</ref>\n\nCoppola explained he had captured the now-iconic footage during demolition of the sets (set destruction and removal was required by the Philippine government). Coppola filmed the demolition with multiple cameras fitted with different film stocks and lenses to capture the explosions at different speeds. He wanted to do something with the dramatic footage and decided to add them to the credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreview1/a/apocalypsenowra.htm |title=DVD Review Apocalypse Now \u2013 Apocalypse Now DVD Review |publisher=Homevideo.about.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' ===\n{{Main|Apocalypse Now Redux}}\nIn 2001, Coppola released ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' in cinemas and subsequently on DVD. This is an extended version that restores 49 minutes of scenes cut from the original film. Coppola has continued to circulate the original version as well: the two versions are packaged together in the ''Complete Dossier'' DVD, released on August 15, 2006 and in the Blu-ray edition released on October 19, 2010.\n\nThe longest section of added footage in the ''Redux'' version is the \"French Plantation\" sequence, a chapter involving the de Marais family's rubber plantation, a holdover from the colonization of [[French Indochina]], featuring Coppola's two sons [[Gian-Carlo Coppola|Gian-Carlo]] and [[Roman Coppola|Roman]] as children of the family. Around the dinner table, a young French child recites a poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]] entitled ''[[L'albatros (poem)|L'albatros]]''. The French family patriarch is not satisfied with the child's recitation. The child is sent away. These scenes were removed from the 1979 cut, which premiered at [[Festival de Cannes|Cannes]]. In behind-the-scenes footage in ''Hearts of Darkness'', Coppola expresses his anger, on the set, at the technical limitations of the scenes, the result of shortage of money. At the time of the ''Redux'' version, it was possible to digitally enhance the footage to accomplish Coppola's vision. In the scenes, the French family patriarchs argue about the positive side of colonialism in Indochina and denounce the betrayal of the military men in the [[First Indochina War]]. Hubert de Marais argues that French politicians sacrificed entire battalions at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], and tells Willard that the US created the Viet Cong (as the [[Viet Minh]]) to fend off Japanese invaders.\n\nOther added material includes extra combat footage before Willard meets Kilgore, a humorous scene in which Willard's team steals Kilgore's surfboard (which sheds some light on the hunt for the mangoes), a follow-up scene to the dance of the ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates, in which Willard's team finds the Playmates stranded after their helicopter has run out of fuel (trading two barrels of fuel for two hours with the Bunnies), and a scene of Kurtz reading from a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about the war, surrounded by Cambodian children.\n\nA deleted scene titled \"Monkey Sampan\" shows Willard and the PBR crew suspiciously eyeing an approaching [[sampan]] juxtaposed to Montagnard villagers joyfully singing \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. As the sampan gets closer, Willard realizes there are monkeys on it and no helmsman. Finally, just as the two boats pass, the wind turns the sail and exposes a naked dead [[Viet Cong]] (VC) nailed to the sail boom. His body is mutilated and looks as though the man had been [[flogged]] and [[castrated]]. The singing stops. As they pass on by, Chief notes out loud, \"That's comin' from where we goin', Captain.\" The boat then slowly passes the giant tail of a shot down [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] as the noise of engines high in the sky is heard. Coppola said that he made up for cutting this scene by having the PBR pass under an aircraft tail in the final cut.\n\n=== First Assembly ===\nA 289-minute First Assembly circulates as a video bootleg, containing extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version.<ref name=\"Coates\">{{cite news |last=Coates |first=Gordon |title=Coppola's slow boat on the Nung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/17/1 |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018214153/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/17/1|archive-date=October 18, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' ===\nIn April 2019, Coppola showed ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' for the 40th anniversary screening at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Gordon |title=Tribeca: Danny Boyle's Beatles Movie 'Yesterday' Set as Closing Night Film |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/beatles-movie-yesterday-say-anything-apocalypse-now-set-tribeca-2019-1194756|access-date=April 24, 2019 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> This new version has a runtime of three hours and three minutes, with Coppola having cut 20 minutes of the added material from ''Redux''; the scenes deleted include the second encounter with the Playmates, parts of the plantation sequence, and Kurtz's reading of ''Time'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=442569 |title=\t\nApocalypse Now Comparison: Final Cut - Redux Version |website=Movie Censorship |date=September 15, 2019 |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> It is also the first time the film has been restored from the original camera negative at 4K; previous transfers were made from an [[interpositive]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Falt |first1=Chris |title='Apocalypse Now': 5 Things You Need to Know About Coppola's New 'Final Cut' |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/apocalypse-now-final-cut-5-things-to-know-francis-for-coppola-new-version-1202129340/ |website=IndieWire|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> It was released in autumn 2019, along with an extended cut of ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleming Jr. |first1=Mike |title=Francis Ford Coppola: How Winning Cannes 40 Years Ago Saved 'Apocalypse Now,' Making 'Megalopolis,' Why Scorsese Almost Helmed 'Godfather Part II' & Re-Cutting Three Past Films |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-cannes-40-anniversary-megalopolis-scorsese-godfather-part-ii-re-cutting-godfather-iii-cotton-club-interview-1202613659/ |date=May 13, 2019 |website=Deadline|access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref> It also had a release in select [[IMAX]] theaters on August 15 and 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/apocalypse-now-final-cut-imax-theaters/ |title=Restored 'Apocalypse Now Final Cut' Coming to IMAX Theaters for the 40th Anniversary |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 25, 2019 |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Cannes screening ===\n[[File:Palmed'or.jpg|thumb|The [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] Palme d'Or was awarded to ''Apocalypse Now''.]]\nA three-hour version of ''Apocalypse Now'' was screened as a \"work in progress\" at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival and met with prolonged applause.<ref name=\"Cowie12\">Cowie 1990, p. 130.</ref> At the subsequent press conference, Coppola criticized the media for attacking him and the production during their problems filming in the Philippines and said, \"We had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane\", and \"My film is not about Vietnam, it ''is'' Vietnam\".<ref name=\"Cowie12\" /> The filmmaker upset newspaper critic [[Rex Reed]] who reportedly stormed out of the conference.

The first [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] appearance, on [[Laserdisc]] on December 29, 1991, cropped the film to a 2:1 aspect ratio (conforming to the [[Univisium]] spec created by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), and included a small degree of pan-and-scan processing at the insistence of Coppola and Storaro. The end credits, from a videotape source rather than a film print, were still crushed for 1.33:1 and zoomed to fit the anamorphic video frame. All DVD releases have maintained this aspect ratio in anamorphic widescreen, but present the film without the end credits, which were treated as a separate feature. The Blu-ray releases of ''Apocalypse Now'' restore the film to a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, making it the first home video release to display the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nAs a DVD extra, the footage of the explosion of the Kurtz compound was featured without text credits but included commentary by Coppola, explaining the various endings based on how the film was screened.\n\nOn the cover of the ''Redux'' DVD, Willard is erroneously listed as \"Lieutenant Willard\".\n\nLionsgate released a 6-disc 40th anniversary edition on August 27, 2019. It includes two [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] discs and four standard Blu-ray discs, containing the theatrical version, ''Redux'', and the ''Final Cut'' featuring 4K restorations from the original camera negative. Previous extras (including the ''Hearts of Darkness'' documentary) have been re-used for this release, along with brand new content including a Tribeca Film Festival Q&A with Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Soderbergh and never-before-seen B-roll footage.<ref>https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=25025</ref>\n\n== Documentaries ==\n''Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'' (American Zoetrope/Cineplex Odeon Films) (1991) Directed by Eleanor Coppola, [[George Hickenlooper]], and Fax Bahr\n\n''Apocalypse Now \u2013 The Complete Dossier'' DVD ([[Paramount Home Entertainment]]) (2006).

The normal size is 105 \u00d7 165&nbsp;cm. In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] it is colloquially called the \"''sinimustvalge''\" (literally \"blue-black-white\"), after the colours of the bands. The flag became associated with [[Estonians|Estonian]] [[nationalism]] and was used as the [[national flag]] (''riigilipp'') when the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued on February 24, 1918. The flag was formally adopted on November 21, 1918. On December 12, 1918 was the first time the flag was raised as the national symbol atop of the [[Pikk Hermann]] Tower in Tallinn.<ref>[http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-780 Estonia's Blue-Black-White Tricolour Flag at estemb.org]</ref>\n<br />\nThe following is a '''list of [[Flag of Estonia|flags of]] [[Estonia]]'''.\n\n== National flag and state flag ==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-  bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

The normal size is 105 \u00d7 165&nbsp;cm. In [[Estonian language|Estonian]] it is colloquially called the \"''sinimustvalge''\" (literally \"blue-black-white\"), after the colours of the bands. The flag became associated with [[Estonians|Estonian]] [[nationalism]] and was used as the [[national flag]] (''riigilipp'') when the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]] was issued on February 24, 1918. The flag was formally adopted on November 21, 1918. On December 12, 1918 was the first time the flag was raised as the national symbol atop of the [[Pikk Hermann]] Tower in Tallinn.<ref>[http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-780 Estonia's Blue-Black-White Tricolour Flag at estemb.org]</ref>\n<br />\nThe following is a '''list of [[Flag of Estonia|flags of]] [[Estonia]]'''.\n\n== National flag and state flag ==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|-  bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

See discussions and FAQ (Q2) on the talk page. -->\n\nObama was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black person to head the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district]] from 1997 until 2004 in the [[Illinois Senate]], when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] began, and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|close primary campaigns]] against [[Hillary Clinton]]. Obama was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.\n\nObama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as economic stimulus amidst the [[Great Recession]]. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in [[death of Osama bin Laden|the deaths of Osama bin Laden]] and suspected Yemeni [[Al-Qaeda]] operative [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].\n\nAfter winning [[2012 United States presidential election|re-election]] by defeating Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in ''Obergefell''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[global warming]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to gains made by [[ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of [[ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]] in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], and [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]]. Obama nominated [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates|three justices to the Supreme Court]]: [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as justices, while [[Merrick Garland]] faced partisan [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|obstruction]] and was not confirmed.

He previously served as a [[U.S. senator]] from [[Illinois]] from 2005 to 2008 and an [[Illinois state senator]] from 1997 to 2004.<!--  PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE FROM \"AFRICAN AMERICAN\", per consensus. See discussions and FAQ (Q2) on the talk page. -->\n\nObama was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black person to head the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district]] from 1997 until 2004 in the [[Illinois Senate]], when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after [[Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign|his presidential campaign]] began, and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|close primary campaigns]] against [[Hillary Clinton]]. Obama was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.\n\nObama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as economic stimulus amidst the [[Great Recession]]. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]], contributing to the overthrow of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in [[death of Osama bin Laden|the deaths of Osama bin Laden]] and suspected Yemeni [[Al-Qaeda]] operative [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].\n\nAfter winning [[2012 United States presidential election|re-election]] by defeating Republican opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in ''Obergefell''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[global warming]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014\u2013present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to gains made by [[ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of [[ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]] in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014\u2013present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], and [[United States\u2013Cuban Thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]]. Obama nominated [[Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates|three justices to the Supreme Court]]: [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Elena Kagan]] were confirmed as justices, while [[Merrick Garland]] faced partisan [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|obstruction]] and was not confirmed.

Beach \u201956 Distinguished Chair Emeritus in Sustainable Studies and Professor of English Language and Literature Emeritus at [[Dickinson College]]. His interests are in literature, contemporary [[ecocriticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[nature writing]]. Nichols taught courses in [[Romanticism]], 19th century literature, literature and the environment, and nature writing. He is especially well-known for his study of [[James Joyce]]'s literary concept of \"epiphany,\u201d his definition of Romantic natural histories, and his coinage of the phrase \"Urbanatural roosting,\" an idea which links urban with natural modes of existence and argues for ways of living more lightly on the earth, for inhabiting our planet the way animals do, by altering our environments without harming those same environments.\n\n== Academic background ==\n\nNichols graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a B.A. with high honors in Philosophy in 1975. As an undergraduate, he received a four-year full academic scholarship as a DuPont Regional Scholar and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also selected for an Honors Program in philosophy, a program which allowed him to sit in on any class at the university and work individually with a separate tutor for each of the three semesters: in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and then to write an honors thesis in his final semester. On the advice of [[Cora Diamond]], he attended [[University College London]] from 1973 to 1974 to study philosophy. He served as a staff reporter for the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] ''Free Lance-Star'', where he received awards from the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the Virginia Press Association, and as an editor for the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], before returning to the University of Virginia for an M.A. and later a Ph.D. in English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. He spent time as a Visiting Researcher at [[Cambridge University]] with [[John Beer]]. His Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by [[Robert Langbaum]] was titled \"The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Moment\". It was later revised for publication with the same title as his first book.\n\nNichols's time at Dickinson was punctuated by his membership on the President's Commission on Environmental Sustainability (PCES)--and before that, on the steering committee of the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE)--as a member of the Climate Change Curriculum Task Force, and a recipient of the Willoughby Institute Award for Teaching with Technology;<ref name=\"blogs.dickinson\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |title=The Willoughby Institute for Teaching with Technology |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703180319/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}</ref> he has also served on the Science Advisory Committee and the General Education Committee of the college. In 1994-95, he was a Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]] and Director of the Dickinson Programs in the Humanities and Sciences in [[Norwich]], U.K. He was a member of the selection committee for the Sam Rose '58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/749/the_sam_rose_58_and_julie_walters_prize_at_dickinson_college_for_global_environmental_activism |title=The Sam Rose \u201958 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism |publisher=Dickinson College |date=February 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref> a $100,000 a year award to a major environmentalist whose impact has been powerful and fully international. Recipients so far have included [[Bill McKibben]] (author and climate activist), [[Lisa P.

S. government, claiming that the climate of the earth is being damaged in ways that threaten the youths' rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness); and, in 2019 to the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC). In addition to his joint appointment in Environmental Studies and Sciences, as well as English, Nichols has also served terms as Chair of both departments. He also worked a brief stint as Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Dickinson.\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nNichols was awarded the Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching<ref name=\"archives.dickinson\">{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/lists-rosters/ganoe-award-inspirational-teaching |title=Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching |publisher=Dickinson College |date= |accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref> (1993-1994).

Beach \u201956 Distinguished Chair Emeritus in Sustainable Studies and Professor of English Language and Literature Emeritus at [[Dickinson College]]. His interests are in literature, contemporary [[ecocriticism]], [[Romanticism]], and [[nature writing]]. Nichols taught courses in [[Romanticism]], 19th century literature, literature and the environment, and nature writing. He is especially well-known for his study of [[James Joyce]]'s literary concept of \"epiphany,\u201d his definition of Romantic natural histories, and his coinage of the phrase \"Urbanatural roosting,\" an idea which links urban with natural modes of existence and argues for ways of living more lightly on the earth, for inhabiting our planet the way animals do, by altering our environments without harming those same environments.\n\n== Academic background ==\n\nNichols graduated from the [[University of Virginia]] with a B.A. with high honors in Philosophy in 1975. As an undergraduate, he received a four-year full academic scholarship as a DuPont Regional Scholar and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He was also selected for an Honors Program in philosophy, a program which allowed him to sit in on any class at the university and work individually with a separate tutor for each of the three semesters: in epistemology, metaphysics, and ethics, and then to write an honors thesis in his final semester. On the advice of [[Cora Diamond]], he attended [[University College London]] from 1973 to 1974 to study philosophy. He served as a staff reporter for the [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] ''Free Lance-Star'', where he received awards from the [[Associated Press|AP]] and the Virginia Press Association, and as an editor for the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], before returning to the University of Virginia for an M.A. and later a Ph.D. in English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature. He spent time as a Visiting Researcher at [[Cambridge University]] with [[John Beer]]. His Ph.D. dissertation, supervised by [[Robert Langbaum]] was titled \"The Poetics of Epiphany: Nineteenth-Century Origins of the Modern Literary Moment\". It was later revised for publication with the same title as his first book.\n\nNichols's time at Dickinson was punctuated by his membership on the President's Commission on Environmental Sustainability (PCES)--and before that, on the steering committee of the Center for Sustainability Education (CSE)--as a member of the Climate Change Curriculum Task Force, and a recipient of the Willoughby Institute Award for Teaching with Technology;<ref name=\"blogs.dickinson\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |title=The Willoughby Institute for Teaching with Technology |accessdate=July 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703180319/http://blogs.dickinson.edu/willoughby/about/2008-2010-willoughby-fellows/ |archivedate=July 3, 2013 }}</ref> he has also served on the Science Advisory Committee and the General Education Committee of the college. In 1994-95, he was a Visiting Lecturer at the [[University of East Anglia]] and Director of the Dickinson Programs in the Humanities and Sciences in [[Norwich]], U.K. He was a member of the selection committee for the Sam Rose '58 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dickinson.edu/homepage/749/the_sam_rose_58_and_julie_walters_prize_at_dickinson_college_for_global_environmental_activism |title=The Sam Rose \u201958 and Julie Walters Prize at Dickinson College for Global Environmental Activism |publisher=Dickinson College |date=2015-02-25 |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> a $100,000 a year award to a major environmentalist whose impact has been powerful and fully international. Recipients so far have included [[Bill McKibben]] (author and climate activist), [[Lisa P. Jackson]] (Barack Obama's first EPA administrator), [[James Balog]] (video and still photographer of melting glaciers and icecaps), [[Mark Ruffalo]] (actor and river activist), [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] (Pulitzer Prize-winning environmental writer for ''The New Yorker'' and professor at Williams College), Brett Jenks (CEO and president of conservation organization [[Rare (conservation organization)|Rare]]), and [[Our Children's Trust]] (the organization that supports 21 young people--aged 11-22--who have brought suit against the federal U. S. government, claiming that the climate of the earth is being damaged in ways that threaten the youths' rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness); and, in 2019 to the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC). In addition to his joint appointment in Environmental Studies and Sciences, as well as English, Nichols has also served terms as Chair of both departments. He also worked a brief stint as Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Dickinson.\n\n== Recognition ==\n\nNichols was awarded the Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching<ref name=\"archives.dickinson\">{{cite web|url=http://archives.dickinson.edu/lists-rosters/ganoe-award-inspirational-teaching |title=Ganoe Award for Inspirational Teaching |publisher=Dickinson College |date= |accessdate=2014-06-24}}</ref> (1993-1994). Speaking to his ability to reach students, this award is described as the \"highest honor the college bestows on a member of the faculty for excellence in teaching\"; it is given by members of the senior class and awarded each year at Commencement.

On 7 August. 1790 he passed as a member of the College of Surgeons, and settled as a general practitioner at Walbrook in the [[City of London]].\n\nFive years later he began publication of ''The Medical and Chirurgical Review,'' a journal which appeared twice each month, of which he was the projector, editor, and almost sole writer, and which he continued until 1807. Determining to qualify as a physician, he, in 1802, proceeded to Edinburgh for one year, but then transferred himself to Glasgow, where he graduated doctor of medicine, 16 April 1804. Returning to the metropolis, he established himself at 17 St. Paul's Churchyard, and on 1 October 1804 was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians. He removed to Bridge Street, Blackfriars, in 1808, was elected physician to the General Dispensary, Aldersgate Street, in 1809, and about that time began to lecture on materia medica and the practice of physic. His lectures were plain, forcible, and unadorned, full of facts and free from speculations. His receipts from his lectures in one year are said to have exceeded a thousand pounds.\n\nIn 1809 he sent to the press his ''Inquiry into the Seat and Nature of Fever''. From this period Clutterbuck's reputation and business steadily increased, and he soon took a position among the first physicians in the city. For more than fifty years he was a regular attendant at the meetings of the Medical Society of London, where he was known as an effective speaker.\n\nClutterbuck was run over in the street on leaving the anniversary meeting of the [[Medical Society of London]], 8 March 1856, and died at his house, 1 Crescent, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, on 24 April 1856. He retained his faculties to the last, and is said to have seen patients on the very day he died.\n\nA portrait of him is in the meeting-room of the Medical Society of London.

From this period Clutterbuck's reputation and business steadily increased, and he soon took a position among the first physicians in the city. For more than fifty years he was a regular attendant at the meetings of the Medical Society of London, where he was known as an effective speaker.\n\nClutterbuck was run over in the street on leaving the anniversary meeting of the [[Medical Society of London]], 8 March 1856, and died at his house, 1 Crescent, New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, on 24 April 1856. He retained his faculties to the last, and is said to have seen patients on the very day he died.\n\nA portrait of him is in the meeting-room of the Medical Society of London. He married in 1796, at Walbrook Church, Harriet Matilda, daughter of William Browne of Kirby Street, Hatton Garden, attorney-at-law, by whom he had ten children. One of his daughters, Julia, married [[James Tod]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Wheeler |chapter=Tod, James (1782\u20131835) |others=revised: Roger T.
