His father, Tsang Kai-wing, was a former football coach and player, then served in the [[Royal Hong Kong Police Force]] from 1940 to 1972. He fled to Taiwan to escape from the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] in 1976 after being convicted of corruption and sentenced to three years in jail, while still free pending an appeal. In 2001, the [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]] seized his house in [[La Salle Road]] and later auctioned it for HK$4.35 million after 10 years of civil proceedings. Tsang Kai-wing died in Taiwan in 2011 with his son Eric and other family members around him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&art_id=87094&sid=25199575&con_type=1&d_str=20090831&sear_year=2009 |title=The worst of times for Fred Ma |author=Central Station |date=31 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604134355/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&art_id=87094&sid=25199575&con_type=1&d_str=20090831&sear_year=2009 |archivedate=2011-06-04 }}</ref><ref name=SCMP19Jan11>Tsang Kai-wing dies aged 94 after 35 years as corruption fugitive, SCMP, Danny Mok, 19 Jan 2011</ref>\n\nTsang is also a cousin of former [[Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development]] [[Frederick Ma]].<ref name=SCMP19Jan11/>\n\nIn his youth, Tsang was a Hong Kong professional soccer player.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2013}}\nTsang began his showbusiness career as a [[stuntman]]. Due to his popularity, Tsang is often the [[master of ceremonies]] (MC) in events organised by the Hong Kong television network [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]], and he was nicknamed \"Prize Master\" (\u734e\u9580\u4eba\uff09.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} \n\nHe is known for being a short plump guy with a habit of speaking before thinking, often landing himself into hot water.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} His insults have led to him being assaulted by rumored [[Triad (underground society)|triad]]s over bad mouthing singer [[Joey Yung]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} As an MC in the [[Miss Chinese International Pageant]], he often favours contestants in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nNevertheless, Tsang also appeared in many successful Hong Kong films, gaining actor awards and nominations. Early on in his career, he was typecast as a bumbling, ugly, and crude sidekick, and it was not until encouragement from his daughter [[Bowie Tsang]] to stop doing comedic roles that he went on to star in a film with friend [[Alan Tam]] and was awarded a Hong Kong best actor award.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Perry Lam, a cinema critic from ''[[Muse (Hong Kong Magazine)|Muse]]'', wrote that Tsang 'brings directness, straightness and a lack of nonsense to whatever role he plays, and occasionally demonstrates an uncanny ability to enter the egoless states of which only the greatest of character actors like [[Robert Duvall]] are capable.'<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lam |first= Perry |date=April 2008  |title= 'Little big man'|journal= Muse Magazine |issue= 15 |pages= 94}}</ref>\nHe also was an occasional singer. Despite his high-pitched voice, he sings his parodies and theme songs to variety shows in a low-range tenor or high-range baritone of 2 octaves.<ref>[Eric Tsang singing Love of My Life with Alan Tam and Hacken Lee (dropped to D major key)]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTsang is a devout [[Buddhist]], often leading other actors in efforts to raise money for Hong Kong Buddhist temples and events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.qq.com/a/20070227/001431_9.htm|script-title=zh:\u7ec4\u56fe\uff1a\u5a31\u4e50\u5708\u660e\u661f\u4fe1\u4f5b\u77e5\u591a\u5c11|date=27 February 2007|work=QQ News|language=Chinese|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nTsang's best friends are [[Natalis Chan]] and [[Alan Tam]], who are also famous singers and actors from Hong Kong.  Tsang has been close friends with Tam's family since childhood as their fathers were colleagues in the police force and played football together.\n\nTsang was married two times. His first marriage was with Taiwanese actress [[Wang Mei Hua]] in 1972 and they had two daughters, [[Bowie Tsang]] and [[Tsang Wing Yee]]. Due to Tsang's sociable nature with spending more time with his friends and at work rather than at home, they divorced three years later in 1975. Wang brought their eldest daughter back to Taiwan, while their younger daughter moved to Canada.\n\nHis second marriage was with Sung Lai Wah in 1989 and they had two sons, [[Derek Tsang]] and [[Mark Tsang]]. Sung and her two sons later immigrated to Toronto, Canada without him, who chose to stay in Hong Kong and they had been living in a long-distance relationship since then.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/eric-tsangs-family-comes-second-093100958.html|title=Eric Tsang's family comes second|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-SG}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual assault allegation===\nIn December 2013, ''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'' published an anonymously-produced interview with actress [[Yammie Lam]] where she said that she had been raped by two Hong Kong entertainment industry \"big brothers\" 20 years ago. According to Lam, one of the individuals had died not long ago, while the other individual is alive. She further claims that the second individual had raped her during a film production in Singapore. However, the names of the alleged perpetrators were censored out of the audio, which generated intense media speculation. It is not known who the interviewer was; in fact, the interviewer's voice shows evidence of having been digitally manipulated from a natural female voice to a male voice.<ref>[http://www.jaynestars.com/news/yammie-nam-admits-she-was-raped-by-two-men JayneStars - Admitted Raped by entertainment \"Big Brother\"]\n</ref><ref>https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/hong-kong-eric-tsang-denies-rape-allegations-1202661112/</ref> In January 2018, a mainland Chinese journalist uploaded what purported to be an uncensored recording of Yammie Lam's 2013 interview. In the new 2018 clip, the interviewer now has a natural female voice, and the formerly censored portions implicate [[Alan Tang]] (deceased in 2011) and Eric Tsang as the two alleged rapists of Lam. Media analysts have endorsed the authenticity of the newly released video; they note that the 2018 video did not have noise removal or other post-production traces that are observed in the publicly released 2013 clip; hence, whomever leaked the video must have had direct access to the original unedited video.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-42719264 BBC China, 2018 (traditional Chinese)]</ref>\n\nTwo days after the release of the January 2018 video, the sexual offense claim against Eric Tsang was corroborated by [[Grace Han]], a talent agent who formerly headed the [[Ford Models]] agency in Asia. Han further alleged that Eric Tsang had sexually assaulted more than one woman, and claims to know of a specific incident in which a group of male Hong Kong celebrities, led by Tsang, allegedly drugged seven female models in a Hong Kong karaoke bar and raped six of them, while one girl escaped after she noticed the drugging.<ref name=\"dailynews.sina.com\">[http://dailynews.sina.com/gb/ent/chnstar/phoenixtv/20180110/18048208126.html Sina China, 2018 (simplified Chinese)]</ref><ref name=\"Variety, 2018 English\">[https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/eric-tsang-sues-sex-harassment-accuser-grace-han-1202666786/ Variety, 2018 (English)]</ref>\n\nTsang rejected the authenticity of the uploaded video and did not address Grace Han's allegation. A week after the allegations surfaced, Tsang filed a defamation lawsuit against Grace Han in the Hong Kong High Court, arranged for a press event, and announced that \"punishment\" is needed. Tsang further claimed to the media that he had already won a defamation lawsuit in 2006 on similar grounds, but independent media sources have not been able to corroborate this claim.<ref name=\"dailynews.sina.com\"/><ref name=\"Variety, 2018 English\"/>\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[The 14 Amazons]]'' (1972) (cameo)\n* ''Tie jin gang da po zi yang guan'' (1974)\n* ''[[Na Cha]]'' (1974)\n* ''Zhong tai quan tan sheng si zhan'' (1974)\n* ''[[Five Shaolin Masters]]'' (1974)\n\n* ''[[Kung Fu Stars]]'' (1975)\n* ''[[Challenge of the Masters]]'' (1976)\n* ''[[The Dragon Lives Again]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Money Crazy]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[The Iron-Fisted Monk]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[Enter the Fat Dragon]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[Warriors Two]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[By Hook or by Crook (1980 film)|By Hook or by Crook]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Bloody Tattoo]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[All the Wrong Clues]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Legend of the Owl]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[Once Upon A Rainbow]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[It Takes Two (1982 film)|It Takes Two]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Till Death Do We Scare]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[He Lives by Night]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Play Catch]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[Aces Go Places 2]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[I Love Lolanto]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Carry On Wise Guy]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Heaven Can Help]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Beloved Daddy]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Double Trouble (1984 Hong Kong film)|Double Trouble]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[My Lucky Stars]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[From the Great Beyond]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[The Thirty Million Rush]]'' (1985)\n* ''[[Why Me?

He fled to Taiwan to escape from the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (Hong Kong)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] in 1976 after being convicted of corruption and sentenced to three years in jail, while still free pending an appeal. In 2001, the [[Department of Justice (Hong Kong)|Department of Justice]] seized his house in [[La Salle Road]] and later auctioned it for HK$4.35 million after 10 years of civil proceedings. Tsang Kai-wing died in Taiwan in 2011 with his son Eric and other family members around him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&art_id=87094&sid=25199575&con_type=1&d_str=20090831&sear_year=2009 |title=The worst of times for Fred Ma |author=Central Station |date=31 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604134355/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=21&art_id=87094&sid=25199575&con_type=1&d_str=20090831&sear_year=2009 |archivedate=2011-06-04 }}</ref><ref name=SCMP19Jan11>Tsang Kai-wing dies aged 94 after 35 years as corruption fugitive, SCMP, Danny Mok, 19 Jan 2011</ref>\n\nTsang is also a cousin of former [[Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development]] [[Frederick Ma]].<ref name=SCMP19Jan11/>\n\nIn his youth, Tsang was a Hong Kong professional soccer player.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=March 2013}}\nTsang began his showbusiness career as a [[stuntman]]. Due to his popularity, Tsang is often the [[master of ceremonies]] (MC) in events organised by the Hong Kong television network [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]], and he was nicknamed \"Prize Master\" (\u734e\u9580\u4eba\uff09.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} \n\nHe is known for being a short plump guy with a habit of speaking before thinking, often landing himself into hot water.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} His insults have led to him being assaulted by rumored [[Triad (underground society)|triad]]s over bad mouthing singer [[Joey Yung]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} As an MC in the [[Miss Chinese International Pageant]], he often favours contestants in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nNevertheless, Tsang also appeared in many successful Hong Kong films, gaining actor awards and nominations. Early on in his career, he was typecast as a bumbling, ugly, and crude sidekick, and it was not until encouragement from his daughter [[Bowie Tsang]] to stop doing comedic roles that he went on to star in a film with friend [[Alan Tam]] and was awarded a Hong Kong best actor award.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Perry Lam, a cinema critic from ''[[Muse (Hong Kong Magazine)|Muse]]'', wrote that Tsang 'brings directness, straightness and a lack of nonsense to whatever role he plays, and occasionally demonstrates an uncanny ability to enter the egoless states of which only the greatest of character actors like [[Robert Duvall]] are capable.'<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lam |first= Perry |date=April 2008  |title= 'Little big man'|journal= Muse Magazine |issue= 15 |pages= 94}}</ref>\nHe also was an occasional singer. Despite his high-pitched voice, he sings his parodies and theme songs to variety shows in a low-range tenor or high-range baritone of 2 octaves.<ref>[Eric Tsang singing Love of My Life with Alan Tam and Hacken Lee (dropped to D major key)]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTsang is a devout [[Buddhist]], often leading other actors in efforts to raise money for Hong Kong Buddhist temples and events.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.qq.com/a/20070227/001431_9.htm|script-title=zh:\u7ec4\u56fe\uff1a\u5a31\u4e50\u5708\u660e\u661f\u4fe1\u4f5b\u77e5\u591a\u5c11|date=27 February 2007|work=QQ News|language=Chinese|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nTsang's best friends are [[Natalis Chan]] and [[Alan Tam]], who are also famous singers and actors from Hong Kong.  Tsang has been close friends with Tam's family since childhood as their fathers were colleagues in the police force and played football together.\n\nTsang was married two times. His first marriage was with Taiwanese actress [[Wang Mei Hua]] in 1972 and they had two daughters, [[Bowie Tsang]] and [[Tsang Wing Yee]]. Due to Tsang's sociable nature with spending more time with his friends and at work rather than at home, they divorced three years later in 1975. Wang brought their eldest daughter back to Taiwan, while their younger daughter moved to Canada.\n\nHis second marriage was with Sung Lai Wah in 1989 and they had two sons, [[Derek Tsang]] and [[Mark Tsang]]. Sung and her two sons later immigrated to Toronto, Canada without him, who chose to stay in Hong Kong and they had been living in a long-distance relationship since then.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/eric-tsangs-family-comes-second-093100958.html|title=Eric Tsang's family comes second|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-SG}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual assault allegation===\nIn December 2013, ''[[Next Magazine (Chinese magazine)|Next Magazine]]'' published an anonymously-produced interview with actress [[Yammie Lam]] where she said that she had been raped by two Hong Kong entertainment industry \"big brothers\" 20 years ago. According to Lam, one of the individuals had died not long ago, while the other individual is alive. She further claims that the second individual had raped her during a film production in Singapore. However, the names of the alleged perpetrators were censored out of the audio, which generated intense media speculation. It is not known who the interviewer was; in fact, the interviewer's voice shows evidence of having been digitally manipulated from a natural female voice to a male voice.<ref>[http://www.jaynestars.com/news/yammie-nam-admits-she-was-raped-by-two-men JayneStars - Admitted Raped by entertainment \"Big Brother\"]\n</ref><ref>https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/hong-kong-eric-tsang-denies-rape-allegations-1202661112/</ref> In January 2018, a mainland Chinese journalist uploaded what purported to be an uncensored recording of Yammie Lam's 2013 interview. In the new 2018 clip, the interviewer now has a natural female voice, and the formerly censored portions implicate [[Alan Tang]] (deceased in 2011) and Eric Tsang as the two alleged rapists of Lam. Media analysts have endorsed the authenticity of the newly released video; they note that the 2018 video did not have noise removal or other post-production traces that are observed in the publicly released 2013 clip; hence, whomever leaked the video must have had direct access to the original unedited video.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/trad/chinese-news-42719264 BBC China, 2018 (traditional Chinese)]</ref>\n\nTwo days after the release of the January 2018 video, the sexual offense claim against Eric Tsang was corroborated by [[Grace Han]], a talent agent who formerly headed the [[Ford Models]] agency in Asia. Han further alleged that Eric Tsang had sexually assaulted more than one woman, and claims to know of a specific incident in which a group of male Hong Kong celebrities, led by Tsang, allegedly drugged seven female models in a Hong Kong karaoke bar and raped six of them, while one girl escaped after she noticed the drugging.<ref name=\"dailynews.sina.com\">[http://dailynews.sina.com/gb/ent/chnstar/phoenixtv/20180110/18048208126.html Sina China, 2018 (simplified Chinese)]</ref><ref name=\"Variety, 2018 English\">[https://variety.com/2018/film/asia/eric-tsang-sues-sex-harassment-accuser-grace-han-1202666786/ Variety, 2018 (English)]</ref>\n\nTsang rejected the authenticity of the uploaded video and did not address Grace Han's allegation. A week after the allegations surfaced, Tsang filed a defamation lawsuit against Grace Han in the Hong Kong High Court, arranged for a press event, and announced that \"punishment\" is needed.
