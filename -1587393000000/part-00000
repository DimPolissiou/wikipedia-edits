Players move characters from screen to screen exploring dungeons, battling enemies, collecting items and solving puzzles. When the player's health bar is full, the player's sword will grow to tremendous sizes whenever swung. Swords in-game can be customized and leveled up to increase its length, width, as well as magical power, other special items that can also be used include [[boomerangs]], [[lanterns]], [[candles]], and [[bow (weapon)|bows]].<ref name=\"IGN Preview\"/>\n\nPlayers can create their own character model using the game's 3D sprite editor. Players are able to collect monsters to be featured in an encyclopedia which is done through beating the monster on its head with a book until its profile shows up in the encyclopedia's pages. Loading screens in-game feature recreated box arts of classic video games using the game's 3D sprites.<ref name=\"IGN Preview\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe game follows a hero on a quest to rid the Dotnia Kingdom of a dark plague caused by the forces of evil in order to restore peace to the land. Legend tells of an evil king known as the Dark King Onyx who brought tragedy and darkness to the kingdom by stealing six magical orbs. However a hero rose up against the Dark King and with his legendary sword as well as the power of the orbs, he sealed Onyx away within another orb. However, the forces of evil rose again as the Dark Bishop Fuelle stole the orb and threw the Kingdom of Dotnia into a state of chaos once more.

Players move characters from screen to screen exploring dungeons, battling enemies, collecting items and solving puzzles. When the player's health bar is full, the player's sword will grow to tremendous sizes whenever swung. Swords in-game can be customized and leveled up to increase its length, width, as well as magical power, other special items that can also be used include [[boomerangs]], [[lanterns]], [[candles]], and [[bow (weapon)|bows]].<ref name=\"IGN Preview\"/>\n\nPlayers can create their own character model using the game's 3D sprite editor. Players are able to collect monsters to be featured in an encyclopedia which is done through beating the monster on its head with a book until its profile shows up in the encyclopedia's pages. Loading screens in-game feature recreated box arts of classic video games using the game's 3D sprites.<ref name=\"IGN Preview\"/>\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe game follows a hero on a quest to rid the Dotnia Kingdom of a dark plague caused by the forces of evil in order to restore peace to the land. Legend tells of an evil king known as the Dark King Onyx who brought tragedy and darkness to the kingdom by stealing six magical orbs. However a hero rose up against the Dark King and with his legendary sword as well as the power of the orbs, he sealed Onyx away within another orb. However, the forces of evil rose again as the Dark Bishop Fuelle stole the orb and threw the Kingdom of Dotnia into a state of chaos once more. The game's main protagonist is the grandchild of the brave hero who sealed away the Dark King and thus is entrusted with the responsibility to save the land.<ref name=\"Famitsu\"/>\n\nThe kingdom was once a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Pixelation|pixelated]] world but as the King of the Land felt that [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] were outdated he thus decreed for the kingdom to make the switch to [[3D computer graphics|3D]].

Earlier, speculation suggested that Seven would launch its secondary channel around November 2009, with possible names including 7PLUS, [[PLUS7]], Channel Mate and 7TWO. Seven's then-programming chief Tim Worner stated after the reveal that some of the potential names were [[red herring (idiom)|red herrings]] to keep details of the channel a secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/10/7two-tvs-best-kept-secret.html|title=7TWO: TV\u2019s \"best kept secret\"|date=2009-10-27|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref> [[PLUS7]] and Channel Mate (as [[7mate]]) were later used for Seven's internet TV catch-up service and Seven's second digital multi-channel, respectively.\n\nThe channel launched with the airing of a promotional video called \"It's Time\", featuring Seven Network personalities and clips of shows and movies intended to be broadcast on the channel, followed by normal programming. This video was also launched on the multi-channel's website and received cross-promotion on the primary Seven channel. The Seven Network continues its policy of cross-promoting each channel's content across all three channels to this day. Seven presenters [[Tom Williams (presenter)|Tom Williams]] and [[Johanna Griggs]] initially served as the \"face\" of the channel and were seen presenting 7TWO's Friday and Sunday night lifestyle line-ups in early 2011.\n\nThe channel did not launch on the same day to many regional areas. 7TWO was launched for [[Southern Cross Television]] viewers in Tasmania and Darwin on 1 December 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/12/7two-for-tassie-darwin-one-for-mildura.html|title=7TWO for Tassie / Darwin, ONE for Mildura.|date=2009-12-01|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref> and for [[Prime Television]] viewers in Regional Victoria, Northern & Southern NSW and the ACT on 23 December 2009 from 9{{nbsp}}am. From launch, Prime broadcast the channel as '7TWO on Prime'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/12/7two-to-launch-on-prime.html|title=7TWO to launch on Prime|date=2009-12-22|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2011, regional broadcaster Prime Television changed the name of its primary channel to 'Prime7', to reflect its strong relationship with its metropolitan partner, Seven. This led to Prime's transmission of 7TWO being rebranded as simply 7TWO, like the metropolitan counterpart.\n\n==Programming==\nFrom launch, premiere seasons of previous Seven shows including ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' were broadcast, along with a mix of other new and classic programming along with movies sourced from [[Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group|Disney]].<ref name=tvt1>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/10/7two-to-launch-november-1st.html|title=7TWO to launch November 1st|date=2009-10-23|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref>\n \nPrime-time programs used to screen under themed nightly blocks such as 'Action Time' and 'Movie Time', however these disappeared as the focus of the channel changed in 2010. The revised channel included 'Best of British' content such as thrice-weekly British murder/mystery (''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' and ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''), British comedy (''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''), and British lifestyle (''[[Escape to the Country]]'' and ''[[Bargain Hunt]]''). The launch of male-skewing sister channel [[7mate]] in September 2010 led to a number of programs moving across from Seven's already existing channels, including 7TWO, to the new channel. 7TWO's target audience was also refined to people 55-plus. Programs that made the move from 7TWO included ''[[Air Crash Investigations]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA: On Fire]]'', ''[[Whacked Out Sports]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[AFL Game Day]]'', ''[[Gary Unmarried]]'', ''[[Club Reps]]'', ''[[Fifth Gear]]'', ''[[Monster Garage]]'', and ''[[The Sopranos]]''.\n\nThe weekday daytime schedule has seen numerous changes since launch as channel executives tried to find the right mix with viewers. At launch, 'Kid's Time' broadcast a block of children's programs each morning such as ''[[Count Duckula]]'', and ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'', soap operas aired in the early afternoon and 'Kitchen Time' featured in the late afternoons with ''[[Essence of Emeril]]'' and ''[[Martha (TV series)|The Martha Stewart Show]]'' among the programs broadcast. In 2010, soap operas including ''[[Shortland Street]]'', ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and, briefly, ''[[Emmerdale]]'' and ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' joined classic Australian soap ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' and early years of ''[[Home and Away]]'' into its mid-morning schedule along with early episodes of quiz show ''[[Deal or No Deal (Australian game show)|Deal Or No Deal]]''. In early afternoon, a mix of repeated fare such as ''[[Mistresses (2008 TV series)|Mistresses]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Doctor Finlay]]'', and movies from the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] library are shown. Occasionally, shows which first aired the previous night on the main Seven channel are encored on 7TWO during the day. While initially, dramas such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' were encored, more recently this has remained true only for Seven's local reality shows such as ''[[The X Factor (Australia)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[My Kitchen Rules]]''. An early morning weekly omnibus of the previous week's new episodes of ''[[Home and Away]]'' airs on Sundays.\n\nIn 2012, the [[Seven Network]] introduced new weekday morning blocks of children's programming to air both 7TWO and [[7mate]]. Branded as ''Total Girl'', the 7TWO block featured female-skewing [[Disney-ABC|Disney]] series such as ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' and ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'', while the 7mate block aired male-skewing programs branded as ''K-Zone''.<ref name=\"Total Girl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/02/new-kids-line-up-coming-to-7two-and-7mate.html|title=New Kids line-up coming to 7TWO and 7mate|date=23 February 2012|access-date=13 June 2017|first=David|last=Knox|work=[[TV Tonight]]}}</ref> ''[[Saturday Disney]]'' aired on 7TWO from 2012 to 2016, for two hours of its weekly episode.<ref name=\"SaturdayDisney\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/03/saturday-disney-moving-to-7two.html|title=Saturday Disney moving to 7TWO|date=23 March 2012|access-date=13 June 2017|first=David|last=Knox|work=[[TV Tonight]]}}</ref> From January 1 2013 - April 24 2020, local Australian children's programs from the Seven Network were moved to air weekdays on 7TWO.

breaks after their original broadcast on the main Seven channel. These were all produced in Seven's Sydney news studio and hosted by either newsreader [[Chris Bath]] or [[Mark Ferguson]].\n\nOn 5 August 2013, a national news bulletin began airing on 7TWO, titled ''Seven News at 7'', airing at 7:00{{nbsp}}pm Monday to Friday. It was presented by [[Melissa Doyle]], with [[David Brown (meteorologist)|David Brown]] on weather.<ref>[http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/08/seven-launches-7two-news-bulletin-tonight.html Seven launches 7TWO News bulletin tonight], ''TV Tonight'', 5 August 2013</ref> Many months after the Nine Network's rival 7{{nbsp}}pm bulletin on GEM had ended, 7TWO aired their last ''Seven News At 7'' bulletin on 2 May 2014.\n\n===Sport===\n7TWO televised live coverage of tennis tournament [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for the first time in 2011, first going to air at 8:30{{nbsp}}pm AEST on 7TWO whilst the primary channel continued normal programming before switching over to Seven at around 10.30{{nbsp}}pm.

This allowed Seven's main channel to continue with normal programming. Between 2015 and 2018, 7TWO started providing secondary coverage of the Australian Open for the first week.\n\nFurther sports coverage on 7TWO includes Horse Racing.\n\nIn 2010, 7TWO broadcast classic [[Australian Football League|AFL]] and Australian Open tennis matches from the Seven archives between midnight and dawn.\n\nIn August 2016, 7TWO broadcast the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] from Rio de Janeiro in September.\n\n==Availability==\n7TWO is available in [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] digital in metropolitan areas and regional [[Queensland]] through Seven Network [[owned-and-operated station]]s including [[ATN]] Sydney, [[HSV (TV station)|HSV]] [[Melbourne]], [[BTQ]] [[Brisbane]], [[SAS (TV station)|SAS]] [[Adelaide]], [[TVW]] [[Perth]] and [[STQ]] [[Queensland]].

channel was officially announced by the Seven Network on its breakfast program, [[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]], at 7:45{{nbsp}}am AEDT 23 October 2009. Earlier, speculation suggested that Seven would launch its secondary channel around November 2009, with possible names including 7PLUS, [[PLUS7]], Channel Mate and 7TWO. Seven's then-programming chief Tim Worner stated after the reveal that some of the potential names were [[red herring (idiom)|red herrings]] to keep details of the channel a secret.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/10/7two-tvs-best-kept-secret.html|title=7TWO: TV\u2019s \"best kept secret\"|date=2009-10-27|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref> [[PLUS7]] and Channel Mate (as [[7mate]]) were later used for Seven's internet TV catch-up service and Seven's second digital multi-channel, respectively.\n\nThe channel launched with the airing of a promotional video called \"It's Time\", featuring Seven Network personalities and clips of shows and movies intended to be broadcast on the channel, followed by normal programming. This video was also launched on the multi-channel's website and received cross-promotion on the primary Seven channel. The Seven Network continues its policy of cross-promoting each channel's content across all three channels to this day. Seven presenters [[Tom Williams (presenter)|Tom Williams]] and [[Johanna Griggs]] initially served as the \"face\" of the channel and were seen presenting 7TWO's Friday and Sunday night lifestyle line-ups in early 2011.\n\nThe channel did not launch on the same day to many regional areas. 7TWO was launched for [[Southern Cross Television]] viewers in Tasmania and Darwin on 1 December 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/12/7two-for-tassie-darwin-one-for-mildura.html|title=7TWO for Tassie / Darwin, ONE for Mildura.|date=2009-12-01|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref> and for [[Prime Television]] viewers in Regional Victoria, Northern & Southern NSW and the ACT on 23 December 2009 from 9{{nbsp}}am. From launch, Prime broadcast the channel as '7TWO on Prime'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/12/7two-to-launch-on-prime.html|title=7TWO to launch on Prime|date=2009-12-22|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2011, regional broadcaster Prime Television changed the name of its primary channel to 'Prime7', to reflect its strong relationship with its metropolitan partner, Seven. This led to Prime's transmission of 7TWO being rebranded as simply 7TWO, like the metropolitan counterpart.\n\n==Programming==\nFrom launch, premiere seasons of previous Seven shows including ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' and ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' were broadcast, along with a mix of other new and classic programming along with movies sourced from [[Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group|Disney]].<ref name=tvt1>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2009/10/7two-to-launch-november-1st.html|title=7TWO to launch November 1st|date=2009-10-23|first=David|last=Knox|website=tvtonight.com.au|url-status=live}}</ref>\n \nPrime-time programs used to screen under themed nightly blocks such as 'Action Time' and 'Movie Time', however these disappeared as the focus of the channel changed in 2010. The revised channel included 'Best of British' content such as thrice-weekly British murder/mystery (''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' and ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''), British comedy (''[[Are You Being Served?]]'' and ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''), and British lifestyle (''[[Escape to the Country]]'' and ''[[Bargain Hunt]]''). The launch of male-skewing sister channel [[7mate]] in September 2010 led to a number of programs moving across from Seven's already existing channels, including 7TWO, to the new channel. 7TWO's target audience was also refined to people 55-plus. Programs that made the move from 7TWO included ''[[Air Crash Investigations]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''[[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA: On Fire]]'', ''[[Whacked Out Sports]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Last Comic Standing]]'', ''[[That '70s Show]]'', ''[[AFL Game Day]]'', ''[[Gary Unmarried]]'', ''[[Club Reps]]'', ''[[Fifth Gear]]'', ''[[Monster Garage]]'', and ''[[The Sopranos]]''.\n\nThe weekday daytime schedule has seen numerous changes since launch as channel executives tried to find the right mix with viewers. At launch, 'Kid's Time' broadcast a block of children's programs each morning such as ''[[Count Duckula]]'', and ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]'', soap operas aired in the early afternoon and 'Kitchen Time' featured in the late afternoons with ''[[Essence of Emeril]]'' and ''[[Martha (TV series)|The Martha Stewart Show]]'' among the programs broadcast. In 2010, soap operas including ''[[Shortland Street]]'', ''[[Coronation Street]]'' and, briefly, ''[[Emmerdale]]'' and ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' joined classic Australian soap ''[[Sons and Daughters (Australian TV series)|Sons and Daughters]]'' and early years of ''[[Home and Away]]'' into its mid-morning schedule along with early episodes of quiz show ''[[Deal or No Deal (Australian game show)|Deal Or No Deal]]''. In early afternoon, a mix of repeated fare such as ''[[Mistresses (2008 TV series)|Mistresses]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Doctor Finlay]]'', and movies from the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] library are shown. Occasionally, shows which first aired the previous night on the main Seven channel are encored on 7TWO during the day. While initially, dramas such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' were encored, more recently this has remained true only for Seven's local reality shows such as ''[[The X Factor (Australia)|The X Factor]]'' and ''[[My Kitchen Rules]]''. An early morning weekly omnibus of the previous week's new episodes of ''[[Home and Away]]'' airs on Sundays.\n\nIn 2012, the [[Seven Network]] introduced new weekday morning blocks of children's programming to air both 7TWO and [[7mate]]. Branded as ''Total Girl'', the 7TWO block featured female-skewing [[Disney-ABC|Disney]] series such as ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]'' and ''[[Good Luck Charlie]]'', while the 7mate block aired male-skewing programs branded as ''K-Zone''.<ref name=\"Total Girl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/02/new-kids-line-up-coming-to-7two-and-7mate.html|title=New Kids line-up coming to 7TWO and 7mate|date=23 February 2012|access-date=13 June 2017|first=David|last=Knox|work=[[TV Tonight]]}}</ref> ''[[Saturday Disney]]'' aired on 7TWO from 2012 to 2016, for two hours of its weekly episode.<ref name=\"SaturdayDisney\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/03/saturday-disney-moving-to-7two.html|title=Saturday Disney moving to 7TWO|date=23 March 2012|access-date=13 June 2017|first=David|last=Knox|work=[[TV Tonight]]}}</ref> From 2013 onwards, local Australian children's programs from the Seven Network were moved to air weekdays on 7TWO.

In 2011, following 9Go!'s ratings share success (for digital channels) in 2010, 7TWO has stolen their crown as the number one multi-channel and the number one most-watched multichannel of the decade and century in Australia.\n\n===Current programming===\n====Documentary====\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[Air Crash Investigations]]'' (shared with Seven and [[7mate]])\n* ''Coastwatch NZ''\n* ''[[Cities of the Underworld]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[I Shouldn't Be Alive]]'' (repeats)\n* ''This Rugged Coast'' (repeats)\n{{colend}}\n\n====Drama====\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[A Place to Call Home (TV series)|A Place to Call Home]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[A Touch of Frost (TV series)|A Touch of Frost]]''\n* ''[[Body of Proof]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Cold Case]]''\n* ''[[Doc Martin]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Father Brown (2013 TV series)|Father Brown]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Foyle's War]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[The Indian Doctor]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Inspector George Gently]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[The Inspector Lynley Mysteries]] '' (repeats)\n* ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Judge John Deed]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[The Last Detective]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]] ''\n* ''[[Rosemary & Thyme]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Without a Trace]]''\n* ''[[Wire in the Blood]]'' (repeats)\n{{colend}}\n\n====Game shows====\n* ''[[Million Dollar Minute]]'' (repeats)\n*''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase UK]]''\n\n====Lifestyle====\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[60 Minute Makeover]]''\n* ''[[Auction Squad]]''\n* ''[[Bargain Hunt]]''\n* ''Best Houses Australia''\n* ''Best House on the Street'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (TV series)|Better Homes and Gardens]]''\n* ''[[Creek to Coast]]''\n* ''Escape to the Continent''\n* ''[[Escape to the Country]]''\n* ''[[The Great South East]]''\n* ''[[Harry's Practice]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Homes Under the Hammer]]''\n* ''The Lucky Country''\n* ''[[Melbourne Weekender]]'' (repeats)\n* ''[[Mighty Cruise Ships]]''\n* ''[[Selling Houses Australia]]''\n* ''[[Queensland Weekender]]''\n* ''[[Sydney Weekender]]''\n* ''[[WA Weekender]]''\n{{colend}}\n\n====Lottery====\n{{Div col}}\n* '' Monday Lotto\n* ''Oz Lotto Tuesday\n* '' Wednesday Lotto\n* '' Powerball Thursday\n* '' Saturday Lotto \n{{colend}}\n\n====News====\n* ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|NBC Today]]'' (moved from [[7mate]])\n* ''[[Meet the Press|NBC Meet the Press]]'' (moved from [[7mate]])\n\n====Reality====\n* ''[[RSPCA Animal Rescue]]'' (repeats)\n\n====Religious====\n* ''Amazing Facts''\n* ''[[David Jeremiah]]''\n* ''[[It Is Written]]''\n* ''Michael Youssef''\n\n====Sport====\n* ''Horse Racing on Seven''\n* ''[[Seven Network Olympic broadcasts|Olympics on Seven]]''\n* ''Paralympics on Seven''\n* ''[[Premier League]]''\n* '' Wimbledon Tennis ''\n\n===Former programming===\n\n====Adult animation====\n* ''[[King of the Hill]]'' (moved to [[Eleven (Australian TV channel)|Eleven]])\n\n====Children's====\n{{Div col}}\n* ''[[A.T.O.M.

This allowed Seven's main channel to continue with normal programming. Between 2015 and 2018, 7TWO started providing secondary coverage of the Australian Open for the first week.\n\nFurther sports coverage on 7TWO includes Horse Racing.\n\nIn 2010, 7TWO broadcast classic [[Australian Football League|AFL]] and Australian Open tennis matches from the Seven archives between midnight and dawn.\n\nIn August 2016, 7TWO broadcast the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] from Rio de Janeiro in September.\n\n==Availability==\n7TWO is available in [[Standard-definition television|standard definition]] digital in metropolitan areas and regional [[Queensland]] through Seven Network [[owned-and-operated station]]s including [[ATN]] Sydney, [[HSV (TV station)|HSV]] [[Melbourne]], [[BTQ]] [[Brisbane]], [[SAS (TV station)|SAS]] [[Adelaide]], [[TVW]] [[Perth]] and [[STQ]] [[Queensland]].

It has been an incorporated entity in Japan since 1940 under the name Kobukai Foundation (\u8ca1\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba\u7687\u6b66\u4f1a Zaidan Hojin Kobukan), then re-registered under the name \"Aikikai\" after the ban on Aikido practice was lifted by the GHQ in 1948. It is headed by the doshu, the living successor of the founder of aikido. In its name, ''Kai'' (\u4f1a) simply means assembly or club.<ref name=\"dict\"/>\n\nThe Aikikai Foundation operates  [[Aikikai#Hombu dojo|Hombu dojo]], which is also named Aikido World Headquarters. It is sometimes called the Aikikai Hombu to distinguish it from the headquarters of later aikido organisations. It is located in [[Tokyo]]. The term \"Hombu\" may sometimes be [[Metonym|used loosely]] to refer to the upper echelons of instructors at Hombu dojo, or to the Aikikai Foundation itself.\n\nThe Aikikai Foundation also currently manages one satellite dojo, the historical [[Iwama dojo]] in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] (about 100&nbsp;km northeast of Tokyo).<ref>[http://www13.big.or.jp/~aikikai/ Ibaraki branch dojo] main website.</ref>\n\nThe Aikikai Foundation sends instructors around Japan on a continual basis.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/> It also issues certificates of grading and instructor titles legitimated by the Doshu throughout the world.\nIn April 2012, the Aikikai Foundation became \"Public Interest Incorporated Associations (Japan)\"\n\n== ''D\u014dshu'' ==\n {{multiple image\n   | width     = 100\n   | footer    = ''D\u014dshu'' of Aikido\n   | image1    =\n   | alt1      = ''O-sensei''\n   | caption1  = Ueshiba Morihei\n   | image2    =\n   | alt2      = Second Doshu\n   | caption2  = Ueshiba Kisshomaru\n   | image3    =\n   | alt3      = Present Doshu\n   | caption3  = Ueshiba Moriteru\n  }}\n\n''D\u014dshu'' (\u9053\u4e3b / \u3069\u3046\u3057\u3085) literally translates as 'Master of the Way'. It is the title denoting the head of the Aikikai. Although the same term could be used as a title within other disciplines, in Japanese its most common meaning is specific to the Aikikai Foundation.<ref name=\"dict\"/>\n\nThe system of having the heir of a [[martial arts]] school be the previous headmaster's son (either natural or adopted for the sake of succession) was common in ''[[kory\u016b]]'' (traditional schools) and such heirs often are referred to as ''[[iemoto]]''. Other arts commonly use the title [[S\u014dke]] for the headmaster.\n \n*Founder (\u958b\u7956 ''Kaiso'') [[Morihei Ueshiba]] (lived 1883-1969) originated the art of Aikido. As such he was also the first ''d\u014dshu'', but is more commonly referred to as ''O-sensei'' (grand teacher).\n*Second ''d\u014dshu'' (\u4e8c\u4ee3\u9053\u4e3b) [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]] (lived 1921\u20131999) took over the leadership of the organisation and assumed the title of ''d\u014dshu'' in 1969 upon the death of his father Morihei Ueshiba. Kisshomaru was the first person in aikido to be widely referred to as ''d\u014dshu''. He was succeeded by his son Moriteru.\n*Third ''d\u014dshu'' (\u4e09\u4ee3\u9053\u4e3b) [[Moriteru Ueshiba]] (born 1951) is the current ''d\u014dshu''. He is grandson of the founder of aikido and assumed the title of ''d\u014dshu'' in 1999.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nMoriteru is expected to be succeeded as doshu by his son, [[Mitsuteru Ueshiba]] (born 1981), who is currently referred to as \"Waka(\u82e5) Sensei\".\n\n== ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' ==\n{{coord|35|41|56.9|N|139|42|51.5|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n[[File:Aikidohombu.jpg|thumb|left|Aikikai ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'']]\nThe ''Hombu [[D\u014dj\u014d]]'' in [[Tokyo]] is the headquarters of the Aikikai.\n\nThe ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' is officially named Aikido World Headquarters, and is entirely operated by the Aikikai Foundation.  It is sometimes called the Aikikai Hombu to distinguish it from the headquarters of later aikido organisations. ''Hombu'' (\u672c\u90e8) is a common word meaning \"headquarters\".\n\n''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' has about 30 instructors, and most are [[shihan]]. The instructors include the Doshu and [[Hiroshi Tada]] 9th dan.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nThe location of ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' is in Wakamatsu-cho, [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]], Tokyo, [[Japan]]. (This same location was formerly the [[Ushigome]] District of Shinjuku.)<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nThe ''d\u014dj\u014d'' was established in April 1931 by the founder of Aikido. It was originally named ''Kobukan D\u014dj\u014d'' ({{linktext|\u7687|\u6b66|\u9928|\u9053|\u5834}}, imperial warrior training hall) but was called ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' after [[World War II]].\n<ref>[http://www.aikidofaq.com/history/osensei.html History of Aikido], Aikido FAQ.</ref>\n\nIn 1967 the original single-story wooden structure was replaced by a five-story modern building. Training takes place in three rooms which total about 250 [[tatami]] in area.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/> The main training area has 105 tatami mats (170m<sup>2</sup>). The other two training areas, containing 72 and 42 tatami mats respectively, are often used for beginner's classes, children's classes, women's classes, or fixed term and enrollment \"academy\" (''Gakko'') courses.\n\nClasses are held seven days a week. Beginner's and regular classes are open to all Aikido practitioners that are or become Aikikai members.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\n== Aikikai school of Aikido ==\n[[File:Aikido keyhole.jpg|thumb|''D\u014dshu'' demonstrating Aikido to students from around the globe, at the IAF Congress in [[Tanabe, Wakayama|Tanabe]] (birth town of \u014csensei)]]\nWithin Japan, there are about 1800 other training locations affiliated with the Hombu. These are united under the All-Japan Aikido Federation.\n<ref>[http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/organization0.htm Organisation diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517202950/http://aikikai.or.jp/jpn/organization0.htm |date=2011-05-17 }} (Japanese), Aikikai Foundation. Note: page may not work in Firefox.</ref>\n\nOverseas, there are about 100 foreign aikido organisations recognised by the Hombu. These are ostensibly national aikido organisations that each represent many dojos and many students. The gradings of students in these organisations are codified specifically by the Hombu. (The Hombu has procedures for examinations and recommendations of aikido grades and instructor titles, and ideally this ensures a degree of international consistency and serves to prevent local instructors from boastfully exaggerating their own ranks.) However, regardless of recognition, all foreign aikido groups remain organisationally independent from the Aikikai Foundation.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nThe students of recognised dojo worldwide are loosely referred to collectively as the Aikikai school of aikido, although this \"school\" is not an official organisation. Their aikido technique may be referred to as Aikikai style, although this encompasses a wider spectrum of technical styles characteristically than later (and smaller) schools of aikido.\n\n== International Aikido Federation ==\n[[File:IAF-logo.gif|thumb|100px|International Aikido Federation logo]]\nThe [[International Aikido Federation]] was formed in 1976 to serve as the primary global aikido organisation. It is an [[umbrella organisation]] with member organisations from more than 40 nations (for example, the All-Japan Aikido Federation is one member). All members must be recognised by the Hombu, so the IAF exclusively represents the Aikikai school. The IAF is a nominally democratic organisation but special roles are given to the Doshu and a council of senior instructors, to safeguard the \"technical and moral\" integrity of aikido. The IAF currently admits only one member organisation per country and gives each such member equal vote (it was modelled on the [[United Nations|UN]]; it does not necessarily give every Aikikai student equal representation).\n\n== Aikikai style of aikido ==\nAikikai is not one style of aikido but instead encompasses a diversity of technical styles. This is associated with the broad base of first generation instructors, who each had their own interpretation of the art, and other influences. Nonetheless Aikikai is often described as a style for comparison with separate aikido organisations. Aikikai is described as the most traditional; Aikikai has stayed loyal to the Ueshiba house and is sometimes called Ueshiba Aikido. It has retained many of the aspects which Morihei Ueshiba valued, such as the non-competitive training system (as contrasted with [[Kenji Tomiki|Tomiki's]] development). Spiritual interpretations are not emphasised compared to in [[Ki Society]].\n\nMorihei Ueshiba's own style evolved significantly over his lifetime. The pre-[[World War II|war]] ''aikibudo'' techniques taught by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] were  generally closer to [[aikijujutsu]] whilst flowing technique was more emphasised as he became older, and this is reflected in the aikido of people who studied at different periods in time.\n\n [[Seiseki Abe]] said: <blockquote>\"As far as the Aikido [O-Sensei] practiced in his later years, even young girls, old people and children could do [the techniques]. That is a big difference. I suppose you could say that it was a difference in the severity or the strictness of the training. Before the war, it was severity and strong technique, as opposed to the (kind of) techniques that invigorate our partners as we have now.\"<ref>[http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=151 Interview with Seiseki Abe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095151/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=151 |date=2011-06-05 }} by Stanley Pranin (February 1982)</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Kazuo Chiba]] has implied that the style of training in Hombu concentrated less on physical rigor because of its demographic: <blockquote>\"A large portion of the membership at [[Iwama Dojo]] consisted of local farmers, hard workers who spent all day in the fields.

It is represented globally through the [[Aikikai#International Aikido Federation|International Aikido Federation]].\n\n== Aikikai Foundation ==\nThe {{Nihongo|'''Aikikai Foundation'''|\u8ca1\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba\u5408\u6c17\u4f1a|Zaidan H\u014djin Aikikai}} is the original aikido organization. It has been an incorporated entity in Japan since 1940 under the name Kobukai Foundation (\u8ca1\u56e3\u6cd5\u4eba\u7687\u6b66\u4f1a Zaidan Hojin Kobukan), then re-registered under the name \"Aikikai\" after the ban on Aikido practice was lifted by the GHQ in 1948. It is headed by the doshu, the living successor of the founder of aikido. In its name, ''Kai'' (\u4f1a) simply means assembly or club.<ref name=\"dict\"/>\n\nThe Aikikai Foundation operates  [[Aikikai#Hombu dojo|Hombu dojo]], which is also named Aikido World Headquarters. It is sometimes called the Aikikai Hombu to distinguish it from the headquarters of later aikido organisations. It is located in [[Tokyo]]. The term \"Hombu\" may sometimes be [[Metonym|used loosely]] to refer to the upper echelons of instructors at Hombu dojo, or to the Aikikai Foundation itself.\n\nThe Aikikai Foundation also currently manages one satellite dojo, the historical [[Iwama dojo]] in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] (about 100&nbsp;km northeast of Tokyo).<ref>[http://www13.big.or.jp/~aikikai/ Ibaraki branch dojo] main website.</ref>\n\nThe Aikikai Foundation sends instructors around Japan on a continual basis.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/> It also issues certificates of grading and instructor titles legitimated by the Doshu throughout the world.\n\n== ''D\u014dshu'' ==\n {{multiple image\n   | width     = 100\n   | footer    = ''D\u014dshu'' of Aikido\n   | image1    =\n   | alt1      = ''O-sensei''\n   | caption1  = Ueshiba Morihei\n   | image2    =\n   | alt2      = Second Doshu\n   | caption2  = Ueshiba Kisshomaru\n   | image3    =\n   | alt3      = Present Doshu\n   | caption3  = Ueshiba Moriteru\n  }}\n\n''D\u014dshu'' (\u9053\u4e3b / \u3069\u3046\u3057\u3085) literally translates as 'Master of the Way'. It is the title denoting the head of the Aikikai. Although the same term could be used as a title within other disciplines, in Japanese its most common meaning is specific to the Aikikai Foundation.<ref name=\"dict\"/>\n\nThe system of having the heir of a [[martial arts]] school be the previous headmaster's son (either natural or adopted for the sake of succession) was common in ''[[kory\u016b]]'' (traditional schools) and such heirs often are referred to as ''[[iemoto]]''. Other arts commonly use the title [[S\u014dke]] for the headmaster.\n \n*Founder (\u958b\u7956 ''Kaiso'') [[Morihei Ueshiba]] (lived 1883-1969) originated the art of Aikido. As such he was also the first ''d\u014dshu'', but is more commonly referred to as ''O-sensei'' (grand teacher).\n*Second ''d\u014dshu'' (\u4e8c\u4ee3\u9053\u4e3b) [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]] (lived 1921\u20131999) took over the leadership of the organisation and assumed the title of ''d\u014dshu'' in 1969 upon the death of his father Morihei Ueshiba. Kisshomaru was the first person in aikido to be widely referred to as ''d\u014dshu''. He was succeeded by his son Moriteru.\n*Third ''d\u014dshu'' (\u4e09\u4ee3\u9053\u4e3b) [[Moriteru Ueshiba]] (born 1951) is the current ''d\u014dshu''. He is grandson of the founder of aikido and assumed the title of ''d\u014dshu'' in 1999.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nMoriteru is expected to be succeeded as doshu by his son, [[Mitsuteru Ueshiba]] (born 1981), who is currently referred to as \"Waka(\u82e5) Sensei\".\n\n== ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' ==\n{{coord|35|41|56.9|N|139|42|51.5|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n[[File:Aikidohombu.jpg|thumb|left|Aikikai ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'']]\nThe ''Hombu [[D\u014dj\u014d]]'' in [[Tokyo]] is the headquarters of the Aikikai.\n\nThe ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' is officially named Aikido World Headquarters, and is entirely operated by the Aikikai Foundation.  It is sometimes called the Aikikai Hombu to distinguish it from the headquarters of later aikido organisations. ''Hombu'' (\u672c\u90e8) is a common word meaning \"headquarters\".\n\n''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' has about 30 instructors, and most are [[shihan]]. The instructors include the Doshu and [[Hiroshi Tada]] 9th dan.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nThe location of ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' is in Wakamatsu-cho, [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]], Tokyo, [[Japan]]. (This same location was formerly the [[Ushigome]] District of Shinjuku.)<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nThe ''d\u014dj\u014d'' was established in April 1931 by the founder of Aikido. It was originally named ''Kobukan D\u014dj\u014d'' ({{linktext|\u7687|\u6b66|\u9928|\u9053|\u5834}}, imperial warrior training hall) but was called ''Hombu D\u014dj\u014d'' after [[World War II]].\n<ref>[http://www.aikidofaq.com/history/osensei.html History of Aikido], Aikido FAQ.</ref>\n\nIn 1967 the original single-story wooden structure was replaced by a five-story modern building. Training takes place in three rooms which total about 250 [[tatami]] in area.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/> The main training area has 105 tatami mats (170m<sup>2</sup>). The other two training areas, containing 72 and 42 tatami mats respectively, are often used for beginner's classes, children's classes, women's classes, or fixed term and enrollment \"academy\" (''Gakko'') courses.\n\nClasses are held seven days a week. Beginner's and regular classes are open to all Aikido practitioners that are or become Aikikai members.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\n== Aikikai school of Aikido ==\n[[File:Aikido keyhole.jpg|thumb|''D\u014dshu'' demonstrating Aikido to students from around the globe, at the IAF Congress in [[Tanabe, Wakayama|Tanabe]] (birth town of \u014csensei)]]\nWithin Japan, there are about 1800 other training locations affiliated with the Hombu. These are united under the All-Japan Aikido Federation.\n<ref>[http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/organization0.htm Organisation diagram] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517202950/http://aikikai.or.jp/jpn/organization0.htm |date=2011-05-17 }} (Japanese), Aikikai Foundation. Note: page may not work in Firefox.</ref>\n\nOverseas, there are about 100 foreign aikido organisations recognised by the Hombu. These are ostensibly national aikido organisations that each represent many dojos and many students. The gradings of students in these organisations are codified specifically by the Hombu. (The Hombu has procedures for examinations and recommendations of aikido grades and instructor titles, and ideally this ensures a degree of international consistency and serves to prevent local instructors from boastfully exaggerating their own ranks.) However, regardless of recognition, all foreign aikido groups remain organisationally independent from the Aikikai Foundation.<ref name=\"aikikai\"/>\n\nThe students of recognised dojo worldwide are loosely referred to collectively as the Aikikai school of aikido, although this \"school\" is not an official organisation. Their aikido technique may be referred to as Aikikai style, although this encompasses a wider spectrum of technical styles characteristically than later (and smaller) schools of aikido.\n\n== International Aikido Federation ==\n[[File:IAF-logo.gif|thumb|100px|International Aikido Federation logo]]\nThe [[International Aikido Federation]] was formed in 1976 to serve as the primary global aikido organisation. It is an [[umbrella organisation]] with member organisations from more than 40 nations (for example, the All-Japan Aikido Federation is one member). All members must be recognised by the Hombu, so the IAF exclusively represents the Aikikai school. The IAF is a nominally democratic organisation but special roles are given to the Doshu and a council of senior instructors, to safeguard the \"technical and moral\" integrity of aikido. The IAF currently admits only one member organisation per country and gives each such member equal vote (it was modelled on the [[United Nations|UN]]; it does not necessarily give every Aikikai student equal representation).\n\n== Aikikai style of aikido ==\nAikikai is not one style of aikido but instead encompasses a diversity of technical styles. This is associated with the broad base of first generation instructors, who each had their own interpretation of the art, and other influences. Nonetheless Aikikai is often described as a style for comparison with separate aikido organisations. Aikikai is described as the most traditional; Aikikai has stayed loyal to the Ueshiba house and is sometimes called Ueshiba Aikido. It has retained many of the aspects which Morihei Ueshiba valued, such as the non-competitive training system (as contrasted with [[Kenji Tomiki|Tomiki's]] development). Spiritual interpretations are not emphasised compared to in [[Ki Society]].\n\nMorihei Ueshiba's own style evolved significantly over his lifetime. The pre-[[World War II|war]] ''aikibudo'' techniques taught by [[Morihei Ueshiba]] were  generally closer to [[aikijujutsu]] whilst flowing technique was more emphasised as he became older, and this is reflected in the aikido of people who studied at different periods in time.\n\n [[Seiseki Abe]] said: <blockquote>\"As far as the Aikido [O-Sensei] practiced in his later years, even young girls, old people and children could do [the techniques]. That is a big difference. I suppose you could say that it was a difference in the severity or the strictness of the training. Before the war, it was severity and strong technique, as opposed to the (kind of) techniques that invigorate our partners as we have now.\"<ref>[http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=151 Interview with Seiseki Abe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095151/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=151 |date=2011-06-05 }} by Stanley Pranin (February 1982)</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Kazuo Chiba]] has implied that the style of training in Hombu concentrated less on physical rigor because of its demographic: <blockquote>\"A large portion of the membership at [[Iwama Dojo]] consisted of local farmers, hard workers who spent all day in the fields. They had thick bones and great physical strength, combined with a peculiar local character known as \"Mito kishitsu,\" a type of manliness close to gallantry.\nAltogether, it was quite an opposite culture from Hombu Dojo in Tokyo. Because it is in the capital of Japan, Hombu\u2019s membership consists of white-collar workers, intellectuals, businessmen, politicians and university students.\"<ref>T.K.

Despite falling in love and having a son, Caladrius is unable to make peace with his memories, and so ventures into the world to discover how his family was destroyed \u2013 and why. He learns his true name: he is [[Griffin]] Tormalyne from the house of [[Griffin]], which was crushed by Arioso Pellior, the patriarch of the house of [[Basilisk]] and tyrant of the city of Berylon.\n\nIn Berylon, Caladrius enters Pellior's house as a music teacher for Pellior's decidedly un-musical daughter. As Griffin tutors Damiet Pellior for an upcoming opera, the city's musicians hatch their own plots. Armed with his picochet{{not a typo}}, a single-stringed instrument played by peasants, and a small bone pipe, Griffin challenges the Basilisk and exacts his revenge. But his revenge is not complete. Arioso Pellior is stricken, but not dead. Pellior names his other daughter, Luna, a powerful magician who has been his apprentice all her life, as his heir. Unexpectedly, Luna declares that thirty-seven years of torturing Tourmalyne House are enough. Hearing this, her father dies of anger. Luna begins to help Caladrius restore Tormalyne House.\n\n==Nominations==\n*1999 [[Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature]] Finalist\n\n==See also==\n* [[Basilisk]]\n* [[Griffin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Patricia A.
