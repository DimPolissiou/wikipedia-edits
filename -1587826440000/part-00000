The Longhorns played their home games at [[Darrell K Royal\u2013Texas Memorial Stadium]] in [[Austin, Texas]], and competed as members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. They were led by second-year head coach [[Tom Herman (American football)|Tom Herman]].\n\nTexas, coming off a 7\u20136 season in Herman's first year, began the year ranked 23rd in the preseason [[AP Poll]].

The team won its next six games, including a dramatic win over No. 7 [[2018 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] in the 113th [[Red River Showdown]]. The Longhorns rose as high as sixth in the AP Poll, but fell in consecutive weeks to [[2018 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] and [[2018 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]]. At the end of the regular season, Texas had a record of 7\u20132 in Big 12 play, good for second in the standings and earning them a spot in the [[2018 Big 12 Championship Game|Big 12 Championship Game]] against Oklahoma. The Sooners won the rematch by a score of 39\u201327. Texas was invited to the [[2019 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] to play [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] runner-up No. 5 [[2018 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], which Texas won in an upset by a score of 28\u201321. They finished with an overall record of 10\u20134 and were ranked 9th in the final AP Poll, the most wins and highest ranked finish for the school since [[2009 Texas Longhorns football team|2009]].\n\nThe team was led on offense by sophomore quarterback [[Sam Ehlinger]], who finished with 3,292 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, and a Big 12-leading 16 rushing touchdowns.

This year's game, which ended in a Longhorn victory, was the highest-scoring Red River Showdown game in history, with a combined score of 93. A memorable aspect of this game was Texas' dominance until midway through the fourth quarter, only to eventually surrender a 21-point lead to the Sooners late in the game; Heisman candidate [[Kyler Murray]] put on an incredible performance, showcasing his superior speed and accuracy.

Salvatore Boemi, anti-mafia prosecutor in Reggio Calabria, told the Italian [[Antimafia Commission]] that \"one becomes a member for the simple fact of being born in a mafia family,\" although other reasons might attract a young man to seek membership, and non-kin have also been admitted. Marriages help cement relations within each '' 'ndrina'' and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence \"a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given '' 'ndrina''.\" Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants.<ref name=\"varese\" />\n\nAt the bottom of the chain of command are the ''picciotti d'onore'' or soldiers, who are expected to perform tasks with blind obedience until they are promoted to the next level of ''cammorista'', where they will be granted command over their own group of soldiers.

In 1930, she met US General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and became his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]. He arranged for her to follow him to [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nWhile serving as Army Chief of Staff in the 1930s, MacArthur filed a libel action against a journalist at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]]. When Pearson added Cooper to his list of witnesses to be deposed, MacArthur dropped the suit. MacArthur subsequently paid Cooper $15,000 to leave Washington, the money allegedly delivered by his aide, [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. However, she did not return to the Philippines, and after a few failed attempts in Hollywood and a hair dressing shop in the Midwest, committed suicide in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tragic love stories in Philippine history|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/tragic-love-stories-in-philippine-history/|website=filipiknow.net|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nElizabeth was born '''Isabel Rosario Cooper''' to a Scottish father Arthur Edmund Cooper and Rosario Lopez Chinese-Filipina mother, who was a [[Hacienda Luisita|haciendera]] (farm owner) from [[Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental|Vallehermoso]], [[Negros Oriental]]. She was nicknamed \"Dimples\". As a teenager she traveled Southeast Asia as a [[Torch song|torch singer]] / entertainer.\n\n==Film career==\nIsabel appeared in a few B-grade Filipino films starting in 1925, under the screen name \"Chabing\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dalisay|first1=Butch|title=Pinoys on the Potomac|url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2014/11/24/1394625/pinoys-potomac|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=Philstar|date=21 November 2014}}</ref> Two of her films were ''Miracles of Love'' (1925) and ''Ang Tatlong Hambog'' (1926). In the latter film, Cooper made [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine film]] history with [[Luis Tuason]] when they performed the very first kissing scene in a Philippine film. She was 12 years old at the time.\n\nShe did not act in any Filipino films after 1930, although the 1941 Tagalog film ''[[Ikaw Pala]]'' is sometimes wrongly attributed to her. \"Ikaw Pala\" had another actress named Cresencia Aligada acting in it in a supporting role; Aligada also went by the screen name \"Dimples,\" hence the mistaken identity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=Simon|title=Rare pre-war Tagalog movie posters|url=http://video48.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/rare-pre-war-tagalog-movie-flyers-29.html|website=Video 48|publisher=Simon Santos|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter her 1934 break-up with MacArthur, Cooper attempted to find roles in Hollywood, but in vain.\n\n==Relationship with General MacArthur==\n\nIn 1930, at the age of 16, Cooper met the American [[General Douglas MacArthur]], then commander of all U.S. troops in the [[Philippines]]. MacArthur's marriage had ended a year earlier. Cooper became his mistress in Manila, a fact the 50-year-old MacArthur hid from his 80-year-old mother.<ref name=\"Karnow\"/> In Manila, the teenaged Cooper lived in [[Paco, Manila|Paco]].\n\nFive months after they first met, MacArthur returned to the United States; while he intended to bring her to Washington, he could not risk scandal by traveling with her, so he bought her a ticket on a ship to arrive after him. She arrived in Washington and ended up ensconced in an apartment in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], Washington, D.C. MacArthur later moved her to the Chastleton Hotel (now a co-op building).

In addition to her brief movie career, Cooper was also known for being the mistress of [[General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]].\n\nBorn in [[Manila]], she was infamous for the first on-screen kiss in a [[Filipino women|Filipino]] movie, ''[[Ang Tatlong Hambog]]'' (1926). In 1930, she met US General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and became his [[mistress (lover)|mistress]]. He arranged for her to follow him to [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nWhile serving as Army Chief of Staff in the 1930s, MacArthur filed a libel action against a journalist at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]]. When Pearson added Cooper to his list of witnesses to be deposed, MacArthur dropped the suit. MacArthur subsequently paid Cooper $15,000 to leave Washington, the money allegedly delivered by his aide, [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. However, she did not return to the Philippines, and after a few failed attempts in Hollywood and a hair dressing shop in the Midwest, committed suicide in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tragic love stories in Philippine history|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/tragic-love-stories-in-philippine-history/|website=filipiknow.net|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nElizabeth was born '''Isabel Rosario Cooper''' to a Scottish father Arthur Edmund Cooper and Rosario Lopez Chinese-Filipina mother, who was a [[Hacienda Luisita|haciendera]] (farm owner) from [[Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental|Vallehermoso]], [[Negros Oriental]]. She was nicknamed \"Dimples\". As a teenager she traveled Southeast Asia as a [[Torch song|torch singer]] / entertainer.\n\n==Film career==\nIsabel appeared in a few B-grade Filipino films starting in 1925, under the screen name \"Chabing\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dalisay|first1=Butch|title=Pinoys on the Potomac|url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2014/11/24/1394625/pinoys-potomac|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=Philstar|date=21 November 2014}}</ref> Two of her films were ''Miracles of Love'' (1925) and ''Ang Tatlong Hambog'' (1926). In the latter film, Cooper made [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine film]] history with [[Luis Tuason]] when they performed the very first kissing scene in a Philippine film. She was 12 years old at the time.\n\nShe did not act in any Filipino films after 1930, although the 1941 Tagalog film ''[[Ikaw Pala]]'' is sometimes wrongly attributed to her. \"Ikaw Pala\" had another actress named Cresencia Aligada acting in it in a supporting role; Aligada also went by the screen name \"Dimples,\" hence the mistaken identity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Santos|first1=Simon|title=Rare pre-war Tagalog movie posters|url=http://video48.blogspot.co.uk/2011/02/rare-pre-war-tagalog-movie-flyers-29.html|website=Video 48|publisher=Simon Santos|accessdate=25 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter her 1934 break-up with MacArthur, Cooper attempted to find roles in Hollywood, but in vain.\n\n==Relationship with General MacArthur==\n\nIn 1930, at the age of 16, Cooper met the American [[General Douglas MacArthur]], then commander of all U.S. troops in the [[Philippines]]. MacArthur's marriage had ended a year earlier. Cooper became his mistress in Manila, a fact the 50-year-old MacArthur hid from his 80-year-old mother.<ref name=\"Karnow\"/> In Manila, the teenaged Cooper lived in [[Paco, Manila|Paco]].\n\nFive months after they first met, MacArthur returned to the United States; while he intended to bring her to Washington, he could not risk scandal by traveling with her, so he bought her a ticket on a ship to arrive after him. She arrived in Washington and ended up ensconced in an apartment in [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]], Washington, D.C. MacArthur later moved her to the Chastleton Hotel (now a co-op building).

This [[Saint-\u00c9tienne]]-based company manufactures [[Loudspeaker enclosure|loudspeakers]] for the home, [[Loudspeaker|speaker drivers]] for automobiles, [[headphones]] and professional monitoring loudspeakers.\n\nThe Grande Utopia is the brand's emblematic loudspeaker, which earned the company its worldwide reputation.<ref>[http://www.focal.com/fr/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4020 Jack English auditions the JMlab Grand Utopia loudspeaker] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202120/http://www.focal.com/fr/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4020 |date=2013-10-29 }}, on ''focal.com''.</ref> It is considered one of the best high-fidelity loudspeakers in the world.<ref>[http://www.on-mag.fr/index.php/topaudio/actualites-news/10943-top-44-des-meilleures-enceintes-acoustiques-audiophiles-de-tous-les-temps-par-audiophilereviewcom Pierre Stemmelin, Top 44 des meilleures enceintes acoustiques audiophiles de tous les temps], on ''on-mag.fr/index.php''.</ref><ref>[http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-technologie-internet/2008-09-08/grande-utopia-em-l-enceinte-de-tous-les-superlatifs/1387/0/272307 Val\u00e9rie Marchive, Grande Utopia EM, l\u2019enceinte de tous les superlatifs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205119/http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-technologie-internet/2008-09-08/grande-utopia-em-l-enceinte-de-tous-les-superlatifs/1387/0/272307 |date=2015-06-10 }}, on ''lepoint.fr''.</ref>\n\nFocal's industrial strategy concentrates on having full control over the entire production process, from the design and manufacturing of the speaker drivers to the assembly of the final product. Its products are entirely designed and developed in France, and most of the production is carried out at the factory in Saint-\u00c9tienne (France).\n\nFocal-JMlab generates a \u20ac53 million annual turnover and employs about 230 people<ref name=\"auto1\"/> at its facility in Saint-\u00c9tienne, which groups the production, R&D and management departments at the same site. Its export share is 70%.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1980s ===\nFocal-JMlab, a research office dedicated to acoustics was founded in 1979 in Paris by engineer, high-fidelity enthusiast and technology journalist Jacques Mahul.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/vie-economique_642117.html Philippe Bidalon, \u00ab Les 100 qui font bouger Saint-\u00c9tienne : Jacques Mahul \u00bb], on lexpress.fr, ''[[L'Express]]''</ref> He began making his first speaker drivers in a small workshop in Saint-Etienne, at a precision mechanics company, which belonged to his father. Whilst producing his speaker drivers, Jacques Mahul also launched his own range of loudspeakers under the brand JMlab. His first loudspeaker, the DB13, was a bookshelf loudspeaker, which produced volumes comparable to larger loudspeakers, particularly in bass frequencies. Initially, he only sold his product to acquaintances but the DB13 was soon launched on the market.\n\nIn the 1980s, the two brands became established. Focal focused on innovation, producing specialised products such as the polyglass \"V\" cone and polykevlar cone. The materials used on the [[tweeter]] evolved from glass fibres to [[Kevlar]], producing a more linear frequency response curve and a smoother and less piercing treble.\nAs for JMlab, the company went from being a manufacturer of small-and medium-sized loudspeakers to a manufacturer of veritable high-end models.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThings rapidly began to pick up speed in 1990 with the arrival of G\u00e9rard Chr\u00e9tien, another high end high fidelity enthusiast and [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine ''L\u2019Audiophile'' since 1977. Currently, he is the managing director and marketing director of Focal-JMlab. By adapting the company's products to the demands of the consumer, the brand soon earned its role as leader on the French loudspeaker market.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/focal-jmlab-le-son-chez-soi-et-au-volant.N34160|title=Focal-JMlab Le son, chez soi et au volant|journal=Usinenouvelle.com/|first=L'Usine|last=Nouvelle|date=19 June 2003}}</ref> The company's turnover increased from \u20ac9 million in 1992 to \u20ac26 million in 2000.<ref name=\"pr\u00e9sentation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.focal.com/fr/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4022|title=Pr\u00e9sentation Focal-JMlab 2011, on the company official website|publisher=|access-date=2013-11-12|archive-url=|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIt was also in the early 1990s that the company implemented an export strategy for its loudspeakers across Europe, Southeast Asia and North America. The brand's reputation on the international stage was reinforced by various awards. The JMlab Vega model was voted \"Loudspeaker of the Year, 1992\" in Japan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiomarketing.com.au/pdf/focal/history.pdf|title=History Focal, on audiomarketing.com|publisher=|access-date=2013-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105154002/http://www.audiomarketing.com.au/pdf/focal/history.pdf|archive-date=2012-01-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in 1996, the Grande Utopia model was praised by the international press.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.focal.com/fr/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4020 |title=Jack English auditions the JMlab Grand Utopia loudspeaker, on ''Stereophile'' |access-date=2013-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202120/http://www.focal.com/fr/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4020 |archive-date=2013-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== 2000s ===\nFrom 2002, production was relocated in Saint-Etienne where about three-quarters of production still takes place with the aim of equipping every loudspeaker with \"Made in France\" speaker drivers.\n\nIn 2003, the two brands were incorporated under the name Focal-JMlab for home products, before being renamed as just Focal in 2005 for all product sectors.\n\n2003 was also the year that the company began collaborating with Paris-based design agency Pineau & Le Porcher. By combining sound quality and aesthetics, this move made Focal-JMlab products lifestyle loudspeakers in their own right and also gave the company a brand signature. Thus, Focal and Pineau & Le Porcher worked in close collaboration to come up with a completely new design for various ranges: Profile and Electra (2005), Chorus (2006), Utopia (2008) and Dome (2009).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/quand-le-design-permet-de-se-differencier.N118371|title=Quand le design permet de se diff\u00e9rencier|first=L'Usine|last=Nouvelle|date=October 1, 2009|via=www.usinenouvelle.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the company bought up the Guy HF cabinet-making facility located in Bourbon-Lancy, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2011, Focal-JMlab merged with [[Naim Audio|Naim Audio Limited]], the leading high-end electronics brand in the UK, which mainly designs and manufactures audio electronics. The new holding company, Vervent Audio Group, owns and manages the two brands. However, both brands remain independent with their own specific philosophies and their own respective ranges and products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-mag.fr/index.php/topaudio/actualites-news/10577-focal-et-naim-audio-annoncent-leur-fusion-au-sein-de-lentite-focal-a-co|title=Focal et Naim Audio annoncent leur fusion au sein de l'entit\u00e9 Focal & Co|first=Pierre|last=Stemmelin|website=www.on-mag.fr}}</ref>\n\nThe two companies began consolidating their activities in 2013, with their presence on a common stand at the High End Show in Munich.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090919/http://www.hificritic.com/downloads/Munich2013.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=September 8, 2013|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Focal adopted a new visual identity and finally, in 2012, built a showroom and a new auditorium at its site in Saint-\u00c9tienne.\n\nIn 2014, Focal&Naim Group was taken over by its management team, Naxicap Partners (major shareholder), Aquasourca and Garibaldi Participations. Jacques Mahul remains involved and becomes Focal-JMlab Vice-Pr\u00e9sident.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hifiplus.com/articles/audios-transfer-window/,|title=Why a week of audio business upheaval might not be a bad thing, on ''www.hifiplus.com''}}</ref> The same year, Focal is recognized by the French state thanks to ''The Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant'' (Living Heritage Company) label.

Consult\u00e9 le 29 novembre 2017</ref>\n\n== Technologies ==\nFocal-JMlab maintains a regular research and development program in speaker drivers\u2019 technologies. Investments in this field have enabled the company to conceive various innovative concepts.<ref>[http://culturehd.com/focal-le-retour-de-la-vraie-enceinte-haute-fidelite_2322 Richard, FOCAL le retour de la vraie enceinte haute fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, on ''culturehd.com'']</ref> Ten innovations have been patented to date.\n\n=== Inverted dome tweeter (1981) ===\nAn inverted dome tweeter was designed and developed by Focal in 1981. (Inverted dome tweeters appeared at least as early as the late 1960s in the EPI 100 loudspeaker manufactured by EPI/Epicure. It had an inverted paper dome.) One of its main advantages is its low directionality and its high dynamics. The majority of the brand's tweeters still feature this technology.\n\n=== K2 cone (1986) ===\nIn 1986, the company introduced the Polykevlar sandwich structure. The Poly-K cone is composed of two layers of aramid fibres applied to either side of a hollow-micro-ball structure in order to improve the compromise between weight-rigidity-and damping.\n\n=== Polyglass cone (1988) ===\nPolyglass technology was introduced by Focal in 1988. This consists in depositing fine glass micro-balls on the surface of a cellulose pulp cone (paper). This combination of glass and paper results in a very rigid material with a low mass, providing excellent damping qualities. The Polyglass cone resulted in a very linear [[frequency response]] curve and improved the definition of the midrange.\n\n=== \"W\" sandwich cone (1995) ===\nIn 1995, Focal improved its sandwich concept with its \"W\" cone system which consists of two sheets of glass fibres applied to a structural foam core. Unlike the mono-material cones, the \"W\" sandwich cone optimises the frequency response curve by maximising the mass, rigidity and damping.\n\n=== Beryllium tweeter (2002) ===\nIn 2002, Focal launched another innovation to their product line, the [[Beryllium]] Tweeter, which was only the second time a tweeter had ever been manufactured from Beryllium. Yamaha had introduced the Beryllium tweeter and Beryllium mid-range speaker in the NS-1000 back in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevintageknob.org/yamaha-NS-1000.html|title=Yamaha NS-1000 on thevintageknob.org|last=Dahl|first=Axel|website=www.thevintageknob.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-27}}</ref>\n\nBeryllium is seven times more rigid than titanium (six times more rigid than aluminum), but has the same mass. It enabled Focal to develop a lighter and faster tweeter which provides excellent damping qualities. When associated with the inverted dome concept, the frequency response can be increased to 40&nbsp;kHz, and more than 5 octaves can be spanned.\nBeing ten times more expensive than gold,Focal only uses the Beryllium Tweeter for the Premium ranges: Utopia, Sopra, Electra and high end studio monitors.\n\n=== Tweeter Al-Mg (2007) ===\nThis tweeter was introduced by Focal JMlab in 2007. The use of aluminium increases damping qualities, whereas the use of magnesium increases the rigidity of the dome. This enabled the frequency response of the Al-Mg Tweeter to be increased to 28&nbsp;kHz.\nThe Al-Mg Tweeter is used on the Chorus range of the Home line and on the CMS and Shape ranges of the Pro line, among others.\n\n=== Flax membrane cone (2013) ===\nEighteen years after introducing the \"W\" sandwich cones, Focal launched the new Made in France \"F\" Sandwich cone (for [[Flax]]). Composed of flax fibres enclosed in two thin layers of glass fibre, this solution offers a natural sound without colouration thanks to light, rigid and damped cones.<ref>[http://www.caraudiovideo.com/index.php/content/view/3454/57/ Alexandre, Focal d\u00e9voile une nouvelle membrane Flax \u00e0 base de lin, on ''caraudiovideo.com'']</ref>\n\n=== Tuned mass damper (2015) ===\nIn order to control resonance and to reduce medium speaker driver distortions, the Tuned Mass Damper technology consists of an additional mass that oscillates in opposition to the resonance frequency. The suspension is optimised to avoid distortions and increase the definition.<ref name=\"Sopra White Paper\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.focal.com/en/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4419|title=Sopra White Paper, on ''focal.com''}}</ref>\n\n=== Infinite horn loading system (2015) ===\nThe rear of the Beryllium tweeter is loaded via a small cavity which is connected to the exterior of the enclosure by a horn. The inside is filled with a damping material. Rear wave of the tweeter is gradually absorbed to reduce distortion.<ref name=\"Sopra White Paper\"/>\n\n=== M-shaped inverted dome tweeter (2016) ===\nTweeters from the K2 Power, renewed in 2016, feature this M-shaped profile. This shape enables to extend the frequency response, a smoother diffusion, and more detailed treble.<ref>[http://www.autonews.fr/hi-tech/caraudiovideo-focal-k2-power-2016-61362 Focal renouvelle la l\u00e9gendaire ligne K2 Power], sur ''autonews.fr''.

In 2013, launches Easya, high-fidelity wireless loudspeakers connectable with multiple sources thanks to built-in ''Bluetooth''\u00ae aptX\u00ae technology.\n\nThe Grande Utopia is the collection's emblematic loudspeaker. The first generation of the Grande Utopia, born in 1995, is a condensation of all the expertise and experience that Focal had gained since its creation. The second generation, in 2002, had the particularity of featuring pure [[Beryllium]] dome tweeters which enable it to receive, the year after, the \"Golden Sound\" award in Japan.<ref>[http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/le-fabricant-d-enceintes-acoustiques-focal-reorganise-sa-production.N7230 Le fabricant d'enceintes acoustiques Focal r\u00e9organise sa production ], on usinenouvelle.com, ''L'Usine nouvelle''</ref> The third generation, launched in 2008, was a concentration of the best of Focal technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-technologie-internet/2008-09-08/grande-utopia-em-l-enceinte-de-tous-les-superlatifs/1387/0/272307|title=Archives - Le Point.fr|first=Le Point|last=magazine|website=Le Point.fr|access-date=2013-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205119/http://www.lepoint.fr/actualites-technologie-internet/2008-09-08/grande-utopia-em-l-enceinte-de-tous-les-superlatifs/1387/0/272307|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> Designed by Pineau & Le Porcher, The Grande Utopia EM distinguished itself through its extraordinary dimensions: weighing 570&nbsp;lbs (260&nbsp;kg) and standing over 6&nbsp;ft (2m) high.

Its products are entirely designed and developed in France, and most of the production is carried out at the factory in Saint-\u00c9tienne (France).\n\nFocal-JMlab generates a \u20ac53 million annual turnover and employs about 230 people<ref name=\"auto1\"/> at its facility in Saint-\u00c9tienne, which groups the production, R&D and management departments at the same site. Its export share is 70%.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1980s ===\nFocal-JMlab, a research office dedicated to acoustics was founded in 1979 in Paris by engineer, high-fidelity enthusiast and technology journalist Jacques Mahul.<ref>[http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/vie-economique_642117.html Philippe Bidalon, \u00ab Les 100 qui font bouger Saint-\u00c9tienne : Jacques Mahul \u00bb], on lexpress.fr, ''[[L'Express]]''</ref> He began making his first speaker drivers in a small workshop in Saint-Etienne, at a precision mechanics company, which belonged to his father. Whilst producing his speaker drivers, Jacques Mahul also launched his own range of loudspeakers under the brand JMlab. His first loudspeaker, the DB13, was a bookshelf loudspeaker, which produced volumes comparable to larger loudspeakers, particularly in bass frequencies. Initially, he only sold his product to acquaintances but the DB13 was soon launched on the market.\n\nIn the 1980s, the two brands became established. Focal focused on innovation, producing specialised products such as the polyglass \"V\" cone and polykevlar cone. The materials used on the [[tweeter]] evolved from glass fibres to [[Kevlar]], producing a more linear frequency response curve and a smoother and less piercing treble.\nAs for JMlab, the company went from being a manufacturer of small-and medium-sized loudspeakers to a manufacturer of veritable high-end models.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThings rapidly began to pick up speed in 1990 with the arrival of G\u00e9rard Chr\u00e9tien, another high end high fidelity enthusiast and [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine ''L\u2019Audiophile'' since 1977. Currently, he is the managing director and marketing director of Focal-JMlab. By adapting the company's products to the demands of the consumer, the brand soon earned its role as leader on the French loudspeaker market.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/focal-jmlab-le-son-chez-soi-et-au-volant.N34160|title=Focal-JMlab Le son, chez soi et au volant|journal=Usinenouvelle.com/|first=L'Usine|last=Nouvelle|date=19 June 2003}}</ref> The company's turnover increased from \u20ac9 million in 1992 to \u20ac26 million in 2000.<ref name=\"pr\u00e9sentation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.focal.com/fr/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4022|title=Pr\u00e9sentation Focal-JMlab 2011, on the company official website|publisher=|access-date=2013-11-12|archive-url=|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIt was also in the early 1990s that the company implemented an export strategy for its loudspeakers across Europe, Southeast Asia and North America. The brand's reputation on the international stage was reinforced by various awards.

By combining sound quality and aesthetics, this move made Focal-JMlab products lifestyle loudspeakers in their own right and also gave the company a brand signature. Thus, Focal and Pineau & Le Porcher worked in close collaboration to come up with a completely new design for various ranges: Profile and Electra (2005), Chorus (2006), Utopia (2008) and Dome (2009).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/quand-le-design-permet-de-se-differencier.N118371|title=Quand le design permet de se diff\u00e9rencier|first=L'Usine|last=Nouvelle|date=October 1, 2009|via=www.usinenouvelle.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the company bought up the Guy HF cabinet-making facility located in Bourbon-Lancy, Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire.\n\n=== 2010s ===\nIn 2011, Focal-JMlab merged with [[Naim Audio|Naim Audio Limited]], the leading high-end electronics brand in the UK, which mainly designs and manufactures audio electronics. The new holding company, Vervent Audio Group, owns and manages the two brands. However, both brands remain independent with their own specific philosophies and their own respective ranges and products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-mag.fr/index.php/topaudio/actualites-news/10577-focal-et-naim-audio-annoncent-leur-fusion-au-sein-de-lentite-focal-a-co|title=Focal et Naim Audio annoncent leur fusion au sein de l'entit\u00e9 Focal & Co|first=Pierre|last=Stemmelin|website=www.on-mag.fr}}</ref>\n\nThe two companies began consolidating their activities in 2013, with their presence on a common stand at the High End Show in Munich.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908090919/http://www.hificritic.com/downloads/Munich2013.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=September 8, 2013|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Focal adopted a new visual identity and finally, in 2012, built a showroom and a new auditorium at its site in Saint-\u00c9tienne.\n\nIn 2014, Focal&Naim Group was taken over by its management team, Naxicap Partners (major shareholder), Aquasourca and Garibaldi Participations.

Consult\u00e9 le 29 novembre 2017</ref>\n\n== Technologies ==\nFocal-JMlab maintains a regular research and development program in speaker drivers\u2019 technologies. Investments in this field have enabled the company to conceive various innovative concepts.<ref>[http://culturehd.com/focal-le-retour-de-la-vraie-enceinte-haute-fidelite_2322 Richard, FOCAL le retour de la vraie enceinte haute fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, on ''culturehd.com'']</ref> Ten innovations have been patented to date.\n\n=== Inverted dome tweeter (1981) ===\nAn inverted dome tweeter was designed and developed by Focal in 1981. (Inverted dome tweeters appeared at least as early as the late 1960s in the EPI 100 loudspeaker manufactured by EPI/Epicure. It had an inverted paper dome.) One of its main advantages is its low directionality and its high dynamics. The majority of the brand's tweeters still feature this technology.\n\n=== K2 cone (1986) ===\nIn 1986, the company introduced the Polykevlar sandwich structure. The Poly-K cone is composed of two layers of aramid fibres applied to either side of a hollow-micro-ball structure in order to improve the compromise between weight-rigidity-and damping.\n\n=== Polyglass cone (1988) ===\nPolyglass technology was introduced by Focal in 1988. This consists in depositing fine glass micro-balls on the surface of a cellulose pulp cone (paper). This combination of glass and paper results in a very rigid material with a low mass, providing excellent damping qualities. The Polyglass cone resulted in a very linear [[frequency response]] curve and improved the definition of the midrange.\n\n=== \"W\" sandwich cone (1995) ===\nIn 1995, Focal improved its sandwich concept with its \"W\" cone system which consists of two sheets of glass fibres applied to a structural foam core. Unlike the mono-material cones, the \"W\" sandwich cone optimises the frequency response curve by maximising the mass, rigidity and damping.\n\n=== Beryllium tweeter (2002) ===\nIn 2002, Focal launched another innovation to their product line, the [[Beryllium]] Tweeter, which was only the second time a tweeter had ever been manufactured from Beryllium. Yamaha had introduced the Beryllium tweeter and Beryllium mid-range speaker in the NS-1000 back in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thevintageknob.org/yamaha-NS-1000.html|title=Yamaha NS-1000 on thevintageknob.org|last=Dahl|first=Axel|website=www.thevintageknob.org|language=en|access-date=2016-03-27}}</ref>\n\nBeryllium is seven times more rigid than titanium (six times more rigid than aluminum), but has the same mass. It enabled Focal to develop a lighter and faster tweeter which provides excellent damping qualities. When associated with the inverted dome concept, the frequency response can be increased to 40&nbsp;kHz, and more than 5 octaves can be spanned.\nBeing ten times more expensive than gold,Focal only uses the Beryllium Tweeter for the Premium ranges: Utopia, Sopra, Electra and high end studio monitors.\n\n=== Tweeter Al-Mg (2007) ===\nThis tweeter was introduced by Focal JMlab in 2007. The use of aluminium increases damping qualities, whereas the use of magnesium increases the rigidity of the dome. This enabled the frequency response of the Al-Mg Tweeter to be increased to 28&nbsp;kHz.\nThe Al-Mg Tweeter is used on the Chorus range of the Home line and on the CMS and Shape ranges of the Pro line, among others.\n\n=== Flax membrane cone (2013) ===\nEighteen years after introducing the \"W\" sandwich cones, Focal launched the new Made in France \"F\" Sandwich cone (for [[Flax]]). Composed of flax fibres enclosed in two thin layers of glass fibre, this solution offers a natural sound without colouration thanks to light, rigid and damped cones.<ref>[http://www.caraudiovideo.com/index.php/content/view/3454/57/ Alexandre, Focal d\u00e9voile une nouvelle membrane Flax \u00e0 base de lin, on ''caraudiovideo.com'']</ref>\n\n=== Tuned mass damper (2015) ===\nIn order to control resonance and to reduce medium speaker driver distortions, the Tuned Mass Damper technology consists of an additional mass that oscillates in opposition to the resonance frequency. The suspension is optimised to avoid distortions and increase the definition.<ref name=\"Sopra White Paper\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.focal.com/en/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=4419|title=Sopra White Paper, on ''focal.com''}}</ref>\n\n=== Infinite horn loading system (2015) ===\nThe rear of the Beryllium tweeter is loaded via a small cavity which is connected to the exterior of the enclosure by a horn. The inside is filled with a damping material. Rear wave of the tweeter is gradually absorbed to reduce distortion.<ref name=\"Sopra White Paper\"/>\n\n=== M-shaped inverted dome tweeter (2016) ===\nTweeters from the K2 Power, renewed in 2016, feature this M-shaped profile. This shape enables to extend the frequency response, a smoother diffusion, and more detailed treble.<ref>[http://www.autonews.fr/hi-tech/caraudiovideo-focal-k2-power-2016-61362 Focal renouvelle la l\u00e9gendaire ligne K2 Power], sur ''autonews.fr''.
