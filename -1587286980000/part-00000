It had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Jewish religious music]], inspiring later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], [[8th Day (Jewish band)|8th Day]], [[Reva L'Sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]]. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revived the band under the name '''Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora''' and produced several more albums.\n\n== Background ==\nThe '''Diaspora Yeshiva''' <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/ Website of the Diaspora Yeshiva]</ref> was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the [[Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim|Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}  It is the only Jewish institution located on [[Mount Zion]]. The yeshiva offers programs ranging from basic Judaism to advanced Talmud - employing a methodology based on [[Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto#Bibliography|Ramchal]] - and emphasizes ''[[mussar]]'' (character development);\nsee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]].\n'''Machon Roni''',<ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/machon-roni-womens-torah-seminary.html Machon Roni page]</ref> a [[Midrasha|Women's Torah Seminary]], operates in parallel.\n\nDiaspora Yeshiva was the first [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] [[yeshiva]] for [[Baal teshuva movement|''baalei teshuva'']].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013|p=291}} Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional [[Torah study|Torah]] or [[Talmud]] study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} To appeal to students who identified with the [[hippie]] [[subculture]] prevalent on American college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a [[Neo-Hasidism|neo-Hasidic]] approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}\n\nNumerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>\n\n==History==\nThe Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the [[Gerard Behar Center|Beit Ha'Am]] hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth;

It had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Jewish religious music]], inspiring later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], [[8th Day (Jewish band)|8th Day]], [[Reva L'Sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]]. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revived the band under the name '''Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora''' and produced several more albums.\n\n== Background ==\nThe '''Diaspora Yeshiva''' <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/ Website of the Diaspora Yeshiva]</ref> was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the [[Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim|Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}  It is the only Jewish institution located on [[Mount Zion]]. The yeshiva offers programs ranging from basic Judaism to advanced Talmud - employing a methodology based on [[Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto#Bibliography|Ramchal]] - and emphasizes ''[[mussar]]'' (character development);\nsee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]].\n'''Machon Roni''', <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/machon-roni-womens-torah-seminary.html Machon Roni page]</ref>a [[Midrasha|Women's Torah Seminary]], operates in parallel.\n\nDiaspora Yeshiva was the first [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] [[yeshiva]] for [[Baal teshuva movement|''baalei teshuva'']].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013|p=291}} Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional [[Torah study|Torah]] or [[Talmud]] study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} To appeal to students who identified with the [[hippie]] [[subculture]] prevalent on American college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a [[Neo-Hasidism|neo-Hasidic]] approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}\n\nNumerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>\n\n==History==\nThe Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the [[Gerard Behar Center|Beit Ha'Am]] hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth;

Instead of punting, O'Rourke scrambled in his own end zone for 45 seconds then took a safety. BC used the free kick to boot the ball far downfield and dashed the Hoyas' three-season unbeaten record.

On the last play of the game, Flutie rolled out right away from the defense and threw a [[Hail Mary pass]] that was caught in the end zone by senior wideout [[Gerard Phelan]], giving BC an insanely miraculous 47\u201345 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/not-categorized/doug-flutie |title=Doug Flutie Hail Mary Pass &#124; The Miracle in Miami |publisher=Yankeemagazine.com |date=2015-11-18 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref> A persistent [[urban legend]] holds that this play essentially clinched the Heisman Trophy, the award given to the best player in college football that year, for Flutie; in fact, the Heisman voting was already complete by the day of the game.

In 1999, the Eagles finished the regular season 8\u20133 including a 31\u201329 win at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] on November 20. BC had earned itself its first bowl berth since being ensnarled in the 1996 gambling scandal. Despite the excitement of its first postseason game in five years, Boston College laid an egg at the [[Insight.com Bowl]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]], getting squashed by the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], 62\u201328. In 2000 BC finished the regular season at 6\u20135 with just enough wins to be bowl-eligible and found themselves in [[Honolulu]] for the [[Aloha Bowl]] where they downed [[Arizona State]] 31\u201317, giving O'Brien his first bowl victory as head coach.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe year 2001 saw Boston College end a 21-game losing streak to ranked opponents when, in the [[Music City Bowl]], the Eagles beat No. 16 [[University of Georgia|Georgia]] 20\u201316 to finish at 8\u20135.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musiccitybowl.com/content/boston-college-20-georgia-16-stats |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827154016/http://www.musiccitybowl.com/content/boston-college-20-georgia-16-stats |archive-date=2014-08-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But the most memorable moment of the year came in another thrilling game against then-No. 1 Miami at Alumni Stadium. Trailing 12\u20137 BC stood at the Hurricanes 9-yard-line, poised to win with just over 20 seconds left in the contest, but an interception thrown by Eagles [[quarterback]] [[Brian St. Pierre]] cost the game. St. Pierre threw too low for receiver Ryan Read, and the pass ricocheted off a Miami defender's leg and fell into the hands of [[defensive end]] [[Matt Walters]]. After a short return, Walters handed the ball off to [[defensive back]] [[Ed Reed]], who returned it the remaining 80 yards for a touchdown\u2014preserving a win for the Hurricanes and keeping their hopes alive for a national championship, which they would eventually win. Despite the heartbreaking loss, the season had several highs including [[running back]] [[William Green (football player)|William Green]] rushing for 1,559 yards and being the top RB taken in the [[2002 NFL Draft]]; eight wins for the first time since 1993; and finishing the season ranked (No. 21) for the first time since 1994.\n\nOver the next few years the team posted respectable win-loss records and continued to win bowl games. In 2002, BC went 9\u20134 and won the [[Motor City Bowl]], in 2003 they were 8\u20135 with a victory in the [[Fight Hunger Bowl|San Francisco Bowl]] and finished 9\u20133 in 2004 with a win in the [[Continental Tire Bowl]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The year 2004 would be the Eagles final campaign in the Big East, and it finished the season in a four-way tie atop the league after losing the home finale to Syracuse (thus costing the Eagles a coveted berth in a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl) \u2014 a year in which they closed the season ranked No. 21 in both major polls.\n\nOn December 6, 2006, O'Brien decided to leave the Eagles and replace [[Chuck Amato]] as head coach at [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail-pf.php?n%3D99205 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827100250/http://www.accessnorthga.com/detail-pf.php?n=99205 |archivedate=2014-08-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Jeff Jagodzinski era (2007\u20132008)===\nO'Brien was replaced by then [[Green Bay Packers]] offensive coordinator [[Jeff Jagodzinski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/acc/2006-12-19-bc-jagodzinski_x.htm|title=Boston College hires Packers coordinator Jagodzinski - USATODAY.com|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Jagodzinski's first year, the Eagles were picked to finish 2nd in the Atlantic in the ACC Preseason Poll. The Eagles raced out to a 7\u20130 start behind the arm of [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] and a stout, senior-laden defense. The Eagles climbed to #2 in the [[BCS rankings|BCS Standings]] before squaring off against #8 [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]] on a rainy night at [[Lane Stadium]]. The Eagles struggled on offense all night and trailed the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Hokies]] 10\u20130 late in the 4th quarter. In a miraculous comeback, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Ryan]] threw two touchdown passes in the final 2:11 of game to give BC the victory. Ryan's second touchdown pass, a 24-yard tear-drop pass to a wide open [[Andre Callender]] in the back of the end-zone, caused [[ESPN]]'s [[Chris Fowler]] to exclaim \"[[Lane Stadium]] goes silent!\" The come-back win vaulted Ryan into the [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] discussion. BC clinched the ACC Atlantic Division with yet another dramatic win, this time over rival [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] was once again the hero, finding a wide-open [[Rich Gunnell]] for a 43-yard TD pass with 1:46 to go to give the Eagles the 20\u201317 lead. [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]'s 54-yard FG attempt to tie the game fell short, clinching the victory for [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]]. The Eagles eventually lost the [[ACC Championship Game]] to the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Hokies]]. BC played in the [[Champs Sports Bowl]] against the [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State Spartans]], winning 24\u201321. 2007 marked the second time in Eagle history that the team won 11 games, the other being the undefeated 1940 season. [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] won the [[Manning Award]] and the [[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]], becoming BC's first major award recipient since [[Mike Ruth]] won the [[Outland Trophy]] in 1985. [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Ryan]] finished 7th in the Heisman race, garnering 9 first place votes. [[Jamie Silva]] was a Consensus All-American, BC's first since [[William Green (American football)|William Green]] in 2001.\n\nThe 2008 season saw the Eagles return to the [[ACC Championship Game]], this time behind a defense that ranked 5th in Total Defense. The Eagles fell once again to the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Hokies]]. In both 2007 and 2008, the Eagles had defeated the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Hokies]] in the regular season meeting only to lose in the [[ACC Championship Game]].\n\nFollowing the 2008 season, Jagodzinski was fired for interviewing with the [[New York Jets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=3816644|title=BC follows through with Jagodzinski's firing|date=7 January 2009|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>\n\n===Frank Spaziani era (2009\u20132012)===\n[[File:Frank Spaziani 2012 02.jpg|thumb|150 px|Coach Spaziani]]\n[[Frank Spaziani]], promoted from defensive coordinator of the Eagles, was hired as BC's head coach in January 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=3829897|title=Spaziani named new Boston College coach|date=13 January 2009|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Prior to the 2009 season, star LB and reigning ACC Defensive Player of the Year [[Mark Herzlich]] was diagnosed with [[Ewing sarcoma|Ewing's Sarcoma]], a rare form of bone cancer.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/giants-re-sign-lb-herzlich-article-1.1714614|title=Giants re-sign linebacker Herzlich|publisher=}}</ref> Herzlich was forced to miss the entirety of the 2009 season.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/> Herzlich became an inspirational figure as he battled his way back, earning the [[Disney's Wide World of Sports Spirit Award]], an award presented annually to college football's most inspirational player or team.<ref name=\"nydailynews.com\"/> Boston College created a chapter of [[Uplifting Athletes]] to benefit [[Ewing sarcoma|Ewing's Sarcoma]] research.

With many key players having graduated, including Heisman finalist Andre Williams, quarterback [[Chase Rettig]], wide receiver Alex Amidon, and linebacker [[Kevin Pierre-Louis]], Addazio helped replace some lost production with graduate transfer quarterback [[Tyler Murphy]], who was recruited by Addazio at [[Florida Gators football|Florida]], as well as converting backup quarterback Josh Bordner to the wide receiver position. The running back core went from a single back (Williams) to a group of five threats: sophomores Myles Willis and Tyler Rouse, true freshman Jonathan Hilliman and Sherm Allston, as well as Tyler Murphy himself, who was more dangerous with his legs than his arm during the season. Murphy finished the season leading all quarterbacks in the league with 1,184 yards rushing, breaking the school record for most rushing yards by a quarterback, previously held by Doug Flutie. The season was highlighted by a historic upset victory over 9th ranked [[USC Trojans football|USC]], in which Murphy rushed for 191 yards in the 37\u201331 victory. The Eagles nearly managed another two upsets against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] and [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]], but came up just short in both games. Boston College played [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in the [[2014 Pinstripe Bowl]] and lost in overtime 31\u201330. The Eagles scored first in overtime, yet missed the PAT, while the Nittany Lions scored on their possession and made their PAT. Boston College finished the season 7\u20136 (4\u20134 ACC).\n\nThe Eagles fell on hard times in Addazio's third season, finishing with an overall record of 3-9 and a winless 0-8 ACC record. The Eagles would also go 0-18 in Basketball during ACC play, the first time since 1976 that a [[Power Five conferences]] program went winless in both basketball and football. However, despite their subpar record, the Eagles boasted the #1 ranked Defense in the FBS under defensive coordinator [[Don Brown (American football coach)|Don Brown]], allowing just 254.4 yards per game, and allowing 10 or fewer points in 6 of their 12 games.<ref>https://www.si.com/college-football/2015/12/20/college-football-michigan-boston-college-don-brown</ref> However, on December 21, 2015, [[Jim Harbaugh]] convinced Brown to leave his position in Chestnut Hill and coach instead for the [[Michigan Wolverines football]].\n\nDuring the 2016 season the Eagles showed improvement from the previous year, finishing with a 7-6 overall record and a 2-6 ACC record after going winless in conference play the year before. This was Addazio's 3rd time in 4 seasons recording 7 wins with the Eagles. Boston College began their season in Dublin, Ireland, where they faced [[Georgia Tech football]] in the [[Emerald Isle Classic]], and subsequently lost 14-17. After the season the Eagles were invited to play in the [[2016 Quick Lane Bowl]], where they defeated former ACC foe [[Maryland Terrapins football]] 36-30.\n\nAddazio coached his way yet another 7-6 overall record in the 2017 season, but continued increasing his conference win total by recording a 4-4 ACC record. The Eagles started the season 1-3, including losses to rivals [[Notre Dame football]] and [[Clemson football]], causing fans to voice concern over Addazio's ability to lead the team to another bowl game. However, the Eagles finished the year with a 6-2 regular season record, highlighted by stellar play from freshman running back [[AJ Dillon]]. Dillon had a breakout game on October 14, 2017, when the Eagles visited the [[Louisville Cardinals football]] and defeated them 45-42 on the road. Dillon posted 272 yards on 39 carries for 4 touchdowns, including a highlight reel stiff arm that led to a 75-yard touchdown. On October 27, 2017, the Eagles hosted the [[Florida State Seminoles football]] for the annual [[Welles Crowther]] Red Bandana game, winning by a score of 35-3. This marked the largest margin of victory in a Boston College win between the two schools. The next week the Eagles lost their starting quarterback, redshirt freshman [[Anthony Brown (quarterback)|Anthony Brown]], to an ACL tear in a home loss to [[NC State Wolfpack football]]. However, the Eagles still won their final two regular season games, posting wins over rival programs [[Uconn Huskies football]] and [[Syracuse Orange football]]. Boston College was again invited to the [[Pinstripe Bowl]], where they lost to Iowa 20-27. Following the season, AJ Dillon was awarded both the ACC Rookie of the Year and the ACC Offensive Rookie of the Year awards, following his 1,589 yard, 14 touchdown campaign. This was the first time in school history that either award had been won.\n\n'''Return to AP Ranking:''' Heading into the 2018 season, Addazio's team received the most media coverage they had seen in years. In fact, ESPN picked them as the team most likely to hit their pre-season predicted win total (6.5), which they eventually did. The reason for this new wave of excitement on Chestnut Hill was clear: Eagles had finished the previous season winning 6 of their final 9 games, and were returning all but 1 defensive starter. The Eagles started the season 3-0, with wins over [[UMass Minutemen football]], long time rival [[Holy Cross football]], and ACC rival [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons football]]. This hot start, combined with the pre-season media attention, found the Eagles back in the AP's Top 25 for the first time since the 2008 season, as they were ranked #23. However, BC fell out of the rankings as quickly as they entered, as they were beaten 13-30 by a previously winless Purdue team on the road the following week. The Eagles showed resilience, bouncing back from a close loss to [[NC State Wolfpack football]], by beating ACC opponents [[Louisville Cardinals football]] and [[Miami Hurricanes football]]. Following their win over the Hurricanes, the BC found themselves back in the Top 25, ranked #24, as they headed to Blacksburg, VA to face longtime rival [[Virginia Tech football]]. Following a 31-21 victory, their 7th of the season, Boston College was chosen to host [[College GameDay (football TV program)]] before their home contest against undefeated [[Clemson football]], the first time College GameDay had been to Chestnut Hill since 2009. BC rose to #17 in the AP poll following the Clemson game. Yet, the Eagles fell to eventual National Champion Clemson 7-27, after their starting quarterback [[Anthony Brown (quarterback)|Anthony Brown]] was injured on the Eagle's first possession. Steve Addazio and his team were unable to break the 7 win mark, as they lost the last two games of the regular season, including a heartbreaking loss to [[Florida State football]] following a Hail Mary in the final 2 minutes of the game. After the season, Boston College was invited to the [[2018 First Responder Bowl]] in Dallas, Texas, where they were set to face #25 [[Boise State football]]. The Eagles came out strong, scoring first to take a 7-0 lead. However, due to poor weather conditions in Dallas, the game was ultimately cancelled, causing coach Addazio to stay at 7 wins. Boston College finished the season with a 7-5 record (4-4 ACC). Despite his injury, [[AJ Dillon]] posted another 1,000+ season, the first time in program history a player had recorded back-to-back 1,000 seasons.\n\nBC then said goodbye to one of their most successful senior classes in program history, as 4 players were selected in the 7 round [[2019 NFL Draft]], including the 14th overall pick [[Chris Lindstrom]].

In 1999, the Eagles finished the regular season 8\u20133 including a 31\u201329 win at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] on November 20. BC had earned itself its first bowl berth since being ensnarled in the 1996 gambling scandal.

Trailing 12\u20137 BC stood at the Hurricanes 9-yard-line, poised to win with just over 20 seconds left in the contest, but an interception thrown by Eagles [[quarterback]] [[Brian St. Pierre]] cost the game. St. Pierre threw too low for receiver Ryan Read, and the pass ricocheted off a Miami defender's leg and fell into the hands of [[defensive end]] [[Matt Walters]]. After a short return, Walters handed the ball off to [[defensive back]] [[Ed Reed]], who returned it the remaining 80 yards for a touchdown\u2014preserving a win for the Hurricanes and keeping their hopes alive for a national championship, which they would eventually win. Despite the heartbreaking loss, the season had several highs including [[running back]] [[William Green (football player)|William Green]] rushing for 1,559 yards and being the top RB taken in the [[2002 NFL Draft]]; eight wins for the first time since 1993; and finishing the season ranked (No. 21) for the first time since 1994.\n\nOver the next few years the team posted respectable win-loss records and continued to win bowl games.

In a miraculous comeback, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Ryan]] threw two touchdown passes in the final 2:11 of game to give BC the victory. Ryan's second touchdown pass, a 24-yard tear-drop pass to a wide open [[Andre Callender]] in the back of the end-zone, caused [[ESPN]]'s [[Chris Fowler]] to exclaim \"[[Lane Stadium]] goes silent!\" The come-back win vaulted Ryan into the [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] discussion.

In addition, he was a unanimous first team All-ACC selection and a finalist for the [[Walter Camp Award]]. Williams set multiple school records, breaking nearly every single-season rushing record and many career-rushing records but also included the single-game rushing record at 339 yards against [[NC State Wolfpack football|NC State]] as well as tying the single-game scoring record at 5 rushing TD's in a game against [[Army Black Knights football|Army]].<ref name=\"soaringtoglory.com\"/> The Eagles played the [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona Wildcats]] in the [[2013 Independence Bowl]], losing by a score of 42\u201319 to finish the season at 7\u20136 (4\u20134 ACC).<ref name=\"scores.espn.go.com\">{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=333650103|title=Arizona vs. Boston College - Game Recap - December 31, 2013 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Andre Williams finished with 2,177 yards rushed on the season, good for 5th most all-time in the NCAA.<ref name=\"scores.espn.go.com\"/>\n\nIn his second year, Addazio led the Eagles to a consecutive 7\u20135 regular season, their second bowl-eligible season in as many years. With many key players having graduated, including Heisman finalist Andre Williams, quarterback [[Chase Rettig]], wide receiver Alex Amidon, and linebacker [[Kevin Pierre-Louis]], Addazio helped replace some lost production with graduate transfer quarterback [[Tyler Murphy]], who was recruited by Addazio at [[Florida Gators football|Florida]], as well as converting backup quarterback Josh Bordner to the wide receiver position. The running back core went from a single back (Williams) to a group of five threats: sophomores Myles Willis and Tyler Rouse, true freshman Jonathan Hilliman and Sherm Allston, as well as Tyler Murphy himself, who was more dangerous with his legs than his arm during the season. Murphy finished the season leading all quarterbacks in the league with 1,184 yards rushing, breaking the school record for most rushing yards by a quarterback, previously held by Doug Flutie. The season was highlighted by a historic upset victory over 9th ranked [[USC Trojans football|USC]], in which Murphy rushed for 191 yards in the 37\u201331 victory. The Eagles nearly managed another two upsets against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]] and [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]], but came up just short in both games. Boston College played [[Penn State Nittany Lions|Penn State]] in the [[2014 Pinstripe Bowl]] and lost in overtime 31\u201330. The Eagles scored first in overtime, yet missed the PAT, while the Nittany Lions scored on their possession and made their PAT. Boston College finished the season 7\u20136 (4\u20134 ACC).\n\nThe Eagles fell on hard times in Addazio's third season, finishing with an overall record of 3-9 and a winless 0-8 ACC record. The Eagles would also go 0-18 in Basketball during ACC play, the first time since 1976 that a [[Power Five conferences]] program went winless in both basketball and football. However, despite their subpar record, the Eagles boasted the #1 ranked Defense in the FBS under defensive coordinator [[Don Brown (American football coach)|Don Brown]], allowing just 254.4 yards per game, and allowing 10 or fewer points in 6 of their 12 games.<ref>https://www.si.com/college-football/2015/12/20/college-football-michigan-boston-college-don-brown</ref> However, on December 21st, 2015, [[Jim Harbaugh]] convinced Brown to leave his position in Chestnut Hill and coach instead for the [[Michigan Wolverines football]].\n\nDuring the 2016 season the Eagles showed improvement from the previous year, finishing with a 7-6 overall record and a 2-6 ACC record after going winless in conference play the year before. This was Addazio's 3rd time in 4 seasons recording 7 wins with the Eagles. Boston College began their season in Dublin, Ireland, where they faced [[Georgia Tech football]] in the [[Emerald Isle Classic]], and subsequently lost 14-17. After the season the Eagles were invited to play in the [[2016 Quick Lane Bowl]], where they defeated former ACC foe [[Maryland Terrapins football]] 36-30.\n\nAddazio coached his way yet another 7-6 overall record in the 2017 season, but continued increasing his conference win total by recording a 4-4 ACC record. The Eagles started the season 1-3, including losses to rivals [[Notre Dame football]] and [[Clemson football]], causing fans to voice concern over Addazio's ability to lead the team to another bowl game. However, the Eagles finished the year with a 6-2 regular season record, highlighted by stellar play from freshman running back [[AJ Dillon]]. Dillon had a breakout game on October 14th, 2017, when the Eagles visited the [[Louisville Cardinals football]] and defeated them 45-42 on the road. Dillon posted 272 yards on 39 carries for 4 touchdowns, including a highlight reel stiff arm that led to a 75-yard touchdown. On October 27th, 2017, the Eagles hosted the [[Florida State Seminoles football]] for the annual [[Welles Crowther]] Red Bandana game, winning by a score of 35-3. This marked the largest margin of victory in a Boston College win between the two schools. The next week the Eagles lost their starting quarterback, redshirt freshman [[Anthony Brown (quarterback)|Anthony Brown]], to an ACL tear in a home loss to [[NC State Wolfpack football]]. However, the Eagles still won their final two regular season games, posting wins over rival programs [[Uconn Huskies football]] and [[Syracuse Orange football]]. Boston College was again invited to the [[Pinstripe Bowl]], where they lost to Iowa 20-27. Following the season, AJ Dillon was awarded both the ACC Rookie of the Year and the ACC Offensive Rookie of the Year awards, following his 1,589 yard, 14 touchdown campaign. This was the first time in school history that either award had been won.\n\n'''Return to AP Ranking:''' Heading into the 2018 season, Addazio's team received the most media coverage they had seen in years. In fact, ESPN picked them as the team most likely to hit their pre-season predicted win total (6.5), which they eventually did. The reason for this new wave of excitement on Chestnut Hill was clear: Eagles had finished the previous season winning 6 of their final 9 games, and were returning all but 1 defensive starter. The Eagles started the season 3-0, with wins over [[UMass Minutemen football]], long time rival [[Holy Cross football]], and ACC rival [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons football]]. This hot start, combined with the pre-season media attention, found the Eagles back in the AP's Top 25 for the first time since the 2008 season, as they were ranked #23. However, BC fell out of the rankings as quickly as they entered, as they were beaten 13-30 by a previously winless Purdue team on the road the following week. The Eagles showed resilience, bouncing back from a close loss to [[NC State Wolfpack football]], by beating ACC opponents [[Louisville Cardinals football]] and [[Miami Hurricanes football]]. Following their win over the Hurricanes, the BC found themselves back in the Top 25, ranked #24, as they headed to Blacksburg, VA to face longtime rival [[Virginia Tech football]]. Following a 31-21 victory, their 7th of the season, Boston College was chosen to host [[College GameDay (football TV program)]] before their home contest against undefeated [[Clemson football]], the first time College GameDay had been to Chestnut Hill since 2009. BC rose to #17 in the AP poll following the Clemson game. Yet, the Eagles fell to eventual National Champion Clemson 7-27, after their starting quarterback [[Anthony Brown (quarterback)|Anthony Brown]] was injured on the Eagle's first possession. Steve Addazio and his team were unable to break the 7 win mark, as they lost the last two games of the regular season, including a heartbreaking loss to [[Florida State football]] following a Hail Mary in the final 2 minutes of the game. After the season, Boston College was invited to the [[2018 First Responder Bowl]] in Dallas, Texas, where they were set to face #25 [[Boise State football]]. The Eagles came out strong, scoring first to take a 7-0 lead. However, due to poor weather conditions in Dallas, the game was ultimately cancelled, causing coach Addazio to stay at 7 wins. Boston College finished the season with a 7-5 record (4-4 ACC). Despite his injury, [[AJ Dillon]] posted another 1,000+ season, the first time in program history a player had recorded back-to-back 1,000 seasons. \n\nBC then said goodbye to one of their most successful senior classes in program history, as 4 players were selected in the 7 round [[2019 NFL Draft]], including the 14th overall pick [[Chris Lindstrom]]. This marked the 3rd time in school history that 4+ players were selected in the NFL Draft, following 2014 and 1995. Additionally, 10 other BC players signed Unsigned Free Agent (UFA) contracts with NFL teams, a testament to the Player Development abilities by the BC coaching staff.\n\n=== Jeff Hafley era (2020\u2013present) ===\nBoston College fired Addazio on December 1, 2019 after a 6\u20136 season and a 44\u201344 record over 7 seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28204922/boston-college-dismisses-steve-addazio-7-seasons|title=Boston College fires Addazio after seven seasons|date=2019-12-01|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> On December 14, 2019, Jeff Hafley, the co-defensive coordinator and secondary coach at Ohio State, was named the 36th head coach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bceagles.com/news/2019/12/14/boston-college-names-jeff-hafley-head-football-coach.aspx|title=Boston College Names Jeff Hafley Head Football Coach|website=Boston College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28295914/boston-college-names-ohio-state-assistant-jeff-hafley-new-coach|title=BC names Ohio State assistant Hafley new coach|date=2019-12-14|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref> Hafley had been named the 2019 Defensive Coordinator of the Year by 247Sports and ranked fourth nationally on its recruiter rankings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Article/Jeff-Hafley-Ohio-State-football-defensive-coordinator--140229946/|title=Jeff Hafley is the 247Sports Defensive Coordinator of the Year|website=247Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n==Conference affiliations==\n* [[NCAA Division I-A independent schools|Independent]] (1892\u20131972)\n* [[NCAA Division I-A independent schools|Division I Independent]] (1973\u20131977)\n* [[NCAA Division I-A independent schools|Division I-A Independent]] (1978\u20131990)\n* [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] (1991\u20132004)\n* [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (2005\u2013present)\n\n==Championships==\n\n===National championships===\nPerhaps the best football team in Boston College history, the undefeated 1940 Eagles (11-0) won the [[1941 Sugar Bowl]] over previously unbeaten Tennessee.

The MVP of the game receives a replica leather helmet.

The first game played between the two schools took place in 1899 and was played at a neutral location. Boston College won 18\u20130.<ref name=\"mcubed.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcubed.net/ncaaf/series/umass/bc.shtml|title=mcubed.net : NCAAF Football : Series records : Massachusetts vs. Boston College|website=www.mcubed.net}}</ref> At the time, UMass was known as Massachusetts Agricultural College. The relative proximity between the schools encouraged them to schedule additional matches in the subsequent years.\n\nBC and UMass met again in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]] in 1901, 1902, and 1912, with UMass winning all three contests before the series was halted.<ref name=\"mcubed.net\"/> The two universities did not meet again on the football field until 1966, when they began a seventeen-year series in which the teams would play each other in the last week of UMass' football season. UMass was in a lower division than BC during the entirety of the rivalry. As such, Boston College dominated the stretch, winning 15 of the 17 games, routinely blowing out the overmatched Minutemen.\n\nAfter 22 years, the rivalry was renewed as UMass traveled to [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]] to play Boston College once again. UMass was yet again outmatched, losing 29\u20137. The universities agreed to play two more times over the next seven years, and Boston College won both games easily.\n\nIn April 2011, UMass announced plans to join the [[Mid-American Conference]] and move up to the [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division 1-A#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]], the highest level of college football in the country. Boston College had been a member of this division for decades, and there was much speculation that the two schools may cultivate a renewal of the rivalry. This was confirmed when it was reported in September, 2011, that they had agreed to play a three-game biannual series beginning in 2014.<ref>http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/09/26/jesse-julmiste-sets-umass-record-for-kickoff-returns</ref> Two of the games will be played at BC's [[Alumni Stadium]] and the other will be held at [[Gillette Stadium]].\n\nBoston College is currently on a 10-game winning streak vs UMass, dating back to 1979.\n\n===Notre Dame===\n{{main article|Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)}}\n{{see also|Frank Leahy Memorial Bowl|Ireland Trophy|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries#Boston College}}\n\nIn recent years, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] has become one of BC's football rivals. Today, ND is the only other [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] [[university]] playing [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I FBS]] football. The match up was dubbed the \"[[Holy War (Boston College vs. Notre Dame)|Holy War]]\" in 1975, and has acquired a number of other nicknames over the years. The two teams battle for the [[Frank Leahy Memorial Bowl]] and the [[Ireland Trophy]]. \n\nThe Eagles and the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Fighting Irish]] have met once in the postseason; [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] defeated [[Boston College]] in the 1983 [[Liberty Bowl]] by a score of 19\u201318.

The teams first played in 1924 and started playing an annual game in 1961. In 2004, the Eagles last year in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]], the Orange pulled off a surprising upset that kept the Eagles from going to their first [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] game. BC's departure from the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]] put the future of the rivalry in doubt. However, the Eagles and the [[Syracuse Orange football|Orange]] agreed to play an annual out-of-conference game through 2021. In 2010, the Eagles won the first meeting between the schools since 2004 by a score of 16\u20137. In September 2011, the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] announced that they had accepted bids by [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pitt]] to become the 13th and 14th members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/6988468/acc-accepts-pittsburgh-panthers-syracuse-orange-14-team-league |title=ACC Adding Big East's Syracuse, Pitt |date=September 19, 2011 |first=Heather |last=Dinich |publisher=ESPN.com}}</ref> [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]]'s admission into the ACC in 2013 reignited this storied rivalry. In both school's final regular season game, Boston College had a chance to return the favor from 2004, and prevent the 5-6 Orange from becoming bowl-eligible. Despite the Eagles taking a 31-27 lead with nearly 2 minutes and no time-outs remaining, Syracuse managed to score a touchdown with 6 seconds left, sealing the win and their 6th of the season, becoming the 11th ACC bowl-eligible team of the year. The Eagles returned the favor the following year, winning a 28\u20137 contest in Chestnut Hill on senior day.\n\n[[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] currently leads the all-time series 31\u201320.{{when|date=January 2018}}{{CN|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Holy Cross===\n{{main article|Boston College\u2013Holy Cross football rivalry}}\nBoston College and [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Holy Cross]] have a dormant rivalry dating back to 1896, and have met 83 times on the field.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

The first part of the conflict was a series of Huilliche attacks on Spanish settlers and missions in the frontier next to [[Bueno River]].
