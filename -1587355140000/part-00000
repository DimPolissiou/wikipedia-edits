When joined by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]] as a fourth member, they are called '''Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young''' ('''CSNY'''). They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies, often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on [[Music of the United States|American music]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|culture]]. \n\nCSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally in July of that year, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave [[The Byrds]] in late 1967, and Stills' band [[Buffalo Springfield]] had broken up in early 1968; Nash left his band [[The Hollies]] in December, and by early 1969 the trio had signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Their first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969, from which came two [[Top 40]] hits, \"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]. In order to tour the album, the trio hired drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and session bassist [[Greg Reeves]], though they still needed a keyboardist;  [[Ahmet Ertegun]] suggested [[Neil Young]], who had played with Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and after some initial reluctance, the trio agreed, signing him on as a full member. The band, now named Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, started their tour, and played their second gig at [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning hours of August 18, 1969. The first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', reached number one in several international charts in 1970, and remains their best selling album, going on to sell over 8 million copies with three hit singles. Four singles were released from the album including \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11], \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16], and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]. The group's second tour, which produced the live double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'' (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by [[John Barbata]], and tensions with Stills, which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band. At the end of the tour the band split up.  The group have since reunited several times, sometimes with and sometimes without Young, and have released eight studio and four live albums. \n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups (Crosby for [[the Byrds]], Stills for [[Buffalo Springfield]] and Nash for [[the Hollies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/alphabetical/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> Neil Young has also been inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield. They have not made a group studio album since 1999's ''[[Looking Forward]]'', and are inactive as of 2020. Whether or not this break is permanent remains to be seen, as the group has often been inactive for years at a time.\n\n==History==\n===CSN Formation and debut album: July 1968 \u2013 May 1969===\nPrior to the formation of CSN, each member of the band had belonged to another prominent group. David Crosby played guitar, sang and wrote songs with [[the Byrds]]; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter in the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] (which also featured [[Neil Young]]); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer and songwriter with [[The Hollies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crosby-stills-nash-young-mn0000130036/biography|work=allmusic.com|author= William Ruhlmann|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Biography by William Ruhlmann}}</ref> \n\nCrosby had been sacked from the Byrds in October 1967 due to disagreements over his songwriting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kZBKDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT93#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=93|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|publisher=Hachette UK|date=23 Sep 2008 }}</ref> By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had disintegrated, and after aiding in putting together the band's final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', Stills was without a band. Stills and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming. The result of one encounter in Florida on Crosby's [[schooner]] was the song \"[[Wooden Ships]]\", composed in collaboration with another guest, [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 65</ref> Graham Nash had been introduced to Crosby when the Byrds had toured the United Kingdom in 1966, and when the Hollies ventured to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with him.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 103</ref> At a party in July 1968 at [[Joni Mitchell]]'s house, Nash asked Stills and Crosby to repeat their performance of a new song by Stills, \"You Don't Have To Cry\", with Nash improvising a third part harmony.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 72\u20133</ref> The vocals gelled, and the three realized that they had a very good vocal chemistry. It is disputed by members of the group whether it was at the house of Joni Mitchell or [[Cass Elliot]]. Stephen Stills recalls that it was at the house of Cass Elliot \u2013 he would have been too intimidated to sing as a group in front of Joni Mitchell for the first time. Nash and Crosby insist that the location was Joni Mitchell's home.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/02/laurel-canyon-music-scene|title=An Oral History of Laurel Canyon, the Sixties and Seventies Music Mecca|author=Lisa Robinson|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCreatively frustrated with the Hollies, Nash decided to quit the band in December 1968, and flew to Los Angeles two days later. The trio stayed in London in early 1969 to rehearse for what turned out to be an unsuccessful audition with [[The Beatles]]' [[Apple Records]]. However, back in California, [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]], who had been a fan of Buffalo Springfield and was disappointed by that band's demise signed them to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 144.</ref> From the outset, given their previous experiences, the trio decided not to be locked into a group structure. They used their surnames as identification to ensure independence and a guarantee that the band could not continue without one of them, unlike both the Byrds and the Hollies. They picked up a management team in [[Elliot Roberts]] and [[David Geffen]], who got them signed to Atlantic and would help to gain clout for the group in the industry.<ref>McDonough, p. 252.</ref> Roberts kept the band focused and dealt with egos, while Geffen handled the business deals, since, in Crosby's words, they needed a \"shark\" and Geffen was it.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pg. 79</ref>\n\nStills was already signed to Atlantic Records through his Buffalo Springfield contract. Crosby had been released from his Byrds deal with Columbia, as he was considered to be unimportant and too difficult to work with. Nash, however, was still signed to [[Epic Records]] through The Hollies. Ertegun worked out a deal with [[Clive Davis]] to essentially trade Nash to Atlantic in exchange for [[Richie Furay]] (who was also signed to Atlantic by virtue of his membership in Buffalo Springfield) and [[Poco]], his new band.<ref>Robert Greenfield. ''The Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegun.'' Simon and Schuster. 2011. 202-3.</ref>\n\nThe trio's first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969. The eponymously titled album was a major hit in the United States, peaking at #6 on the ''Billboard'' album chart during a 107-week stay that spawned two [[Top 40]] hits (\"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]) and significant airplay on [[FM radio]]. The album ultimately earned a RIAA [[platinum album|triple platinum]] certification in 1999 and [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=379|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=305|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=crosby,%20stills&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> With the exceptions of drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker \"Captain Many Hands\" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact.\n\n===CSNY, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu to 4 Way Street: August 1969 \u2013 April 1971===\nRetaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist [[Steve Winwood]], who was already occupied with the newly formed group [[Blind Faith]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 92</ref> Erteg\u00fcn suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 163\u20134</ref> Stills and Nash initially held reservations; Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield, and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. But after several meetings, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner. The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].\n\nThey initially completed the rhythm section with former Buffalo Springfield bassist [[Bruce Palmer]]. However, Palmer was let go due to his persistent personal problems following rehearsals at the [[Cafe au Go Go]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]; according to Crosby, \"Bruce Palmer was into [[drug injection|another instrument]] and his head was not where it should have been.\"<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\">Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94</ref> Teenaged [[Motown]] session bassist [[Greg Reeves]] joined in Palmer's place at the recommendation of [[Rick James]], a friend of the band.<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\"/>\n\nWith Young on board, the restructured group embarked on a four-leg, 39-date tour that ended with three European concerts in January 1970. Their first gig was on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] the next day, but that they had no idea where that was. Their one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969, was a [[baptism by fire]]. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, \"This is only the second time we've performed in front of people. We're scared shitless.\" Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]],''<ref>Neil Young is notably absent from the documentary film. In an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeEWMnRcrTY interview in 2000 for VH1], he revealed that he objected to being photographed at close quarters, so the cameras avoided him. In February 2019, [https://www.jambase.com/article/woodstock-documentary-bill-gerber-neil-young-janis-joplin it was reported] that plans to release a restored version of the film would include footage of Young.</ref> along with recording the Joni Mitchell [[Woodstock (song)|song memorializing Woodstock]], boosted the visibility of the quartet. CSNY appeared at other prominent festivals that year. Footage from two performances from the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (held on the grounds of the [[Esalen Institute]] on September 13\u201314, 1969) appears in the movie ''[[Celebration at Big Sur]]''. They also appeared at the violence-plagued [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969 alongside [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and the headlining [[Rolling Stones]]. At the band's request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970).\n\nGreat anticipation had built for the expanded supergroup and their first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', which arrived in stores in March 1970. It topped the charts during a 97-week stay in the United States and generated three hit singles, including the Stills-sung cover of Mitchell's \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11] and both of Nash's contributions (\"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16] and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]). Certified [[Multi-platinum|septuple platinum]] by [[RIAA]], the album's domestic sales currently sit at over 8 million copies; as of 2017, it remains the highest-selling album of each member's career.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?/topic/106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales/|title=NEIL YOUNG, BOB SEGER and CROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG.....USA album sales|website=Greasy Lake Community}}</ref> ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' was also the first release on the Atlantic Records SD-7200 \"superstar\" line, created by the label for its highest-profile artists; subsequent solo albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash would be the next releases in this series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlantic7200.html |title=Atlantic Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 \"because [he] suddenly decided he was an [[Apache]] [[witch doctor]].\"<ref name=csn124>''Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography''.

We'll sing any song if it's great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player.\"<ref name=csn124 /> He was replaced by Calvin \"Fuzzy\" Samuels, a homeless Jamaican musician recently discovered by Stills at [[Island Records]]' London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band's tempos during the first tour and ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the [[Denver Coliseum]] on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor would later assert that his dismissal served as a proxy for renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves' firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer [[John Barbata]] (formerly of [[The Turtles]]) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings. A week before the Denver performance, Young and Crosby were staying at a house near [[San Francisco]] when reports of the [[Kent State shootings]] arrived, inspiring Young to write the protest song \"[[Ohio (1970 song)|Ohio]]\". Recorded and rush-released weeks later with the new rhythm section, it peaked at #14 in August 1970, providing another American [[Top 20]] hit for the group.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 127</ref>\n\nAs the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills' alcohol and [[cocaine]] abuse and perceived [[megalomania]], culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the [[Fillmore East]] when he was informed that [[Bob Dylan]] was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to fire Stills during a two-night stint at Chicago's [[Auditorium Theatre]] in July 1970. Following his reinstatement, the tour ended as scheduled in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] on July 9, 1970; however, the group broke up immediately thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-actual-honest-to-god-reunion-of-crosby-stills-and-nash-19770602|title=The Actual, Honest-to-God Reunion of Crosby, Stills and Nash|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/wild-tales-graham-nash-opens-sex-drugs-music-behind-crosby-stills-nash-young-article-1.1442620|title=In 'Wild Tales,' Graham Nash opens up about sex, drugs and music behind Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|website=Nydailynews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970|title=Sugar Mountain|website=Sugarmtn.org}}</ref> Concert recordings from that tour assembled by Nash produced the 1971 double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'', which also topped the charts during a 42-week stay. Although they would continue to collaborate in various and largely ephemeral permutations, the four members would not come back together in earnest until their 1974 reunion tour.\n\n===Individual activity===\n{{main|David Crosby|Stephen Stills|Graham Nash|Neil Young}}\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' in September (which peaked at #8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" [#33]); Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|eponymous debut]] in November; Crosby's ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]'' in February, and Nash's ''[[Songs for Beginners]]'' in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Stills' entry (including two Top 40 hits, \"Love the One You're With\" [#14] and \"Sit Yourself Down\" [#37]) peaked the highest at #3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's ''[[Stephen Stills 2]]'', which included two minor hits (\"Change Partners\" [#43]; \"Marianne\" [#42]) and peaked at #8. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release ''[[Another Stoney Evening]]''.\n\n1972 proved to be another fruitful year for all the band members in their solo or duo efforts. Young achieved solo superstardom with the chart-topping ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' and two Top 40 singles, the #1 hit \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" and \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" (#31). Stills joined with former [[The Byrds|Byrd]] [[Chris Hillman]] to form the band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]], releasing a self-titled double album; although it did not generate any significant hits, counting the three CSN/CSNY records, ''[[Manassas (album)|Manassas]]'' became Stills' sixth Top Ten album in a row, peaking at #4. Nash and Young released Young's \"[[War Song]]\" as a joint single to support [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign; despite their intentions, the single failed to make a serious impression. Meanwhile, Nash and Crosby's touring was so successful and pleasant for them that they recorded and released their first album as a duo, ''[[Graham Nash David Crosby]]'', which eclipsed their recent solo efforts with a Top 40 hit (Nash's \"[[Immigration Man]]\" [#36]) while also peaking at #4.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 151</ref>\n\nThe group members fared less well in 1973. Young recorded two dark albums. The first, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', chronicled his winter tour that followed the death of his Crazy Horse bandmate [[Danny Whitten]] from an alcohol/[[Valium]] overdose, a tour Crosby and Nash joined mid-way. A critical success despite his personal misgivings, it attained a RIAA gold certification before stalling at #22. The second album, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'', was so dark that [[Reprise Records]] refused to release it until 1975. Although it is widely regarded as his [[magnum opus]], it only reached #25. Crosby spearheaded and produced a [[Byrds (album)|reunion album]] of the original Byrds quintet which was a notable critical failure upon its release in March 1973. The most commercially successful Byrds album since 1966, it sold only marginally well by CSNY's standards, peaking at #20. Stills released a [[Down the Road (Manassas album)|second Manassas record]] in April 1973 and Nash recorded his [[Wild Tales (album)|second solo album]] (released in January 1974); again, neither disc sold to expectations, peaking respectively at #26 and #34.\n\n===CSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973 \u2013 1976===\n[[Image:CSNY 8-1974 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Stills (left), Crosby and Nash in 1974]]\n\nIn June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled ''Human Highway''. However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's [[Winterland Ballroom]] in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-04-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-07-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref> Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=crosby+stills+nash+the+biography&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD8avLgrTWAhWDw4MKHXxCA48Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22big+tour%22&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> The quartet [[CSNY 1974|reassembled]] in earnest that summer, with sidemen [[Tim Drummond]] on bass, [[Russ Kunkel]] on drums, and [[Joe Lala]] on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near [[Woodside, California]] before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.\n\nThe tour was directed by San Francisco-based impresario [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]].

Under the stewardship of Graham's production company, the tour was plagued by profligate spending, exemplified by a litany of pillowcases embroidered with the band's new Mitchell-designed logo and the routine chartering of helicopters and private jets in lieu of ground transportation. Nash would later recall that \"the tour made just over eleven million dollars, which of course was a lot of money in those days. We all got less than a half million each. It was obvious that between Bill Graham, the promoters and a bunch of others, they all had a good time. Let's just put it that way.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/> According to road manager Chris O'Dell, \"One time they spilled cocaine on the carpet.

While Nash viewed the re-shuffling of items from only two albums and one single (typified by the exclusion of his \"Marrakesh Express\", a Top 40 hit) as absurd, it eventually topped the ''Billboard'' album chart in November.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 176</ref>\n\nAlthough tensions were high between Crosby, Stills and Young, the band reconvened at the [[Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito, California]] with [[The Albert Brothers]] in November to finish the long-gestating follow-up to ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu''. While several songs were completed and recorded (including Young's \"Human Highway\", still envisioned as the provisional title track; a take of Crosby's \"Homeward Through the Haze\" with Crosby on piano and [[Lee Sklar]] on bass; and Nash's [[anti-whaling]] opus \"Wind on the Water\"), Young left once again following a tumultuous argument. While Crosby, Stills and Nash (augmented by a variety of session musicians, including Sklar, Kunkel and [[Grateful Dead]] drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) attempted to complete the album as a trio effort, the feud between Stills and Nash resurfaced, resulting in Stills destroying the master of \"Wind on the Water\" with a razor blade after Crosby and Nash objected to a harmony part on Stills' \"Guardian Angel\". Even though Stills characterized the razor blade incident as a joke, the sessions promptly dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=csn%20dave%20zimmer&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiftfnptp_SAhWJjFQKHYdwDesQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=homeward%20through%20the%20haze&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash signed a separate contract with [[ABC Records]] and began to tour regularly again, playing a more intimate array of sports arenas, outdoor festivals and theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:%28Crosby+%26+Nash%29+date:%5B1975-01-01+TO+1975-12-31%5D |title=Search for setlists: artist:(Crosby & Nash) date:[1975-01-01 TO 1975-12-31 |publisher=setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> During this period they produced two studio albums, ''[[Wind on the Water]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Whistling Down the Wire]]'' in 1976, and the 1977 concert album ''[[Crosby-Nash Live]]''. Along with Drummond (retained from the 1974 CSNY tour), they continued to use the sidemen from the ensemble known as [[The Section (band)|The Section]] from their first LP. This crack session group (wryly rechristened The Mighty Jitters by Crosby) contributed to records by a myriad of other Los Angeles-based artists in the seventies, such as [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. Throughout the mid-70s, Crosby and Nash also lent their harmonies to hits like Taylor's \"Mexico\" and Joni Mitchell's \"[[Free Man in Paris]]\".\n\nMeanwhile, Stills and Young returned to their own careers. They briefly united for a one-off album and tour credited to the Stills-Young Band, ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (1976). Although the [[Miami]]-based sessions briefly metamorphosed into the third attempt at a CSNY reunion album, Stills and Young wiped the vocal contributions of the other pair off the [[master recording|master tape]] when Crosby & Nash were obligated to leave the sessions to finish their own ''Whistling Down the Wire'' in Los Angeles.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 185\u20136</ref> As Stills and Young embarked on a tour to promote the album in the summer of 1976, the old tensions between the pair resurfaced, exacerbated by Stills' insistence that professional studio musicians back them rather than Young's preferred Crazy Horse. After a July 20, 1976, show in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], Young's tour bus took a different direction from Stills'. Waiting at their next stop in [[Atlanta]], Stills received a laconic telegram: \"Dear Stephen, Funny how things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.\"<ref>McDonough, pp. 501\u20132</ref> Young's management claimed that he was under doctor's orders to rest and recover from an apparent throat infection. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour alone, though Young would make up dates with Crazy Horse later in the year.\n\n===CSN reform: 1976 \u2013 1985===\n\nLater in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash at one of their concerts in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio. \n\nLess than a year after reforming, Crosby, Stills & Nash released ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]''. Recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami under the auspices of Ron and Howard Albert throughout late 1976 and early 1977, the album exemplified the meticulously stylized [[soft rock]] production ethos of the epoch and contained the band's highest-charting single, Nash's \"[[Just a Song Before I Go]]\" (#7); Stills' \"Fair Game\" also peaked at #43. The album peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the summer of 1977 during a 33-week stay, remaining at that position for the month of August and ultimately earning a RIAA [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification behind one of the best-selling LPs of all time, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/csn-mw0000676437/awards |title=CSN \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1977-06-17 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> As of 2017, it remains the trio configuration's best-selling album, outselling their debut by 200,000 records.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\"/>\n\nOn June 21, 1978, Crosby, Stills & Nash received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry, located at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/crosby-stills-and-nash|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/crosby-stills-nash/|title=Crosby Stills & Nash \u2013 Hollywood Star Walk \u2013 Los Angeles Times|website=Projects.latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful arena tours in 1977 and 1978, further work as a group was complicated by Crosby's newfound dependence on [[Crack cocaine|freebase cocaine]]. ''[[Earth & Sky (album)|Earth & Sky]]'', a 1980 Nash album, was envisaged as a Crosby & Nash project following aborted 1978 CSN sessions until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam because his freebase pipe had fallen off of an amp and broken.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 314</ref>\n\nStills and Nash convened in 1980\u20131981 to record ''[[Daylight Again]]'' as a self-funded duo; however, Atlantic Records executives refused to reimburse their expenses or release the LP until Crosby was reinstated.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 353\u20134</ref> Crosby contributed \"Delta\" (his last original composition for several years) and a cover of [[Judy Henske]] and [[Craig Doerge]]'s \"Might as Well Have a Good Time\" along with some additional vocals on other tracks. Despite Crosby's condition and the relatively d\u00e9mod\u00e9 nature of the group in the wake of the ascendancy of [[new wave]] and [[contemporary R&B]], ''Daylight Again'' reached #8 in 1982 during a 41-week chart stay. The album contained two major hits, Nash's \"Wasted on the Way\" (#9) and Stills' \"[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]\" (#18); Stills' \"Too Much Love to Hide\" also charted at #69. While the album ultimately failed to sell as well as its predecessors in the new musical climate, it received a RIAA platinum certification in early 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/daylight-again-mw0000189646/awards |title=Daylight Again \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |date=1982-06-21 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=daylight%20again#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the success of ''Daylight Again'' inaugurated a new tradition of near-annual touring that persisted for over thirty years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/crosby-stills-and-nash-33d6f8a1.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash Tour Statistics|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref> the bottom soon fell out for Crosby, who was arrested and jailed on drug and weapons charges in [[Texas]] in May 1982. Having recorded a potential title song for the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that was never used, the band released it as a single and hastily assembled concert recordings around two studio tracks for the album ''[[Allies (CSN album)|Allies]]'', their lowest-charting record to date.

The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (\"Laughter, Love and Music\") at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.\n\nCSN recorded two more studio albums in the 1990s, ''[[Live It Up (CSN album)|Live It Up]]'' (1990) and ''[[After the Storm (CSN album)|After the Storm]]'' (1994); both albums sold poorly by previous standards and failed to attain RIAA certifications. A [[CSN (box set)|box set]] arrived in 1991, four [[compact disc|discs]] of expected group highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Owing to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young's material earmarked for the box.  Ultimately, nineteen tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were credited to CSNY. The CSNY version of \"Human Highway\" leaked to the internet several years later.<ref>McDonough, p. 248</ref>\n\nIn 1994, CSN collaborated with [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] to contribute \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, ''[[Looking Forward]]''. The album was released at Young's behest via [[Reprise Records]] in October 1999. With writing credits mostly limited to band members and Young leveraging the ongoing success of his solo career by ensconcing himself as the first among equals with a plurality of songs, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at #26 (the group's highest chart placement since ''American Dream'') during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, ''Looking Forward'' was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major money-makers.\n\nCSN were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its members inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by comedian [[Phil Hartman]] during his first career as a graphic designer.\n\nVarious compilations of the band's configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and ''So Far'' being the most commercially successful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby's ''Voyage'' chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash's ''Reflections'' appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, ''[[Carry On (Stephen Stills album)|Carry On]]'', was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash.<ref>[http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211015258/http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm|date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:csny-06-tour.jpg|thumb|left|One of the backdrops during the 2006 \"Freedom of Speech\" tour, as shown here, was the photos of American soldiers who had died in the war in Iraq.]]\n\nIn 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young set off on their Freedom of Speech Tour in support of ''[[Living with War]]'', a Young solo album written in response to the [[Iraq War]].

Their first tour was as CSNY, and was a four-leg, 39-date tour that started  on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. Their second gig was a one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969. During that tour they also appeared at the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (September 13\u201314, 1969), and the notorious [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969.  The tour ended with three European concerts in January 1970.  They were accompanied on the tour by [[Greg Reeves]] on bass, and [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)| Dallas Taylor]] on drums. \n\nBefore the start of their second tour, Greg Reeves was replaced on bass by Calvin Samuels. The tour is notorious for the tensions within the band, and Dallas Taylor was fired, to be replaced by  [[John Barbata]] on drums, and Stephen Stills was temporarily sacked by the rest of the group.

When joined by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]] as a fourth member, they are called '''Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young''' ('''CSNY'''). They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies, often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on [[Music of the United States|American music]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|culture]]. \n\nCSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally in July of that year, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave [[The Byrds]] in late 1967, and Stills' band [[Buffalo Springfield]] had broken up in early 1968; Nash left his band [[The Hollies]] in December, and by early 1969 the trio had signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Their first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969, from which came two [[Top 40]] hits, \"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]. In order to tour the album, the trio hired drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and session bassist [[Greg Reeves]], though they still needed a keyboardist;  [[Ahmet Ertegun]] suggested [[Neil Young]], who had played with Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and after some initial reluctance, the trio agreed, signing him on as a full member. The band, now named Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, started their tour, and played their second gig at [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning hours of August 18, 1969. The first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', reached number one in several international charts in 1970, and remains their best selling album, going on to sell over 8 million copies three hit singles. Four singles were released from the album including \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11], \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16], and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]. The group's second tour, which produced the live double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'' (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by [[John Barbata]], and tensions with Stills, which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band. At the end of the tour the band split up.  The group have since reunited several times, sometimes with and sometimes without Young, and have released eight studio and four live albums. \n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups (Crosby for [[the Byrds]], Stills for [[Buffalo Springfield]] and Nash for [[the Hollies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/alphabetical/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> Neil Young has also been inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield. They have not made a group studio album since 1999's ''[[Looking Forward]]'', and are inactive as of 2020. Whether or not this break is permanent remains to be seen, as the group has often been inactive for years at a time.\n\n==History==\n===CSN Formation and debut album: July 1968 \u2013 May 1969===\nPrior to the formation of CSN, each member of the band had belonged to another prominent group. David Crosby played guitar, sang and wrote songs with [[the Byrds]]; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter in the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] (which also featured [[Neil Young]]); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer and songwriter with [[The Hollies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crosby-stills-nash-young-mn0000130036/biography|work=allmusic.com|author= William Ruhlmann|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Biography by William Ruhlmann}}</ref> \n\nCrosby had been sacked from the Byrds in October 1967 due to disagreements over his songwriting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kZBKDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT93#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=93|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|publisher=Hachette UK|date=23 Sep 2008 }}</ref> By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had disintegrated, and after aiding in putting together the band's final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', Stills was without a band. Stills and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming. The result of one encounter in Florida on Crosby's [[schooner]] was the song \"[[Wooden Ships]]\", composed in collaboration with another guest, [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 65</ref> Graham Nash had been introduced to Crosby when the Byrds had toured the United Kingdom in 1966, and when the Hollies ventured to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with him.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 103</ref> At a party in July 1968 at [[Joni Mitchell]]'s house, Nash asked Stills and Crosby to repeat their performance of a new song by Stills, \"You Don't Have To Cry\", with Nash improvising a third part harmony.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 72\u20133</ref> The vocals gelled, and the three realized that they had a very good vocal chemistry. It is disputed by members of the group whether it was at the house of Joni Mitchell or [[Cass Elliot]]. Stephen Stills recalls that it was at the house of Cass Elliot \u2013 he would have been too intimidated to sing as a group in front of Joni Mitchell for the first time. Nash and Crosby insist that the location was Joni Mitchell's home.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/02/laurel-canyon-music-scene|title=An Oral History of Laurel Canyon, the Sixties and Seventies Music Mecca|author=Lisa Robinson|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCreatively frustrated with the Hollies, Nash decided to quit the band in December 1968, and flew to Los Angeles two days later. The trio stayed in London in early 1969 to rehearse for what turned out to be an unsuccessful audition with [[The Beatles]]' [[Apple Records]]. However, back in California, [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]], who had been a fan of Buffalo Springfield and was disappointed by that band's demise signed them to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 144.</ref> From the outset, given their previous experiences, the trio decided not to be locked into a group structure. They used their surnames as identification to ensure independence and a guarantee that the band could not continue without one of them, unlike both the Byrds and the Hollies. They picked up a management team in [[Elliot Roberts]] and [[David Geffen]], who got them signed to Atlantic and would help to gain clout for the group in the industry.<ref>McDonough, p. 252.</ref> Roberts kept the band focused and dealt with egos, while Geffen handled the business deals, since, in Crosby's words, they needed a \"shark\" and Geffen was it.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pg. 79</ref>\n\nStills was already signed to Atlantic Records through his Buffalo Springfield contract. Crosby had been released from his Byrds deal with Columbia, as he was considered to be unimportant and too difficult to work with. Nash, however, was still signed to [[Epic Records]] through The Hollies. Ertegun worked out a deal with [[Clive Davis]] to essentially trade Nash to Atlantic in exchange for [[Richie Furay]] (who was also signed to Atlantic by virtue of his membership in Buffalo Springfield) and [[Poco]], his new band.<ref>Robert Greenfield. ''The Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegun.'' Simon and Schuster. 2011. 202-3.</ref>\n\nThe trio's first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969. The eponymously titled album was a major hit in the United States, peaking at #6 on the ''Billboard'' album chart during a 107-week stay that spawned two [[Top 40]] hits (\"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]) and significant airplay on [[FM radio]]. The album ultimately earned a RIAA [[platinum album|triple platinum]] certification in 1999 and [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=379|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=305|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=crosby,%20stills&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> With the exceptions of drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker \"Captain Many Hands\" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact.\n\n===CSNY, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu to 4 Way Street: August 1969 \u2013 April 1971===\nRetaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist [[Steve Winwood]], who was already occupied with the newly formed group [[Blind Faith]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 92</ref> Erteg\u00fcn suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 163\u20134</ref> Stills and Nash initially held reservations; Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield, and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. But after several meetings, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner. The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].\n\nThey initially completed the rhythm section with former Buffalo Springfield bassist [[Bruce Palmer]]. However, Palmer was let go due to his persistent personal problems following rehearsals at the [[Cafe au Go Go]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]; according to Crosby, \"Bruce Palmer was into [[drug injection|another instrument]] and his head was not where it should have been.\"<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\">Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94</ref> Teenaged [[Motown]] session bassist [[Greg Reeves]] joined in Palmer's place at the recommendation of [[Rick James]], a friend of the band.<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\"/>\n\nWith Young on board, the restructured group embarked on a four-leg, 39-date tour that ended with three European concerts in January 1970. Their first gig was on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] the next day, but that they had no idea where that was. Their one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969, was a [[baptism by fire]]. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, \"This is only the second time we've performed in front of people. We're scared shitless.\" Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]],''<ref>Neil Young is notably absent from the documentary film. In an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeEWMnRcrTY interview in 2000 for VH1], he revealed that he objected to being photographed at close quarters, so the cameras avoided him. In February 2019, [https://www.jambase.com/article/woodstock-documentary-bill-gerber-neil-young-janis-joplin it was reported] that plans to release a restored version of the film would include footage of Young.</ref> along with recording the Joni Mitchell [[Woodstock (song)|song memorializing Woodstock]], boosted the visibility of the quartet. CSNY appeared at other prominent festivals that year. Footage from two performances from the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (held on the grounds of the [[Esalen Institute]] on September 13\u201314, 1969) appears in the movie ''[[Celebration at Big Sur]]''. They also appeared at the violence-plagued [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969 alongside [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and the headlining [[Rolling Stones]]. At the band's request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970).\n\nGreat anticipation had built for the expanded supergroup and their first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', which arrived in stores in March 1970. It topped the charts during a 97-week stay in the United States and generated three hit singles, including the Stills-sung cover of Mitchell's \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11] and both of Nash's contributions (\"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16] and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]). Certified [[Multi-platinum|septuple platinum]] by [[RIAA]], the album's domestic sales currently sit at over 8 million copies; as of 2017, it remains the highest-selling album of each member's career.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?/topic/106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales/|title=NEIL YOUNG, BOB SEGER and CROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG.....USA album sales|website=Greasy Lake Community}}</ref> ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' was also the first release on the Atlantic Records SD-7200 \"superstar\" line, created by the label for its highest-profile artists; subsequent solo albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash would be the next releases in this series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlantic7200.html |title=Atlantic Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 \"because [he] suddenly decided he was an [[Apache]] [[witch doctor]].\"<ref name=csn124>''Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography''.

We'll sing any song if it's great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player.\"<ref name=csn124 /> He was replaced by Calvin \"Fuzzy\" Samuels, a homeless Jamaican musician recently discovered by Stills at [[Island Records]]' London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band's tempos during the first tour and ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the [[Denver Coliseum]] on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor would later assert that his dismissal served as a proxy for renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves' firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer [[John Barbata]] (formerly of [[The Turtles]]) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings. A week before the Denver performance, Young and Crosby were staying at a house near [[San Francisco]] when reports of the [[Kent State shootings]] arrived, inspiring Young to write the protest song \"[[Ohio (1970 song)|Ohio]]\". Recorded and rush-released weeks later with the new rhythm section, it peaked at #14 in August 1970, providing another American [[Top 20]] hit for the group.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 127</ref>\n\nAs the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills' alcohol and [[cocaine]] abuse and perceived [[megalomania]], culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the [[Fillmore East]] when he was informed that [[Bob Dylan]] was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to fire Stills during a two-night stint at Chicago's [[Auditorium Theatre]] in July 1970. Following his reinstatement, the tour ended as scheduled in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] on July 9, 1970; however, the group broke up immediately thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-actual-honest-to-god-reunion-of-crosby-stills-and-nash-19770602|title=The Actual, Honest-to-God Reunion of Crosby, Stills and Nash|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/wild-tales-graham-nash-opens-sex-drugs-music-behind-crosby-stills-nash-young-article-1.1442620|title=In 'Wild Tales,' Graham Nash opens up about sex, drugs and music behind Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|website=Nydailynews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970|title=Sugar Mountain|website=Sugarmtn.org}}</ref> Concert recordings from that tour assembled by Nash produced the 1971 double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'', which also topped the charts during a 42-week stay. Although they would continue to collaborate in various and largely ephemeral permutations, the four members would not come back together in earnest until their 1974 reunion tour.\n\n===Individual activity===\n{{main|David Crosby|Stephen Stills|Graham Nash|Neil Young}}\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' in September (which peaked at #8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" [#33]); Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|eponymous debut]] in November; Crosby's ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]'' in February, and Nash's ''[[Songs for Beginners]]'' in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Stills' entry (including two Top 40 hits, \"Love the One You're With\" [#14] and \"Sit Yourself Down\" [#37]) peaked the highest at #3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's ''[[Stephen Stills 2]]'', which included two minor hits (\"Change Partners\" [#43]; \"Marianne\" [#42]) and peaked at #8. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release ''[[Another Stoney Evening]]''.\n\n1972 proved to be another fruitful year for all the band members in their solo or duo efforts. Young achieved solo superstardom with the chart-topping ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' and two Top 40 singles, the #1 hit \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" and \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" (#31). Stills joined with former [[The Byrds|Byrd]] [[Chris Hillman]] to form the band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]], releasing a self-titled double album; although it did not generate any significant hits, counting the three CSN/CSNY records, ''[[Manassas (album)|Manassas]]'' became Stills' sixth Top Ten album in a row, peaking at #4. Nash and Young released Young's \"[[War Song]]\" as a joint single to support [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign; despite their intentions, the single failed to make a serious impression. Meanwhile, Nash and Crosby's touring was so successful and pleasant for them that they recorded and released their first album as a duo, ''[[Graham Nash David Crosby]]'', which eclipsed their recent solo efforts with a Top 40 hit (Nash's \"[[Immigration Man]]\" [#36]) while also peaking at #4.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 151</ref>\n\nThe group members fared less well in 1973. Young recorded two dark albums. The first, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', chronicled his winter tour that followed the death of his Crazy Horse bandmate [[Danny Whitten]] from an alcohol/[[Valium]] overdose, a tour Crosby and Nash joined mid-way. A critical success despite his personal misgivings, it attained a RIAA gold certification before stalling at #22. The second album, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'', was so dark that [[Reprise Records]] refused to release it until 1975. Although it is widely regarded as his [[magnum opus]], it only reached #25. Crosby spearheaded and produced a [[Byrds (album)|reunion album]] of the original Byrds quintet which was a notable critical failure upon its release in March 1973. The most commercially successful Byrds album since 1966, it sold only marginally well by CSNY's standards, peaking at #20. Stills released a [[Down the Road (Manassas album)|second Manassas record]] in April 1973 and Nash recorded his [[Wild Tales (album)|second solo album]] (released in January 1974); again, neither disc sold to expectations, peaking respectively at #26 and #34.\n\n===CSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973 \u2013 1976===\n[[Image:CSNY 8-1974 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Stills (left), Crosby and Nash in 1974]]\n\nIn June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled ''Human Highway''. However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's [[Winterland Ballroom]] in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-04-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-07-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref> Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=crosby+stills+nash+the+biography&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD8avLgrTWAhWDw4MKHXxCA48Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22big+tour%22&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> The quartet [[CSNY 1974|reassembled]] in earnest that summer, with sidemen [[Tim Drummond]] on bass, [[Russ Kunkel]] on drums, and [[Joe Lala]] on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near [[Woodside, California]] before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.\n\nThe tour was directed by San Francisco-based impresario [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]].

Crosby, in particular,  was disillusioned by the bombastic nature of the performances, which he collectively dubbed the \"Doom Tour\": \"We had good monitors, but Stephen and Neil were punching well over 100 db from their half stacks. Graham and I simply couldn't do the harmonies when we couldn't hear ourselves. Also, when you play a stadium you almost have to do a [[Mick Jagger]] where you wave a sash around and prance about. I can't quite do that. We did what we could, but I don't know how many people in the audience really got it. A lot of them were there for the tunes.

Under the stewardship of Graham's production company, the tour was plagued by profligate spending, exemplified by a litany of pillowcases embroidered with the band's new Mitchell-designed logo and the routine chartering of helicopters and private jets in lieu of ground transportation. Nash would later recall that \"the tour made just over eleven million dollars, which of course was a lot of money in those days. We all got less than a half million each. It was obvious that between Bill Graham, the promoters and a bunch of others, they all had a good time. Let's just put it that way.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/> According to road manager Chris O'Dell, \"One time they spilled cocaine on the carpet.

While Nash viewed the re-shuffling of items from only two albums and one single (typified by the exclusion of his \"Marrakesh Express\", a Top 40 hit) as absurd, it eventually topped the ''Billboard'' album chart in November.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 176</ref>\n\nAlthough tensions were high between Crosby, Stills and Young, the band reconvened at the [[Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito, California]] with [[The Albert Brothers]] in November to finish the long-gestating follow-up to ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu''. While several songs were completed and recorded (including Young's \"Human Highway\", still envisioned as the provisional title track; a take of Crosby's \"Homeward Through the Haze\" with Crosby on piano and [[Lee Sklar]] on bass; and Nash's [[anti-whaling]] opus \"Wind on the Water\"), Young left once again following a tumultuous argument. While Crosby, Stills and Nash (augmented by a variety of session musicians, including Sklar, Kunkel and [[Grateful Dead]] drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) attempted to complete the album as a trio effort, the feud between Stills and Nash resurfaced, resulting in Stills destroying the master of \"Wind on the Water\" with a razor blade after Crosby and Nash objected to a harmony part on Stills' \"Guardian Angel\". Even though Stills characterized the razor blade incident as a joke, the sessions promptly dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=csn%20dave%20zimmer&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiftfnptp_SAhWJjFQKHYdwDesQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=homeward%20through%20the%20haze&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash signed a separate contract with [[ABC Records]] and began to tour regularly again, playing a more intimate array of sports arenas, outdoor festivals and theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:%28Crosby+%26+Nash%29+date:%5B1975-01-01+TO+1975-12-31%5D |title=Search for setlists: artist:(Crosby & Nash) date:[1975-01-01 TO 1975-12-31 |publisher=setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> During this period they produced two studio albums, ''[[Wind on the Water]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Whistling Down the Wire]]'' in 1976, and the 1977 concert album ''[[Crosby-Nash Live]]''. Along with Drummond (retained from the 1974 CSNY tour), they continued to use the sidemen from the ensemble known as [[The Section (band)|The Section]] from their first LP. This crack session group (wryly rechristened The Mighty Jitters by Crosby) contributed to records by a myriad of other Los Angeles-based artists in the seventies, such as [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. Throughout the mid-70s, Crosby and Nash also lent their harmonies to hits like Taylor's \"Mexico\" and Joni Mitchell's \"[[Free Man in Paris]]\".\n\nMeanwhile, Stills and Young returned to their own careers. They briefly united for a one-off album and tour credited to the Stills-Young Band, ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (1976). Although the [[Miami]]-based sessions briefly metamorphosed into the third attempt at a CSNY reunion album, Stills and Young wiped the vocal contributions of the other pair off the [[master recording|master tape]] when Crosby & Nash were obligated to leave the sessions to finish their own ''Whistling Down the Wire'' in Los Angeles.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 185\u20136</ref> As Stills and Young embarked on a tour to promote the album in the summer of 1976, the old tensions between the pair resurfaced, exacerbated by Stills' insistence that professional studio musicians back them rather than Young's preferred Crazy Horse. After a July 20, 1976, show in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], Young's tour bus took a different direction from Stills'. Waiting at their next stop in [[Atlanta]], Stills received a laconic telegram: \"Dear Stephen, Funny how things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.\"<ref>McDonough, pp. 501\u20132</ref> Young's management claimed that he was under doctor's orders to rest and recover from an apparent throat infection. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour alone, though Young would make up dates with Crazy Horse later in the year.\n\n===CSN reform: 1976 \u2013 1985===\n\nLater in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash at one of their concerts in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio. \n\nLess than a year after reforming, Crosby, Stills & Nash released ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]''. Recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami under the auspices of Ron and Howard Albert throughout late 1976 and early 1977, the album exemplified the meticulously stylized [[soft rock]] production ethos of the epoch and contained the band's highest-charting single, Nash's \"[[Just a Song Before I Go]]\" (#7); Stills' \"Fair Game\" also peaked at #43. The album peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the summer of 1977 during a 33-week stay, remaining at that position for the month of August and ultimately earning a RIAA [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification behind one of the best-selling LPs of all time, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/csn-mw0000676437/awards |title=CSN \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1977-06-17 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> As of 2017, it remains the trio configuration's best-selling album, outselling their debut by 200,000 records.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\"/>\n\nOn June 21, 1978, Crosby, Stills & Nash received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry, located at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/crosby-stills-and-nash|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/crosby-stills-nash/|title=Crosby Stills & Nash \u2013 Hollywood Star Walk \u2013 Los Angeles Times|website=Projects.latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful arena tours in 1977 and 1978, further work as a group was complicated by Crosby's newfound dependence on [[Crack cocaine|freebase cocaine]]. ''[[Earth & Sky (album)|Earth & Sky]]'', a 1980 Nash album, was envisaged as a Crosby & Nash project following aborted 1978 CSN sessions until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam because his freebase pipe had fallen off of an amp and broken.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 314</ref>\n\nStills and Nash convened in 1980\u20131981 to record ''[[Daylight Again]]'' as a self-funded duo; however, Atlantic Records executives refused to reimburse their expenses or release the LP until Crosby was reinstated.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 353\u20134</ref> Crosby contributed \"Delta\" (his last original composition for several years) and a cover of [[Judy Henske]] and [[Craig Doerge]]'s \"Might as Well Have a Good Time\" along with some additional vocals on other tracks. Despite Crosby's condition and the relatively d\u00e9mod\u00e9 nature of the group in the wake of the ascendancy of [[new wave]] and [[contemporary R&B]], ''Daylight Again'' reached #8 in 1982 during a 41-week chart stay. The album contained two major hits, Nash's \"Wasted on the Way\" (#9) and Stills' \"[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]\" (#18); Stills' \"Too Much Love to Hide\" also charted at #69. While the album ultimately failed to sell as well as its predecessors in the new musical climate, it received a RIAA platinum certification in early 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/daylight-again-mw0000189646/awards |title=Daylight Again \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |date=1982-06-21 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=daylight%20again#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the success of ''Daylight Again'' inaugurated a new tradition of near-annual touring that persisted for over thirty years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/crosby-stills-and-nash-33d6f8a1.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash Tour Statistics|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref> the bottom soon fell out for Crosby, who was arrested and jailed on drug and weapons charges in [[Texas]] in May 1982. Having recorded a potential title song for the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that was never used, the band released it as a single and hastily assembled concert recordings around two studio tracks for the album ''[[Allies (CSN album)|Allies]]'', their lowest-charting record to date. Crosby was sentenced to two terms, but the conviction was overturned; arrested several more times, he finally turned himself in to the authorities in December 1985.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 438\u20139</ref> He would spend eight months in prison.\n\n===CSNY again: 1988 \u2013 present ===\n\nBased on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N9aLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA318#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=318|title=CSNY: Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young|author= Peter Doggett|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date= 2 Apr 2019}}</ref> Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by myriad health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band.<ref>McDonough, p. 625</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n38EhI2JaoC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=stills+freebase+american+dream&source=bl&ots=vISae80Ctk&sig=R4OpGLPLZ0Rj6jkQpfFDuJQl69E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LcHRUv_MFoLksASDwoCIDQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=stills%20freebase%20american%20dream&f=false |title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young ... \u2013 Barney Hoskyns \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref> It did make it to #16 on the ''Billboard'' chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (\"Laughter, Love and Music\") at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.\n\nCSN recorded two more studio albums in the 1990s, ''[[Live It Up (CSN album)|Live It Up]]'' (1990) and ''[[After the Storm (CSN album)|After the Storm]]'' (1994); both albums sold poorly by previous standards and failed to attain RIAA certifications. A [[CSN (box set)|box set]] arrived in 1991, four [[compact disc|discs]] of expected group highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Owing to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young's material earmarked for the box.  Ultimately, nineteen tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were credited to CSNY. The CSNY version of \"Human Highway\" leaked to the internet several years later.<ref>McDonough, p. 248</ref>\n\nIn 1994, CSN collaborated with [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] to contribute \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, ''[[Looking Forward]]''. The album was released at Young's behest via [[Reprise Records]] in October 1999. With writing credits mostly limited to band members and Young leveraging the ongoing success of his solo career by ensconcing himself as the first among equals with a plurality of songs, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at #26 (the group's highest chart placement since ''American Dream'') during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, ''Looking Forward'' was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major money-makers.\n\nCSN were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its members inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by comedian [[Phil Hartman]] during his first career as a graphic designer.\n\nVarious compilations of the band's configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and ''So Far'' being the most commercially successful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby's ''Voyage'' chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash's ''Reflections'' appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, ''[[Carry On (Stephen Stills album)|Carry On]]'', was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash.<ref>[http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211015258/http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm|date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:csny-06-tour.jpg|thumb|left|One of the backdrops during the 2006 \"Freedom of Speech\" tour, as shown here, was the photos of American soldiers who had died in the war in Iraq.]]\n\nIn 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young set off on their Freedom of Speech Tour in support of ''[[Living with War]]'', a Young solo album written in response to the [[Iraq War]].

With protest against the [[Vietnam War]] gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.\n\nAs a group, they recorded one hit song in response to political events although they recorded other political songs as solo artists and in various combinations.

The students were shot by [[Ohio National Guardsmen]] during an anti-war protest on the campus in May 1970.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jerry Lewis  |author2=Hensley Thomas |title=THE MAY 4 SHOOTINGS AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY: THE SEARCH  FOR HISTORICAL ACCURACY |url=http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/lewihen.htm |publisher=Dept.kent.edu |accessdate=12 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509131525/http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/LEWIHEN.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe release of \"[[Ohio (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Ohio]]\" marked the boldest musical statement made to that date regarding the [[Vietnam War]], calling out [[Richard Nixon]] by name and voicing the counterculture's rage and despair at the events. Between \"Ohio\", their appearance in both the festival and movie of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', and the runaway success of their two albums, the group found themselves in the position of enjoying a level of adulation far greater than experienced with their previous bands, as evidenced by the 27 Platinum certifications they received across seven albums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe band has been continuously associated with political causes throughout its existence, the latest example being the song \"Almost Gone (The Ballad of Bradley Manning)\" which focuses on the length and conditions of [[Chelsea Manning]]'s pre-trial confinement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/crosby-stills-nash-playing-hard-rock-148226345.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash playing Hard Rock|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>\n\nDespite their estrangement, Crosby,<ref>{{cite web|author=David Crosby|title=David Crosby on Twitter (30 Aug 2015)|url=https://twitter.com/thedavidcrosby/status/637808975279489024|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=David Crosby|title=David Crosby on Twitter (2 Jul 2015)|url=https://twitter.com/thedavidcrosby/status/616462823783313408|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> Nash,<ref name=\"SpinMedia\">{{cite web|author=Rachel Brodsky|title=Thurston Moore, Jeff Tweedy, Killer Mike, and More Sign Their Support For Bernie Sanders|url=http://www.spin.com/2015/09/thurston-moore-jeff-tweedy-killer-mike-bernie-sanders/|website=Spin.com|publisher=SpinMedia|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> and Young<ref name=\"SpinMedia\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Ben Kaye|title=Neil Young snubs Donald Trump, gives \"Rockin' in the Free World\" to Bernie Sanders|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/neil-young-snubs-donald-trump-gives-rockin-in-the-free-world-to-bernie-sanders/|website=Consequence of Sound|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> were all vocal in their support for [[2016 United States Presidential election|2016]] [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Presidential candidate]] [[Bernie Sanders]].\n\n==Influence==\n{{expand section|date=August 2019}}\n{{unsourced section|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe collective abilities allowed CSNY to straddle all the [[genre]]s of popular music eminent at the time, from [[country rock]] to confessional ballads, from acoustic guitars and voice to electric guitar, and three-part harmony. With [[The Beatles]]' break-up made public by April 1970, and with [[Bob Dylan]] in reclusive low-key activity since mid-1966, CSNY found itself as the adopted standard bearers for the [[Woodstock Nation]], serving an importance in society as counterculture figureheads equaled at the time in rock and roll only by [[The Rolling Stones]] or [[The Who]].

Their first tour was as CSNY, and was a four-leg, 39-date tour that started  on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. Their second gig was a one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969. During that tour they also appeared at the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (September 13\u201314, 1969), and the notorious [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969.  The tour ended with three European concerts in January 1970.  They were accompanied on the tour by [[Greg Reeves]] on bass, and [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)| Dallas Taylor]] on drums. \n\nBefore the start of their second tour, Greg Reeves was replaced on bass by Calvin Samuels. The tour is notorious for the tensions within the band, and Dallas Taylor was fired, to be replaced by  [[John Barbata]] on drums, and Stephen Stills was temporarily sacked by the rest of the group. The tour started in Denver Coliseum on 12 May 1970, and finished after 22 dates at the [[Met Center]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] on 9 July 1970, after which the group split up. The double live album ''[[4 Way Street]]'', released April 1971, was recorded at several dates on this tour.  \n\n\n'''[[CSNY 1974|1974 So Far Tour]]'''\n*Bass: [[Tim Drummond]]; Drums: [[Russ Kunkel]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[CSN (album)|1977 CSN Tour]]'''\n*Keyboards: [[Craig Doerge]] (replaced by Kim Bullard); Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: [[Joe Vitale (musician)| Joe Vitale]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[CSN (album)|1978 Tour]]'''\n*Keyboards: Kim Bullard; Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: [[Joe Vitale (musician)| Joe Vitale]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[No Nukes: The Muse Concerts for a Non-Nuclear Future| 1979 MUSE Concert]]'''\n*Keyboards: [[Craig Doerge]]; Bass: [[Tim Drummond]]; Drums: [[Russ Kunkel]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[Daylight Again| 1982 Daylight Again Tour]]'''\n*Guitar: Michael Stergis; Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Michael Hannah (Hannah replaced by [[James Newton Howard]]); Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: [[Joe Vitale (musician)| Joe Vitale]]; Percussion: Efrain Toro\n'''[[Allies (Crosby, Stills & Nash album)| 1983 Allies Tour]]'''\n*Guitar: Michael Stergis; Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Kim Bullard; Bass: [[Kenny Passarelli]]; Drums: Rick Jaeger; Percussion: Efrain Toro\n'''1984 Tour'''\n*Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Kim Bullard; Bass: [[Kenny Passarelli]] (replaced by [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]); Drums: [[Ian Wallace (drummer)| Ian Wallace]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''1985 Tour'''\n*Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Kim Bullard (Bullard replaced by [[Craig Doerge]]); Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: Mark T.

She was a four-year letter-winner in both [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]], and is the first woman to earn [[All-America]] honors in both [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] in the same year. She also led UCLA to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[volleyball]] titles in 1990 and 1991. She won the Honda-Broderick Award (now the [[Honda Sports Award]]) as the nation's best female collegiate volleyball player in both 1992 and 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collegiatewomensportsawards.com/archives/volleyball|title=Volleyball|website=CWSA|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n===UCLA statistics===\nSource<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sidearm.sites.s3.amazonaws.com/uclabruins.com/documents/2016/10/14/16_17WBB_UCLA.pdf|title=UCLA Media Guide|website=|access-date=2017-09-05}}</ref>\n{{NBA player statistics legend}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Team\n!GP\n!Points\n!FG%\n!FT%\n!RPG\n!APG\n!SPG\n!BPG\n!PPG\n|-\n|1993-94\n|UCLA\n|'''24'''\n|'''561'''\n|'''57.0%'''\n|51.7%\n|13.1\n|'''1.3'''\n|'''3.0'''\n|1.0\n|'''23.4'''\n|-\n|1992-93\n|UCLA\n|23\n|488\n|47.3%\n|'''74.8%'''\n|13.5\n|1.2\n|2.5\n|'''1.4'''\n|21.2\n|-\n|1991-92\n|UCLA\n|23\n|495\n|56.0%\n|63.1%\n|'''13.8'''\n|1.3\n|2.8\n|1.3\n|21.5\n|-\n|1990-91\n|UCLA\n|19\n|269\n|50.0%\n|67.0%\n|10.3\n|0.7\n|1.6\n|0.6\n|14.2\n|-\n|Career\n|UCLA\n|89\n|1813\n|52.8%\n|63.2%\n|12.8\n|1.1\n|2.5\n|1.1\n|20.4\n|}\n\n==ABL career==\nNatalie Williams played three seasons for the [[Portland Power (basketball)|Portland Power]] in the [[American Basketball League (1996\u20131998)|American Basketball League]] (ABL). She was traded to the [[Long Beach Stingrays]] in April 1998, but when the team folded, she was reassigned to the Power. She was a two-time All-ABL first team selection, the 1998 ABL M.V.P., finished her first season as the league's top rebounder, averaging 12.5 rebounds per game, and on January 9, 1998, she grabbed a league record 22 rebounds.\n\n==WNBA career==\nAfter the ABL folded, she was selected by her hometown team, the [[Utah Starzz]] in the first round (third pick overall) of the 1999 [[WNBA Draft]] on May 4, 1999.\n\nShe played with the Starzz from 1999 to 2002.
