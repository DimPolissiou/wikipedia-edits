The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters who are collectively known as Demons.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.
