Great Demon World Village|lead=yes}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] developed by [[Capcom]] and released as an [[arcade game]] in 1988, and subsequently [[porting|ported]] to a number of other platforms. It is the sequel to ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' and the second game in the ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' series.\n\n==Story==\n'''''Makaimura'''''\n\nOne storm filled evening, Knight Arthur and his love, Princess Prin Prin were enjoying a quite night in the cemetery together, when they were beset upon by a winged Satan. The Satan dove and captured the princess, and disappeared with her before Arthur's eyes. Without a moment's hesitation, Arthur donned his knight armor and picked up his lance, and set forth to Astaroth's castle where he knew he would find his abducted love.\n\n'''''Daimakaimura'''''\n\nThree years after those events, the Ghosts have returned with Ghouls for revenge, initiating a mortal holocaust on the Princess' kingdom as beams of light struck through countless villagers, when Sir. Arthur returns to the village, his rescue attempt was too soon as his beloved Princess Prin-Prin also has her soul taken away from her body infront of his very eyes. Now it's up to the heroic knight once again to slay his way to the hellish castle to defeat the evil Lucifer and his legion of demons and restore the souls of Prin-Prin and every mortal.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Ghouls_'n_Ghosts_Gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of gameplay in the arcade version.]]\nThe gameplay for ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' is similar to that of ''Ghosts 'n Goblins''. The player controls the [[knight]] [[Arthur (Ghosts 'n Goblins)|Arthur]], who must advance through a series of eerie levels and defeat a number of [[undead]] and demonic creatures in his quest to restore all the people killed by [[Lucifer]] ([[Loki]] in the English-language [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Master System]] versions), including his beloved Princess Prin-Prin, back to life. Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.\n\nBy jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless [[duck]]. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack, with the exception of the special weapon (see below).\n \nThere are six levels. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete levels 1 through 5 twice. Upon completing them the first time, Arthur is taken back to level 1, but this time a special weapon appears during the game. To enter Lucifer's chamber the player must have this special weapon equipped, and must have defeated the final Fly boss from level 5. After entering the final large door, the player goes directly to Lucifer's chamber.\n\n==Music==\nThe original soundtrack for the arcade version was composed by Tamayo Kawamoto. Many computer [[porting|ports]] of the game include the soundtrack by [[Tim Follin]] which consists of arrangements and some new songs. Follin's soundtrack \u2013 especially [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] (which both implement each machines' '[[chiptune]]' synthesizers, although the selection of pieces and some scoring differs slightly between computers) and [[Amiga]] versions (of which the playlist is again slightly different) \u2013 is respected among computer game music listeners and also gained appreciation from reviewers when the game was published.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tim Follin |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=51}}</ref>\n\n==Home versions==\n*Ports of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' were released in Europe in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. These ports were all handled by [[Software Creations]] and all omit a great deal of detail from the arcade version.\n*A [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] port of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' (programmed by [[Yuji Naka]]) was released by [[Sega]] in 1989 in Japan and North America, and in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] in Europe. This version was re-released as a [[handheld TV game]] with ''[[Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition]]'' in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] and as a downloadable [[Virtual Console]] game for the [[Wii]] in [[2007 in video gaming|2007]]. This version was also included on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n*Sega also released a [[Master System]] port in 1990. This version introduced a power-up system that allows the player to enter secret shops and upgrade parts of their armor. This includes helmets, which give the player access to new weapons and magic spells; chest armor, which allows the player to sustain more damage; and boots, which increase the player's speed.\n*A [[SuperGrafx]] port of ''Daimakaimura'' was released by [[NEC Avenue]] in 1990. This version was included on the [[TurboGrafx-16 Mini]] in 2020.\n*A version of ''Daimakaimura'' was released by Capcom in 1994 for the Sharp [[X68000]].\n*In [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], Capcom released ''[[Capcom Generations|Capcom Generation 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] in Japan, a compilation which included ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' along with ''Ghosts 'n Goblins'' and ''Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts''. The PlayStation version of this compilation was released as a bundle in Europe with three other volumes titled ''Capcom Generations'' (in plural) under the title of ''Capcom Generations: Chronicles of Arthur''.

Great Demon World Village|lead=yes}} is a [[side-scrolling]] [[platform game]] developed by [[Capcom]] and released as an [[arcade game]] in 1988, and subsequently [[porting|ported]] to a number of other platforms. It is the sequel to ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins (video game)|Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' and the second game in the ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]'' series.\n\n==Story==\n'''''Makaimura'''''\n\nOne storm filled evening, Knight Arthur and his love, Princess Prin Prin were enjoying a quite night in the cemetery together, when they were beset upon by a winged Satan. The Satan dove and captured the princess, and disappeared with her before Arthur's eyes. Without a moment's hesitation, Arthur donned his knight armor and picked up his lance, and set forth to Astaroth's castle where he knew he would find his abducted love.\n\n'''''Daimakaimura'''''\n\nThree years after those events, the Ghosts have returned with Ghouls for revenge, initiating a mortal holocaust on the Princess' kingdom as beams of light struck through countless villagers, when Sir. Arthur returns to the village, his rescue attempt was too soon as his beloved Princess Prin-Prin also has her soul taken away from her body infront of his very eyes. Now it's up to the heroic knight once again to slay his way to the hellish castle to defeat the evil Lucifer and his legion of demons and restore the souls of Prin-Prin and every mortal.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Ghouls_'n_Ghosts_Gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of gameplay in the arcade version.]]\nThe gameplay for ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' is similar to that of ''Ghosts 'n Goblins''. The player controls the [[knight]] [[Arthur (Ghosts 'n Goblins)|Arthur]], who must advance through a series of eerie levels and defeat a number of [[undead]] and demonic creatures in his quest to restore all the people killed by [[Lucifer]] ([[Loki]] in the English-language [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Master System]] versions), including his beloved Princess Prin-Prin, back to life. Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.\n\nBy jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil [[Magician (fantasy)|magician]] that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless [[duck]]. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack, with the exception of the special weapon (see below).\n \nThere are six levels. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete levels 1 through 5 twice. Upon completing them the first time, Arthur is taken back to level 1, but this time a special weapon appears during the game. To enter Lucifer's chamber the player must have this special weapon equipped, and must have defeated the final Fly boss from level 5. After entering the final large door, the player goes directly to Lucifer's chamber.\n\n==Music==\nThe original soundtrack for the arcade version was composed by Tamayo Kawamoto. Many computer [[porting|ports]] of the game include the soundtrack by [[Tim Follin]] which consists of arrangements and some new songs. Follin's soundtrack \u2013 especially [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] (which both implement each machines' '[[chiptune]]' synthesizers, although the selection of pieces and some scoring differs slightly between computers) and [[Amiga]] versions (of which the playlist is again slightly different) \u2013 is respected among computer game music listeners and also gained appreciation from reviewers when the game was published.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Tim Follin |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=3 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1995|page=51}}</ref>\n\n==Home versions==\n*Ports of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' were released in Europe in [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. These ports were all handled by [[Software Creations]] and all omit a great deal of detail from the arcade version.\n*A [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] port of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' (programmed by [[Yuji Naka]]) was released by [[Sega]] in 1989 in Japan and North America, and in [[1990 in video gaming|1990]] in Europe. This version was re-released as a [[handheld TV game]] with ''[[Street Fighter II: Special Champion Edition]]'' in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] and as a downloadable [[Virtual Console]] game for the [[Wii]] in [[2007 in video gaming|2007]]. This version was also included on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n*Sega also released a [[Master System]] port in 1990. This version introduced a power-up system that allows the player to enter secret shops and upgrade parts of their armor. This includes helmets, which give the player access to new weapons and magic spells; chest armor, which allows the player to sustain more damage; and boots, which increase the player's speed.\n*A [[SuperGrafx]] port of ''Daimakaimura'' was released by [[NEC Avenue]] in 1990. This version was included on the [[TurboGrafx-16 Mini]] in 2020.\n*A version of ''Daimakaimura'' was released by Capcom in 1994 for the Sharp [[X68000]].\n*In [[1998 in video gaming|1998]], Capcom released ''[[Capcom Generations|Capcom Generation 2]]'' for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] in Japan, a compilation which included ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' along with ''Ghosts 'n Goblins'' and ''Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts''. The PlayStation version of this compilation was released as a bundle in Europe with three other volumes titled ''Capcom Generations'' (in plural) under the title of ''Capcom Generations: Chronicles of Arthur''. Capcom later released in North America ''[[Capcom Classics Collection|Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] in [[2005 in video gaming|2005]] and ''Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in [[2006 in video gaming|2006]], which includes all the ''Capcom Generations'' titles. The emulation on a number of these compilations is slightly off, in that the screen display is too dark.\n*The arcade version of ''Ghouls 'n Ghosts'' was re-released as one of the included games on the Capcom Home Arcade console in 2019.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR    = SMD: 80%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/genesis/563325-ghouls-n-ghosts/index.html |title=Ghouls 'n Ghosts for Genesis |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925220034/https://www.gamerankings.com/genesis/563325-ghouls-n-ghosts/index.html |archive-date=2018-09-25 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| CVG   = 88%<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG%2FIssue097%2FPages%2FCVG09700077.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011151439/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG%2FIssue097%2FPages%2FCVG09700077.jpg |archive-date=2017-10-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| CRASH = 92%<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash%2FIssue71%2FPages%2FCrash7100057.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011151932/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=Crash%2FIssue71%2FPages%2FCrash7100057.jpg |archive-date=2017-10-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| SUser = 82%<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser%2FIssue093%2FPages%2FSinclairUser09300047.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011153032/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=SinclairUser%2FIssue093%2FPages%2FSinclairUser09300047.jpg |archive-date=2017-10-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| YSinclair = 91%<ref name=\"ysrnry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/ghoulsandghosts.htm|title=Ghouls And Ghosts|publisher=ysrnry.co.uk|accessdate=2015-09-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721184302/http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/ghoulsandghosts.htm|archivedate=2015-07-21}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[Zzap!64]]''\n| rev1Score = 96%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap100/100thspec5.html |title=Zzap!64 100th Issue Pull-Out Special Page 5 |publisher=Zzap64.co.uk |accessdate=2012-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204010725/http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap100/100thspec5.html |archive-date=2012-12-04 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[The Games Machine]]''\n| rev2Score = 90%<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=TheGamesMachine%2FIssue26%2FPages%2FTheGamesMachine2600022.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011153455/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=TheGamesMachine%2FIssue26%2FPages%2FTheGamesMachine2600022.jpg |archive-date=2017-10-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev3Score = 905<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ACE%2FIssue28%2FPages%2FACE2800068.jpg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011151717/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=ACE%2FIssue28%2FPages%2FACE2800068.jpg |archive-date=2017-10-11 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[MegaTech]]''\n| rev4Score = 93%<ref>MegaTech rating, [[EMAP]], issue 5, page 78, May 1992</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Mean Machines]]''\n| rev5Score = 92%<ref name=\"outofprintarchive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.outofprintarchive.com/articles/reviews/MegaDrive/GhoulsNGhosts-MeanMachines1-3.html|title=Out-of-Print Archive &bull;

{"title_page": "Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Montgolfiere Gatineau.png|right|250pxl]]\n\nThe '''Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival''' is a yearly festival held in [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]], Canada, and organized by a not-for-profit organization, during which [[hot air balloons]] of every shape and colour are flown and where 300 shows and performances adding up to over 60 hours\u2019 worth of programming are taking place. More than 200,000 visitors and 1,000 RVs usually participate.\nIt is held over four days in late-August and early September during the [[Labor Day Weekend]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Filling balloons with hot air.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Filling balloons for the festival]]\n[[File:Ballons in Gatineau.JPG|thumb|200px|Balloon riding during the 2005 Festival]]\n\n===Jean Boileau era and the festival's beginning (1988-2001)===\nThe festival started in 1988 by [[Jean Boileau]] and attracted about 50 000 visitors and about 50 balloons. Through the following years the festival became much larger and was one of the biggest festivals in Canada. Attendance at one point reached over 225,000 people and had over 150 balloons. In 1998, the festival was also hosting the [[World Hot Air Airship Championship]], which was disputed by 16 teams from Europe, China and the United States.\n\n===Fatal accident and festival departure (2001-2002)===\n\nOn July 14, 2001, Boileau who was the general manager since its beginning was involved in a horrific hot-air balloon accident just east of the [[Ottawa International Airport]] on [[Leitrim Road (Ottawa)|Leitrim Road]].

It is the sequel to 1989's ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]''. [[Johnathon Schaech]] stars as a bouncer who must protect a Louisiana bar from criminals.\n\n==Plot==\n[[D.E.A.]] agent Shane Tanner is the son of a legendary cooler named James Dalton (played by [[Patrick Swayze]] in the original film). Nate Tanner is Shane's uncle, and the owner of the Black Pelican, a bar located in Nate's new permanent home of Tyree, [[Louisiana]]. Nate gets a call from his rival, who is nicknamed \"Wild Bill\", the former Black Pelican cooler who has been trying to steal it from Nate. Wild Bill asks Nate to meet him at a pier, supposedly to discuss a truce. Nate goes to the pier and is ambushed and beaten badly by Wild Bill.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[New York City]], Shane, along with other agents, bust drug dealers in a [[night club]]. Shane later gets a phone call about his uncle being in the hospital and getting badly beaten. Shane gets his uncle's location and leaves for Tyree. Shane takes off for local authorities to find out who ambushed Nate. Shane decides to stay in Nate's house and run the Black Pelican in Nate's absence, much to the dismay of Wild Bill. The location is best for drug-running, as the Black Pelican is close to the border. However, like his uncle, Shane refuses to sell the bar and damages the numerous thugs that Wild Bill sends his way.\n\nA small subplot involves Shane still looking for the murderer who killed his father, the legendary Dalton, many years ago when Shane arrived home from work (Shane was a rookie Louisiana state trooper). After Dalton's murder, Shane left town and joined the DEA as a field agent. Now, Wild Bill's boss, Miami crime syndicate kingpin Victor Cross, decides that it is time to handle matters personally, since Wild Bill's men have not been doing a good job of taking care of Shane. Shane is soon faced with impossible odds and a low number of staff members at the Black Pelican.\n\nTo rid Louisiana of Victor, Wild Bill, and their organization, Shane teams up with local school teacher Beau Hampton, who has a military background And also wild bills cousin.  Soon, Beau and Shane take down Wild Bill and Victor. In the end, Victor is badly beaten and left at Beau's house and Wild Bill is impaled by the symbolic black pelican at the bar.\n\nIt is revealed that Victor had wanted Shane dead for a drug bust he did on Victor long ago as a state trooper. Victor had hired Wild Bill, then a cooler at the bar, to kill Dalton. Shane decides to stay in town since he can finally be at peace after finding his father's murderers and exacting justice from them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]] as Shane Tanner\n* [[Ellen Hollman]] as Beau Hampton\n* [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] as Victor Cross \n* [[Jake Busey]] as Wild Bill\n* [[Will Patton]] as Nate Tanner\n* [[Marisa Quinn]] as Nadja\n* Crystal Mantec\u00f3n as Sherri\n\n==Reception==\nScott Weinberg of [[DVD Talk]] rated it 2.5/5 stars and called it a predictably \"mindless, silly mess\" that was made to capitalize on the first film's fandom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/22493/road-house-2/|title=Road House 2|last=Weinberg|first=Scott|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=2006-07-18|accessdate=2016-10-01}}</ref>  In a review of both films, Cam Lindsay of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' wrote that it was better to ignore the sequel and simply rewatch the original instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/film/article/road_house_road_house_2_last_call-rowdy_herrington_scott|title=Road House / Road House 2: Last Call|last=Lindsay|first=Cam|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=2006-01-01|accessdate=2016-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0469965}}\n* {{Amg movie|348513}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|id=road_house_2_last_call}}\n\n{{Scott Ziehl}}\n\n[[Category:2006 films]]\n[[Category:Direct-to-video sequel films]]\n[[Category:2000s action thriller films]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer direct-to-video films]]\n[[Category:Sony Pictures direct-to-video films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2006 direct-to-video action film by Scott Ziehl}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Road House 2\n| image          = roadhouse2.jpg\n| caption        = DVD cover\n| director       = [[Scott Ziehl]]\n| producer       = Yoram Pelman\n| screenplay     = {{plainlist|\n* Miles Chapman\n* [[Johnathon Schaech]]\n* [[Richard Chizmar]]\n}}\n| story          = Miles Chapman\n| starring       = {{Plainlist| \n* Johnathon Schaech\n* [[Ellen Hollman]]\n* [[Richard Norton (actor)|Richard Norton]] \n* [[Jake Busey]]\n* [[Will Patton]]\n}}\n| music          = [[Amotz Plessner]]\n| cinematography = [[Thomas L.

{"title_page": "Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "In the British peerage, a '''royal duke''' is a member of the [[British royal family]], entitled to the titular dignity of prince and the [[Royal and noble styles|style]] of ''[[Royal Highness|His Royal Highness]]'', who holds a [[duke]]dom. Dukedoms are the highest titles in the British roll of peerage, and the holders of these particular dukedoms are Princes of the Blood Royal. The holders of the dukedoms are royal, not the titles themselves. They are titles created and bestowed on legitimate sons and male-line grandsons of the British monarch, usually upon reaching their [[Age of majority|majority]] or marriage.<ref name=\"burke\">{{cite book | title=[[Burke's Peerage|Burke's Guide to the Royal Family]] | publisher=Burke's Peerage Ltd/Shaw Publishing Co. | year=1973 | location=London | pages=[https://archive.org/details/burkesguidetoroy00lond/page/183 183, 336\u2013337] | isbn=0-220-66222-3 | chapter=Appendix C: Titles Traditionally Associated with the Royal Family | editor=[[Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd|Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh]] }}</ref> The titles can be inherited but cease to be called \"royal\" once they pass beyond the grandsons of a monarch. As with any peerage, once the title becomes extinct, it may subsequently be recreated by the reigning monarch at any time.\n\n==Royal status of dukedoms==\nIn the United Kingdom, there is nothing intrinsic to any dukedom that makes it \"royal\". Rather, these peerages are called royal dukedoms because they are created for, and held by, members of the royal family who are entitled to the titular dignity of Prince and the style ''Royal Highness''. Although the term \"royal duke\" therefore has no official meaning ''per se'', the category \"Duke of the [[Royal family|Blood Royal]]\" was acknowledged as a rank conferring special [[Order of precedence|precedence]] at court in the unrevoked 20th clause of the Lord Chamberlain's order of 1520.<ref>{{cite web|first=Francois|last=Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/order_precedence.htm#1520 |title=Order of Precedence in England and Wales |publisher=Heraldica.org |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref><ref name=\"squibb\">{{cite book | title=Order of Precedence in England and Wales | publisher=Clarendon Press | author=[[George Drewry Squibb|Squibb, G.D.]] | chapter=The Lord Chamberlain's Order of 1520, as amended in 1595 | year=1981 | location=Oxford, England | pages=99\u2013101}}</ref> This decree accorded precedence to any peer related by blood to the sovereign above all others of the same degree within the peerage. The order did not apply within [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], nor did it grant precedence above the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or other [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]] such as is now enjoyed by royal dukes. But it placed junior \"Dukes of the Blood Royal\" above the most senior non-royal duke, junior \"Earls of the Blood Royal\" above the most senior non-royal earl ([[cf.]] [[Earl of Wessex#Second creation (current)|Earldom of Wessex]]), etc. It did not matter how distantly related to the monarch the peers might be (presumably they ranked among each other in [[order of succession]] to the Crown). Although the 1520 order is theoretically still in effect, in fact the \"Blood Royal\" clause seems to have fallen into [[desuetude]] by 1917 when George V limited the style of Royal Highness to children and male-line grandchildren of the Sovereign. Thus peers of the blood royal who are neither sons nor grandsons of a sovereign are no longer accorded precedence above other peers.\n\nUnder the 20 November 1917 letters patent of King [[George V]], the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and the style ''Royal Highness'' were restricted to the legitimate children of a sovereign, the legitimate children of a sovereign's legitimate sons, and the eldest living legitimate son of the eldest legitimate son of a Prince of Wales.{{efn|This rule would have meant that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] would not, from birth, have had royal status or be called Prince and Princess, as they were the children of the ''daughter'' of the sovereign. So immediately prior to the birth of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth's]] first child, King [[George VI]] issued letters patent dated 22 October 1948 declaring that Princess Elizabeth's children with [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh]] would take royal status and be called Prince or Princess from birth.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38452|page=5889|date=9 November 1948}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2012, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] extended the style ''Royal Highness'' from ''the eldest living legitimate son of the eldest legitimate son of a Prince of Wales'' to ''all the children of the eldest son of a Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness''.\n\nPresuming the current Duke of Gloucester and Duke of Kent are succeeded by their eldest sons, Alexander Earl of Ulster and George Earl of St Andrews, respectively, those peerages (or rather, the 1928 and 1934 creations of them) will cease to be royal dukedoms, instead the title holders will become \"ordinary\" dukes.<ref name=\"eilers\">Eilers, Marlene. ''Queen Victoria's Descendants.'' Rosvall Royal Books, Falkoping, Sweden, 1997. p. 45. {{ISBN|91-630-5964-9}}</ref> The third dukes of Gloucester and Kent will each be styled ''[[His Grace]]'' because as great-grandsons of George V, they are not princes and are not styled ''HRH''. Similarly, upon the death of [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (1850\u20131942) (the third son of Queen [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]), his only male-line grandson, [[Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Alastair, Earl of MacDuff]] (1914\u201343), briefly succeeded to his peerages and was styled ''His Grace''.

In addition to the dukedom of Cornwall, a peerage, the heir apparent also enjoys a life interest in the [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. \n*[[Duke of Rothesay]] is a secondary title of the Sovereign's heir apparent in Scotland, currently held by Prince Charles,<ref name=\"burke\"/> who is properly called \"HRH The Prince Charles, Duke of Rothesay\" (rather than \"HRH The Prince of Wales\") in Scotland.\n\nWith the exceptions of the [[Dukes in the United Kingdom|dukedoms]] of Cornwall and Rothesay (which can only be held by the eldest living son of the sovereign who is also the heir-apparent), these dukedoms are hereditary according to the [[letters patent]] that created them.<ref name=\"burke\"/> Those patents each contain the standard remainder to \"heirs male of his body\".\n\nBy law the British monarch also holds, and is entitled to the revenues of, the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]. Within the borders of the [[County Palatine]] of [[Lancashire]], therefore, Elizabeth II is hailed as \"The Queen, The Duke of Lancaster\" (even when the monarch is a Queen regnant, by tradition she does not use the title ''Duchess'').<ref name=\"burke\"/> However, legally the monarch is not the Duke of Lancaster: peerages are in origin [[vassal|held]] [[fief|feudally]] of the sovereign who, as the [[fount of honour]], cannot hold a peerage of him- or herself. The situation is similar in the [[Channel Islands]], where the monarch is addressed as [[Duke of Normandy]], but only in accordance with tradition.

As with any peerage, once the title becomes extinct, it may subsequently be recreated by the reigning monarch at any time.\n\n==Royal status of dukedoms==\nIn the United Kingdom, there is nothing intrinsic to any dukedom that makes it \"royal\". Rather, these peerages are called royal dukedoms because they are created for, and held by, members of the royal family who are entitled to the titular dignity of Prince and the style ''Royal Highness''. Although the term \"royal duke\" therefore has no official meaning ''per se'', the category \"Duke of the [[Royal family|Blood Royal]]\" was acknowledged as a rank conferring special [[Order of precedence|precedence]] at court in the unrevoked 20th clause of the Lord Chamberlain's order of 1520.<ref>{{cite web|first=Francois|last=Velde |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/order_precedence.htm#1520 |title=Order of Precedence in England and Wales |publisher=Heraldica.org |accessdate=2010-11-17}}</ref><ref name=\"squibb\">{{cite book | title=Order of Precedence in England and Wales | publisher=Clarendon Press | author=[[George Drewry Squibb|Squibb, G.D.]] | chapter=The Lord Chamberlain's Order of 1520, as amended in 1595 | year=1981 | location=Oxford, England | pages=99\u2013101}}</ref> This decree accorded precedence to any peer related by blood to the sovereign above all others of the same degree within the peerage. The order did not apply within [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], nor did it grant precedence above the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] or other [[Great Officer of State|Great Officers of State]] such as is now enjoyed by royal dukes. But it placed junior \"Dukes of the Blood Royal\" above the most senior non-royal duke, junior \"Earls of the Blood Royal\" above the most senior non-royal earl ([[cf.]] [[Earl of Wessex#Second creation (current)|Earldom of Wessex]]), etc. It did not matter how distantly related to the monarch the peers might be (presumably they ranked among each other in [[order of succession]] to the Crown). Although the 1520 order is theoretically still in effect, in fact the \"Blood Royal\" clause seems to have fallen into [[desuetude]] by 1917 when George V limited the style of Royal Highness to children and male-line grandchildren of the Sovereign. Thus peers of the blood royal who are neither sons nor grandsons of a sovereign are no longer accorded precedence above other peers.\n\nUnder the 20 November 1917 letters patent of King [[George V]], the titular dignity of Prince or Princess and the style ''Royal Highness'' were restricted to the legitimate children of a sovereign, the legitimate children of a sovereign's legitimate sons, and the eldest living legitimate son of the eldest legitimate son of a Prince of Wales.{{efn|This rule would have meant that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] would not, from birth, have had royal status or be called Prince and Princess, as they were the children of the ''daughter'' of the sovereign. So immediately prior to the birth of [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth's]] first child, King [[George VI]] issued letters patent dated 22 October 1948 declaring that Princess Elizabeth's children with [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Philip Mountbatten, Duke of Edinburgh]] would take royal status and be called Prince or Princess from birth.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38452|page=5889|date=9 November 1948}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2012, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] extended the style ''Royal Highness'' from ''the eldest living legitimate son of the eldest legitimate son of a Prince of Wales'' to ''all the children of the eldest son of a Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness''.\n\nPresuming the current Duke of Gloucester and Duke of Kent are succeeded by their eldest sons, Alexander Earl of Ulster and George Earl of St Andrews, respectively, those peerages (or rather, the 1928 and 1934 creations of them) will cease to be royal dukedoms, instead the title holders will become \"ordinary\" dukes.<ref name=\"eilers\">Eilers, Marlene.

The book is part biography, and part polemic on race and class. The overall ideological framework of the book is a pragmatic, socialist-oriented Pan-Africanism that seeks the liberation of all humanity from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, it highlights the shared problems faced by African communities worldwide in a global system of imperialism.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\nDaley takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review</ref> Daley asserts that Britain is not a meritocracy where the barriers of race and class can be simply overcome through hard work and perseverance. He explains his success as the absurd and unexpected consequence of an unequal system that allows the rise of a few while leaving behind the many, no matter how brilliant they are. He points out several times that some of his friends could have been academics or scientists if the obstacles of structural racism and class oppression had not been there.<ref>http://socialistreview.org.uk/438/natives</ref>\n\nOne important idea that emerges from Natives is that, in spite of Britain's record of violence, slavery, genocide and colonialism, there is nonetheless a longstanding progressive trend that is \u201crooted in ideas of freedom, equality and democracy\u201d.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nIn June 2016, Akala supported [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] after mass resignations from his cabinet and a [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|leadership challenge]].

The book is part biography, and part polemic on race and class. The overall ideological framework of the book is a pragmatic, socialist-oriented Pan-Africanism that seeks the liberation of all humanity from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, it highlights the shared problems faced by African communities worldwide in a global system of imperialism.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\nDaley takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review</ref> Daley asserts that Britain is not a meritocracy where the barriers of race and class can be simply overcome through hard work and perseverance. He explains his success as the absurd and unexpected consequence of an unequal system that allows the rise of a few while leaving behind the many, no matter how brilliant they are. He points out several times that some of his friends could have been academics or scientists if the obstacles of structural racism and class oppression had not been there.<ref>http://socialistreview.org.uk/438/natives</ref>\n\nOne important idea that emerges from Natives is that, in spite of Britain's record of violence, slavery, genocide and colonialism, there is nonetheless a longstanding progressive trend that is \u201crooted in ideas of freedom, equality and democracy\u201d.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nIn June 2016, Akala supported [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] after mass resignations from his cabinet and a [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|leadership challenge]]. He [[Twitter|tweeted]]: \"The way these dickhead Labor MP's are snaking @jeremycorbyn eediat ting.\"<ref name=\"twitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/akalamusic/status/748236119326744576|title=The way these dickhead Labor MP's are snaking @jeremycorbyn eediat ting.|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2017, he endorsed Corbyn in the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]].

According to a 2020 story by [[Yahoo Sports]] journalist Jeff Eisenberg, Fine's development as a quarterback began in the summer before his sixth-grade year, during which he attended a quarterback camp at the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]]. The young Fine paid special attention to former Oklahoma star quarterback and then-current Sooners assistant [[Josh Heupel]], observing Heupel's throwing motion and paying attention to the advice he offered. During each day's drive home from the camp, he wrote down what he had learned. After the camp, Fine and his father typed up the notes, and he went so far as to place a printed copy next to his bed.<ref name=Eisenberg>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/sports/too-short-mason-fine-is-just-fine-proving-doubters-wrong-130958631.html |title=Too short?

Each day, the two would teach one another proper throwing motion via the notes they took at the aforementioned camp. In Eisenberg's story, Dale recalled, \"It was hours and days and months and years of repetition. The motto we went by was that it wasn\u2019t just practice that made perfect. It was perfect practice that made perfect.\" By the time Mason finished his eighth-grade year, they no longer worked on his mechanics. The following summer, he attended a quarterback camp at which an instructor praised his throwing motion and asked about his quarterbacks coach. Eisenberg noted, \"The instructor couldn\u2019t believe it was his dad, let alone that Dale Fine had no previous football experience.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\n==High school==\nSince his hometown of fewer than 1,000 operated only a K\u20138 school, Fine had a choice between several nearby high schools, and enrolled at Locust Grove High School in [[Locust Grove, Oklahoma|Locust Grove]] in 2012. The Pirates had just hired a new head coach after winning only two games in the previous three seasons. Eisenberg noted that the new coach, Matt Hennesy, had to make a decision regarding his new talent\u2014while Fine was the team's best passer, \"Hennesy feared putting a 5-foot-9, 135-pound freshman behind a patchwork offensive line.\" Hennesy decided to start Fine as a wide receiver, but designed a series of trick plays to utilize Fine's throwing ability; Fine would throw for more than 600 yards as a freshman despite not playing quarterback. <ref name=Eisenberg/> He went on to start at quarterback in his remaining three high school seasons, setting the all-time Oklahoma high school record for passing yards and touchdowns and becoming the first player to ever win the state's [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade Player of the Year]] award twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/high-school/locust-grove-s-mason-fine-wins-second-gatorade-oklahoma-player/article_ae25486f-7f81-5282-86c3-e2cc8a99c183.html|title=Locust Grove's Mason Fine wins second Gatorade Oklahoma Player of the Year Award|last=Hoover|first=John E.|date=December 4, 2015|website=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recruitment==\nDespite his gaudy high school statistics, Fine finished his senior season without a single [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] offer, largely due to his lack of size. During a summer camp before his senior season, an assistant for [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] pulled him aside, praising his arm strength and ability to escape a collapsing pocket. However, he then told Fine that his small size made it unlikely that he would ever play at a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] school, instead offering to recommend him to [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] or [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] schools. Fine would tell Eisenberg, \"I was polite and told him that I appreciated it, but inside I was fuming.\" This coach was not alone in his sentiment; Fine went without an offer even after sending out numerous highlight tapes and attending camps at four other FBS schools. [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] showed strong interest after Fine's junior season, but went with a considerably taller prospect; [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] recruited him only as a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]], and did not make him an offer even after its main quarterback target rescinded a verbal commitment to the school; and when Hennesy called [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State's]] [[Bill Snyder]] about Fine, Snyder responded that he didn't recruit quarterbacks under 6 feet tall.<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\nFine caught a break when [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] hired [[Seth Littrell]] as head coach shortly after the end of the [[2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2015 season]]. Littrell, a former Oklahoma player who grew up in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], was a close friend of Hennesy who operated an [[Air raid offense|Air Raid offense]] similar to the one that Fine quarterbacked at Locust Grove. Shortly after his hiring, Littrell called Hennesy to ask about available quarterbacks; while North Texas had an incoming graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for the 2016 season, Littrell sought a future prospect. Littrell and his staff were sold on Fine's ability; he would tell Eisenberg,<ref name=Eisenberg/>{{blockquote|There were local kids with [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] offers who were calling us because they wanted to play in our system, but he was better than them. To be honest, we kept laughing because it wasn\u2019t even close. If this kid was 6-2 or 6-3, he\u2019d have been offered by everyone in the country.}}\n\nSensing that this was his best chance at an FBS offer, Fine made makeshift lifts for his shoes in order to appear taller for his North Texas visit. For his part, Littrell would say, \"He could have shown up in combat boots with four-inch heels and we\u2019d have taken him.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/> On February 3, 2016, Fine signed a [[National Letter of Intent]] with North Texas.<ref name=\"247sports\">{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Player/Mason-Fine-78299/high-school-136282/|title=Mason Fine, Locust Grove, Pro-Style Quarterback|work=[[247Sports.com]]|url-status=live|accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\n\n=== North Texas ===\n\n==== 2016 ====\nFine started nine games for [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] as a true freshman in 2016, throwing for 1,572 yards and breaking the school record for longest play from scrimmage with an 80-yard touchdown run against [[UTSA Roadrunners football|UTSA]] to earn a spot on the [[Conference USA]] All-Freshman team <ref>{{cite web|url=http://conferenceusa.com/news/2016/12/6/FB_1206163929.aspx|title=C-USA All-Freshman Team|date=December 6, 2016|website=[[Conference USA]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== 2017\u20132018 ====\nOver his sophomore and junior years, Fine led the Mean Green to 9 victories in each season and threw for a total of 7,845 yards and 58 touchdowns.

Eisenberg noted that the new coach, Matt Hennesy, had to make a decision regarding his new talent\u2014while Fine was the team's best passer, \"Hennesy feared putting a 5-foot-9, 135-pound freshman behind a patchwork offensive line.\" Hennesy decided to start Fine as a wide receiver, but designed a series of trick plays to utilize Fine's throwing ability; Fine would throw for more than 600 yards as a freshman despite not playing quarterback. <ref name=Eisenberg/> He went on to start at quarterback in his remaining three high school seasons, setting the all-time Oklahoma high school record for passing yards and touchdowns and becoming the first player to ever win the state's [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade Player of the Year]] award twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/sports/high-school/locust-grove-s-mason-fine-wins-second-gatorade-oklahoma-player/article_ae25486f-7f81-5282-86c3-e2cc8a99c183.html|title=Locust Grove's Mason Fine wins second Gatorade Oklahoma Player of the Year Award|last=Hoover|first=John E.|date=December 4, 2015|website=[[Tulsa World]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recruitment==\nDespite his gaudy high school statistics, Fine finished his senior season without a single [[Athletic scholarship|scholarship]] offer, largely due to his lack of size. During a summer camp before his senior season, an assistant for [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] pulled him aside, praising his arm strength and ability to escape a collapsing pocket. However, he then told Fine that his small size made it unlikely that he would ever play at a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] school, instead offering to recommend him to [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] or [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] schools. Fine would tell Eisenberg, \"I was polite and told him that I appreciated it, but inside I was fuming.\" This coach was not alone in his sentiment; Fine went without an offer even after sending out numerous highlight tapes and attending camps at four other FBS schools. [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] showed strong interest after Fine's junior season, but went with a considerably taller prospect; [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]] recruited him only as a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]], and did not make him an offer even after its main quarterback target rescinded a verbal commitment to the school; and when Hennesy called [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State's]] [[Bill Snyder]] about Fine, Snyder responded that he didn't recruit quarterbacks under 6 feet tall.<ref name=Eisenberg/>\n\nFine caught a break when [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] hired [[Seth Littrell]] as head coach shortly after the end of the [[2015 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2015 season]]. Littrell, a former Oklahoma player who grew up in [[Muskogee, Oklahoma]], was a close friend of Hennesy who operated an [[Air raid offense|Air Raid offense]] similar to the one that Fine quarterbacked at Locust Grove. Shortly after his hiring, Littrell called Hennesy to ask about available quarterbacks; while North Texas had an incoming graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for the 2016 season, Littrell sought a future prospect. Littrell and his staff were sold on Fine's ability; he would tell Eisenberg,<ref name=Eisenberg/>{{blockquote|There were local kids with [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] offers who were calling us because they wanted to play in our system, but he was better than them. To be honest, we kept laughing because it wasn\u2019t even close. If this kid was 6-2 or 6-3, he\u2019d have been offered by everyone in the country..}}\n\nSensing that this was his best chance at an FBS offer, Fine made makeshift lifts for his shoes in order to appear taller for his North Texas visit. For his part, Littrell would say, \"He could have shown up in combat boots with four-inch heels and we\u2019d have taken him.\"<ref name=Eisenberg/> On February 3, 2016, Fine signed a [[National Letter of Intent]] with North Texas.<ref name=\"247sports\">{{cite web|url=https://247sports.com/Player/Mason-Fine-78299/high-school-136282/|title=Mason Fine, Locust Grove, Pro-Style Quarterback|work=[[247Sports.com]]|url-status=live|accessdate=August 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\n\n=== North Texas ===\n\n==== 2016 ====\nFine started nine games for [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]] as a true freshman in 2016, throwing for 1,572 yards and breaking the school record for longest play from scrimmage with an 80-yard touchdown run against [[UTSA Roadrunners football|UTSA]] to earn a spot on the [[Conference USA]] All-Freshman team <ref>{{cite web|url=http://conferenceusa.com/news/2016/12/6/FB_1206163929.aspx|title=C-USA All-Freshman Team|date=December 6, 2016|website=[[Conference USA]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== 2017\u20132018 ====\nOver his sophomore and junior years, Fine led the Mean Green to 9 victories in each season and threw for a total of 7,845 yards and 58 touchdowns.

It was recorded while traveling for the [[Loud Tour]] between February and November 2011, and was originally planned to be a [[reissue]] of her previous studio album ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). As executive producer, Rihanna enlisted a wide range of producers including [[Alex da Kid]], [[Calvin Harris]], [[Chase & Status]], [[No I.D.]], and [[Stargate (music producers)|Stargate]]  to achieve her desired sound. Following in the same vein as ''Loud'', ''Talk That Talk'' is a [[Electronic dance music|dance]]-oriented [[Pop music|pop]]/[[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] crossover album that incorporates elements of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[dubstep]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[house music]]. The album also continues to have subtle [[dancehall]] genres, whilst its lyrical content and themes revolve around a nihilist, romantic and lascivious lover.\n\n''Talk That Talk'' received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the album's lyrics, while others were less favorable of its themes. ''Talk That Talk'' debuted at number three on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 198,000 copies and went on to sell 1.15 million copies in the United States by June 2015. The album also peaked at number one in Austria, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]], selling 163,000 copies in its first week. As of April 2012, the album has been certified triple Platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) for shipments of 900,000 copies. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Talk That Talk'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2011.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.snepmusique.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/RIN-2012-SNEP-copie.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2012|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 8, 2012|page=34}}</ref> As of March 2013, the album has sold more than 5.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe album produced six singles, including the international hit \"[[We Found Love]]\" which was released as the albums [[lead single]]. \"[[We Found Love]]\" became Rihanna's eleventh number-one song on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and topped the charts in twenty six additional countries. \"[[You da One]]\", \"[[Talk That Talk (Rihanna song)|Talk That Talk]]\" (featuring rapper [[Jay-Z]]) and a remix of \"[[Birthday Cake (song)#Remix featuring Chris Brown|Birthday Cake]]\" (featuring [[Chris Brown]]) experienced moderate success, while \"[[Where Have You Been]]\" reached the top ten of twenty countries around the world. A remixed form of \"[[Cockiness (Love It)#Remix|Cockiness (Love It)]]\" (featuring rapper [[ASAP Rocky]]) was released as the sixth and final single from the album.\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the release of Rihanna's previous studio album, ''Loud'' (2010), the singer revealed via [[Twitter]] that the album would be re-issued with new songs and released in fall 2011.<ref name=\"BET\">{{cite web |last=Gipson |first=Brooklyne |url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2011/06/17/rihanna-to-re-release-loud-.html|title=Rihanna to Re-Release Loud|work=[[Black Entertainment Television]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Fall2011\">{{cite news|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/06/17/rihanna-to-release-new-album-this-fall/|title=Rihanna plans 'Loud' re-release for Fall|work=Rap-Up|publisher=Devin Lazerine|date=June 17, 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}</ref> \nIn September 2011, Rihanna took to Twitter to confirm that plans for a re-issue of ''Loud'' had been scrapped, with the singer tweeting \"I [thought about] a [re-release], but LOUD is its own body of work!

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\nTrack listing and credits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]. <ref name=\"tidalcreds\"/>\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\nTrack listing and credits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]. <ref name=\"tidalcreds\"/>\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n| title1 = 0.00\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.
