He impersonated a sound expert and went to a sound-stage under construction with Mayer, criticizing the construction and using double-talk to confuse him. He ended his evaluation by proclaiming the whole soundstage needed to be torn down, and Mayer was about to order it done before his co-workers revealed the prank. <ref>Eyman, Scott.

Among his more sizable screen roles was the moronic, illiterate gangster \"secretary\" in ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. From 1930 Barnett appeared, usually as comedy relief, in films and on television in a career spanning 45 years. Among his best-regarded early roles, apart from ''Scarface,'' were ''[[The Big Cage]]'' (1933), ''[[Thirty Day Princess]]'' (1934) and, in a perfectly suited Runyonesque part, ''[[Princess O'Hara]]'' (1935). In later years, Barnett played straight character parts, often as careworn little men, [[undertaker]]s, [[janitor]]s, bartenders and drunks in pictures ranging from films noir (''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', 1946) to westerns (''[[Springfield Rifle (film)|Springfield Rifle]]'', 1952). He was a welcome presence in \"B\" comedies and mysteries: as Runyonesque gangsters in ''[[Petticoat Larceny]]'' (1943), ''[[Little Miss Broadway]]'' (1947), and ''[[Gas House Kids Go West]]'' (1947), and notably as [[Tom Conway]]'s enthusiastic sidekick in ''[[The Falcon's Alibi]]'' (1946). After World War II, with the Hollywood studios making fewer films, Barnett became a familiar face on television.\n\n==Later years and death==\nIn one of his last public appearances, Barnett showcased his unique brand of humor with a monologue, delivered at Madison Square Garden in the vaudeville revue ''The Big Show of 1936''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Nels|title=Familiar Names Still Bask In Limelight of Vaudeville|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540206/daily_independent_journal/|agency=Daily Independent Journal|date=August 8, 1972|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nBarnett died of heart disease August 10, 1977, at [[Encino Hospital Medical Center]].<ref name=oj>{{cite news|title=Actor Vince Barnett dead|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540144/the_ottawa_journal/|agency=The Ottawa Journal|date=August 11, 1977|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> He was survived by his wife, Kit, a brother and a sister.<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie comic dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540182/redlands_daily_facts/|agency=Redlands Daily Facts|date=August 11, 1977|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''[[Wide Open (film)|Wide Open]]'' (1930) -

He impersonated a sound expert and went to a sound-stage under construction with Mayer, criticizing the construction and using double-talk to confuse him. He ended his evaluation by proclaiming the whole soundstage needed to be torn down, and Mayer was about to order it done before his co-workers revealed the prank. <ref>Eyman, Scott.

Among his more sizable screen roles was the moronic, illiterate gangster \"secretary\" in ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]''. From 1930 Barnett appeared, usually as comedy relief, in films and on television in a career spanning 45 years. Among his best-regarded early roles, apart from ''Scarface,'' were ''[[The Big Cage]]'' (1933), ''[[Thirty Day Princess]]'' (1934) and, in a perfectly suited Runyonesque part, ''[[Princess O'Hara]]'' (1935). In later years, Barnett played straight character parts, often as careworn little men, [[undertaker]]s, [[janitor]]s, bartenders and drunks in pictures ranging from films noir (''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', 1946) to westerns (''[[Springfield Rifle (film)|Springfield Rifle]]'', 1952). He was a welcome presence in \"B\" comedies and mysteries: as Runyonesque gangsters in ''[[Petticoat Larceny]]'' (1943), ''[[Little Miss Broadway]]'' (1947), and ''[[Gas House Kids Go West]]'' (1947), and notably as [[Tom Conway]]'s enthusiastic sidekick in ''[[The Falcon's Alibi]]'' (1946). After World War II, with the Hollywood studios making fewer films, Barnett became a familiar face on television.\n\n==Later years and death==\nIn one of his last public appearances, Barnett showcased his unique brand of humor with a monologue, delivered at Madison Square Garden in the vaudeville revue ''The Big Show of 1936''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Nels|title=Familiar Names Still Bask In Limelight of Vaudeville|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540206/daily_independent_journal/|agency=Daily Independent Journal|date=August 8, 1972|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\nBarnett died of heart disease August 10, 1977, at [[Encino Hospital Medical Center]].<ref name=oj>{{cite news|title=Actor Vince Barnett dead|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540144/the_ottawa_journal/|agency=The Ottawa Journal|date=August 11, 1977|page=5|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> He was survived by his wife, Kit, a brother and a sister.<ref>{{cite news|title=Movie comic dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/3540182/redlands_daily_facts/|agency=Redlands Daily Facts|date=August 11, 1977|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 2, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n\n==Selected filmography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* ''[[Wide Open (film)|Wide Open]]'' (1930) -

Using a [[linearized field equation]] (appropriate for the study of ''weak'' gravitational fields), he derived the famous [[quadrupole formula]] quantifying the rate at which such radiation should carry away energy.<ref name='Gravitationswellen'>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=\u00dcber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154\u2013167}}</ref> Examples of systems with time varying quadrupole moments include vibrating strings, bars rotating about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the bar, and binary star systems, but not rotating disks.\n\nIn 1922, [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] wrote a paper expressing (apparently for the first time) the view that gravitational waves are in essence ripples in coordinates, and have no physical meaning. He did not appreciate Einstein's arguments that the waves are real.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eddington|1922|loc=page 268-282}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, together with [[Nathan Rosen]], Einstein rediscovered the [[Beck vacuums]], a family of exact gravitational wave solutions with cylindrical symmetry (sometimes also called ''Einstein\u2013Rosen waves''). While investigating the motion of test particles in these solutions, Einstein and Rosen became convinced that gravitational waves were unstable to collapse. Einstein reversed himself and declared that gravitational radiation was ''not'' after all a prediction of his theory. Einstein wrote to his friend [[Max Born]]\n\n<blockquote>\nTogether with a young collaborator, I arrived at the interesting result that gravitational waves do not exist, though they had been assumed a certainty to the first approximation. This shows that the nonlinear field equations can show us more, or rather limit us more, than we have believed up till now.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, Einstein believed that he and Rosen had established that their new argument showed that the prediction of gravitational radiation was a ''mathematical artifact'' of the linear approximation he had employed in 1916. Einstein believed these plane waves would gravitationally collapse into points; he had long hoped something like this would explain quantum mechanical wave-particle duality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nEinstein and Rosen accordingly submitted a paper entitled ''Do gravitational waves exist?'' to a leading physics journal, ''[[Physical Review]]'', in which they described their wave solutions and concluded that the \"radiation\" that seemed to appear in general relativity was not genuine radiation capable of transporting energy or having (in principle) measurable physical effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennefick|first=Daniel|date=September 2005|title=Einstein Versus the Physical Review|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=43\u201348|doi=10.1063/1.2117822|issn=0031-9228}}</ref> The anonymous referee, who\u2014as the current editor of ''Physical Review'' recently confirmed, all parties now being deceased\u2014was the combative cosmologist, [[Howard Percy Robertson]], pointed out the error described below, and the manuscript was returned to the authors with a note from the editor asking them to revise the paper to address these concerns. Quite uncharacteristically, Einstein took this criticism very badly, angrily replying \"I see no reason to address the, in any case erroneous, opinion expressed by your referee.\" He vowed never again to submit a paper to ''Physical Review''. Instead, Einstein and Rosen resubmitted the paper without change to another and much less well known journal, ''[[Journal of the Franklin Institute|The Journal of the Franklin Institute]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|last2=Rosen|first2=Nathan|date=January 1937|title=On gravitational waves|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=223|issue=1|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1016/s0016-0032(37)90583-0|issn=0016-0032}}</ref> He kept his vow regarding ''Physical Review''.\n\n[[Leopold Infeld]], who arrived at [[Princeton University]] at this time, later remembered his utter astonishment on hearing of this development, since radiation is such an essential element for any [[classical field theory]] worthy of the name. Infeld expressed his doubts to a leading expert on general relativity: H. P. Robertson, who had just returned from a visit to [[Caltech]]. Going over the argument as Infeld remembered it, Robertson was able to show Infeld the mistake: locally, the Einstein\u2013Rosen waves are [[gravitational plane wave]]s. Einstein and Rosen had correctly shown that a cloud of test particles would, in sinusoidal plane waves, form [[caustic (mathematics)|caustic]]s, but changing to another chart (essentially the [[Brinkmann coordinates]]) shows that the formation of the caustic is ''not a contradiction at all'', but in fact just what one would expect in this situation. Infeld then approached Einstein, who concurred with Robertson's analysis (still not knowing it was he who reviewed the Physical Review submission).\n\nSince Rosen had recently departed for the Soviet Union, Einstein acted alone in promptly and thoroughly revising their joint paper. This third version was retitled ''On gravitational waves'', and, following Robertson's suggestion of a transformation to cylindrical coordinates, presented what are now called Einstein\u2013Rosen cylindrical waves (these are locally isometric to plane waves). This is the version that eventually appeared. However, Rosen was unhappy with this revision and eventually published his own version, which retained the erroneous \"disproof\" of the prediction of gravitational radiation.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of ''Physical Review'', Robertson wryly reported that in the end, Einstein had fully accepted the objections that had initially so upset him.\n\n===Bern and Chapel Hill conferences===\n\nIn 1955, an important conference honoring the semi-centennial of [[special relativity]] was held in [[Bern]], the Swiss capital city where Einstein was working in the famous patent office during the [[Annus mirabilis]].  Rosen attended and gave a talk in which he computed the ''[[Einstein pseudotensor]]'' and ''[[Landau\u2013Lifshitz pseudotensor]]'' (two alternative, non-covariant, descriptions of the energy carried by a ''gravitational'' field, a notion that is notoriously difficult to pin down in general relativity). These turn out to be zero for the Einstein\u2013Rosen waves, and Rosen argued that this reaffirmed the negative conclusion he had reached with Einstein in 1936.\n\nHowever, by this time a few physicists, such as [[Felix Pirani]] and [[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|Ivor Robinson]], had come to appreciate the role played by curvature in producing tidal accelerations, and were able to convince many peers that gravitational radiation would indeed be produced, at least in cases such as a vibrating spring where different pieces of the system were clearly not in [[inertia]]l motion. Nonetheless, some physicists continued to doubt whether radiation would be produced by a [[binary star system]], where the [[world line]]s of the [[center of mass|centers of mass]] of the two stars should, according to the [[Einstein\u2013Infeld\u2013Hoffmann equations|EIH approximation]] (dating from 1938 and due to Einstein, Infeld, and [[Banesh Hoffmann]]), follow [[timelike geodesic]]s.\n\nInspired by conversations by [[Felix Pirani]], Hermann Bondi took up the study of gravitational radiation, in particular the question of quantifying the energy and momentum carried off 'to infinity' by a radiating system. During the next few years, Bondi developed the [[Bondi radiating chart]] and the notion of [[Bondi energy]] to rigorously study this question in maximal generality.\n\nIn 1957, at a conference at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], appealing to various mathematical tools developed by [[John Lighton Synge]], [[A. Z. Petrov]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz]], Pirani explained more clearly than had previously been possible the central role played by the [[Riemann tensor]] and in particular the [[electrogravitic tensor|tidal tensor]] in general relativity.<ref name=Pirani1957>{{cite journal | author=Pirani, Felix A.

As the wave passes over the rod, atomic forces hold the length of the rod fixed, but the proper distance between the two beads oscillates. Thus, the beads rub against the rod, dissipating heat.\"<ref name=\"Preskill\"/>\n\nAs the gravitational waves are mainly transverse, the rod has to be oriented perpendicular to the propagation direction of the wave.\n\n==History of arguments on the properties of gravitational waves==\n\n===Einstein's double reversal===\n\nThe creator of the theory of general relativity, [[Albert Einstein]], argued in 1916<ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=N\u00e4herungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688\u2013696|bibcode=1916SPAW.......688E }}</ref> that gravitational radiation should be produced, according to his theory, by any mass-energy configuration that has a time-varying [[quadrupole moment]] (or higher [[multipole moment]]). Using a [[linearized field equation]] (appropriate for the study of ''weak'' gravitational fields), he derived the famous [[quadrupole formula]] quantifying the rate at which such radiation should carry away energy.<ref name='Gravitationswellen'>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=\u00dcber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154\u2013167}}</ref> Examples of systems with time varying quadrupole moments include vibrating strings, bars rotating about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the bar, and binary star systems, but not rotating disks.\n\nIn 1922, [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] wrote a paper expressing (apparently for the first time) the view that gravitational waves are in essence ripples in coordinates, and have no physical meaning. He did not appreciate Einstein's arguments that the waves are real.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eddington|1922|loc=page 268-282}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, together with [[Nathan Rosen]], Einstein rediscovered the [[Beck vacuums]], a family of exact gravitational wave solutions with cylindrical symmetry (sometimes also called ''Einstein\u2013Rosen waves''). While investigating the motion of test particles in these solutions, Einstein and Rosen became convinced that gravitational waves were unstable to collapse. Einstein reversed himself and declared that gravitational radiation was ''not'' after all a prediction of his theory. Einstein wrote to his friend [[Max Born]]\n\n<blockquote>\nTogether with a young collaborator, I arrived at the interesting result that gravitational waves do not exist, though they had been assumed a certainty to the first approximation. This shows that the nonlinear field equations can show us more, or rather limit us more, than we have believed up till now.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn other words, Einstein believed that he and Rosen had established that their new argument showed that the prediction of gravitational radiation was a ''mathematical artifact'' of the linear approximation he had employed in 1916. Einstein believed these plane waves would gravitationally collapse into points; he had long hoped something like this would explain quantum mechanical wave-particle duality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nEinstein and Rosen accordingly submitted a paper entitled ''Do gravitational waves exist?'' to a leading physics journal, ''[[Physical Review]]'', in which they described their wave solutions and concluded that the \"radiation\" that seemed to appear in general relativity was not genuine radiation capable of transporting energy or having (in principle) measurable physical effects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennefick|first=Daniel|date=September 2005|title=Einstein Versus the Physical Review|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=58|issue=9|pages=43\u201348|doi=10.1063/1.2117822|issn=0031-9228}}</ref> The anonymous referee, who\u2014as the current editor of ''Physical Review'' recently confirmed, all parties now being deceased\u2014was the combative cosmologist, [[Howard Percy Robertson]], pointed out the error described below, and the manuscript was returned to the authors with a note from the editor asking them to revise the paper to address these concerns. Quite uncharacteristically, Einstein took this criticism very badly, angrily replying \"I see no reason to address the, in any case erroneous, opinion expressed by your referee.\" He vowed never again to submit a paper to ''Physical Review''. Instead, Einstein and Rosen resubmitted the paper without change to another and much less well known journal, ''[[Journal of the Franklin Institute|The Journal of the Franklin Institute]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|last2=Rosen|first2=Nathan|date=January 1937|title=On gravitational waves|journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute|volume=223|issue=1|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1016/s0016-0032(37)90583-0|issn=0016-0032}}</ref> He kept his vow regarding ''Physical Review''.\n\n[[Leopold Infeld]], who arrived at [[Princeton University]] at this time, later remembered his utter astonishment on hearing of this development, since radiation is such an essential element for any [[classical field theory]] worthy of the name. Infeld expressed his doubts to a leading expert on general relativity: H. P. Robertson, who had just returned from a visit to [[Caltech]]. Going over the argument as Infeld remembered it, Robertson was able to show Infeld the mistake: locally, the Einstein\u2013Rosen waves are [[gravitational plane wave]]s. Einstein and Rosen had correctly shown that a cloud of test particles would, in sinusoidal plane waves, form [[caustic (mathematics)|caustic]]s, but changing to another chart (essentially the [[Brinkmann coordinates]]) shows that the formation of the caustic is ''not a contradiction at all'', but in fact just what one would expect in this situation. Infeld then approached Einstein, who concurred with Robertson's analysis (still not knowing it was he who reviewed the Physical Review submission).\n\nSince Rosen had recently departed for the Soviet Union, Einstein acted alone in promptly and thoroughly revising their joint paper. This third version was retitled ''On gravitational waves'', and, following Robertson's suggestion of a transformation to cylindrical coordinates, presented what are now called Einstein\u2013Rosen cylindrical waves (these are locally isometric to plane waves). This is the version that eventually appeared. However, Rosen was unhappy with this revision and eventually published his own version, which retained the erroneous \"disproof\" of the prediction of gravitational radiation.\n\nIn a letter to the editor of ''Physical Review'', Robertson wryly reported that in the end, Einstein had fully accepted the objections that had initially so upset him.\n\n===Bern and Chapel Hill conferences===\n\nIn 1955, an important conference honoring the semi-centennial of [[special relativity]] was held in [[Bern]], the Swiss capital city where Einstein was working in the famous patent office during the [[Annus mirabilis]].  Rosen attended and gave a talk in which he computed the ''[[Einstein pseudotensor]]'' and ''[[Landau\u2013Lifshitz pseudotensor]]'' (two alternative, non-covariant, descriptions of the energy carried by a ''gravitational'' field, a notion that is notoriously difficult to pin down in general relativity). These turn out to be zero for the Einstein\u2013Rosen waves, and Rosen argued that this reaffirmed the negative conclusion he had reached with Einstein in 1936.\n\nHowever, by this time a few physicists, such as [[Felix Pirani]] and [[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|Ivor Robinson]], had come to appreciate the role played by curvature in producing tidal accelerations, and were able to convince many peers that gravitational radiation would indeed be produced, at least in cases such as a vibrating spring where different pieces of the system were clearly not in [[inertia]]l motion. Nonetheless, some physicists continued to doubt whether radiation would be produced by a [[binary star system]], where the [[world line]]s of the [[center of mass|centers of mass]] of the two stars should, according to the [[Einstein\u2013Infeld\u2013Hoffmann equations|EIH approximation]] (dating from 1938 and due to Einstein, Infeld, and [[Banesh Hoffmann]]), follow [[timelike geodesic]]s.\n\nInspired by conversations by [[Felix Pirani]], Hermann Bondi took up the study of gravitational radiation, in particular the question of quantifying the energy and momentum carried off 'to infinity' by a radiating system. During the next few years, Bondi developed the [[Bondi radiating chart]] and the notion of [[Bondi energy]] to rigorously study this question in maximal generality.\n\nIn 1957, at a conference at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]], appealing to various mathematical tools developed by [[John Lighton Synge]], [[A. Z. Petrov]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz]], Pirani explained more clearly than had previously been possible the central role played by the [[Riemann tensor]] and in particular the [[electrogravitic tensor|tidal tensor]] in general relativity.<ref name=Pirani1957>{{cite journal | author=Pirani, Felix A.

''[[Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' (1912) was his best-selling book.\n\nIn addition to the commercial success of his printed works, his books have had second lives and continuing influence when adapted as films and television productions. His novels and short stories have been adapted into 112 films, two television episodes, and a television series, ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]''.<ref name=\"hulse-vii-x\">Hulse 2007, pp. vii\u2013x.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nPearl Zane Grey was born January 31, 1872, in [[Zanesville, Ohio]]. His birth name may have originated from newspaper descriptions of [[Queen Victoria]]'s mourning clothes as \"pearl grey.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 5.</ref> He was the fourth of five children born to Alice \"Allie\" Josephine Zane, whose English [[Quaker]] [[immigrant]] ancestor Robert Zane came to the North American colonies in 1673, and her husband, Lewis M. Gray, a dentist.<ref>May 1997, p. 3.</ref> His family changed the spelling of its last name to \"Grey\" after his birth. Later Grey dropped Pearl and used Zane as his first name.\n\nHe grew up in Zanesville, a city founded by his maternal grandfather, John McIntire, who had been gifted the land by Zane's maternal great-grandfather [[Ebenezer Zane]], an [[American Revolutionary War]] patriot.\n\nBoth Zane and his brother [[Reddy Grey|Romer]] were active, athletic boys who were enthusiastic baseball players and fishermen.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 17.</ref> From an early age, he was intrigued by history. Soon, he developed an interest in writing. His early interests contributed to his later writing success.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> For example, his knowledge of history informed his first three novels, which recounted the heroism of ancestors who fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\nAs a child, Grey frequently engaged in violent brawls, probably related to his father\u2019s punishing him with severe beatings. Though irascible and antisocial like his father, Grey was supported by a loving mother and found a father substitute. Muddy Miser was an old man who approved of Grey's love of fishing and writing, and who talked about the advantages of an unconventional life. Despite warnings by Grey's father to steer clear of Miser, the boy spent much time during five formative years in the company of the old man.<ref>May 1997, p. 2.</ref>\n\nGrey was an avid reader of adventure stories such as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'', as well as [[dime novels]] featuring [[Buffalo Bill]] and \u201c[[Deadwood Dick]]\u201d. He was enthralled by and crudely copied the great illustrators [[Howard Pyle]] and [[Frederic Remington]].<ref>May 1997, p. 6.</ref> He was particularly impressed with ''Our Western Border'', a history of the Ohio frontier that likely inspired his earliest novels.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 13.</ref> Zane wrote his first story, ''Jim of the Cave'', when he was fifteen. His father tore it to shreds and beat him.<ref>May 1997, p. 7.</ref>\n\nDue to shame from a severe financial setback in 1889 caused by a poor investment, Lewis Grey moved his family from Zanesville and started again in [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref>May 1997, p. 8.</ref> While his father struggled to re-establish his dental practice, Zane Grey made rural house calls and performed basic extractions, which his father had taught him. The younger Grey practiced until the state board intervened. His brother Romer earned money by driving a delivery wagon.<ref name=\"gruber-26\">Gruber 1969, p. 26.</ref> Grey also worked as a part-time usher in a theater and played summer [[baseball]] for the Columbus Capitols, with aspirations of becoming a major leaguer.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 22.</ref> Eventually, Grey was spotted by a baseball scout and received offers from many colleges.  Romer also attracted scouts\u2019 attention and went on to have a professional baseball career.<ref name=\"gruber-26\" />\n\n=== University of Pennsylvania and baseball ===\n[[File:Zane Grey 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|Zane Grey at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1895]]\nGrey chose the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on a baseball [[scholarship]], where he studied [[dentistry]] and joined [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]; he graduated in 1896. When he arrived at Penn, he had to prove himself worthy of a scholarship before receiving it. He rose to the occasion by coming in to pitch against the Riverton club, pitching five scoreless innings and producing a double in the tenth which contributed to the win.<ref>May 1997, p. 11.</ref> The [[Ivy League]] was highly competitive and an excellent training ground for future pro baseball players. Grey was a solid hitter and an excellent pitcher who relied on a sharply dropping curve ball. When the distance from the pitcher's mound to the plate was lengthened by ten feet in 1894 (primarily to reduce the dominance of [[Cy Young]]'s pitching), the effectiveness of Grey's pitching suffered. He was re-positioned to the outfield.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 34.</ref> The short, wiry baseball player remained a campus hero on the strength of his timely hitting.<ref name=\"may-16\">May 1997, p. 16.</ref>\n\nHe was an indifferent scholar, barely achieving a minimum average. Outside class he spent his time on baseball, swimming, and creative writing, especially poetry.<ref name=\"may-16\" /> His shy nature and his [[teetotalism|teetotaling]] set him apart from other students, and he socialized little. Grey struggled with the idea of becoming a writer or baseball player for his career, but unhappily concluded that dentistry was the practical choice.\n\nDuring a summer break, while playing \"summer nines\" in [[Delphos, Ohio]], Grey was charged with, and quietly settled, a [[paternity (law)|paternity]] suit.  His father paid the $133.40 cost and Grey resumed playing summer baseball.  He concealed the episode when he returned to Penn.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 35.</ref>\n\nGrey went on to play [[minor league baseball]] with several teams, including the [[Newark, New Jersey]] Colts in 1898<ref name=\"baseball-1\">{{cite web|title=Zane Grey Minor League Statistics |website=Baseball Reference |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=grey--001zan |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> and also with the Orange Athletic Club for several years. His brother [[Reddy Grey|Romer Carl \"Reddy\" Grey]] (known as \"R.C.\" to his family) did better and played professionally in the minor leagues.  Romer played a single major league game in 1903 for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].<ref name=\"baseball-2\">{{cite web|title=Reddy Grey Statistics |website=Baseball Reference |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greyre01.shtml |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Dentistry ===\nAfter graduating, Grey established his practice in New York City under the name of Dr. Zane Grey in 1896.  It was a competitive area but he wanted to be close to publishers.  He began to write in the evening to offset the tedium of his dental practice.<ref name=\"gruber-35\">Gruber 1969, p. 35.</ref>  He struggled financially and emotionally. Grey was a natural writer but his early efforts were stiff and grammatically weak. Whenever possible, he played baseball with the Orange Athletic Club in New Jersey, a team of former collegiate players that was one of the best amateur teams in the country.<ref name=\"gruber-35\" />\n\nGrey often went camping with his brother R.C. in [[Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]], where they fished in the upper [[Delaware River]].  When canoeing in 1900, Grey met seventeen-year-old Lina Roth, better known as \"Dolly.\" Dolly came from a family of physicians and was studying to be a schoolteacher.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 38.</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and family ===\n[[File:Zane Grey House, Lackawaxen, PA.jpg|thumb|The [[Zane Grey Museum]] in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]]\nAfter a passionate and intense courtship marked by frequent quarrels, Grey and Dolly married five years later in 1905.  Grey suffered bouts of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anger, and [[mood swings]], which affected him most of his life. As he described it,  \"A hyena lying in ambush\u2014that is my black spell! I conquered one mood only to fall prey to the next ... I wandered about like a lost soul or a man who was conscious of imminent death.\"<ref>May 1997, pp. 22\u201322.</ref>\n\nDuring his courtship of Dolly, Grey still saw previous girlfriends and warned her frankly, \n\n<blockquote>But I love to be free.  I cannot change my spots.  The ordinary man is satisfied with a moderate income, a home, wife, children, and all that. ... But I am a million miles from being that kind of man and no amount of trying will ever do any good ... I shall never lose the spirit of my interest in women.<ref>Pauly 2005, pp. 53, 57.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter they married in 1905, Dolly gave up her teaching career.  They moved to a farmhouse at the confluence of the [[Lackawaxen River|Lackawaxen]] and Delaware rivers, in [[Lackawaxen Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania|Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]], where Grey's mother and sister joined them. (This house, now preserved and operated as the [[Zane Grey Museum]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].) Grey finally ceased his dental practice to work full-time on his nascent literary pursuits.  Dolly's inheritance provided an initial financial cushion.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\n=== Writing career ===\n[[File:Tse-ne-gat son of the Paiute Chief Polk Utah Summer 1914 by Zane Grey.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white image of two men on horse back|Picture taken by Zane Grey of Tse-ne-gat, one of the fighters during the [[Bluff War]] ]]\nWhile Dolly managed Grey's career and raised their three children, including son [[Romer Zane Grey]], over the next two decades Grey often spent months away from the family.  He fished, wrote, and spent time with his many mistresses. While Dolly knew of his behavior, she seemed to view it as his handicap rather than a choice.  Throughout their life together, he highly valued her management of his career and their family, and her solid emotional support.  In addition to her considerable editorial skills, she had good business sense and handled all his contract negotiations with publishers, agents, and movie studios. All his income was split fifty-fifty with her; from her \"share,\" she covered all family expenses.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 224.</ref> Their considerable correspondence shows evidence of his lasting love for her despite his infidelities and personal emotional turmoil.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nThe Greys moved to California in 1918.  In 1920 they settled in [[Altadena, California]], where Grey bought [[Zane Grey Estate|a prominent mansion on East Mariposa Street]], known locally as \"Millionaire's Row.\" Designed by architects [[Myron Hunt]] and [[Elmer Grey]] (no relation to the author), the 1907 Mediterranean-style house is acclaimed as the first fireproof home in Altadena, built entirely of reinforced [[concrete]] as prescribed by the first owner's wife.{{citation needed|reason=Factual statement re: first fireproff home ordered by first owner's wife|date=November 2015}} Grey summed up his feelings for the city: \"In Altadena, I have found those qualities that make life worth living.\"<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 184.</ref>\n\nIn Altadena Grey also spent time with his mistress Brenda Montenegro. The two met while hiking Eaton Canyon.  Of her he wrote,\n\n<blockquote>I saw her flowing raven mane against the rocks of the canyon. I have seen the red skin of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and the olive of the Spaniards, but her ... her skin looked as if her Creator had in that instant molded her just for me. I thought it was an apparition.  She seemed to be the embodiment of the West I portray in my books, open and wild.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Larry|title=Christmas in Altadena where characters are real|url=http://www.sbsun.com/opinion/20101202/larry-wilson-christmas-in-altadena-where-characters-are-real|website=The Sun|publisher=San Bernardino County Sun|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWith the help of Dolly's proofreading and copy editing, Grey gradually improved his writing. His first magazine article, \"A Day on the Delaware,\" a human-interest story about a Grey brothers' fishing expedition, was published in the May 1902 issue of ''[[Recreation]]'' magazine.<ref>May 1997, p. 23.</ref> Elated at selling the article, Grey offered reprints to patients in his waiting room.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 44.</ref> In writing, Grey found temporary escape from the harshness of his life and his demons. \"Realism is death to me.

After studying its style and structure in detail, he decided to write a full-length work.<ref name=\"may-34\">May 1997, p. 34.</ref> Grey had difficulties in writing his first novel, ''Betty Zane'' (1903).  When it was rejected by Harper & Brothers, he lapsed into despair.<ref name=\"may-34\" /> The novel dramatized the heroism of an ancestor who had saved [[Fort Henry (West Virginia)|Fort Henry]].  He self-published it, perhaps with funds provided by his wife Dolly or his brother R.

He also began the habit of taking copious notes, not only of scenery and activities but of dialogue.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 167.</ref> His first two trips were arduous, but Grey learned much from his compatriot adventurers. He gained the confidence to write convincingly about the American West, its characters, and its landscape.  Treacherous river crossings, unpredictable beasts, bone-chilling cold, searing heat, parching thirst, bad water, irascible tempers, and heroic cooperation all became real to him. He wrote, \"Surely, of all the gifts that have come to me from contact with the West, this one of sheer love of wildness, beauty, color, grandeur, has been the greatest, the most significant for my work.\"<ref name=\"may-52\">May 1997, p. 52.</ref>\n\nUpon returning home in 1909, Grey wrote a new novel, ''The Last of the Plainsmen'', describing the adventures of Buffalo Jones.  Harper's editor [[Ripley Hitchcock]] rejected it, the fourth work in a row.  He told Grey, \"I do not see anything in this to convince me you can write either narrative or fiction.\"<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 77.</ref> Grey wrote dejectedly,\n\n<blockquote>I don't know which way to turn.  I cannot decide what to write next.  That which I desire to write does not seem to be what the editors want ... I am full of stories and zeal and fire ... yet I am inhibited by doubt, by fear that my feeling for life is false.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 89.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book was later published by the American magazine, ''[[Outing (magazine)|Outing]]'', which provided Grey some satisfaction. Grey next wrote a series of magazine articles and juvenile novels.<ref name=\"Pauly2007\">{{cite book|author=Thomas H.

He wrote it in four months in 1910. It quickly became a bestseller. Grey took his next work to Hitchcock again; this time Harper published his work, a historical romance in which [[Mormon]] characters were of central importance.<ref name=\"may-52\" /> Grey continued to write popular novels about [[Manifest Destiny]], the conquest of the [[Old West]], and the behavior of men in elemental conditions.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nTwo years later Grey produced his best-known book, ''[[Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' (1912), his all-time best-seller, and one of the most successful Western novels of all time.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 1, 105.</ref>  Hitchcock rejected it, but Grey took his manuscript directly to the vice president of Harper, who accepted it. The novel had a sequel ([[The Rainbow Trail]] in 1915), and was filmed five times (in [[Riders of the Purple Sage (1918 film)|1918]], 1925, 1931, 1941 and 1996); but in later film versions the villains are corrupt judges or lawyers, not polygamous Mormons). \n\nAs Zane Grey had become a household name, after that Harper eagerly received all his manuscripts.  Other publishers caught on to the commercial potential of the Western novel. [[Max Brand]] and [[Ernest Haycox]] were among the most notable of other writers of Westerns.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 108, 110.</ref> Grey's publishers paired his novels with some of the best illustrators of the time, including [[N. C. Wyeth]], [[Frank Schoonover]], [[Douglas Duer]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Wilhelm Heinrich Detlev K\u00f6rner|W. H. D. Koerner]], and [[Charles Marion Russell|Charles Russell]].<ref name=\"may-83\">May 1997, p. 83.</ref>\n\nGrey had the time and money to engage in his first and greatest passion: fishing. From 1918 until 1932, he was a regular contributor to ''[[Outdoor Life]]'' magazine.  As one of its first celebrity writers, he began to popularize big-game fishing. Several times he went deep-sea fishing in Florida to relax and to write in solitude.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 117.</ref> Although he commented that \"the sea, from which all life springs, has been equally with the desert my teacher and religion\", Grey was unable to write a great [[Nautical fiction|sea novel]].<ref>May 1997, p. 120.</ref> He felt the sea soothed his moods, reduced his depressions, and gained him the opportunity to harvest deeper thoughts:\n\n{{quote|The lure of the sea is some strange magic that makes men love what they fear.  The solitude of the desert is more intimate than that of the sea. Death on the shifting barren sands seems less insupportable to the imagination than death out on the boundless ocean, in the awful, windy emptiness.  Man's bones yearn for dust.<ref name=\"may-83\" />}}\n\nOver the years, Grey spent part of his time traveling and the rest of the year wrote novels and articles. Unlike writers who could write every day, Grey would have dry spells and then sudden bursts of energy, in which he could write as much as 100,000 words in a month.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 214.</ref> He encountered fans in most places. He visited the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in [[Oregon]] in 1919 for a fishing expedition, and fell in love with it. He returned in the 1920s, eventually setting up [[Zane Grey Cabin|a cabin]] on the lower Rogue River. Grey captured the river's essence in two books: Tales of Freshwater Fishing and Rogue River Feud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opb.org/news/article/how-zane-grey-put-the-rogue-river-on-the-map/|title=How Zane Grey Put The Rogue River On The Map|last=Norcross|first=Geoff|website=www.opb.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref> Other excursions took him to [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] and [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"gruber-218\">Gruber 1969, p. 218.</ref>\n\n[[File:SITE OF ZANE GREY'S LODGE IN GILA COUNTY.jpg|thumb|right|Site of Grey's cabin in Arizona]]\n[[File:Zane Grey in Australia.jpg|thumb|Zane Grey at Koala Park holding a [[koala]] during a visit to Australia in December 1935]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=16219 |title=Adlib Internet Server 5 &#124; Details |publisher=Acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}</ref>\nFrom 1923 to 1930, he spent a few weeks a year at his cabin on the [[Mogollon Rim]], in Central [[Arizona]].  After years of abandonment and decay, the cabin was restored in 1966 by [[Bill Goettl]], a Phoenix air conditioning magnate. He opened it to the public as a free-of-charge museum. The [[Dude Fire]] destroyed the cabin in 1990. It was later reconstructed 25 miles away in the town of [[Payson, Arizona|Payson]].<ref name=\"gruber-218\" />\n\nDuring the 1930s, Grey continued to write, but the [[Great Depression]] hurt the publishing industry.  His sales fell off, and he found it more difficult to sell serializations. He had avoided making investments that would have been affected by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] of 1929, and continued to earn royalty income, so he did better than many financially. Nearly half of the film adaptations of his novels were made in the 1930s.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 311.</ref>\n\nFrom 1925 to his death in 1939, Grey traveled more and further from his family.  He became interested in exploring unspoiled lands, particularly the islands of the South Pacific, New Zealand and Australia.  He thought Arizona was beginning to be overrun by tourists and speculators.<ref>May 1997, p. 149.</ref> Near the end of his life, Grey looked into the future and wrote:\n{{quote|The so-called civilization of man and his works shall perish from the earth, while the shifting sands, the red looming walls, the purple sage, and the towering monuments, the vast brooding range show no perceptible change.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 278.</ref>}}\n\n=== Reception by critics ===\nThe more books Grey sold, the more the established critics, such as [[Heywood Broun]] and [[Burton Rascoe]], attacked him. They claimed his depictions of the West were too fanciful, too violent, and not faithful to the moral realities of the frontier.  They thought his characters unrealistic and much larger-than-life.  Broun stated that \"the substance of any two Zane Grey books could be written upon the back of a postage stamp.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 157.</ref>\n\nT. K. Whipple praised a typical Grey novel as a modern version of the ancient ''[[Beowulf]]'' saga,\n\n<blockquote>\"a battle of passions with one another and with the will, a struggle of love and hate, or remorse and revenge, of blood, lust, honor, friendship, anger, grief\u2014all of a grand scale and all incalculable and mysterious.\" But he also criticized Grey's writing, \"His style, for example, has the stiffness which comes from an imperfect mastery of the medium.  It lacks fluency and facility.\"<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 258.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGrey based his work in his own varied first-hand experience, supported by careful note-taking, and considerable research.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 166\u201367.</ref> Despite his great popular success and fortune, Grey read the reviews and sometimes became paralyzed by negative emotions after critical ones.<ref>May 1997, p. 133.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, a reviewer said Grey's \"moral ideas ... [were] decidedly askew.\" Grey reacted with a 20-page treatise, \"My Answer to the Critics.\" He defended his intentions to produce great literature in the setting of the Old West.<ref>May 1997, p. 134.</ref> He suggested that critics should ask his readers what they think of his books, and noted actor and fan [[John Barrymore]] as an example. Dolly warned him against publishing the treatise, and he retreated from a public confrontation.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nHis novel ''The Vanishing American'' (1925), first serialized in ''[[The Ladies' Home Journal]]'' in 1922, prompted a heated debate. People recognized its [[Navajo people|Navajo]] hero as patterned after [[Jim Thorpe]], a great Native American athlete. Grey portrayed the struggle of the Navajo to preserve their identity and culture against corrupting influences of the white government and of [[missionaries]]. This viewpoint enraged religious groups. Grey contended, \"I have studied the Navaho Indians for 12 years. I know their wrongs. The missionaries sent out there are almost everyone mean, vicious, weak, immoral, useless men.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 138.</ref> To have the book published, Grey agreed to some structural changes. With this book, Grey completed the most productive period of his writing career, having laid out most major themes, character types, and settings.<ref name=\"may-143\">May 1997, p. 143.</ref>\n\nHis ''Wanderer of the Wasteland'' is a thinly disguised autobiography.<ref>May 1997, p. 118.</ref> One of his books, \"Tales of the Angler's El Dorado, New Zealand,\" helped establish the [[Bay of Islands]] in New Zealand as a premier [[game fishing]] area.  Several of his later writings (e.g. [[Rangle River]]) were based in Australia.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\n=== Fishing ===\nGrey co-founded the \"Porpoise Club\" with his friend, Robert H. Davis of ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'', to popularize the sport of hunting of [[dolphins]] and [[porpoises]].  They made their first catch off [[Seabright, New Jersey]] on September 21, 1912, where they harpooned and reeled in a [[bottlenose dolphin]].<ref>George Reiger, ed., ''The Best of Zane Grey, Outdoorsman: Hunting and Fishing Tales'' (Stackpole Books, 1992)</ref><ref name=\"pauly-149\">Pauly 2007, p. 149.</ref>\n\nGrey's son Loren claims in the introduction to ''[[Tales of Tahitian Waters]]'' that Zane Grey fished on average 300 days a year through his adult life. Grey and his brother R.C. were frequent visitors to [[Long Key]], [[Florida]], where they helped to establish the [[Long Key Fishing Club]], built by [[Henry Morrison Flagler]]. Zane Grey was its president from 1917 to 1920. He pioneered the fishing of Boohoo fish ([[sailfish]]). Zane Grey Creek was named for him.<ref>[http://www.keyshistory.org/longkey.html Long Key], Keys History website</ref>\n\nGrey indulged his interest in fishing with visits to Australia and New Zealand. He first visited New Zealand in 1926 and caught several large fish of great variety, including a [[mako shark]], a ferocious fighter which presented a new challenge.  Grey established a base at Otehei Bay, [[Urupukapuka Island]] in the [[Bay of Islands]], which became a destination for the rich and famous. He wrote many articles in international sporting magazines highlighting the uniqueness of New Zealand fishing, which has produced heavy-tackle world records for the major [[billfish]], striped [[marlin]], black marlin, blue marlin and broadbill.  A lodge and camp were established at Otehei Bay in 1927 called the Zane Grey Sporting Club. He held numerous world records during this time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zgws.org/zgfishre.php|title=Zane Grey's West Society -|website=www.zgws.org}}</ref> and invented the teaser, a hookless bait that is still used today to attract fish. Grey made three additional fishing trips to New Zealand. The second was January to April 1927, the third December 1928 to March 1929, and the last from December 1932 to February 1933.\n\nGrey fished out of [[Wedgeport, Nova Scotia]], for many summers.\n\nGrey also helped establish deep-sea sport fishing in [[New South Wales]], Australia, particularly in [[Bermagui, New South Wales|Bermagui]], which is famous for marlin fishing. Patron of the Bermagui Sport Fishing Association for 1936 and 1937, Grey set a number of world records,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zgws.org/zgfishre.php|title=Zane Grey's West Society -|website=www.zgws.org|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.igfa.org/Museum/HOF-Grey.aspx|title=IGFA {{!}} Zane Grey|website=www.igfa.org|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thewatermansjournal.com/blog/article/-03-11-zane-grey-rediscovering-a-legend|title=The Waterman's Journal - Global Sportfishing News, Reports, and More ...|last=TheWatermansJournal.com|website=thewatermansjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref> and wrote of his experiences in his book ''An American Angler in Australia''.\n\nFrom 1928 on, Grey was a frequent visitor to [[Tahiti]]. He fished the surrounding waters several months at a time and maintained a permanent fishing camp at [[Vairao]]. He claimed that these were the most difficult waters he had ever fished, but from these waters he also took some of his most important records, such as the first marlin over 1,000 pounds.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nGrey had built a getaway home in [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], which once served as the Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel |publisher=Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel |url=http://www.zanegreypueblohotel.com/ |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}{{deadlink|date=June 2019}}</ref> He served as president of Catalina's exclusive fishing club, the [[Tuna Club of Avalon]].<ref>Pete Thomas, [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/09/news/os-fairgame9 Pioneers on the angling front], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', December 9, 2003</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nZane Grey died of heart failure on October 23, 1939, at his home in [[Altadena, California]].

Later these were adapted again for television, forming the series ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'' (''Sgt. Preston of the Yukon'' on TV).

''[[Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' (1912) was his best-selling book.\n\nIn addition to the commercial success of his printed works, his books have had second lives and continuing influence when adapted as films and television productions. His novels and short stories have been adapted into 112 films, two television episodes, and a television series, ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theater]]''.<ref name=\"hulse-vii-x\">Hulse 2007, pp. vii\u2013x.</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nPearl Zane Grey was born January 31, 1872, in [[Zanesville, Ohio]]. His birth name may have originated from newspaper descriptions of [[Queen Victoria]]'s mourning clothes as \"pearl grey.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 5.</ref> He was the fourth of five children born to Alice \"Allie\" Josephine Zane, whose English [[Quaker]] [[immigrant]] ancestor Robert Zane came to the North American colonies in 1673, and her husband, Lewis M. Gray, a dentist.<ref>May 1997, p. 3.</ref> His family changed the spelling of its last name to \"Grey\" after his birth. Later Grey dropped Pearl and used Zane as his first name.\n\nHe grew up in Zanesville, a city founded by his maternal grandfather, John McIntire, who had been gifted the land by Zane's maternal great-grandfather [[Ebenezer Zane]], an [[American Revolutionary War]] patriot.\n\nBoth Zane and his brother [[Reddy Grey|Romer]] were active, athletic boys who were enthusiastic baseball players and fishermen.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 17.</ref> From an early age, he was intrigued by history. Soon, he developed an interest in writing. His early interests contributed to his later writing success.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> For example, his knowledge of history informed his first three novels, which recounted the heroism of ancestors who fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 13.</ref>\n\nAs a child, Grey frequently engaged in violent brawls, probably related to his father\u2019s punishing him with severe beatings. Though irascible and antisocial like his father, Grey was supported by a loving mother and found a father substitute. Muddy Miser was an old man who approved of Grey's love of fishing and writing, and who talked about the advantages of an unconventional life. Despite warnings by Grey's father to steer clear of Miser, the boy spent much time during five formative years in the company of the old man.<ref>May 1997, p. 2.</ref>\n\nGrey was an avid reader of adventure stories such as ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and the ''[[Leatherstocking Tales]]'', as well as [[dime novels]] featuring [[Buffalo Bill]] and \u201c[[Deadwood Dick]]\u201d. He was enthralled by and crudely copied the great illustrators [[Howard Pyle]] and [[Frederic Remington]].<ref>May 1997, p. 6.</ref> He was particularly impressed with ''Our Western Border'', a history of the Ohio frontier that likely inspired his earliest novels.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 13.</ref> Zane wrote his first story, ''Jim of the Cave'', when he was fifteen. His father tore it to shreds and beat him.<ref>May 1997, p. 7.</ref>\n\nDue to shame from a severe financial setback in 1889 caused by a poor investment, Lewis Grey moved his family from Zanesville and started again in [[Columbus, Ohio]].<ref>May 1997, p. 8.</ref> While his father struggled to re-establish his dental practice, Zane Grey made rural house calls and performed basic extractions, which his father had taught him. The younger Grey practiced until the state board intervened. His brother Romer earned money by driving a delivery wagon.<ref name=\"gruber-26\">Gruber 1969, p. 26.</ref> Grey also worked as a part-time usher in a theater and played summer [[baseball]] for the Columbus Capitols, with aspirations of becoming a major leaguer.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 22.</ref> Eventually, Grey was spotted by a baseball scout and received offers from many colleges.  Romer also attracted scouts\u2019 attention and went on to have a professional baseball career.<ref name=\"gruber-26\" />\n\n=== University of Pennsylvania and baseball ===\n[[File:Zane Grey 1895.jpg|thumb|upright|Zane Grey at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], 1895]]\nGrey chose the [[University of Pennsylvania]] on a baseball [[scholarship]], where he studied [[dentistry]] and joined [[Sigma Nu]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]; he graduated in 1896. When he arrived at Penn, he had to prove himself worthy of a scholarship before receiving it. He rose to the occasion by coming in to pitch against the Riverton club, pitching five scoreless innings and producing a double in the tenth which contributed to the win.<ref>May 1997, p. 11.</ref> The [[Ivy League]] was highly competitive and an excellent training ground for future pro baseball players. Grey was a solid hitter and an excellent pitcher who relied on a sharply dropping curve ball. When the distance from the pitcher's mound to the plate was lengthened by ten feet in 1894 (primarily to reduce the dominance of [[Cy Young]]'s pitching), the effectiveness of Grey's pitching suffered. He was re-positioned to the outfield.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 34.</ref> The short, wiry baseball player remained a campus hero on the strength of his timely hitting.<ref name=\"may-16\">May 1997, p. 16.</ref>\n\nHe was an indifferent scholar, barely achieving a minimum average. Outside class he spent his time on baseball, swimming, and creative writing, especially poetry.<ref name=\"may-16\" /> His shy nature and his [[teetotalism|teetotaling]] set him apart from other students, and he socialized little. Grey struggled with the idea of becoming a writer or baseball player for his career, but unhappily concluded that dentistry was the practical choice.\n\nDuring a summer break, while playing \"summer nines\" in [[Delphos, Ohio]], Grey was charged with, and quietly settled, a [[paternity (law)|paternity]] suit.  His father paid the $133.40 cost and Grey resumed playing summer baseball.  He concealed the episode when he returned to Penn.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 35.</ref>\n\nGrey went on to play [[minor league baseball]] with several teams, including the [[Newark, New Jersey]] Colts in 1898<ref name=\"baseball-1\">{{cite web|title=Zane Grey Minor League Statistics |website=Baseball Reference |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=grey--001zan |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref> and also with the Orange Athletic Club for several years. His brother [[Reddy Grey|Romer Carl \"Reddy\" Grey]] (known as \"R.C.\" to his family) did better and played professionally in the minor leagues.  Romer played a single major league game in 1903 for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]].<ref name=\"baseball-2\">{{cite web|title=Reddy Grey Statistics |website=Baseball Reference |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greyre01.shtml |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Dentistry ===\nAfter graduating, Grey established his practice in New York City under the name of Dr. Zane Grey in 1896.  It was a competitive area but he wanted to be close to publishers.  He began to write in the evening to offset the tedium of his dental practice.<ref name=\"gruber-35\">Gruber 1969, p. 35.</ref>  He struggled financially and emotionally. Grey was a natural writer but his early efforts were stiff and grammatically weak. Whenever possible, he played baseball with the Orange Athletic Club in New Jersey, a team of former collegiate players that was one of the best amateur teams in the country.<ref name=\"gruber-35\" />\n\nGrey often went camping with his brother R.C. in [[Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]], where they fished in the upper [[Delaware River]].  When canoeing in 1900, Grey met seventeen-year-old Lina Roth, better known as \"Dolly.\" Dolly came from a family of physicians and was studying to be a schoolteacher.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 38.</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and family ===\n[[File:Zane Grey House, Lackawaxen, PA.jpg|thumb|The [[Zane Grey Museum]] in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]]\nAfter a passionate and intense courtship marked by frequent quarrels, Grey and Dolly married five years later in 1905.  Grey suffered bouts of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], anger, and [[mood swings]], which affected him most of his life. As he described it,  \"A hyena lying in ambush\u2014that is my black spell! I conquered one mood only to fall prey to the next ... I wandered about like a lost soul or a man who was conscious of imminent death.\"<ref>May 1997, pp. 22\u201322.</ref>\n\nDuring his courtship of Dolly, Grey still saw previous girlfriends and warned her frankly, \n\n<blockquote>But I love to be free.  I cannot change my spots.  The ordinary man is satisfied with a moderate income, a home, wife, children, and all that. ... But I am a million miles from being that kind of man and no amount of trying will ever do any good ... I shall never lose the spirit of my interest in women.<ref>Pauly 2005, pp. 53, 57.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter they married in 1905, Dolly gave up her teaching career.  They moved to a farmhouse at the confluence of the [[Lackawaxen River|Lackawaxen]] and Delaware rivers, in [[Lackawaxen Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania|Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]], where Grey's mother and sister joined them. (This house, now preserved and operated as the [[Zane Grey Museum]], is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].) Grey finally ceased his dental practice to work full-time on his nascent literary pursuits.  Dolly's inheritance provided an initial financial cushion.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 49\u201350.</ref>\n\n=== Writing career ===\n[[File:Tse-ne-gat son of the Paiute Chief Polk Utah Summer 1914 by Zane Grey.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white image of two men on horse back|Picture taken by Zane Grey of Tse-ne-gat, one of the fighters during the [[Bluff War]] ]]\nWhile Dolly managed Grey's career and raised their three children, including son [[Romer Zane Grey]], over the next two decades Grey often spent months away from the family.  He fished, wrote, and spent time with his many mistresses. While Dolly knew of his behavior, she seemed to view it as his handicap rather than a choice.  Throughout their life together, he highly valued her management of his career and their family, and her solid emotional support.  In addition to her considerable editorial skills, she had good business sense and handled all his contract negotiations with publishers, agents, and movie studios. All his income was split fifty-fifty with her; from her \"share,\" she covered all family expenses.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 224.</ref> Their considerable correspondence shows evidence of his lasting love for her despite his infidelities and personal emotional turmoil.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nThe Greys moved to California in 1918.  In 1920 they settled in [[Altadena, California]], where Grey bought [[Zane Grey Estate|a prominent mansion on East Mariposa Street]], known locally as \"Millionaire's Row.\" Designed by architects [[Myron Hunt]] and [[Elmer Grey]] (no relation to the author), the 1907 Mediterranean-style house is acclaimed as the first fireproof home in Altadena, built entirely of reinforced [[concrete]] as prescribed by the first owner's wife.{{citation needed|reason=Factual statement re: first fireproff home ordered by first owner's wife|date=November 2015}} Grey summed up his feelings for the city: \"In Altadena, I have found those qualities that make life worth living.\"<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 184.</ref>\n\nIn Altadena Grey also spent time with his mistress Brenda Montenegro. The two met while hiking Eaton Canyon.  Of her he wrote,\n\n<blockquote>I saw her flowing raven mane against the rocks of the canyon. I have seen the red skin of the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and the olive of the Spaniards, but her ... her skin looked as if her Creator had in that instant molded her just for me. I thought it was an apparition.  She seemed to be the embodiment of the West I portray in my books, open and wild.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=Larry|title=Christmas in Altadena where characters are real|url=http://www.sbsun.com/opinion/20101202/larry-wilson-christmas-in-altadena-where-characters-are-real|website=The Sun|publisher=San Bernardino County Sun|accessdate=November 22, 2015}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWith the help of Dolly's proofreading and copy editing, Grey gradually improved his writing. His first magazine article, \"A Day on the Delaware,\" a human-interest story about a Grey brothers' fishing expedition, was published in the May 1902 issue of ''[[Recreation]]'' magazine.<ref>May 1997, p. 23.</ref> Elated at selling the article, Grey offered reprints to patients in his waiting room.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 44.</ref> In writing, Grey found temporary escape from the harshness of his life and his demons. \"Realism is death to me. I cannot stand life as it is.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 22.</ref> By this time, he had given up baseball.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 42.</ref>\n\nGrey read [[Owen Wister]]'s great Western novel ''[[The Virginian (novel)|The Virginian]]''. After studying its style and structure in detail, he decided to write a full-length work.<ref name=\"may-34\">May 1997, p. 34.</ref> Grey had difficulties in writing his first novel, ''Betty Zane'' (1903).  When it was rejected by Harper & Brothers, he lapsed into despair.<ref name=\"may-34\" /> The novel dramatized the heroism of an ancestor who had saved [[Fort Henry (West Virginia)|Fort Henry]].  He self-published it, perhaps with funds provided by his wife Dolly or his brother R. C.'s wealthy girlfriend Reba Smith.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 47.</ref> From the beginning, vivid description was the strongest aspect of his writing.<ref>May 1997, p. 39.</ref>\n\n[[File:Blue book 191706.jpg|thumb|Grey's novel ''The Roaring U.P. Trail'' was serialized in [[Blue Book (magazine)|''Blue Book'']] in 1917]]\n\nAfter attending a lecture in New York in 1907 by [[Charles \"Buffalo\" Jones|Charles Jesse \"Buffalo\" Jones]], western hunter and guide who had co-founded [[Garden City, Kansas]], Grey arranged for a [[mountain lion]]-hunting trip to the [[North Rim]] of the [[Grand Canyon]].<ref>May 1997, p. 48.</ref> He brought along a camera to document his trips and prove his adventures.  He also began the habit of taking copious notes, not only of scenery and activities but of dialogue.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 167.</ref> His first two trips were arduous, but Grey learned much from his compatriot adventurers. He gained the confidence to write convincingly about the American West, its characters, and its landscape.  Treacherous river crossings, unpredictable beasts, bone-chilling cold, searing heat, parching thirst, bad water, irascible tempers, and heroic cooperation all became real to him. He wrote, \"Surely, of all the gifts that have come to me from contact with the West, this one of sheer love of wildness, beauty, color, grandeur, has been the greatest, the most significant for my work.\"<ref name=\"may-52\">May 1997, p. 52.</ref>\n\nUpon returning home in 1909, Grey wrote a new novel, ''The Last of the Plainsmen'', describing the adventures of Buffalo Jones.  Harper's editor [[Ripley Hitchcock]] rejected it, the fourth work in a row.  He told Grey, \"I do not see anything in this to convince me you can write either narrative or fiction.\"<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 77.</ref> Grey wrote dejectedly,\n\n<blockquote>I don't know which way to turn.  I cannot decide what to write next.  That which I desire to write does not seem to be what the editors want ... I am full of stories and zeal and fire ... yet I am inhibited by doubt, by fear that my feeling for life is false.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 89.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe book was later published by the American magazine, ''[[Outing (magazine)|Outing]]'', which provided Grey some satisfaction. Grey next wrote a series of magazine articles and juvenile novels.<ref name=\"Pauly2007\">{{cite book|author=Thomas H. Pauly|title=Zane Grey: His Life, His Adventures, His Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLlmBdOG1nIC&pg=PA359|date=27 July 2007|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07492-9|page=359}}</ref>\n\nWith the birth of his first child pending, Grey felt compelled to complete his next novel, ''The Heritage of the Desert''.  He wrote it in four months in 1910. It quickly became a bestseller. Grey took his next work to Hitchcock again; this time Harper published his work, a historical romance in which [[Mormon]] characters were of central importance.<ref name=\"may-52\" /> Grey continued to write popular novels about [[Manifest Destiny]], the conquest of the [[Old West]], and the behavior of men in elemental conditions.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nTwo years later Grey produced his best-known book, ''[[Riders of the Purple Sage]]'' (1912), his all-time best-seller, and one of the most successful Western novels of all time.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 1, 105.</ref>  Hitchcock rejected it, but Grey took his manuscript directly to the vice president of Harper, who accepted it. The novel had a sequel ([[The Rainbow Trail]] in 1915), and was filmed five times (in [[Riders of the Purple Sage (1918 film)|1918]], 1925, 1931, 1941 and 1996); but in later film versions the villains are corrupt judges or lawyers, not polygamous Mormons). \n\nAs Zane Grey had become a household name, after that Harper eagerly received all his manuscripts.  Other publishers caught on to the commercial potential of the Western novel. [[Max Brand]] and [[Ernest Haycox]] were among the most notable of other writers of Westerns.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 108, 110.</ref> Grey's publishers paired his novels with some of the best illustrators of the time, including [[N. C. Wyeth]], [[Frank Schoonover]], [[Douglas Duer]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Wilhelm Heinrich Detlev K\u00f6rner|W. H. D. Koerner]], and [[Charles Marion Russell|Charles Russell]].<ref name=\"may-83\">May 1997, p. 83.</ref>\n\nGrey had the time and money to engage in his first and greatest passion: fishing. From 1918 until 1932, he was a regular contributor to ''[[Outdoor Life]]'' magazine.  As one of its first celebrity writers, he began to popularize big-game fishing. Several times he went deep-sea fishing in Florida to relax and to write in solitude.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 117.</ref> Although he commented that \"the sea, from which all life springs, has been equally with the desert my teacher and religion\", Grey was unable to write a great [[Nautical fiction|sea novel]].<ref>May 1997, p. 120.</ref> He felt the sea soothed his moods, reduced his depressions, and gained him the opportunity to harvest deeper thoughts:\n\n{{quote|The lure of the sea is some strange magic that makes men love what they fear.  The solitude of the desert is more intimate than that of the sea. Death on the shifting barren sands seems less insupportable to the imagination than death out on the boundless ocean, in the awful, windy emptiness.  Man's bones yearn for dust.<ref name=\"may-83\" />}}\n\nOver the years, Grey spent part of his time traveling and the rest of the year wrote novels and articles. Unlike writers who could write every day, Grey would have dry spells and then sudden bursts of energy, in which he could write as much as 100,000 words in a month.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 214.</ref> He encountered fans in most places. He visited the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] in [[Oregon]] in 1919 for a fishing expedition, and fell in love with it. He returned in the 1920s, eventually setting up [[Zane Grey Cabin|a cabin]] on the lower Rogue River. Grey captured the river's essence in two books: Tales of Freshwater Fishing and Rogue River Feud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opb.org/news/article/how-zane-grey-put-the-rogue-river-on-the-map/|title=How Zane Grey Put The Rogue River On The Map|last=Norcross|first=Geoff|website=www.opb.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref> Other excursions took him to [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] and [[Wyoming]].<ref name=\"gruber-218\">Gruber 1969, p. 218.</ref>\n\n[[File:SITE OF ZANE GREY'S LODGE IN GILA COUNTY.jpg|thumb|right|Site of Grey's cabin in Arizona]]\n[[File:Zane Grey in Australia.jpg|thumb|Zane Grey at Koala Park holding a [[koala]] during a visit to Australia in December 1935]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/itemDetailPaged.cgi?itemID=16219 |title=Adlib Internet Server 5 &#124; Details |publisher=Acmssearch.sl.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2018-04-15}}</ref>\nFrom 1923 to 1930, he spent a few weeks a year at his cabin on the [[Mogollon Rim]], in Central [[Arizona]].  After years of abandonment and decay, the cabin was restored in 1966 by [[Bill Goettl]], a Phoenix air conditioning magnate. He opened it to the public as a free-of-charge museum. The [[Dude Fire]] destroyed the cabin in 1990. It was later reconstructed 25 miles away in the town of [[Payson, Arizona|Payson]].<ref name=\"gruber-218\" />\n\nDuring the 1930s, Grey continued to write, but the [[Great Depression]] hurt the publishing industry.  His sales fell off, and he found it more difficult to sell serializations. He had avoided making investments that would have been affected by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash]] of 1929, and continued to earn royalty income, so he did better than many financially. Nearly half of the film adaptations of his novels were made in the 1930s.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 311.</ref>\n\nFrom 1925 to his death in 1939, Grey traveled more and further from his family.  He became interested in exploring unspoiled lands, particularly the islands of the South Pacific, New Zealand and Australia.  He thought Arizona was beginning to be overrun by tourists and speculators.<ref>May 1997, p. 149.</ref> Near the end of his life, Grey looked into the future and wrote:\n{{quote|The so-called civilization of man and his works shall perish from the earth, while the shifting sands, the red looming walls, the purple sage, and the towering monuments, the vast brooding range show no perceptible change.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 278.</ref>}}\n\n=== Reception by critics ===\nThe more books Grey sold, the more the established critics, such as [[Heywood Broun]] and [[Burton Rascoe]], attacked him. They claimed his depictions of the West were too fanciful, too violent, and not faithful to the moral realities of the frontier.  They thought his characters unrealistic and much larger-than-life.  Broun stated that \"the substance of any two Zane Grey books could be written upon the back of a postage stamp.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 157.</ref>\n\nT. K. Whipple praised a typical Grey novel as a modern version of the ancient ''[[Beowulf]]'' saga,\n\n<blockquote>\"a battle of passions with one another and with the will, a struggle of love and hate, or remorse and revenge, of blood, lust, honor, friendship, anger, grief\u2014all of a grand scale and all incalculable and mysterious.\" But he also criticized Grey's writing, \"His style, for example, has the stiffness which comes from an imperfect mastery of the medium.  It lacks fluency and facility.\"<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 258.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGrey based his work in his own varied first-hand experience, supported by careful note-taking, and considerable research.<ref>Gruber 1969, pp. 166\u201367.</ref> Despite his great popular success and fortune, Grey read the reviews and sometimes became paralyzed by negative emotions after critical ones.<ref>May 1997, p. 133.</ref>\n\nIn 1923, a reviewer said Grey's \"moral ideas ... [were] decidedly askew.\" Grey reacted with a 20-page treatise, \"My Answer to the Critics.\" He defended his intentions to produce great literature in the setting of the Old West.<ref>May 1997, p. 134.</ref> He suggested that critics should ask his readers what they think of his books, and noted actor and fan [[John Barrymore]] as an example. Dolly warned him against publishing the treatise, and he retreated from a public confrontation.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nHis novel ''The Vanishing American'' (1925), first serialized in ''[[The Ladies' Home Journal]]'' in 1922, prompted a heated debate. People recognized its [[Navajo people|Navajo]] hero as patterned after [[Jim Thorpe]], a great Native American athlete. Grey portrayed the struggle of the Navajo to preserve their identity and culture against corrupting influences of the white government and of [[missionaries]]. This viewpoint enraged religious groups. Grey contended, \"I have studied the Navaho Indians for 12 years. I know their wrongs. The missionaries sent out there are almost everyone mean, vicious, weak, immoral, useless men.\"<ref>May 1997, p. 138.</ref> To have the book published, Grey agreed to some structural changes. With this book, Grey completed the most productive period of his writing career, having laid out most major themes, character types, and settings.<ref name=\"may-143\">May 1997, p. 143.</ref>\n\nHis ''Wanderer of the Wasteland'' is a thinly disguised autobiography.<ref>May 1997, p. 118.</ref> One of his books, \"Tales of the Angler's El Dorado, New Zealand,\" helped establish the [[Bay of Islands]] in New Zealand as a premier [[game fishing]] area.  Several of his later writings (e.g. [[Rangle River]]) were based in Australia.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\n=== Fishing ===\nGrey co-founded the \"Porpoise Club\" with his friend, Robert H. Davis of ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'', to popularize the sport of hunting of [[dolphins]] and [[porpoises]].  They made their first catch off [[Seabright, New Jersey]] on September 21, 1912, where they harpooned and reeled in a [[bottlenose dolphin]].<ref>George Reiger, ed., ''The Best of Zane Grey, Outdoorsman: Hunting and Fishing Tales'' (Stackpole Books, 1992)</ref><ref name=\"pauly-149\">Pauly 2007, p. 149.</ref>\n\nGrey's son Loren claims in the introduction to ''[[Tales of Tahitian Waters]]'' that Zane Grey fished on average 300 days a year through his adult life. Grey and his brother R.C. were frequent visitors to [[Long Key]], [[Florida]], where they helped to establish the [[Long Key Fishing Club]], built by [[Henry Morrison Flagler]]. Zane Grey was its president from 1917 to 1920. He pioneered the fishing of Boohoo fish ([[sailfish]]). Zane Grey Creek was named for him.<ref>[http://www.keyshistory.org/longkey.html Long Key], Keys History website</ref>\n\nGrey indulged his interest in fishing with visits to Australia and New Zealand. He first visited New Zealand in 1926 and caught several large fish of great variety, including a [[mako shark]], a ferocious fighter which presented a new challenge.  Grey established a base at Otehei Bay, [[Urupukapuka Island]] in the [[Bay of Islands]], which became a destination for the rich and famous. He wrote many articles in international sporting magazines highlighting the uniqueness of New Zealand fishing, which has produced heavy-tackle world records for the major [[billfish]], striped [[marlin]], black marlin, blue marlin and broadbill.  A lodge and camp were established at Otehei Bay in 1927 called the Zane Grey Sporting Club. He held numerous world records during this time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zgws.org/zgfishre.php|title=Zane Grey's West Society -|website=www.zgws.org}}</ref> and invented the teaser, a hookless bait that is still used today to attract fish. Grey made three additional fishing trips to New Zealand. The second was January to April 1927, the third December 1928 to March 1929, and the last from December 1932 to February 1933.\n\nGrey fished out of [[Wedgeport, Nova Scotia]], for many summers.\n\nGrey also helped establish deep-sea sport fishing in [[New South Wales]], Australia, particularly in [[Bermagui, New South Wales|Bermagui]], which is famous for marlin fishing. Patron of the Bermagui Sport Fishing Association for 1936 and 1937, Grey set a number of world records,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zgws.org/zgfishre.php|title=Zane Grey's West Society -|website=www.zgws.org|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.igfa.org/Museum/HOF-Grey.aspx|title=IGFA {{!}} Zane Grey|website=www.igfa.org|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thewatermansjournal.com/blog/article/-03-11-zane-grey-rediscovering-a-legend|title=The Waterman's Journal - Global Sportfishing News, Reports, and More ...|last=TheWatermansJournal.com|website=thewatermansjournal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-19}}</ref> and wrote of his experiences in his book ''An American Angler in Australia''.\n\nFrom 1928 on, Grey was a frequent visitor to [[Tahiti]]. He fished the surrounding waters several months at a time and maintained a permanent fishing camp at [[Vairao]]. He claimed that these were the most difficult waters he had ever fished, but from these waters he also took some of his most important records, such as the first marlin over 1,000 pounds.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nGrey had built a getaway home in [[Santa Catalina Island, California]], which once served as the Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel |publisher=Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel |url=http://www.zanegreypueblohotel.com/ |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}{{deadlink|date=June 2019}}</ref> He served as president of Catalina's exclusive fishing club, the [[Tuna Club of Avalon]].<ref>Pete Thomas, [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/dec/09/news/os-fairgame9 Pioneers on the angling front], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', December 9, 2003</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nZane Grey died of heart failure on October 23, 1939, at his home in [[Altadena, California]]. He was interred at the Lackawaxen and Union Cemetery, [[Lackawaxen Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania|Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=lrRJAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT11015&lpg=PT11015&dq=Lackawaxen+and+Union+Cemetery+zane+grey&source=bl&ots=FPQJql3SFh&sig=ACfU3U0HNO2awTgd96QOo_T0odC--zKRLQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwia_-HA6MHhAhWny4MKHd2kAPsQ6AEwB3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Lackawaxen%20and%20Union%20Cemetery%20zane%20grey&f=false ''Delphi Collected Works of Zane Grey'']</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n=== Literary works ===\nGrey became one of the first millionaire authors.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With his veracity and emotional intensity, he connected with millions of readers worldwide, during peacetime and war, and inspired many Western writers who followed him.\n\nZane Grey was a major force in shaping the myths of the Old West; his books and stories were adapted into other media, such as film and TV productions. He was the author of more than 90 books, some published posthumously and/or based on [[Serial (literature)|serials]] originally published in magazines. His total book sales exceed 40&nbsp;million.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 143.</ref>\n\nGrey wrote not only Westerns, but two hunting books, six children's books, three baseball books, and eight fishing books.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 2.</ref> Many of them became bestsellers.  It is estimated that he wrote more than nine million words in his career.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 3.</ref> From 1917 to 1926, Grey was in the top ten best-seller list nine times, which required sales of more than 100,000 copies each time.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 1.</ref> Even after his death, Harper had a stockpile of his manuscripts and continued to publish a new title each year until 1963.<ref>May 1997, p. 151.</ref> During the 1940s and afterward, as Grey's books were reprinted as paperbacks, his sales exploded.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\n[[Erle Stanley Gardner]], prolific author of mystery novels and the ''[[Perry Mason]]'' series, said of Grey:\n\n{{quote|[He] had the knack of tying his characters into the land, and the land into the story.  There were other Western writers who had fast and furious action, but Zane Grey was the one who could make the action not only convincing but inevitable, and somehow you got the impression that the bigness of the country generated a bigness of character.<ref>Gruber 1969, p. 213.</ref>}}\n\nGrey was President [[Dwight D.

This enabled him to control production values and faithfulness to his books.  After seven films he sold his company to [[Jesse Lasky]] who was a partner of the founder of [[Paramount Pictures]]. Paramount made a number of movies based on Grey's writings and hired him as advisor.<ref>May 1997, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> Many of his films were shot at locations described in his books.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nIn 1936 Grey appeared as himself in a feature film shot in Australia, ''[[White Death (1936 film)|White Death]]'' (1936).  At the same time he provided a story that was filmed as ''[[Rangle River]]'' (1936).\n\nGrey became disenchanted by the commercial exploitation and copyright infringement of his works.  He felt his stories and characters were diluted by being adapted to film.<ref>May 1997, p. 110.</ref> Nearly 50 of his novels were converted into more than 100 Western movies.<ref name=\"gruber-4\">Gruber 1969, p. 4.</ref>  Shortly after Grey's death, the success of Fritz Lang's [[Western Union (film)|''Western Union'']] (1941), a film based on one of his books, helped bring about a resurgence in Hollywood westerns.  Its costars were [[Randolph Scott]] and [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]].  The period of the 1940s and 1950s included the great works of [[John Ford]], who successfully used the settings of Grey's novels in Arizona and Utah.<ref>Pauly 2005, p. 312.</ref>\n\nThe success of Grey's ''[[The Lone Star Ranger]]'' (the novel was adapted into four movies: 1914, 1919, [[The Lone Star Ranger (1930 film)|1930]] and 1942, and a [[comic book]] in 1949) and ''[[King of the Royal Mounted]]'' (popular as a series of [[Big Little Books]] and comics, later turned into a 1936 film and  three film serials) inspired two radio series by [[George Trendle]] ([[WXYT (AM)|WXYZ]], [[Detroit]]).  Later these were adapted again for television, forming the series ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]'' and ''[[Challenge of the Yukon]]'' (''Sgt. Preston of the Yukon'' on TV).  More of Grey's work was featured in adapted form on the ''Zane Grey Show'', which ran on the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] for five months in the 1940s, and the \"Zane Grey Western Theatre,\" which had a five-year run of 145 episodes.<ref name=\"gruber-4\" />\n\nMany famous actors got their start in films based on Zane Grey books.  They included [[Gary Cooper]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[William Powell]], [[Wallace Beery]], [[Richard Arlen]], [[Buster Crabbe]], [[Shirley Temple]], and [[Fay Wray]]. [[Victor Fleming]], later director of  ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', and [[Henry Hathaway]], who later directed ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'', both learned their craft on Grey films.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\n=== Honors and awards ===\n* The [[National Park Service]] maintains his former home in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania as the [[Zane Grey Museum (Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania)|Zane Grey Museum]], a part of the [[Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River]] area.\n* His [[Zane Grey Estate|home in Altadena]] is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n* Zanesville, Ohio, has a museum named in his honor, the National Road-Zane Grey Museum.\n* Zane Grey Terrace, a small residential street in the hillsides of Altadena, is named in his honor.\n* The Zane Grey Tourist Park in Bermagui, Australia.\n* \"Zane Greys'\" a headland at the western end of Matapaua Bay, New Zealand.\n* The Zane Grey Continuation School is located adjacent to [[Reseda High School]] in [[Reseda, Los Angeles]], California.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}\n* Zane Grey room is located at the Sigma Nu \u2013 Beta Rho house in honor of where Zane Grey lived for part of his time at the University of Pennsylvania.\n* Wilder Ranch State Park near [[Santa Cruz, California]] named the Zane Grey Trail after the author.

This is in contrast to the former [[Alliance of American Football|AAF]], which eliminated kickoffs outright, and the NFL and college football, both of which imposed rules minimizing the impact of the kickoff in the mid-2010s to improve player safety.<ref name=\"ap51019\" /> Many of these kickoff rules were adapted from rules created by The Spring League's predecessor, the [[Fall Experimental Football League]].<ref name=\"espn2\">{{cite news|last1=Seifert|first1=Kevin|title=Inside slant: FXFL set to debut, ready or not|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/143981/inside-slant-fxfl-set-to-debut-ready-or-not|accessdate=October 8, 2014|work=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n*The spot of the kickoff is set at the kicking team's 30-yard line.<ref name=\"seifertrulesreveal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/28438441/xfl-rule-changes-focus-faster-pace-more-excitement|title=XFL rule changes to focus on faster pace, more excitement|first=Kevin|last=Seifert|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=January 7, 2020|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> (The NFL and college standard is the 35-yard line.) However, members of the kicking team (excluding the kicker) line up at the receiving team's 35-yard line and blockers on the receiving team must line up at their 30-yard line. Only the kicker and returner(s) can move until the ball is either caught or three seconds after it hits the ground.\n*Kickoffs that go out of bounds, or fall short of the receiving team's 20-yard line,<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" /> come to the kicking team's 45-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciatraina/2019/09/03/why-former-giants-offensive-coordinator-kevin-gilbride-joined-the-xfl/|title=Why Former Giants Offensive Coordinator Kevin Gilbride Joined The XFL|first=Patricia|last=Traina|website=Forbes}}</ref> (The NFL and NCAA only require a kick travel 10 yards; kicks out of bounds are placed at the receiving team's 40 yard line.)\n*The XFL uses two different types of touchbacks. A major touchback occurs when a kick travels into the endzone in the air, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 35. A minor touchback occurs when the ball bounces into the endzone, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 15. These rules discourage either team from purposefully taking a touchback.\n*Teams can request to attempt an [[onside kick]] under more conventional kickoff rules. If a team opts for an onside kick, the ball must travel at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team (as with other leagues) but may not travel more than 20 yards downfield in the air from the spot of the kick, to prevent the formation from being used as a [[loophole]].<ref name=\"teamnine\">{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/oliver-luck-talks-tv-deals-draft-and-xfls-team-9/|title=Oliver Luck talks TV deals, Draft and XFL's \"Team 9\" {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 24, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Punts ====\n\n*The XFL does not allow [[gunner (gridiron football)|gunners]]; all players on a punting team must remain on or behind the line of scrimmage until the ball is kicked.<ref>McAfee, Pat.

November 21, 2019</ref> (This is a carryover from the original XFL, although that league had scrapped the rule midway through its only season).\n*The [[coffin corner punt]] is treated as a touchback and brought to the 35-yard line. The attempts to neutralize punt coverage are made with the intention of encouraging more [[Glossary of American football#F|fourth-down conversions]]; Luck conceded halfway through the inaugural season that the effort was largely unsuccessful, as coaches continued to punt as usual.<ref name=sixmidseasontakeaways/>\n*The same touchback rules for kickoffs also applies to punts.\n\n==== Points after touchdown ====\nThe conventional [[extra point]] kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt [[two-point conversion|two points]], and a ten-yard attempt three points.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/08/xfl-to-use-one-two-three-point-conversions/|title=XFL to use one-, two-, three-point conversions|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 8, 2019|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs. The [[Stars Football League]] also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score.\n\n==== Double-forward pass ====\nTeams are able to attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass.\n\n==== Overtime ====\nOvertime is decided by a five-round [[penalty shootout|shootout]] of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the [[NCAA]] adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 FBS season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/07/spring-league-returns-with-revolutionary-overtime-idea/|title=Spring League returns with revolutionary overtime idea|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 7, 2019|work=Profootballtalk.com|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Greg |title=Targeting protocols approved for football |url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref> Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball.

Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted pursuant to regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score. If both teams remain tied after five rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw.<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" />\n\n==== Clock changes ====\n*Outside of the [[two-minute warning]], the clock runs continuously. During this time, the clock only stops during a change of possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/wwe-issues-fan-survey-asking-fans-what-they-would-like-to-see-in-the-xfl/|title=WWE issues fan survey asking fans what they would like to see in the XFL {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 12, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> This reverses after the [[two-minute warning]] (which the XFL uses), after which the clock stops after all plays from scrimmage<ref name=tbt7119>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2019/07/01/how-the-xfl-will-be-different-from-the-nfl/|title=How the XFL will be different from the NFL|first=Thomas|last=Bassinger|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 1, 2019|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref> until the ball is spotted and reverts to NFL timing rules otherwise, stopping after incomplete passes, advancing the ball out of bounds and spiking the football. ([[Arena football]] has long used a continuous clock with even fewer stoppages; Canadian football does not use a continuous clock, but stops the clock after all plays from scrimmage following that code's [[three-minute warning]].)\n*The [[play clock]] is 25 seconds long measured from the spotting of the ball, roughly the same as the NCAA rule for plays when the clock is stopped. (This is five seconds longer than the CFL rule, which is 20 seconds from the spotting of the ball. The XFL's efforts to speed up spotting are aimed to make the two lengths of time nearly the same, 30 to 32 seconds overall.) The NFL standard is 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, also used during the NCAA during plays when the clock is running; the former AAF and previous XFL measure was 35 seconds from the end of the previous play.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In conjunction with this rule, the XFL has a one-way radio in all offensive players' helmets to allow the [[offensive coordinator]] to run a [[no-huddle offense]] and call plays directly to all of the players from the sidelines. This eliminates the need for a [[huddle]].<ref name=espn613>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26958876/can-xfl-20-succeed-where-aaf-why-already-jump-start|title=Can XFL 2.0 succeed where the AAF couldn't?

This is in contrast to the former [[Alliance of American Football|AAF]], which eliminated kickoffs outright, and the NFL and college football, both of which imposed rules minimizing the impact of the kickoff in the mid-2010s to improve player safety.<ref name=\"ap51019\" /> Many of these kickoff rules were adapted from rules created by The Spring League's predecessor, the [[Fall Experimental Football League]].<ref name=\"espn2\">{{cite news|last1=Seifert|first1=Kevin|title=Inside slant: FXFL set to debut, ready or not|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/143981/inside-slant-fxfl-set-to-debut-ready-or-not|accessdate=October 8, 2014|work=ESPN.com|publisher=ESPN|date=October 8, 2014}}</ref>\n*The spot of the kickoff is set at the kicking team's 30-yard line.<ref name=\"seifertrulesreveal\">{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/espn/story/_/id/28438441/xfl-rule-changes-focus-faster-pace-more-excitement|title=XFL rule changes to focus on faster pace, more excitement|first=Kevin|last=Seifert|work=[[ESPN.com]]|date=January 7, 2020|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref> (The NFL and college standard is the 35-yard line.) However, members of the kicking team (excluding the kicker) line up at the receiving team's 35-yard line and blockers on the receiving team must line up at their 30-yard line. Only the kicker and returner(s) can move until the ball is either caught or three seconds after it hits the ground.\n*Kickoffs that go out of bounds, or fall short of the receiving team's 20-yard line,<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" /> come to the kicking team's 45-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patriciatraina/2019/09/03/why-former-giants-offensive-coordinator-kevin-gilbride-joined-the-xfl/|title=Why Former Giants Offensive Coordinator Kevin Gilbride Joined The XFL|first=Patricia|last=Traina|website=Forbes}}</ref> (The NFL and NCAA only require a kick travel 10 yards; kicks out of bounds are placed at the receiving team's 40 yard line.)\n*The XFL uses two different types of touchbacks. A major touchback occurs when a kick travels into the endzone in the air, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 35. A minor touchback occurs when the ball bounces into the endzone, which results in the receiving team taking possession at the 15. These rules discourage either team from purposefully taking a touchback.\n*Teams can request to attempt an [[onside kick]] under more conventional kickoff rules. If a team opts for an onside kick, the ball must travel at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team (as with other leagues) but may not travel more than 20 yards downfield in the air from the spot of the kick, to prevent the formation from being used as a [[loophole]].<ref name=\"teamnine\">{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/oliver-luck-talks-tv-deals-draft-and-xfls-team-9/|title=Oliver Luck talks TV deals, Draft and XFL's \"Team 9\" {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 24, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Punts ====\n\n*The XFL does not allow [[gunner (gridiron football)|gunners]]; all players on a punting team must remain on or behind the line of scrimmage until the ball is kicked.<ref>McAfee, Pat.

November 21, 2019</ref> (This is a carryover from the original XFL, although that league had scrapped the rule midway through its only season).\n*The [[coffin corner punt]] is treated as a touchback and brought to the 35-yard line. The attempts to neutralize punt coverage are made with the intention of encouraging more [[Glossary of American football#F|fourth-down conversions]]; Luck conceded halfway through the inaugural season that the effort was largely unsuccessful, as coaches continued to punt as usual.<ref name=sixmidseasontakeaways/>\n*The same touchback rules for kickoffs also applies to punts.\n\n==== Points after touchdown ====\nThe conventional [[extra point]] kick was replaced with a scrimmage play, varying in point value depending on how far the touchdown-scoring team chooses to take the snap from the goal line: a two-yard attempt scores a single point, a five-yard attempt [[two-point conversion|two points]], and a ten-yard attempt three points.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/08/xfl-to-use-one-two-three-point-conversions/|title=XFL to use one-, two-, three-point conversions|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 8, 2019|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en|access-date=April 9, 2019}}</ref> (This rule is also a carryover from the original XFL, which added the rule only for the playoffs. The [[Stars Football League]] also used the rule during its existence.) In the event the defense secures a turnover and returns the ball for a touchdown, the defensive team scores the same number of points as the offense was aiming to score.\n\n==== Double-forward pass ====\nTeams are able to attempt two forward passes on the same play, so long as the ball never crosses the line of scrimmage before the second pass.\n\n==== Overtime ====\nOvertime is decided by a five-round [[penalty shootout|shootout]] of two-point conversions similar to a penalty shootout in soccer or ice hockey. Such a shootout had never been attempted in organized football at the time the rule was proposed; in April 2019, the [[NCAA]] adopted a similar concept for games that reach a fifth overtime starting with the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 FBS season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/04/07/spring-league-returns-with-revolutionary-overtime-idea/|title=Spring League returns with revolutionary overtime idea|last=Florio|first=Mike|date=April 7, 2019|work=Profootballtalk.com|accessdate=April 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Greg |title=Targeting protocols approved for football |url=http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/media-center/news/targeting-protocols-approved-football |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=July 11, 2019}}</ref> Unlike other football leagues, a coin toss is not used to determine who is on offense first; instead, the visiting team is on offense first and home team on defense first for each round, similar to baseball.

Pre-snap offensive penalties result in the ball being respotted pursuant to regular rules, while post-snap offensive penalties result in a loss of down and no score. If both teams remain tied after five rounds, multiple rounds of conversions will be played until one team succeeds, thus ensuring that no game can end in a draw.<ref name=\"XFL Rules\" />\n\n==== Clock changes ====\n*Outside of the [[two-minute warning]], the clock runs continuously. During this time, the clock only stops during a change of possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://xfl2k.com/news/wwe-issues-fan-survey-asking-fans-what-they-would-like-to-see-in-the-xfl/|title=WWE issues fan survey asking fans what they would like to see in the XFL {{!}} XFL2k|last=Rachuk|first=Stephan|date=April 12, 2019|website=XFL2K.com|language=en-US|access-date=April 12, 2019}}</ref> This reverses after the [[two-minute warning]] (which the XFL uses), after which the clock stops after all plays from scrimmage<ref name=tbt7119>{{cite web|url=https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2019/07/01/how-the-xfl-will-be-different-from-the-nfl/|title=How the XFL will be different from the NFL|first=Thomas|last=Bassinger|work=Tampa Bay Times|date=July 1, 2019|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref> until the ball is spotted and reverts to NFL timing rules otherwise, stopping after incomplete passes, advancing the ball out of bounds and spiking the football. ([[Arena football]] has long used a continuous clock with even fewer stoppages; Canadian football does not use a continuous clock, but stops the clock after all plays from scrimmage following that code's [[three-minute warning]].)\n*The [[play clock]] is 25 seconds long measured from the spotting of the ball, roughly the same as the NCAA rule for plays when the clock is stopped. (This is five seconds longer than the CFL rule, which is 20 seconds from the spotting of the ball. The XFL's efforts to speed up spotting are aimed to make the two lengths of time nearly the same, 30 to 32 seconds overall.) The NFL standard is 40 seconds from the end of the previous play, also used during the NCAA during plays when the clock is running; the former AAF and previous XFL measure was 35 seconds from the end of the previous play.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In conjunction with this rule, the XFL has a one-way radio in all offensive players' helmets to allow the [[offensive coordinator]] to run a [[no-huddle offense]] and call plays directly to all of the players from the sidelines. This eliminates the need for a [[huddle]].<ref name=espn613>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/26958876/can-xfl-20-succeed-where-aaf-why-already-jump-start|title=Can XFL 2.0 succeed where the AAF couldn't?
