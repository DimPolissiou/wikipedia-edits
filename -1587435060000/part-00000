The neighbouring administrative districts ([[gmina]]s) are [[Gmina Kobylnica|Kobylnica]] and [[Gmina S\u0142upsk]].\n\nS\u0142upsk had its origins as a Pomeranian settlement in the early [[Middle Ages]]. In 1265 it was given town rights. By the 14th century, the town had become a centre of local administration and trade and a [[Hanseatic League]] associate. Between 1368 and 1478, it was the residence of the [[Dukes of Pomerania|Dukes of S\u0142upsk]], until 1474 vassals of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385-1569)|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1648, according to the [[Peace of Westphalia|peace treaty]] of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], Stolp became part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. In 1815 it was incorporated into the newly formed Prussian [[Province of Pomerania (1653\u20131815)|Province of Pomerania]]. After [[World War II]] the city was assigned to Poland as part of the [[recovered territories]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\n{{anchor|Names}}Slavic names in  [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] \u2014 ''Stolpsk'',<ref name=\"etymology\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=20|title=S\u0142upsk.pl: ''Informacje og\u00f3lne''|accessdate=April 12, 2008|language=Polish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100355/http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=20|archive-date=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''St\u00f4\u0142psk'', ''S\u0142\u00ebpsk'', ''S\u0142\u00ebpsk\u00f2'', ''St\u00f4\u0142p''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naszekaszuby.pl/modules/artykuly/article.php?articleid=196|title=Nasze Kaszuby: Zestawienie kaszubskich i polskich nazw miejscowo\u015bci na Kaszubach, z wariantami, z wyszczeg\u00f3lnieniem powiat\u00f3w|language=Polish, Kashubian|accessdate=April 12, 2008}}</ref> \u2014 and [[Polish language|Polish]] \u2014 ''S\u0142upsk'' \u2014 may be etymologically related to the words ''s\u0142up'' (\"pole\") and ''sto\u0142p'' (\"keep\").

The territory was subsequently partitioned between [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Sweden]]. After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) and the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)]], Stolp came under Brandenburgian control. In 1660, [[Kashubian language|Kashubian dialect]] was allowed to be taught but only in religious studies.<ref name=\"Historia S\u0142upska do roku 1945\"/> Polish language in general however was experiencing very unfavourable conditions due to depopulation of the area in numerous wars and implied [[Germanization]].<ref>J\u0119zyk polski, Tomy 19-20 Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w J\u0119zyka Polskiego, page 194, W Drukarni Uniwersytetu Jagiello\u0144skiego, 1999</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Thirty Years' War]], Stolp lost much of its former importance&mdash;despite the fact that [[Szczecin]] was then [[Swedish Pomerania|a part of Sweden]], the province's capital was situated not in the second-largest city of the region, but in the one closest to the former ducal residence&mdash;[[Stargard]]. However, the local economy stabilized. The constant dynamic development of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and good economic conditions saw the city develop. After the major state border changes (modern [[Western Pomerania|Vorpommern]] and Stettin joined the Prussian state after a conflict with [[Sweden]]) Stolp was only an administrative centre of the ''[[Districts of Prussia|Kreis]]'' (district) within the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of [[Koszalin|K\u00f6slin]] (Koszalin). However, its geographical location led to rapid development, and in the 19th century it was the second city of the province in terms of both population and industrialization.\n\nIn 1769, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] established a military school in the city, according to [[Stanis\u0142aw Salmonowicz]] its purpose was the [[Germanization]] of local Polish nobility.<ref>''Polacy i Niemcy wobec siebie'' [[Stanis\u0142aw Salmonowicz]], O\u015brodek Bada\u0144 Naukowych im.

In 1869 a railway from [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (Gda\u0144sk) reached Stolp.\n\n[[File:637188 S\u0142upsk Ratusz 02.JPG|thumb|right|[[S\u0142upsk Town Hall]] from 1901]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the city's boundaries were significantly extended towards the west and south. The new railway station was built about 1,000 metres from the old city. In 1901, the construction of a new city hall was completed, followed by a local administration building in 1903. In 1910 a tram line was opened. The football club [[Viktoria Stolp]] was formed in 1901. In 1914, before the [[First World War]], Stolp had approximately 34,340 inhabitants.\n\n===Interwar period===\nStolp was not directly affected by the fighting in the [[First World War]]. The trams did not operate during the war, returning to the streets in 1919. Demographic growth remained high, although development slowed, because the city became peripheral, the ''Kreis'' (district) being situated on post-war Germany's border with the [[Polish Corridor]]. Polish claims to Stolp and its neighbouring area were refused during the [[Treaty of Versailles]] negotiations. From 1926 the city became an active point of [[Nazi]] supporters, and the influence of [[NSDAP]] grew rapidly.<ref name=\"Historia S\u0142upska do roku 1945\"/> The party with Hitler received 49.1% of the city's vote in the [[German federal election, March 1933|German federal election of March 1933]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/stolp.html |title=Deutsche Verwaltungsgeschichtevon der Reichseinigung 1871 bis zur Wiedervereinigung 1990 von Dr. Michael Rademacher M.A. |access-date=2011-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723075122/http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/stolp.html |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nDuring the [[Kristallnacht]], the night of 9/10 November 1938, the local [[synagogue]] was burned down.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">S\u0142upsk po wybuchu II wojny \u015bwiatowej</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:S\u0142upsk, Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Mariacki (1945).jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the Old Town in 1945]]\nThe beginning of the [[Second World War]] halted the development of the city.

The city boundaries are generally artificial, with only short natural boundaries around the villages of [[Kobylnica, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kobylnica]] and [[W\u0142ynk\u00f3wko]] on the [[S\u0142upia River]]. The boundaries have remained unchanged since 1949, when Ryczewo became a part of the city.\n\nS\u0142upsk shares about three-quarters of its boundaries with the rural district called [[Gmina S\u0142upsk]], of which S\u0142upsk is the administrative seat (although it is not part of the district). The city's other neighbouring district is [[Gmina Kobylnica]], to the south-west. The [[S\u0142upsk Special Economic Zone]] is not entirely contained within the city limits: a portion of it lies within Gmina S\u0142upsk, while some smaller areas are at quite a distance from S\u0142upsk ([[Debrzno]]), or even in another voivodeship ([[Koszalin]], [[Szczecinek]], [[Wa\u0142cz]]).\n[[File:S\u0142upsk boundnary scheme.png|thumb|270px|The neighbourhoods and suburbs of S\u0142upsk]]\nThe city has a fairly irregular shape, with its central point at ''Plac Zwyci\u0119stwa'' (\"Victory Square\") at {{Coord|54|27|51|N|17|01|42|E}}.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:POL-Rezerwat przyrody Buczyna nad S\u0142upi\u0105 DSC 0158.JPG|thumb|S\u0142upia River, which flows through S\u0142upsk]]\nS\u0142upsk lies in an ''[[Urstromtal|pradolina]]'' of the [[S\u0142upia River]]. The city centre is situated significantly lower than its western and easternmost portions. Divided into two almost equal parts by the river, S\u0142upsk is hilly when compared to other cities in the region. About {{convert|5|km2|sqmi}} of the city's area is covered by forests, while {{convert|17|km2|sqmi}} is used for agricultural purposes.\n\nS\u0142upsk is rich in natural water bodies. There are more than twenty [[pond]]s, mostly former meanders of the S\u0142upia, within the city limits. There are also several [[stream]]s, irrigation [[canal]]s (generally unused and abandoned) and a [[leat]]. Except in the city centre, all these watercourses are unregulated.\n\nThere is generally little human influence on landform features visible within the city limits. However, in the northwestern part of the city there is a huge [[Copse|hollow]], a remnant of a former [[sand mine]].

Poland}}\n\nThe European Interceptor Site (EIS) of the US was planned in nearby [[Redzikowo]], forming a [[Ground-Based Midcourse Defense]] system in conjunction with a US narrow-beam midcourse tracking and discrimination radar system in the [[Czech Republic]]. It was supposed to consist of up to 10 [[missile silo|silo]]-based interceptors, a two-stage version of the existing three-stage Ground Based Interceptor (GBI), with [[Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle]] (EKV).\n\nThe missile shield has received much local opposition in the area, including several protests. This included a protest in March 2008, when an estimated 300 protesters marched on the proposed site of the missile base.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/29/europe/EU-GEN-Poland-Missile-Defense.php Protesters March on Proposed US Missile Base]</ref> The planned installation was later scrapped by President Obama on 17 September 2009.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/18/world/europe/18shield.html?_r=1&hp President Obama announces scrapping the planned missile defense system in Poland and the Czech republic] [[New York Times]] Retrieved on 09-17-09</ref>\n\nOn February 12, 2016 the US Army has awarded AMEC Foster Wheeler a $182.7 million contract with option to support the Aegis Ashore missile defense system in Poland.

The neighbouring administrative districts ([[gmina]]s) are [[Gmina Kobylnica|Kobylnica]] and [[Gmina S\u0142upsk]].\n\nS\u0142upsk had its origins as a Pomeranian settlement in the early [[Middle Ages]]. In 1265 it was given town rights. By the 14th century, the town had become a centre of local administration and trade and a [[Hanseatic League]] associate. Between 1368 and 1478, it was the residence of the [[Dukes of Pomerania|Dukes of S\u0142upsk]], until 1474 vassals of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385-1569)|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1648, according to the [[Peace of Westphalia|peace treaty]] of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]], Stolp became part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. In 1815 it was incorporated into the newly formed Prussian [[Province of Pomerania (1653\u20131815)|Province of Pomerania]]. After [[World War II]] the city was assigned to Poland as part of the [[recovered territories]].\n\n==Etymology==\n\n{{anchor|Names}}Slavic names in  [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]] \u2014 ''Stolpsk'',<ref name=\"etymology\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=20|title=S\u0142upsk.pl: ''Informacje og\u00f3lne''|accessdate=April 12, 2008|language=Polish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013100355/http://www.slupsk.pl/info.php?id=20|archive-date=October 13, 2007|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''St\u00f4\u0142psk'', ''S\u0142\u00ebpsk'', ''S\u0142\u00ebpsk\u00f2'', ''St\u00f4\u0142p''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naszekaszuby.pl/modules/artykuly/article.php?articleid=196|title=Nasze Kaszuby: Zestawienie kaszubskich i polskich nazw miejscowo\u015bci na Kaszubach, z wariantami, z wyszczeg\u00f3lnieniem powiat\u00f3w|language=Polish, Kashubian|accessdate=April 12, 2008}}</ref> \u2014 and [[Polish language|Polish]] \u2014 ''S\u0142upsk'' \u2014 may be etymologically related to the words ''s\u0142up'' (\"pole\") and ''sto\u0142p'' (\"keep\").

The succeeding dukes were also vassals of the Kings of Poland: [[Wartislaw VII, Duke of Pomerania|Wartislaw VII]] paid homage in 1390 (to King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]]),<ref>Juliusz Bardach, ''Historia pa\u0144stwa i prawa Polski, Volume 1'', Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawn.

It became part of the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] in 1478.\n\n===Modern ages===\n[[File:Lubinus Stolpe.png|thumb|left|View of \"Stolpe\" from 1618, by [[Eilhard Lubinus]]]]\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] reached the town in 1521, when Christian Ketelhut preached in the town. Ketelhut was forced to leave Stolp in 1522 due to an intervention by [[Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania]]. Peter Suawe, a Protestant from Stolp, however, continued his practices. In 1524, Johannes Amandus from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] and others arrived and preached in a more radical way. As a consequence, Saint Mary's Church was profaned, the monastery's church was burned, and the clergy were treated poorly.<ref>Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, p.211, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}</ref> The inhabitants of the town began the process of conversion to [[Lutheranism]].

The territory was subsequently partitioned between [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and [[Sweden]]. After the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) and the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)]], Stolp came under Brandenburgian control. In 1660, [[Kashubian language|Kashubian dialect]] was allowed to be taught but only in religious studies.<ref name=\"Historia S\u0142upska do roku 1945\"/> Polish language in general however was experiencing very unfavourable conditions due to depopulation of the area in numerous wars and implied [[Germanization]].<ref>J\u0119zyk polski, Tomy 19-20 Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w J\u0119zyka Polskiego, page 194, W Drukarni Uniwersytetu Jagiello\u0144skiego, 1999</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Thirty Years' War]], Stolp lost much of its former importance&mdash;despite the fact that [[Szczecin]] was then [[Swedish Pomerania|a part of Sweden]], the province's capital was situated not in the second-largest city of the region, but in the one closest to the former ducal residence&mdash;[[Stargard]]. However, the local economy stabilized. The constant dynamic development of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] and good economic conditions saw the city develop. After the major state border changes (modern [[Western Pomerania|Vorpommern]] and Stettin joined the Prussian state after a conflict with [[Sweden]]) Stolp was only an administrative centre of the ''[[Districts of Prussia|Kreis]]'' (district) within the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of [[Koszalin|K\u00f6slin]] (Koszalin). However, its geographical location led to rapid development, and in the 19th century it was the second city of the province in terms of both population and industrialization.\n\nIn 1769, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] established a military school in the city, according to [[Stanis\u0142aw Salmonowicz]] its purpose was the [[Germanization]] of local Polish nobility.<ref>''Polacy i Niemcy wobec siebie'' [[Stanis\u0142aw Salmonowicz]], O\u015brodek Bada\u0144 Naukowych im.

In 1869 a railway from [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] (Gda\u0144sk) reached Stolp.\n\n[[File:637188 S\u0142upsk Ratusz 02.JPG|thumb|right|[[S\u0142upsk Town Hall]] from 1901]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the city's boundaries were significantly extended towards the west and south. The new railway station was built about 1,000 metres from the old city. In 1901, the construction of a new city hall was completed, followed by a local administration building in 1903. In 1910 a tram line was opened. The football club [[Viktoria Stolp]] was formed in 1901. In 1914, before the [[First World War]], Stolp had approximately 34,340 inhabitants.\n\n===Interwar period===\nStolp was not directly affected by the fighting in the [[First World War]]. The trams did not operate during the war, returning to the streets in 1919. Demographic growth remained high, although development slowed, because the city became peripheral, the ''Kreis'' (district) being situated on post-war Germany's border with the [[Polish Corridor]]. Polish claims to Stolp and its neighbouring area were refused during the [[Treaty of Versailles]] negotiations.

The city boundaries are generally artificial, with only short natural boundaries around the villages of [[Kobylnica, Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kobylnica]] and [[W\u0142ynk\u00f3wko]] on the [[S\u0142upia River]]. The boundaries have remained unchanged since 1949, when Ryczewo became a part of the city.\n\nS\u0142upsk shares about three-quarters of its boundaries with the rural district called [[Gmina S\u0142upsk]], of which S\u0142upsk is the administrative seat (although it is not part of the district). The city's other neighbouring district is [[Gmina Kobylnica]], to the south-west. The [[S\u0142upsk Special Economic Zone]] is not entirely contained within the city limits: a portion of it lies within Gmina S\u0142upsk, while some smaller areas are at quite a distance from S\u0142upsk ([[Debrzno]]), or even in another voivodeship ([[Koszalin]], [[Szczecinek]], [[Wa\u0142cz]]).\n[[File:S\u0142upsk boundnary scheme.png|thumb|270px|The neighbourhoods and suburbs of S\u0142upsk]]\nThe city has a fairly irregular shape, with its central point at ''Plac Zwyci\u0119stwa'' (\"Victory Square\") at {{Coord|54|27|51|N|17|01|42|E}}.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:POL-Rezerwat przyrody Buczyna nad S\u0142upi\u0105 DSC 0158.JPG|thumb|S\u0142upia River, which flows through S\u0142upsk]]\nS\u0142upsk lies in an ''[[Urstromtal|pradolina]]'' of the [[S\u0142upia River]]. The city centre is situated significantly lower than its western and easternmost portions. Divided into two almost equal parts by the river, S\u0142upsk is hilly when compared to other cities in the region. About {{convert|5|km2|sqmi}} of the city's area is covered by forests, while {{convert|17|km2|sqmi}} is used for agricultural purposes.\n\nS\u0142upsk is rich in natural water bodies. There are more than twenty [[pond]]s, mostly former meanders of the S\u0142upia, within the city limits. There are also several [[stream]]s, irrigation [[canal]]s (generally unused and abandoned) and a [[leat]]. Except in the city centre, all these watercourses are unregulated.\n\nThere is generally little human influence on landform features visible within the city limits. However, in the northwestern part of the city there is a huge [[Copse|hollow]], a remnant of a former [[sand mine]]. Although there were once plans to build a [[waterpark]] in this area,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gp24.pl/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070924/SLUPSK/70923013|title=Gp24.pl: ''Coraz bli\u017cej aquaparku''|accessdate=April 13, 2008|language=Polish}}</ref> they were later abandoned and the site remains unused.\n\n===Climate===\nS\u0142upsk has a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate|marine climate]], like the rest of the Polish coastal regions.<ref name=\"ilustrowana geografia polski\">{{Cite book|title=Ilustrowana Geografia Polski|author=Kaczmarek, T., Kaczmarek, U., So\u0142owiej D., Wrzesi\u0144ski, D.|year=2002|publisher=\u015awiat Ksi\u0105\u017cki|language=Polish}}</ref> The city lies in a zone where the [[continental climate]] influences are very weak compared with other regions of Poland.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Altas geograficzny dla szk\u00f3\u0142 \u015brednich|author=Collaborative work|year=2000|publisher=PPWK|language=Polish}}</ref> The warmest month is July, with an average temperature range of {{convert|11|to|21|C|F}}.

Their names are used for traffic signposting purposes and are shown on maps. The neighbourhoods are as follows:\n* '''Nadrzecze''' (\"Riverside\") \u2014 situated in the southern part of the city, this district is a major industrial area. It is bounded by the railroad to the west, [[Jadwiga \u0141uszczewska|Deotymy]] and [[Pope John Paul II|Jana Paw\u0142a II]] streets to the north, the S\u0142upia river to the east and the city boundary to the south.\n* '''Osiedle Akademickie''' (\"Academic Neighbourhood\") \u2014 a neighbourhood of [[detached house|detached]] and [[semi-detached]] houses around the [[Pomeranian Academy]] and its [[hall of residence|halls of residence]].\n* '''Osiedle Ba\u0142tyckie''' (\"Baltic Neighbourhood\") \u2014 the northernmost neighbourhood of S\u0142upsk, a large part of which belongs to the [[S\u0142upsk Special Economic Zone]].\n* '''Osiedle Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci''' (\"Independence Neighbourhood\") (before 1989 called ''Osiedle Budowniczych Polski Ludowej'' or \"Neighbourhood of the Builders of People's Poland\", and still popularly referred to as ''BPL'') and '''Osiedle Piast\u00f3w''' (\"[[Piast dynasty|Piast]] Neighbourhood\") \u2014 these neighbourhoods make up the largest residential area of the city, inhabited by about 40,000 people.\n* '''Osiedle S\u0142owi\u0144skie''' (\"[[Slovincian]] Neighbourhood\") \u2014 the easternmost part of S\u0142upsk, similar in character to Osiedle Akademickie. It adjoins the Northern Wood (''Lasek P\u00f3\u0142nocny'') and is close to the city's boundary with [[Redzikowo]], the planned site of the [[National missile defense|US national missile defense]] interceptors.\n* '''Ryczewo''' \u2014 brought within the city limits in 1949, this is the youngest neighbourhood of S\u0142upsk.

According to police statistics, it is the most dangerous area of the city.\n\n===Parks===\nS\u0142upsk has many green areas within its boundaries. The most important are the Park of Culture and Leisure (''Park Kultury i Wypoczynku''), the Northern Wood (''Lasek P\u00f3\u0142nocny'') and the Southern Wood (''Lasek Po\u0142udniowy'').

The narrow gauge tracks were rebuilt as standard gauge by 1933, but were demolished during the Second World War. After the war, the first train connection to be restored was that with [[L\u0119bork]], reopened May 27, 1945.

Local roads of lesser importance connect S\u0142upsk with surrounding villages and towns.\n\nThe city's network of streets is well developed, but many of them require general refurbishment. The city is currently investing significant sums of money in road development.\n\n===Air===\n[[S\u0142upsk-Redzikowo Airport]] is now defunct, however, it once worked as a regular passenger airport of local significance. Several plans to eventually reopen it failed because of lack of funds.

{"title_page": "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n[[File:Hume titlepage1779.jpg|thumb|Title page]]\n[[File:Painting of David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume]]\n'''''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]]. Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of [[God]]'s existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.\n\nIn the ''Dialogues'', Hume's characters debate a number of [[argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the [[argument from design]]\u2014for which Hume uses a house\u2014and whether there is more suffering or good in the world ([[argument from evil]]).\n\nHume started writing the ''Dialogues'' in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''. The ''Dialogues'' were [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David|year=1779 |title=  Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Penguin Books, Limited |place=London |edition= Second |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_E7dbAAAAQAAJ/page/n63 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_E7dbAAAAQAAJ |accessdate= 20 June 2016}} via Google Books</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' (1986), evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] discussed his choice to title his book after theologian [[William Paley]]'s famous statement of the teleological argument, the [[watchmaker analogy]], and noted that Hume's critique of the argument from design as an explanation of design in nature was the initial criticism that would ultimately be answered by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Dawkins|title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design|title-link=The Blind Watchmaker|year=1996|orig-year=1986|publisher=[[W.

In a [[Letter (message)|letter]], he reconstructs the conversation of Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes in detail for his friend Hermippus. He serves as the [[narrator]] throughout the piece. At the end of the Dialogues he believes that Cleanthes offered the strongest arguments. However, this could be out of loyalty to his teacher, as this does not seem to reflect Hume's own views on the topic. When other pieces on religion by Hume are taken into consideration, it may be noted that they all end with (apparently) ironic statements reaffirming the truth of Christian religious views. While the irony may be less readily evident in the Dialogues, this would suggest a similar reading of this work's ending.<ref>See Bernd Gr\u00e4frath's \"Vernunftige Gelassenheit\" in G. Gabriel, C. Schildknecht, Literarische Formen der Philosophie. Metzler, 1990.</ref> Cicero used a similar technique in his Dialogues. \n*'''Cleanthes''' is an \"experimental theist\"&mdash;\"an exponent of orthodox empiricism\"<ref name=\"anth\">Anthony C.

Through dialogue, three philosophers named Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes debate the nature of [[God]]'s existence. Whether or not these names reference specific philosophers, ancient or otherwise, remains a topic of scholarly dispute. While all three agree that a god exists, they differ sharply in opinion on God's nature or attributes and how, or if, humankind can come to knowledge of a deity.\n\nIn the ''Dialogues'', Hume's characters debate a number of [[argument]]s for the [[existence of God]], and arguments whose proponents believe through which we may come to know the nature of God. Such topics debated include the [[argument from design]]\u2014for which Hume uses a house\u2014and whether there is more suffering or good in the world ([[argument from evil]]).\n\nHume started writing the ''Dialogues'' in 1750 but did not complete them until 1776, shortly before his death. They are based partly on [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Natura Deorum]]''. The ''Dialogues'' were [[List of works published posthumously|published posthumously]] in 1779, originally with neither the author's nor the publisher's name.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hume |first=David|year=1779 |title=  Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Penguin Books, Limited |place=London |edition= Second |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_E7dbAAAAQAAJ/page/n63 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_E7dbAAAAQAAJ |accessdate= 20 June 2016}} via Google Books</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' (1986), evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] discussed his choice to title his book after theologian [[William Paley]]'s famous statement of the teleological argument, the [[watchmaker analogy]], and noted that Hume's critique of the argument from design as an explanation of design in nature was the initial criticism that would eventually be fulfilled by [[Charles Darwin]] in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|author-link=Richard Dawkins|title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design|title-link=The Blind Watchmaker|year=1996|orig-year=1986|publisher=[[W.

In a [[Letter (message)|letter]], he reconstructs the conversation of Demea, Philo, and Cleanthes in detail for his friend Hermippus. He serves as the [[narrator]] throughout the piece. At the end of the Dialogues he believes that Cleanthes offered the strongest arguments. However, this could be out of loyalty to his teacher, as this does not seem to reflect Hume's own views on the topic. When other pieces on religion by Hume are taken into consideration, it may be noted that they all end with (apparently) ironic statements reaffirming the truth of Christian religious views. While the irony may be less readily evident in the Dialogues, this would suggest a similar reading of this work's ending.<ref>See Bernd Gr\u00e4frath's \"Vernunftige Gelassenheit\" in G. Gabriel, C.

Gailey described that the director took her to the house of actor [[Jack Nicholson]] in Los Angeles, under the argument of wanting her as a model for a photo shoot for ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine. There, Polanski supplied [[Methaqualone|quaaludes]] and later photographed her topless. Both were alone in Nicholson's house, so Polanski took advantage to take her to the master bedroom and then rape her.<ref name=\"roman\" /> Polanski was accused of sexual abuse of a minor, drug use, perversion and sodomy. The prosecution ordered 90 days of state prison that included a psychiatric evaluation, while deliberating the final sentence. However, Polanski requested another 90-day probation period to finish a then-current project, which was granted. After filming finished, the director returned to the United States for his evaluation period and was released after 42 days.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Harriet|date=1 October 2009|title=Defense strategies could keep Polanski out of prison|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-polanski-legal1-2009oct01,0,1100452.story}}</ref> However, Polanski fled to Europe before his sentencing, after reportedly learning that the judge in the case would renege on a probation agreement and instead impose a jail sentence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roman Polanski fails to secure no-jail guarantee in rape case |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/apr/03/roman-polanski-child-rape-case-jail-time |work=The Guardian |date=April 4, 2017}}</ref> Polanski settled in his native France where his French nationality prevented him from being extradited to the United States.<ref>{{cite news|last=Dyer|first=Clare|date=29 September 2009|title=How did the law catch up with Roman Polanski?|work=The Guardian |location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/29/law-catch-roman-polanski|}}</ref>\n\nThe Polanski case sparked the interest of the American media who condemned the actions of the French authorities.

At that time Soon-Yi was 17 years old. After that, the relationship was finished and Farrow was left with the custody of all her children. The court granted Allen an agreement that he could see them with Farrow's permission.<ref name=\"ronan\" /> On August 4, 1992, Farrow left all her children with Allen while she went shopping. According to a later statement, Allen took advantage of the moment to go down to the basement with one of his adopted daughters, Dylan Farrow, then 7 years old, and later sexually abuse her. A legal dispute began for the total custody of the minors and Allen was taken to court, although the accusation did not proceed. A year later, a doctor at the [[Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital]]'s Children's Sexual Abuse Clinic stated that Dylan Farrow's rape story was possibly an invention of the girl caused by the stress of living in a volatile home.<ref name=\"daughter\" /> Dylan Farrow, by then 28, repeated the assault allegation in February 2014 in an open letter in ''The New York Times'' blog of [[Nicholas Kristof]], a family friend, stating: \"When I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and took me to a dark attic on the second floor of our house.\nHe told me to lie on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train.

Originally referenced in films as '''Creighton Chaney''', he was later credited as \"Lon Chaney, Jr.\" in 1935, and after ''[[Man Made Monster]]'' (1941), beginning as early as ''The Wolf Man'' later that same year, he was almost always billed under his more famous father's name as '''Lon Chaney''' at the studio's insistence. Chaney had [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, and his career in movies and television spanned four decades, from 1931 to 1971.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Lon Chaney, Sr. The Miracle Man.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Lon Chaney]], Creighton's father]]\n\nCreighton was born in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma Territory]], the son of then stage performer [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and Frances Cleveland Creighton Chaney, a singing stage performer who traveled in road shows across the country with Creighton. His parents' troubled marriage ended in divorce in 1913 following his mother's scandalous public [[suicide]] attempt in [[Los Angeles]]. Young Creighton lived in various homes and [[boarding school]]s until 1916, when his father (now employed in the film industry) married Hazel Hastings and could provide a stable home.\n\nFrom an early age, he worked hard to avoid his famous father's shadow. In young adulthood, his father discouraged him from show business, and he attended business college and became successful in a Los Angeles appliance corporation. Creighton, who had begun working for a plumbing company, married Dorothy Hinckley, the daughter of his employer Ralph Hinckley. They had two sons: Lon Ralph Chaney and Ronald Creighton Chaney.\n\nCreighton's life changed forever when his father was diagnosed with throat cancer and died on August 26, 1930, at the age of 47. Many articles and biographies over the years report that Creighton was led to believe his mother had died while he was a boy, and was only made aware she lived after his father's death. Creighton always maintained he had a tough childhood.\n\n==Career==\n===As Creighton Chaney===\nIt was only after his father's death that Chaney began to act in films, billed by his own name. He began with an uncredited [[bit part]] in the serial ''[[The Galloping Ghost (serial)|The Galloping Ghost]]'' (1931) and signed a contract with [[RKO]] who gave him small roles in a number of films, including ''[[Girl Crazy (1932 film)|Girl Crazy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Roadhouse Murder]]'' (1932), ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932), and ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932).\n\nRKO gave him the starring role in a serial, ''[[The Last Frontier (serial)|The Last Frontier]]'' (1932). He got bigger film roles in ''[[Lucky Devils (1933 film)|Lucky Devils]]'' (1933), ''[[Son of the Border]]'' (1933), ''[[Scarlet River]]'' (1933), ''[[The Life of Vergie Winters]]'' (1934). Over at [[Mascot Pictures]] he supported [[John Wayne]] in a serial, ''[[The Three Musketeers (1933 serial)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1933), which was later re-edited into a film entitled ''Desert Command'' (1946).\n\n\"I did every possible bit in pictures\" said Chaney later. \"Had to do stuntwork to live.

The film was Chaney Jr's first major role in a film and was a critical success for him. Chaney had a screen test for the role of [[Quasimodo]] for the remake of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), but the role went to [[Charles Laughton]].\n\nHal Roach used him in his third-billed character role in ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940) as [[Victor Mature]]'s caveman father, Chaney began to be viewed as a character actor in the mold of his father. He had in fact designed a swarthy, ape-like Neanderthal make-up on himself for the film, but production decisions and union rules prevented his following through on emulating his father in that fashion. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] used him in a supporting role in ''[[North West Mounted Police (film)|North West Mounted Police]]'' (1940) and MGM used him in ''[[Billy the Kid (1941 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1941).

Chaney's first horror film, it was successful enough for them to offer him a long-term contract.\n\nUniversal kept him in supporting roles for a while: a comedy ''[[Too Many Blondes]]'' (1941), a musical ''[[San Antonio Rose (film)|San Antonio Rose]]'' (1941), a serial ''[[Riders of Death Valley]]'' (1941), the Western ''[[Badlands of Dakota]]'' (1941) and the \"Northern\" ''[[North to the Klondike]]'' (1942).\n\n===Horror Film Star: The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Inner Sanctum===\n[[File:TheWolfManLobbyCardCropped.png|thumb|[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]], Chaney's signature role.]]\n[[File:MummysGhost1944Crop002.png|thumb|Chaney appeared as [[The Mummy (franchise)|Kharis the Mummy]] three times between 1942 and 1944.]]\nChaney was then given the title role in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) for Universal, a role which, much like Karloff's [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] monster, would largely [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] Chaney as a horror film actor for the rest of his life.\n\nChaney Jr was now an official horror star, and Universal gave him the role of Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) when Karloff decided not to play the part again. He was in a crime film, ''[[Eyes of the Underworld]]'' (1942) and the wartime shorts  ''[[Keeping Fit]]'' (1942) and ''[[What We Are Fighting For]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney Jr played Kharis the Mummy in ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), another hit. He was in a Western ''[[Frontier Badmen]]'' (1943), then reprised his role as the Wolf Man in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney was given the role of Dracula in ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943). This made him the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major horror characters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, and [[Count Dracula]].\n\nAfter a cameo in ''[[Crazy House (1943 film)|Crazy House]]'' (1943) he was given the lead in ''[[Calling Dr. Death]]'' (1943), based on the [[Inner Sanctum Mystery|Inner Sanctum mysteries]]. It kicked off another series starring Chaney, the first of which was ''[[Weird Woman]]'' (1944).\n\nHe made a second mummy movie, ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' (1944) and had a support part in ''[[Cobra Woman]]'' (1944), starring [[Maria Montez]] and ''[[Ghost Catcher]]'' (1944), with [[Olsen and Johnson]].\n\n''[[Dead Man's Eyes]]'' (1944) was the third Inner Sanctum, after which he was back as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944).

He returned as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), one of the last of the Universal horror cycle. ''[[Pillow of Death]]'' (1945) was the last Inner Sanctum. ''[[The Daltons Ride Again]]'' (1945) was a Western.\n\n===Leaving Universal===\nDespite being typecast as the Wolf Man, the 6-foot 2-inch, 220 pound actor managed to carve out a secondary niche as a supporting actor and villain.\n\nHe was in a Bob Hope comedy ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947), supported [[Randolph Scott]] in ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) and had a support in ''[[The Counterfeiters (1948 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' (1948) and played a villain in ''[[16 Fathoms Deep]]'' (1948) for [[Monogram Pictures]], a remake of his 1934 film.\n\nHe reprised his Wolf Man role to great effect in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) but it did not cause a notable boost to his career.

The series ended after 39 episodes. Universal released their film biography of his father, ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957), featuring a semi-fictionalized version of Creighton's life story from his birth up until his father's death. [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] was cast as Creighton as a young adult.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the western series ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'' titled \"The Black Marshal from [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]]\" (1958), and appeared in numerous western series such as ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''.

In 1962, Chaney gained a chance to briefly play Quasimodo in a simulacrum of his father's make-up, as well as return to his roles of the Mummy and the Wolf Man on the television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' with friends [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Peter Lorre]]. During this era, he starred in [[Jack Hill]]'s ''[[Spider Baby]]'' (filmed 1964, released 1968), for which he also sang the title song.\n\n===Final films===\nIn later years, he suffered from [[throat cancer]] and chronic [[heart disease]] among other ailments after decades of heavy drinking and smoking. In his final horror film, ''[[Dracula vs. Frankenstein]]'' (1971), directed by [[Al Adamson]], he played Groton, [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]'s mute henchman. He filmed his part in the spring of 1969, and shortly thereafter performed his final film role, also for Adamson in 1969 in ''[[The Female Bunch]]''.<ref>Weldon, Michael (1983). \"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film\". Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|0-345-34345-X}}. Page 235</ref>  Chaney had lines in ''[[The Female Bunch]]'' but his hoarse, raspy voice was virtually unrecognizable. Due to illness he retired from acting to concentrate on a book about the Chaney family legacy, ''A Century of Chaneys'', which remains to date unpublished in any form. His grandson, [[Ron Chaney]], was working on completing this project.<ref>[http://www.midnightpalace.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=141 Interview with Ron Chaney, including references to Lon's book]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nChaney was married twice. His first wife Dorothy divorced him in 1936 for drinking too much and being \"sullen\".<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Is Sued for Divorce; Wed 10 Years\nChicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963); Chicago, Ill. [Chicago, Ill]26 June 1936: 23.</ref> He remarried in 1937. He had two sons by his first wife, Lon Ralph Chaney (born July 3, 1928) and Ronald Creighton Chaney (born March 18, 1930), both now deceased.\n\nChaney was well liked by some co-workers \u2013 \"sweet\" is the adjective that most commonly emerges from those who acted with, and liked him \u2013 yet he was capable of intense dislikes. For instance, he and frequent co-star [[Evelyn Ankers]] did not get along at all despite their on-camera chemistry. He was also known to befriend younger actors and stand up for older ones who Chaney felt were belittled by the studios. One example was that of [[William Farnum]], a major silent star who played a bit part in ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]''. According to co-star Peter Coe, Chaney demanded that Farnum be given his own chair on the set and be treated with respect, or else he would walk off the picture.\n\nChaney had run-ins with actor [[Frank Reicher]] (whom he nearly strangled on camera in ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'') and director [[Robert Siodmak]] (over whose head Chaney broke a vase).<ref>Smith, Don G., ''Lon Chaney Jr.: Horror Film Star'', McFarland & Co., 1996</ref>\nActor [[Robert Stack]] claimed in his 1980 autobiography that Chaney and drinking buddy [[Broderick Crawford]] were known as \"the monsters\" around the [[Universal Pictures]] lot because of their drunken behavior that frequently resulted in bloodshed.<ref>Stack, Robert, ''Straight Shooting'', Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1980, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Honors===\nIn 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |date=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nChaney died of [[heart failure]] at age 67 on July 12, 1973, in [[San Clemente, California]].<ref>[http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm Cumuseumofterror.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604021624/http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm |date=2008-06-04 }} (Includes Chaney's Death Certificate)</ref> His body was donated for [[medical research]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Lon Chaney Jr., Actor, Is Dead at 67; Portrayed Monsters |quote= Lon Chaney Jr., the film actor, died yesterday at the age of 67.

Chaney had [[English people|English]], [[French people|French]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry, and his career in movies and television spanned four decades, from 1931 to 1971.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Lon Chaney, Sr. The Miracle Man.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Lon Chaney]], Creighton's father]]\n\nCreighton was born in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma Territory]], the son of then stage performer [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and Frances Cleveland Creighton Chaney, a singing stage performer who traveled in road shows across the country with Creighton. His parents' troubled marriage ended in divorce in 1913 following his mother's scandalous public [[suicide]] attempt in [[Los Angeles]]. Young Creighton lived in various homes and [[boarding school]]s until 1916, when his father (now employed in the film industry) married Hazel Hastings and could provide a stable home.\n\nFrom an early age, he worked hard to avoid his famous father's shadow. In young adulthood, his father discouraged him from show business, and he attended business college and became successful in a Los Angeles appliance corporation. Creighton, who had begun working for a plumbing company, married Dorothy Hinckley, the daughter of his employer Ralph Hinckley. They had two sons: Lon Ralph Chaney and Ronald Creighton Chaney.\n\nCreighton's life changed forever when his father was diagnosed with throat cancer and died on August 26, 1930, at the age of 47. Many articles and biographies over the years report that Creighton was led to believe his mother had died while he was a boy, and was only made aware she lived after his father's death. Creighton always maintained he had a tough childhood.\n\n==Career==\n===As Creighton Chaney===\nIt was only after his father's death that Chaney began to act in films, billed by his own name. He began with an uncredited [[bit part]] in the serial ''[[The Galloping Ghost (serial)|The Galloping Ghost]]'' (1931) and signed a contract with [[RKO]] who gave him small roles in a number of films, including ''[[Girl Crazy (1932 film)|Girl Crazy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Roadhouse Murder]]'' (1932), ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932), and ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932).\n\nRKO gave him the starring role in a serial, ''[[The Last Frontier (serial)|The Last Frontier]]'' (1932). He got bigger film roles in ''[[Lucky Devils (1933 film)|Lucky Devils]]'' (1933), ''[[Son of the Border]]'' (1933), ''[[Scarlet River]]'' (1933), ''[[The Life of Vergie Winters]]'' (1934). Over at [[Mascot Pictures]] he supported [[John Wayne]] in a serial, ''[[The Three Musketeers (1933 serial)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1933), which was later re-edited into a film entitled ''Desert Command'' (1946).\n\n\"I did every possible bit in pictures\" said Chaney later. \"Had to do stuntwork to live. I bulldogged steers, fell off and got knocked off cliffs, rode horses and precipes into rivers, drove prairie schooners up and down hills.\"<ref>FILLER OF FATHER'S FOOTWEAR: FILLER OF FATHER'S FOOTWEAR\nSmith, Frederick James.

The last film he made as Creighton Chaney was ''[[The Marriage Bargain]]'' (1935) for Screencraft Productions. After this point he was billed as Lon Chaney, Jr. until 1942, when he was often billed, at the insistence of [[Universal Studios]], with his iconic father's name, although the \"Jr.\" was usually added by others to distinguish the two.\n\n===As Lon Chaney Jr===\nHe had the lead in ''[[A Scream in the Night]]'' (1935) made for Commodore Pictures, a crime thriller.<ref>Mary Pickford Considers Leading Drive to Produce Pictures in England: British Films Would Use American Actors Cycle of Kipling Stories Looms Both Here and Abroad; Lon Chaney, Jr., Follows in Noted Parent's Footsteps\nSchallert, Edwin.

He was a henchman in a serial for Republic, ''[[Undersea Kingdom]]'' (1936). Universal got him to play a henchman in their serial, ''[[Ace Drummond (serial)|Ace Drummond]]'' (1937) and he was uncredited in Columbia's ''[[Killer at Large (1937 film)|Killer at Large]]'' (1937).

[Los Angeles, Calif]15 Jan 1940: 9.</ref> He was cast in that role in the film ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), which was produced by [[Hal Roach Studios]]. The film was Chaney Jr's first major role in a film and was a critical success for him. Chaney had a screen test for the role of [[Quasimodo]] for the remake of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1939), but the role went to [[Charles Laughton]].\n\nHal Roach used him in his third-billed character role in ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940) as [[Victor Mature]]'s caveman father, Chaney began to be viewed as a character actor in the mold of his father. He had in fact designed a swarthy, ape-like Neanderthal make-up on himself for the film, but production decisions and union rules prevented his following through on emulating his father in that fashion. [[Cecil B. DeMille]] used him in a supporting role in ''[[North West Mounted Police (film)|North West Mounted Police]]'' (1940) and MGM used him in ''[[Billy the Kid (1941 film)|Billy the Kid]]'' (1941). That studio considered putting Chaney Jr in a remake of his father's hit ''[[He Who Gets Slapped]]'' but decided not to make it.<ref>Young Chaney May Do 'He Who Gets Slapped': Preston 'Night' Star Fellows Subject Named Warners Sign Darwell Ink Spots, Faye Cast Bellamy Set for Comedy\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif. [Los Angeles, Calif] 04 Jan 1941: A9.</ref>\n\n===Universal Pictures===\nUniversal Pictures offered Chaney Jr the lead in ''[[Man Made Monster|Man-Made Monster]]'' (1941), a science-fiction horror thriller originally written with Karloff in mind.  Chaney's first horror film, it was successful enough for them to offer him a long-term contract.\n\nUniversal kept him in supporting roles for a while: a comedy ''[[Too Many Blondes]]'' (1941), a musical ''[[San Antonio Rose (film)|San Antonio Rose]]'' (1941), a serial ''[[Riders of Death Valley]]'' (1941), the Western ''[[Badlands of Dakota]]'' (1941) and the \"Northern\" ''[[North to the Klondike]]'' (1942).\n\n===Horror Film Star: The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Inner Sanctum===\n[[File:TheWolfManLobbyCardCropped.png|thumb|[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]], Chaney's signature role.]]\n[[File:MummysGhost1944Crop002.png|thumb|Chaney appeared as [[The Mummy (franchise)|Kharis the Mummy]] three times between 1942 and 1944.]]\nChaney was then given the title role in ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941) for Universal, a role which, much like Karloff's [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] monster, would largely [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] Chaney as a horror film actor for the rest of his life.\n\nChaney Jr was now an official horror star, and Universal gave him the role of Frankenstein's Monster in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'' (1942) when Karloff decided not to play the part again. He was in a crime film, ''[[Eyes of the Underworld]]'' (1942) and the wartime shorts  ''[[Keeping Fit]]'' (1942) and ''[[What We Are Fighting For]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney Jr played Kharis the Mummy in ''[[The Mummy's Tomb]]'' (1942), another hit. He was in a Western ''[[Frontier Badmen]]'' (1943), then reprised his role as the Wolf Man in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'' (1943).\n\nChaney was given the role of Dracula in ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' (1943). This made him the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major horror characters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, and [[Count Dracula]].\n\nAfter a cameo in ''[[Crazy House (1943 film)|Crazy House]]'' (1943) he was given the lead in ''[[Calling Dr. Death]]'' (1943), based on the [[Inner Sanctum Mystery|Inner Sanctum mysteries]]. It kicked off another series starring Chaney, the first of which was ''[[Weird Woman]]'' (1944).\n\nHe made a second mummy movie, ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'' (1944) and had a support part in ''[[Cobra Woman]]'' (1944), starring [[Maria Montez]] and ''[[Ghost Catcher]]'' (1944), with [[Olsen and Johnson]].\n\n''[[Dead Man's Eyes]]'' (1944) was the third Inner Sanctum, after which he was back as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'' (1944). ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]'' (1944) was Chaney's third and final appearance as Kharis.\n\nHe had a small role in an [[Abbott and Costello]] comedy ''[[Here Come the Co-Eds]]'' (1945), then made more Inner Sanctums: ''[[The Frozen Ghost]]'' (1945) and ''[[Strange Confession]]'' (1945). He returned as the Wolf Man in ''[[House of Dracula]]'' (1945), one of the last of the Universal horror cycle. ''[[Pillow of Death]]'' (1945) was the last Inner Sanctum. ''[[The Daltons Ride Again]]'' (1945) was a Western.\n\n===Leaving Universal===\nDespite being typecast as the Wolf Man, the 6-foot 2-inch, 220 pound actor managed to carve out a secondary niche as a supporting actor and villain.\n\nHe was in a Bob Hope comedy ''[[My Favorite Brunette]]'' (1947), supported [[Randolph Scott]] in ''[[Albuquerque (film)|Albuquerque]]'' (1948) and had a support in ''[[The Counterfeiters (1948 film)|The Counterfeiters]]'' (1948) and played a villain in ''[[16 Fathoms Deep]]'' (1948) for [[Monogram Pictures]], a remake of his 1934 film.\n\nHe reprised his Wolf Man role to great effect in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]'' (1948) but it did not cause a notable boost to his career. In April 1948 Chaney went to hospital after taking an overdose of sleeping pills.<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Takes Too Many Sleeping Pills, Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File); Los Angeles, Calif.

Kramer told the press at the time that whenever a script came in with a role too difficult for most actors in Hollywood, he called Chaney.\n\nOne of his best known roles was a 1952 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717031/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_87 live television version]{{unreliable source|date=April 2019}} of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' on the anthology series ''[[Tales of Tomorrow]]'' for which he allegedly showed up drunk, though that contention is unsubstantiated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmthreat.com/features/28492/ |title=Film Threat \u2013 The Bootleg Files: Tales Of Tomorrow \u2013 Frankenstein |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> During the live broadcast, Chaney, playing the Monster, apparently thought it was just a rehearsal and he would pick up furniture that he was supposed to break, only to gingerly put it back down while muttering, \"I saved it for you.\" A kinescope of the January 18, 1952 broadcast is available on DVD, [[YouTube]], and also open to the public for viewing at [[The Paley Center for Media]] in [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nHe became quite popular with [[baby boomer]]s after Universal released its back catalog of horror films to television in 1957 (''[[Shock Theater]]'') and ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]'' magazine regularly focused on his films.\n\nIn 1957, Chaney went to [[Ontario, Canada]], to costar in the first ever American-Canadian television production, as Chingachgook in ''[[Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans]]'', suggested by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s stories. The series ended after 39 episodes. Universal released their film biography of his father, ''[[Man of a Thousand Faces (film)|Man of a Thousand Faces]]'' (1957), featuring a semi-fictionalized version of Creighton's life story from his birth up until his father's death. [[Roger Smith (actor)|Roger Smith]] was cast as Creighton as a young adult.\n\nHe appeared in an episode of the western series ''[[Tombstone Territory]]'' titled \"The Black Marshal from [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]]\" (1958), and appeared in numerous western series such as ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]''. He also hosted the 13-episode television [[anthology]] series ''[[13 Demon Street]]'' in 1959, which was created by [[Curt Siodmak]].\n[[File:Dracula vs. Frankenstein Chaney.jpg|thumb|left|Chaney Jr. in ''Dracula vs. Frankenstein'' (1971)]]\n\n===1960s===\nIn the 1960s, Chaney specialised in horror films, such as ''[[House of Terror (1960 film)|House of Terror]]'' (1960), ''[[The Devil's Messenger]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Haunted Palace]]'' (1963), replacing [[Boris Karloff]] in the latter for [[Roger Corman]].\n\nHe was in a Western ''[[Law of the Lawless (1963 film)|Law of the Lawless]]'' (1963), ''[[Face of the Screaming Werewolf]]'' (1964), ''[[Witchcraft (1964 film)|Witchcraft]]'' (1964), and ''[[Stage to Thunder Rock]]'' (1964).\n\nHe had one of his best later roles in ''[[Spider Baby]]'', made in 1964 but not released until 1968. Then it was back to Westerns - ''[[Young Fury]]'' (1965), ''[[Black Spurs]]'' (1965), ''[[Town Tamer]]'' (1966), ''[[Johnny Reno]]'' (1967), ''[[Apache Uprising]]'' (1967), ''[[Welcome to Hard Times (film)|Welcome to Hard Times]]'' (1967) and ''[[Buckskin (film)|Buckskin]]'' (1968). There was also horror, such as ''[[Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors]]'' (1967) and ''[[Hillbillys in a Haunted House]]'' (1967).\n\nHis bread-and-butter work during this decade was television \u2013 where he made guest appearances on everything from ''[[Wagon Train]]'' to ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' \u2013 and in a string of supporting roles in low-budget Westerns produced by [[A. C. Lyles]] for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. In 1962, Chaney gained a chance to briefly play Quasimodo in a simulacrum of his father's make-up, as well as return to his roles of the Mummy and the Wolf Man on the television series ''[[Route 66 (TV series)|Route 66]]'' with friends [[Boris Karloff]] and [[Peter Lorre]]. During this era, he starred in [[Jack Hill]]'s ''[[Spider Baby]]'' (filmed 1964, released 1968), for which he also sang the title song.\n\n===Final films===\nIn later years, he suffered from [[throat cancer]] and chronic [[heart disease]] among other ailments after decades of heavy drinking and smoking. In his final horror film, ''[[Dracula vs. Frankenstein]]'' (1971), directed by [[Al Adamson]], he played Groton, [[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Frankenstein]]'s mute henchman. He filmed his part in the spring of 1969, and shortly thereafter performed his final film role, also for Adamson in 1969 in ''[[The Female Bunch]]''.<ref>Weldon, Michael (1983). \"The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film\". Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|0-345-34345-X}}. Page 235</ref>  Chaney had lines in ''[[The Female Bunch]]'' but his hoarse, raspy voice was virtually unrecognizable. Due to illness he retired from acting to concentrate on a book about the Chaney family legacy, ''A Century of Chaneys'', which remains to date unpublished in any form. His grandson, [[Ron Chaney]], was working on completing this project.<ref>[http://www.midnightpalace.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=141 Interview with Ron Chaney, including references to Lon's book]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nChaney was married twice. His first wife Dorothy divorced him in 1936 for drinking too much and being \"sullen\".<ref>Lon Chaney Jr. Is Sued for Divorce; Wed 10 Years\nChicago Daily Tribune (1923-1963); Chicago, Ill.

He had two sons by his first wife, Lon Ralph Chaney (born July 3, 1928) and Ronald Creighton Chaney (born March 18, 1930), both now deceased.\n\nChaney was well liked by some co-workers \u2013 \"sweet\" is the adjective that most commonly emerges from those who acted with, and liked him \u2013 yet he was capable of intense dislikes. For instance, he and frequent co-star [[Evelyn Ankers]] did not get along at all despite their on-camera chemistry. He was also known to befriend younger actors and stand up for older ones who Chaney felt were belittled by the studios. One example was that of [[William Farnum]], a major silent star who played a bit part in ''[[The Mummy's Curse]]''. According to co-star Peter Coe, Chaney demanded that Farnum be given his own chair on the set and be treated with respect, or else he would walk off the picture.\n\nChaney had run-ins with actor [[Frank Reicher]] (whom he nearly strangled on camera in ''[[The Mummy's Ghost]]'') and director [[Robert Siodmak]] (over whose head Chaney broke a vase).<ref>Smith, Don G., ''Lon Chaney Jr.: Horror Film Star'', McFarland & Co., 1996</ref>\nActor [[Robert Stack]] claimed in his 1980 autobiography that Chaney and drinking buddy [[Broderick Crawford]] were known as \"the monsters\" around the [[Universal Pictures]] lot because of their drunken behavior that frequently resulted in bloodshed.<ref>Stack, Robert, ''Straight Shooting'', Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1980, p. 64</ref>\n\n===Honors===\nIn 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf |date=2012-10-13 }}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nChaney died of [[heart failure]] at age 67 on July 12, 1973, in [[San Clemente, California]].<ref>[http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm Cumuseumofterror.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604021624/http://www.cumuseumofterror.com/DeathCerts.htm |date=2008-06-04 }} (Includes Chaney's Death Certificate)</ref> His body was donated for [[medical research]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Lon Chaney Jr., Actor, Is Dead at 67; Portrayed Monsters |quote= Lon Chaney Jr., the film actor, died yesterday at the age of 67.

Prior to running for office, [[Louisiana]] [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Jimmie Davis|Jimmy Davis]] advised Thompson that the key to a successful political career was to \"sing softly and carry a big [[guitar]].\"<ref name=mteleg/><ref>Davis, quoted in Eric Welch, \"Gospel-singing Jeweler Is 'Country' Candidate\", ''Macon Telegraph'', 1967 August 26, p. A1.</ref>\n\nIn 1961, Thompson ran for office for the first for a vacant seat on the [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb County]] Commission, but lost the election.<ref name=mc/> However, two years later, Macon Mayor [[Benjamin Merritt]] encouraged Thompson to run for an alderman seat on the Macon City Council. <ref name=mc/> This time, Ronnie Thompson defeated incumbent alderman Bert Hamilton in the [[nonpartisan]] city election to win the seat on the council.<ref name=mc/> He served on city council until he was elected Mayor of Macon in 1967.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\n===Mayor of Macon===\nIn 1967, Ronnie Thompson, who was 33-years old, announced his campaign against his former political mentor, incumbent Mayor Benjamin Merritt, who was seeking re-election. Unusually, Thompson ran for mayor as a Republican, in a city and region dominated by Democrats at the time. Thompson narrowly won the election with 14,732 votes, while Mayor Merritt garnered 13,002 votes.<ref name=mc/> Thompson made history by becoming the Macon's first Republican mayor in its history.<ref name=mteleg/> \n\nRonnie Thompson's 1967 mayoral campaign was supported by several of his colleagues in the music industry. [[Otis Redding]] and [[Phil Walden]], the founder of Macon-based [[Capricorn Records]], gave Thompson space in the Redwal Music Building on Cotton Avenue for use as a campaign headquarters.<ref name=mteleg2/> Redding, who had worked with Thompson, died in a plane crash on December 10, 1967, a little more than one month after Thompson had been inaugurated as Macon's mayor.<ref name=mteleg2/> Mayor Thompson quickly renamed and rededicated one of Macon's bridges as the \"Otis Redding Bridge\" in the singer's memory.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nHe won re-election to a second term in 1971 when he defeated Democrat [[F. Emory Greene]], a Bibb County commissioner and former member of the [[Georgia House of Representatives]].\n\nWhen Thompson was sworn in as mayor shortly after the 1967 election, he presided over a city still in the midst of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], as well as the [[racial tension]]s that gripped the South at the time.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson attempted to navigate the issue of race by focusing largely on [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] issues during his early years, as well as chairing the Macon City Council Library Committee, which opened the library to African-Americans for the first time.<ref name=mc/> However, in 1970, Thompson issued a controversial \"shoot to kill\" for city police against an upcoming demonstration by the Black Liberation Front, which planned to picket downtown stores, citing the need to combat \"lawlessness and anarchy.\"<ref name=mteleg/> At another point in his tenure, Thompson floated the idea of arming 1,000 \"volunteer lawmen\" in the event of civil violence, but the idea was never fulfilled and no one was ever recruited.<ref name=mteleg/> Critics, including other elected officials in Macon's city government, attacked the idea, noting that it could inflame the present racial tensions.<ref name=mteleg/> \n\nThe issue of race in Macon erupted again in 1971, when a white police officer shot and killed a black city employee.<ref name=mc/> Just one month after the shooting, the police officer was cleared of [[involuntary manslaughter]].<ref name=mc/> In response to the manslaughter clearance, race riots erupted in Macon on June 20, 1971, which included several suspected [[fire bombing]]s.<ref name=mc/> Mayor Thompson issued a 36-hour, dusk-to-dawn [[curfew]] and went on patrol with the city's police.<ref name=mteleg/> During the unrest, a police officer called dispatch to report that he had been shot by a [[sniper]] near the intersection of Broadway and Greter Streets. Thompson went to the scene of the shooting with Macon's city police chief. There, Mayor Thompson fired a [[Carbine|carbine long gun]] at the house where the sniper was believed to be hiding, though no one was ever apprehended for the shooting.<ref name=mteleg/> News accounts erroneously reported that Thompson had fired a [[submachine gun]] at the sniper's location, while Thompson told the media that \"I could hear bullets whizzing by me,\" which he later admitted was an exaggeration of the actual events.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson would also later tell a reporter that \"machine gun\u201d sounded \"more colorful\" than the carbine long gun he had actually used at the scene.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson also placed [[billboards]] around Macon, warning that criminals and rioters would be shot during the unrest.<ref name=mc/> \n\nCritics blasted Thompson for inserting himself into the crime scene unnecessarily and derisively called him '''\"Machine Gun Ronnie\"''', despite the fact that he never used a machine gun.<ref name=mteleg/><ref name=mc/> In 2010 interview, Thompson defended his actions and the \"shoot to kill\" orders he issued as a deterrence against potential violence, citing the damaged caused by the [[1970 Augusta riot]] a year earlier, in which six black men were shot and killed by police.<ref name=mteleg2/> He told ''The Macon Telegraph'', \"The people who put me in the same category as [[George Wallace]] don't know me...I got my reputation because I didn\u2019t want people to burn the city down.\"<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nStill, the \"Machine Gun Ronnie\" nickname, which Thompson never actively opposed, stuck and remained with him for the rest of his political career.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson even used the name to his advantage on the campaign trail by selling election model machine guns with his name \"Thompson\" printed on them.<ref name=mc/> Months later, Thompson was re-elected to a second term as mayor.\n\nIn another memorable episode, Thompson authorized the city to acquire a [[U.S. Army]] surplus [[armored personnel carrier]] for two hundred dollars in May 1973. Opponents of the purchase called it \"Thompson's Tank\", while Mayor later nicknamed the vehicle \"Winky Tink.\"<ref name=mteleg/> The tank was never used in law enforcement, but Thompson mused about adding a canon and a [[.50-caliber]] machine gun to the vehicle to guard against future riots.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\nThe events of the 1971 riots and the tank acquisition overshadowed some of Ronnie Thompson's accomplishments. He introduced official non-discriminatory hiring practices for the first time.<ref name=mc/> Thompson oversaw a series of major infrastructure upgrades during his two terms in office, including the paving and renovation of seventy-seven of city streets.<ref name=mc/> He was a leading supporter of the 14,000 [[Macon Coliseum]] multi-purpose area, which opened in 1968 at a cost of $4.5 million soon after he became mayor.<ref name=mc/> Ronnie Thompson also led the modernization of city hospitals, ungraded Macon's regional airports, library expansions, and campaigned for new industrial development.<ref name=mc/> Thompson, who campaigned on the importance of law and order, expanded the Macon Police Department from 168 officers to 242 officers, and the Macon Fire Department from 181 to 287 [[firefighters]].<ref name=mc/> His successor, former Mayor [[Buck Melton]], credited Thompson with saving and restoring many of Macon's larger old buildings.<ref name=mc/> Thompson, who had met former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at a golf course in Augusta, led the effort to name the Eisenhower Parkway, which runs through the city's south side, after the former president.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\nThroughout his time as mayor, Thompson hosted his own radio talk show and wrote a column for the ''[[Macon Herald]]'', a weekly newspaper.<ref name=mc/> \n\nRonnie Thompson unsuccessful ran for higher office while serving as mayor. In 1972, Thompson ran unopposed for the Republican nomination for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], but was defeated in the [[1972 United States House of Representatives elections|general election]] by incumbent Democratic [[U.S. Rep.]] [[W. S. Stuckey Jr.]] Two years later, Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] was term-limited and could not run for re-election in 1974. Ronnie Thompson won the Republican gubernatorial nomination, but lost to Democratic nominee [[George Busbee]] in the [[1974 Georgia gubernatorial election|1974 general election]]. Busbee handily defeated Thompson 69.1% to 30.9%.\n\nThompson left office in 1975 after two terms and was succeeded by Mayor [[Buck Melton]].\n\nThompson's time as mayor left an impression that many in the political realm still remembered years after he left office. [[Jim Marshall (Georgia politician)|Jim Marshall]], who was Macon's mayor from 1995 to 1999, recalled being asked about Thompson by other mayors when he served on the [[United States Conference of Mayors]]' executive committee in the 1990s, over two decades after Thompson had left office, \"And one mayor of Macon was well known: Ronnie Thompson...Not necessarily for good reasons, but some mayors actually had stories about him, what, almost 25 years later?\"<ref name=mteleg/> Marshall said he did not know Thompson until long after his political life had ended, \"But in his later life, I did meet him and he seemed like an awfully decent person.  And I really enjoyed his company.\"<ref name=mteleg/>\n\n===Later life and career===\nRonnie Thompson lived a much more private life after leaving elected politics in 1975. He wrote a column for the ''[[Macon News]]'' until 1983, when that newspaper merged with the ''[[Macon Telegraph]]''.<ref name=mc/> \n\nThompson largely left politics to focus on his education and a new career after leaving politics. In a 2010 interview with ''The Telegraph'', he stated, \"When I came out of the mayor\u2019s office, I only had a [[high school degree]].\"<ref name=mteleg2/> He eventually became a [[mental health]] caseworker and community support services counselor at the River Edge Behavioral Health Center in Macon, where he supervised thirty-five patients with mental illness per day.<ref name=mteleg2/> Thompson taught social skills and management to patients to help them better navigate society.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nAccording to Thompson, he became interested in [[mental health services]] when he met and befriended a mentally handicapped man nicknamed \"Bullfrog\" before becoming Macon's mayor.<ref name=mteleg2/> Racial tensions were simmering in Macon throughout the 1960s. At the time, a group of white Macon residents forcibly put Bullfrog, who was black, on a bus to [[Detroit, Michigan]], to deport the man from the city, which they derisively called a \"one-way freedom ride\".<ref name=mteleg2/> The whites forced Bullfrog to carry a letter addressed to [[Mayor of Detroit|Detroit Mayor]] [[Jerome Cavanagh]], a supporter of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], referring to Bullfrog as a \"typical black\" who should join the 60,000 Detroiters who were unemployed at the time.<ref name=mteleg2/> Thompson, then a city alderman, called Mayor Cavanagh to apologize and paid for a bus ticket to bring Bullfrog back to Macon.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nAdditionally, Thompson also worked nights at the Crest Lawn Funeral Home in Macon.<ref name=mteleg/><ref name=mteleg2/> His night shifts, which were typically quiet, allowed him the flexibility to complete both his [[associates degree]] and his [[bachelor's degree]].<ref name=mteleg2/> By 2010, Thompson was working on his [[master's degree]] in [[Addiction|addiction studies]] to help with his full-time career at the River Edge Behavioral Health Center.<ref name=mteleg2/> He suffered a minor [[stroke]] in the summer of 2009, which forced him to take two months off from work and his education.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nRonnie Thompson died from [[Alzheimer's disease]] on March 22, 2020, at the age of 85.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{MaconGAMayors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Ronnie}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Macon, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) city council members]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans]]\n[[Category:American gospel singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Macon, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Singers from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:American columnists]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force personnel]]\n[[Category:People from Macon, Georgia]]\n[[Category:People from Augusta, Georgia]]\n\n[[ar:\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0633\u0648\u0646]]\n[[simple:Ronnie Thompson]]\n", "text_old": "{{underconstruction}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name               = Ronnie Thompson\n| image              = Ronnie Thompson 4.jpg\n| image_size         = \n| caption            = Thompson during the 1960s\n| office             = [[Mayor of Macon, Georgia]]\n| term_start         = November 1967\n| term_end           = 1975\n| predecessor        = [[Benjamin Franklin Merritt, Jr.]]\n| successor          = [[Buck Melton]]\n| birth_date         = {{birth date|1934|7|21}}\n| birth_place        = [[Augusta, Georgia]]\n| death_date         = {{death date and age|2020|3|22|1934|7|21}}\n| death_place        = \n| party              = [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]\n| spouse             = \n| relations          = \n| children           = \n| residence          = \n| alma_mater         = \n| occupation         = \n| profession         = Singer<br>Musician<br>Politician<br>Counselor\n| religion           = \n| signature          = \n}}\n\n'''Ronald John \"Ronnie\" Thompson Sr.''' (July 21, 1934 \u2013 March 22, 2020), also known by '''\"Machine Gun Ronnie\" Thompson''', was an American [[gospel singer]], politician, musician, and mental health caseworker.

Emory Greene]], a Bibb County commissioner and former member of the [[Georgia House of Representatives]].\n\nWhen Thompson was sworn in as mayor shortly after the 1967 election, he presided over a city still in the midst of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], as well as the [[racial tension]]s that gripped the South at the time.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson attempted to navigate the issue of race by focusing largely on [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] issues during his early years, as well as chairing the Macon City Council Library Committee, which opened the library to African-Americans for the first time.<ref name=mc/> However, in 1970, Thompson issued a controversial \"shoot to kill\" for city police against an upcoming demonstration by the Black Liberation Front, which planned to picket downtown stores, citing the need to combat \"lawlessness and anarchy.\"<ref name=mteleg/> At another point in his tenure, Thompson floated the idea of arming 1,000 \"volunteer lawmen\" in the event of civil violence, but the idea was never fulfilled and no one was ever recruited.<ref name=mteleg/> Critics, including other elected officials in Macon's city government, attacked the idea, noting that it could inflame the present racial tensions.<ref name=mteleg/> \n\nThe issue of race in Macon erupted again in 1971, when a white police officer shot and killed a black city employee.<ref name=mc/> Just one month after the shooting, the police officer was cleared of [[involuntary manslaughter]].<ref name=mc/> In response to the manslaughter clearance, race riots erupted in Macon on June 20, 1971, which included several suspected [[fire bombing]]s.<ref name=mc/> Mayor Thompson issued a 36-hour, dusk-to-dawn [[curfew]] and went on patrol with the city's police.<ref name=mteleg/> During the unrest, a police officer called dispatch to report that he had been shot by a [[sniper]] near the intersection of Broadway and Greter Streets. Thompson went to the scene of the shooting with Macon's city police chief. There, Mayor Thompson fired a [[Carbine|carbine long gun]] at the house where the sniper was believed to be hiding, though no one was ever apprehended for the shooting.<ref name=mteleg/> News accounts erroneously reported that Thompson had fired a [[submachine gun]] at the sniper's location, while Thompson told the media that \"I could hear bullets whizzing by me,\" which he later admitted was an exaggeration of the actual events.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson would also later tell a reporter that \"machine gun\u201d sounded \"more colorful\" than the carbine long gun he had actually used at the scene.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson also placed [[billboards]] around Macon, warning that criminals and rioters would be shot during the unrest.<ref name=mc/> \n\nCritics blasted Thompson for inserting himself into the crime scene unnecessarily and derisively called him '''\"Machine Gun Ronnie\"''', despite the fact that he never used a machine gun.<ref name=mteleg/><ref name=mc/> In 2010 interview, Thompson defended his actions and the \"shoot to kill\" orders he issued as a deterrence against potential violence, citing the damaged caused by the [[1970 Augusta riot]] a year earlier, in which six black men were shot and killed by police.<ref name=mteleg2/> He told ''The Macon Telegraph'', \"The people who put me in the same category as [[George Wallace]] don't know me...I got my reputation because I didn\u2019t want people to burn the city down.\"<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nStill, the \"Machine Gun Ronnie\" nickname, which Thompson never actively opposed, stuck and remained with him for the rest of his political career.<ref name=mteleg/> Thompson even used the name to his advantage on the campaign trail by selling election model machine guns with his name \"Thompson\" printed on them.<ref name=mc/> Months later, Thompson was re-elected to a second term as mayor.\n\nIn another memorable episode, Thompson authorized the city to acquire a [[U.S. Army]] surplus [[armored personnel carrier]] for two hundred dollars in May 1973. Opponents of the purchase called it \"Thompson's Tank\", while Mayor later nicknamed the vehicle \"Winky Tink.\"<ref name=mteleg/> The tank was never used in law enforcement, but Thompson mused about adding a canon and a [[.50-caliber]] machine gun to the vehicle to guard against future riots.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\nThe events of the 1971 riots and the tank acquisition overshadowed some of Ronnie Thompson's accomplishments. He introduced official non-discriminatory hiring practices for the first time.<ref name=mc/> Thompson oversaw a series of major infrastructure upgrades during his two terms in office, including the paving and renovation of seventy-seven of city streets.<ref name=mc/> He was a leading supporter of the 14,000 [[Macon Coliseum]] multi-purpose area, which opened in 1968 at a cost of $4.5 million soon after he became mayor.<ref name=mc/> Ronnie Thompson also led the modernization of city hospitals, ungraded Macon's regional airports, library expansions, and campaigned for new industrial development.<ref name=mc/> Thompson, who campaigned on the importance of law and order, expanded the Macon Police Department from 168 officers to 242 officers, and the Macon Fire Department from 181 to 287 [[firefighters]].<ref name=mc/> His successor, former Mayor [[Buck Melton]], credited Thompson with saving and restoring many of Macon's larger old buildings.<ref name=mc/> Thompson, who had met former President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] at a golf course in Augusta, led the effort to name the Eisenhower Parkway, which runs through the city's south side, after the former president.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\nThroughout his time as mayor, Thompson hosted his own radio talk show and wrote a column for the ''[[Macon Herald]]'', a weekly newspaper.<ref name=mc/> \n\nRonnie Thompson unsuccessful ran for higher office while serving as mayor. In 1972, Thompson ran unopposed for the Republican nomination for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], but was defeated in the [[1972 United States House of Representatives elections|general election]] by incumbent Democratic [[U.S. Rep.]] [[W. S. Stuckey Jr.]] Two years later, Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] was term-limited and could not run for re-election in 1974. Ronnie Thompson won the Republican gubernatorial nomination, but lost to Democratic nominee [[George Busbee]] in the [[1974 Georgia gubernatorial election|1974 general election]]. Busbee handily defeated Thompson 69.1% to 30.9%.\n\nThompson left office in 1975 after two terms and was succeeded by Mayor [[Buck Melton]].\n\nThompson's time as mayor left an impression that many in the political realm still remembered years after he left office. [[Jim Marshall (Georgia politician)|Jim Marshall]], who was Macon's mayor from 1995 to 1999, recalled being asked about Thompson by other mayors when he served on the [[United States Conference of Mayors]]' executive committee in the 1990s, over two decades after Thompson had left office, \"And one mayor of Macon was well known: Ronnie Thompson...Not necessarily for good reasons, but some mayors actually had stories about him, what, almost 25 years later?\"<ref name=mteleg/> Marshall said he did not know Thompson until long after his political life had ended, \"But in his later life, I did meet him and he seemed like an awfully decent person.  And I really enjoyed his company.\"<ref name=mteleg/>\n\n===Later life and career===\nRonnie Thompson lived a much more private life after leaving elected politics in 1975. He wrote a column for the ''[[Macon News]]'' until 1983, when that newspaper merged with the ''[[Macon Telegraph]]''.<ref name=mc/> \n\nThompson largely left politics to focus on his education and a new career after leaving politics. In a 2010 interview with ''The Telegraph'', he stated, \"When I came out of the mayor\u2019s office, I only had a [[high school degree]].\"<ref name=mteleg2/> He eventually became a [[mental health]] caseworker and community support services counselor at the River Edge Behavioral Health Center in Macon, where he supervised thirty-five patients with mental illness per day.<ref name=mteleg2/> Thompson taught social skills and management to patients to help them better navigate society.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nAccording to Thompson, he became interested in [[mental health services]] when he met and befriended a mentally handicapped man nicknamed \"Bullfrog\" before becoming Macon's mayor.<ref name=mteleg2/> Racial tensions were simmering in Macon throughout the 1960s. At the time, a group of white Macon residents forcibly put Bullfrog, who was black, on a bus to [[Detroit, Michigan]], to deport the man from the city, which they derisively called a \"one-way freedom ride\".<ref name=mteleg2/> The whites forced Bullfrog to carry a letter addressed to [[Mayor of Detroit|Detroit Mayor]] [[Jerome Cavanagh]], a supporter of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], referring to Bullfrog as a \"typical black\" who should join the 60,000 Detroiters who were unemployed at the time.<ref name=mteleg2/> Thompson, then a city alderman, called Mayor Cavanagh to apologize and paid for a bus ticket to bring Bullfrog back to Macon.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nAdditionally, Thompson also worked nights at the Crest Lawn Funeral Home in Macon.<ref name=mteleg/><ref name=mteleg2/> His night shifts, which were typically quiet, allowed him the flexibility to complete both his [[associates degree]] and his [[bachelor's degree]].<ref name=mteleg2/> By 2010, Thompson was working on his [[master's degree]] in [[Addiction|addiction studies]] to help with his full-time career at the River Edge Behavioral Health Center.<ref name=mteleg2/> He suffered a minor [[stroke]] in the summer of 2009, which forced him to take two months off from work and his education.<ref name=mteleg2/>\n\nRonnie Thompson died from [[Alzheimer's disease]] on March 22, 2020, at the age of 85.<ref name=mteleg/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{MaconGAMayors}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thompson, Ronnie}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2020 deaths]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Macon, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) city council members]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans]]\n[[Category:American gospel singers]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Macon, Georgia]]\n[[Category:Singers from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:American columnists]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force personnel]]\n[[Category:People from Macon, Georgia]]\n[[Category:People from Augusta, Georgia]]\n\n[[ar:\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0633\u0648\u0646]]\n[[simple:Ronnie Thompson]]\n", "name_user": "Scanlan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronnie_Thompson_(politician)"}

He showed him the fundamentals starting when he was seven years old. Obsessively, Maravich spent hours practicing ball control tricks, passes, head fakes, and long-range shots.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMaravich played high school [[varsity team|varsity]] ball at [[Daniel High School]] in [[Central, South Carolina]], a year before being old enough to attend the school.  While at Daniel from 1961 to 1963, Maravich participated in the school's first-ever game against a team from an all-black school. In 1963 his father departed from his position as head basketball coach at [[Clemson University]] and joined the coaching staff at [[North Carolina State University]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The Maravich family's subsequent move to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], allowed Pete to attend [[Needham B. Broughton High School]].<ref name=\":0\" />  His high school years also saw the birth of his famous moniker.  From his habit of shooting the ball from his side, as if holding a [[revolver]], Maravich became known as \"Pistol\" Pete Maravich. He graduated from Needham B. Broughton High School in 1965 and then attended [[Southwood College|Edwards Military Institute]], where he averaged 33 points per game. Pete never liked school and did not like Edwards Military institute. It was known that Press Maravich was extremely protective of Maravich and would guard against any issue that may come up during his adolescence. Press threatened to shoot Pete with a 45 caliber gun if he drank or got into trouble.<ref name=\":0\" /> Maravich was 6 feet 4 inches in high school and was getting ready to play in college when his father took a coaching position at Louisiana State University.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==College career==\nAt that time NCAA rules prohibited first-year students from playing at varsity level, which forced Maravich to play on the freshman team. In his first game, Maravich put up 50 [[Point (basketball)|points]], 14 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 11 [[Assist (basketball)|assists]] against [[Southeastern Louisiana University|Southeastern Louisiana College]].<ref name=\"Federman\">{{cite book | first = Wayne | last =Federman | last2= Terrill |first2=Marshall |last3=Maravich |first3=Jackie | title = Maravich | page = 68 | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-894963-52-0 }}</ref>\n[[File:Pete Maravich 1967.jpeg|thumb|160px|Maravich at LSU in 1967]]\n\nIn only three years playing on the varsity team (and under his father's coaching) at LSU, Maravich scored 3,667 points\u20141,138 of those in 1967\u201368, 1,148 in 1968\u201369, and 1,381 in 1969-70\u2014while averaging 43.8, 44.2, and 44.5 points per game, respectively. For his collegiate career, the 6'5\" (1.96 m) guard averaged 44.2 points per game in 83 contests and led the NCAA in scoring for each of his three seasons.<ref>Rogers, Thomas.

Retrieved June 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nMaravich's long-standing collegiate scoring record is particularly notable when three factors are taken into account:\n*First, because of the [[NCAA]] rules that prohibited him from taking part in varsity competition during his first year as a student, Maravich was prevented from adding to his career record for a full quarter of his time at LSU.  During this first year, Maravich scored 741 points in freshman competition.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich|last=Kriegel|first=Mark|publisher=Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8497-4|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/pistollifeofpete00krie}}</ref>\n*Second, Maravich played before the advent of the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line. This significant difference has raised speculation regarding just how much higher his records would be, given his long-range shooting ability and how such a component might have altered his play. Writing for [[ESPN.com]], Bob Carter stated, \"Though Maravich played before [...] the 3-point shot was established, he loved gunning from long range.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Medcalf  | first =Myron | title =What if 'Pistol' Pete had a 3-point line? | website =[[ESPN.com]] | publisher =[[ESPN]] | date =August 18, 2014 | url =http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/99934/what-if-pistol-pete-had-a-3-point-line | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref> It has been reported that former LSU coach [[Dale Brown (basketball)|Dale Brown]] charted every shot Maravich scored and concluded that, if his shots from three-point range had been counted as three points, Maravich's average would have totaled 57 points per game.<ref>{{cite web | last =Diaz\n| first =Angel | last2 =Erwin | first2 =Jack | last3 =Warner | first3 =Ralph | title =The 25 Most Unbreakable Records in Sports History | website =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex.com]] | publisher = | date =March 2, 2012 | url =http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/03/the-25-most-unbreakable-records-in-sports-history/15 | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[Steve Bunin]], [[Bill Walton]] | title =Remembering Pete Maravich | medium =Television production | publisher =[[The Hot List]] | location = | date =2006 | time =1:56 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk-JJX2SRHc&t=1m56s | access-date =October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n*Third, the [[shot clock]] had also not yet been instituted in NCAA play during Maravich's college career. (A time limit on ball possession speeds up play, mandates an additional number of field goal attempts, eliminates [[Stalling (gaming)|stalling]], and increases the number of possessions throughout the game, all resulting in higher overall scoring.)<ref name=nytimes />\n\nMore than 40 years later, however, many of his NCAA and LSU records still stand. Maravich was a three-time All-American. Though he never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3\u201320 record in the season prior to his arrival.

And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team\u2014a very large salary at that time.<ref name=\"NBAhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/maravich_bio.html|title=Pete Maravich Bio|date=|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest\u2014good enough to earn [[NBA All-Rookie Team]] honors.

But the team stumbled to a 36\u201346 record\u201412 wins fewer than in the previous season.  Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the [[New York Knicks]] in the first round.\n\nMaravich struggled somewhat during his second season.  His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36\u201346 record.  Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round.  However, Atlanta fought hard against the [[Boston Celtics]], with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.\n\nMaravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA).  With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season.<ref>[[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Jerry West]] were the first to accomplish this feat in the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' 1964\u201365 season.

However, the season was good enough to earn Maravich his first-ever appearance in the [[NBA All-Star Game]], and also All-NBA Second Team honors.\n\nThe following season (1973\u201374) was his best yet\u2014at least in terms of individual accomplishments.  Maravich posted 27.7 points per game\u2014second in the league behind [[Bob McAdoo]]\u2014and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game.  However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35\u201347 record and missed the postseason entirely.\n\n===New Orleans Jazz===\n[[File:Pete Maravich 1977.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Maravich playing for the Jazz in 1977]]\nIn the summer of 1974, an expansion franchise was preparing for its first season of competition in the NBA.  The New Orleans Jazz were looking for something or someone to generate excitement among their new basketball fans. With his exciting style of play, Maravich was seen as the perfect man for the job. Additionally, he was already a celebrity in the state due to accomplishments at LSU.  To acquire Maravich, the Jazz traded two players and four draft picks to Atlanta.\n\nThe expansion team struggled mightily in its first season.  Maravich managed to score 21.5 points per game, but shot a career-worst 41.9 percent from the floor. The Jazz posted a 23\u201359 record, worst in the NBA.\n\nJazz management did its best to give Maravich a better supporting cast. The team posted a 38\u201344 record in its second season (1975\u201376) but did not qualify for postseason play, despite the dramatic improvement.  Maravich struggled with injuries that limited him to just 62 games that season, but he averaged 25.9 points per contest (third behind McAdoo and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]) and continued his crowd-pleasing antics. He was elected to the [[All-NBA First Team]] that year.\n\nThe following season (1976\u201377) was his most productive in the NBA.  He led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points per game.  He scored 40 points or more in 13 games,<ref>At the time, [[Tiny Archibald]]'s 18 games of 40+ points in 1972\u201373 was the only total higher by a guard.</ref> and 50 or more in 4 games.<ref>The most ever by a guard, until [[Michael Jordan]] did it 8 times in 1986\u201387. Jordan would go on to get 4 or more 50+ point games in three more seasons; [[Kobe Bryant]] is the only other guard to reach this mark, 6 times in 2005\u201306, and a record 10 times in 2006\u201307.</ref> His 68-point masterpiece against the Knicks<ref>[http://espn.go.com/classic/s/moment010225maravich.html \"Pete Maravich's 68 points a record\" by Larry Schwartz on ESPN Classic], November 19, 2003</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lsusports.net/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=177319 |title='Pistol' Pete Maravich \u2013 Career Recap \u2013 LSUsports.net \u2013 The Official Web Site of LSU Tigers Athletics |publisher=LSUsports.net |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> was at the time the most points ever scored by a guard in a single game, and only two players at any position had ever scored more: [[Wilt Chamberlain]] and [[Elgin Baylor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbahoopsonline.com/History/Leagues/NBA/pointsingame.html |title=Most points by 1 player in a NBA game, 50 point games in NBA history |publisher=Nbahoopsonline.com |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> Baylor was head coach of the Jazz at that time.\n\nMaravich earned his third all-star game appearance and was honored as All-NBA First Team for the second consecutive season.\n\nThe following season, injuries to both knees forced him to miss 32 games during the 1977\u201378 season. Despite being robbed of some quickness and athleticism, he still managed to score 27.0 points per game, and he also added 6.7 assists per contest, his highest average as a member of the Jazz.  Many of those assists went to new teammate [[Truck Robinson]], who had joined the franchise as a free agent during the off-season. In his first year in New Orleans, he averaged 22.7 points and a league-best 15.7 rebounds per game. His presence prevented opponents from focusing their defensive efforts entirely on Maravich, and it lifted the Jazz to a 39\u201343 record\u2014just short of making the club's first-ever appearance in the playoffs.\n\nKnee problems plagued Maravich for the rest of his career. He played in just 49 games during the 1978\u201379 season. He scored 22.6 points per game that season and earned his fifth and final All-Star appearance. But his scoring and passing abilities were severely impaired. The team struggled on the court, and faced serious financial trouble as well. Management became desperate to make some changes. The Jazz traded Robinson to the [[Phoenix Suns]], receiving draft picks and some cash in return. However, in 1979, team owner [[Sam Battistone]] moved the Jazz to [[Salt Lake City]].\n\n===Final season===\nThe Utah Jazz began play in the 1979\u201380 season.  Maravich moved with the team to [[Salt Lake City]], but his knee problems were worse than ever.  He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach [[Tom Nissalke]] had a strict rule that players who didn't practice were not allowed to play in games.  Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself.  During that time, [[Adrian Dantley]] emerged as the team's franchise player.\n\nThe Jazz placed Maravich on [[Waivers (NBA)|waivers]] in January 1980.  He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar [[Larry Bird]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Linda Hamilton |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595102509,00.html |title=25 years later the Jazz are going strong |publisher=Deseret.news.com |date=November 2, 2004 |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>  Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a \"hired gun\" off the bench. He helped the team post a 61\u201321 record in the regular season, best in the league.  And, for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs.  He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by [[Julius Erving]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.\n\nRealizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the 3-point shot just in time for Maravich's last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 3-point shots, giving him a career 66.7% completion rate behind the arc.\n\nDuring his ten-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest.  In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], and his No. 7 jersey has been retired by both the Jazz and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], as well as his No. 44 jersey by the [[Atlanta Hawks]].\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|leader=y}}\n\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 NBA season|1970\u201371]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| '''81''' || ... || 36.1 || .458 || ... || .800 || 3.7 || 4.4 || ... || ... || 23.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 NBA season|1971\u201372]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 66 || ... || 34.9 || .427 || ... || .811 || 3.9 || 6.0 || ... || ... || 19.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 NBA season|1972\u201373]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 79 || ... || 39.1 || .441 || ... || .800 || 4.4 || '''6.9''' || ... || ... || 26.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 NBA season|1973\u201374]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 76 || ... || 38.2 || .457 || ... || .826 || 4.9 || 5.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 27.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 NBA season|1974\u201375]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 79 || ... || 36.1 || .419 || ... || .811 || '''5.3''' || 6.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 21.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 NBA season|1975\u201376]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 62 || ... || 38.3 || '''.459''' || ... || .811 || 4.8 || 5.4 || 1.4 || '''.4''' || 25.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 NBA season|1976\u201377]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 73 || ... || '''41.7''' || .433 || ... || .835 || 5.1 || 5.4 || 1.2 || .3 ||style=\"background:#cfecec;\"|  '''31.1'''*\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 NBA season|1977\u201378]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 50 || ... || 40.8 || .444 || ... || '''.870''' || 3.6 || 6.7 || '''2.0''' || .2 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 NBA season|1978\u201379]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 49 || ... || 37.2 || .421 || ... || .841 || 2.5 || 5.0 || 1.2 || '''.4''' || 22.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 17 || ... || 30.7 || .412 || .636 || .820 || 2.4 || 3.2 || .9 || .2 || 17.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 26 || 4 || 17.0 || .494 || .750 || .909 || 1.5 || 1.1 || .3 || .1 || 11.5\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 658 || ... || 37.0 || .441 || .667 || .820 || 4.2 || 5.4 || 1.4 || .3 || 24.2\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| All-Star\n| 4 || 4 || 19.8 || .409 || ... || .778 || 2.0 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0.0 || 10.8\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971 NBA Playoffs|1971]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 5 || ... || '''39.8''' || .377 || ... || .692 || 5.2 || 4.8 || ... || ... || 22.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972 NBA Playoffs|1972]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 36.5 || .446 || ... || '''.817''' || '''5.3''' || 4.7 || ... || ... || '''27.7'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973 NBA Playoffs|1973]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 39.0 || .419 || ... || .794 || 4.8 || '''6.7''' || ... || ... || 26.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1980 NBA Playoffs|1980]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 9 || ... || 11.6 || '''.490''' || .333 || .667 || .9 || .7 || .3 || .0 || 6.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Career<ref name=\"Pete Maravich\"/>\n| 26 || ... || 29.1 || .423 || .333 || .784 || 3.6 || 3.8 || ... || ... || 18.7\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter injuries forced his retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Maravich became a [[recluse]] for two years.

During this first year, Maravich scored 741 points in freshman competition.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Pistol: The Life of Pete Maravich|last=Kriegel|first=Mark|publisher=Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8497-4|location=New York|pages=|url=https://archive.org/details/pistollifeofpete00krie}}</ref>\n*Second, Maravich played before the advent of the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line. This significant difference has raised speculation regarding just how much higher his records would be, given his long-range shooting ability and how such a component might have altered his play. Writing for [[ESPN.com]], Bob Carter stated, \"Though Maravich played before [...] the 3-point shot was established, he loved gunning from long range.\"<ref>{{cite web | last =Medcalf  | first =Myron | title =What if 'Pistol' Pete had a 3-point line? | website =[[ESPN.com]] | publisher =[[ESPN]] | date =August 18, 2014 | url =http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/99934/what-if-pistol-pete-had-a-3-point-line | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref> It has been reported that former LSU coach [[Dale Brown (basketball)|Dale Brown]] charted every shot Maravich scored and concluded that, if his shots from three-point range had been counted as three points, Maravich's average would have totaled 57 points per game.<ref>{{cite web | last =Diaz\n| first =Angel | last2 =Erwin | first2 =Jack | last3 =Warner | first3 =Ralph | title =The 25 Most Unbreakable Records in Sports History | website =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex.com]] | publisher = | date =March 2, 2012 | url =http://www.complex.com/sports/2012/03/the-25-most-unbreakable-records-in-sports-history/15 | accessdate = September 16, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[Steve Bunin]], [[Bill Walton]] | title =Remembering Pete Maravich | medium =Television production | publisher =[[The Hot List]] | location = | date =2006 | time =1:56 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk-JJX2SRHc&t=1m56s | access-date =October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n*Third, the [[shot clock]] had also not yet been instituted in NCAA play during Maravich's college career. (A time limit on ball possession speeds up play, mandates an additional number of field goal attempts, eliminates [[Stalling (gaming)|stalling]], and increases the number of possessions throughout the game, all resulting in higher overall scoring.)<ref name=nytimes />\n\nMore than 40 years later, however, many of his NCAA and LSU records still stand. Maravich was a three-time All-American. Though he never appeared in the NCAA tournament, Maravich played a key role in turning around a lackluster program that had posted a 3\u201320 record in the season prior to his arrival.

And it did not help that many of the veteran players resented the $1.9 million contract that Maravich received from the team\u2014a very large salary at that time.<ref name=\"NBAhistory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/maravich_bio.html|title=Pete Maravich Bio|date=|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaravich appeared in 81 games and averaged 23.2 points per contest\u2014good enough to earn [[NBA All-Rookie Team]] honors.

But the team stumbled to a 36\u201346 record\u201412 wins fewer than in the previous season.  Still, the Hawks qualified for the playoffs, where they lost to the [[New York Knicks]] in the first round.\n\nMaravich struggled somewhat during his second season.  His scoring average dipped to 19.3 points per game, and the Hawks finished with another disappointing 36\u201346 record.  Once again they qualified for the playoffs, and once again they were eliminated in the first round.  However, Atlanta fought hard against the [[Boston Celtics]], with Maravich averaging 27.7 points in the series.\n\nMaravich erupted in his third season, averaging 26.1 points (5th in the NBA) and dishing out 6.9 assists per game (6th in the NBA).  With 2,063 points, he combined with Hudson (2,029 points) to become only the second set of teammates in league history to each score over 2,000 points in a single season.<ref>[[Elgin Baylor]] and [[Jerry West]] were the first to accomplish this feat in the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' 1964\u201365 season.

Maravich posted 27.7 points per game\u2014second in the league behind [[Bob McAdoo]]\u2014and earned his second appearance in the All-Star Game.  However, Atlanta sank to a disappointing 35\u201347 record and missed the postseason entirely.\n\n===New Orleans Jazz===\n[[File:Pete Maravich 1977.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Maravich playing for the Jazz in 1977]]\nIn the summer of 1974, an expansion franchise was preparing for its first season of competition in the NBA.  The New Orleans Jazz were looking for something or someone to generate excitement among their new basketball fans. With his exciting style of play, Maravich was seen as the perfect man for the job. Additionally, he was already a celebrity in the state due to accomplishments at LSU.  To acquire Maravich, the Jazz traded two players and four draft picks to Atlanta.\n\nThe expansion team struggled mightily in its first season.  Maravich managed to score 21.5 points per game, but shot a career-worst 41.9 percent from the floor. The Jazz posted a 23\u201359 record, worst in the NBA.\n\nJazz management did its best to give Maravich a better supporting cast. The team posted a 38\u201344 record in its second season (1975\u201376) but did not qualify for postseason play, despite the dramatic improvement.  Maravich struggled with injuries that limited him to just 62 games that season, but he averaged 25.9 points per contest (third behind McAdoo and [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]) and continued his crowd-pleasing antics. He was elected to the [[All-NBA First Team]] that year.\n\nThe following season (1976\u201377) was his most productive in the NBA.  He led the league in scoring with an average of 31.1 points per game.  He scored 40 points or more in 13 games,<ref>At the time, [[Tiny Archibald]]'s 18 games of 40+ points in 1972\u201373 was the only total higher by a guard.</ref> and 50 or more in 4 games.<ref>The most ever by a guard, until [[Michael Jordan]] did it 8 times in 1986\u201387.

Despite being robbed of some quickness and athleticism, he still managed to score 27.0 points per game, and he also added 6.7 assists per contest, his highest average as a member of the Jazz.  Many of those assists went to new teammate [[Truck Robinson]], who had joined the franchise as a free agent during the off-season. In his first year in New Orleans, he averaged 22.7 points and a league-best 15.7 rebounds per game. His presence prevented opponents from focusing their defensive efforts entirely on Maravich, and it lifted the Jazz to a 39\u201343 record\u2014just short of making the club's first-ever appearance in the playoffs.\n\nKnee problems plagued Maravich for the rest of his career. He played in just 49 games during the 1978\u201379 season. He scored 22.6 points per game that season and earned his fifth and final All-Star appearance. But his scoring and passing abilities were severely impaired. The team struggled on the court, and faced serious financial trouble as well. Management became desperate to make some changes. The Jazz traded Robinson to the [[Phoenix Suns]], receiving draft picks and some cash in return. However, in 1979, team owner [[Sam Battistone]] moved the Jazz to [[Salt Lake City]].\n\n===Final season===\nThe Utah Jazz began play in the 1979\u201380 season.  Maravich moved with the team to [[Salt Lake City]], but his knee problems were worse than ever.  He appeared in 17 games early in the season, but his injuries prevented him from practicing much, and new coach [[Tom Nissalke]] had a strict rule that players who didn't practice were not allowed to play in games.  Thus, Maravich was parked on the bench for 24 straight games, much to the dismay of Utah fans and to Maravich himself.  During that time, [[Adrian Dantley]] emerged as the team's franchise player.\n\nThe Jazz placed Maravich on [[Waivers (NBA)|waivers]] in January 1980.  He signed with the Celtics, the top team in the league that year, led by rookie superstar [[Larry Bird]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Linda Hamilton |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595102509,00.html |title=25 years later the Jazz are going strong |publisher=Deseret.news.com |date=November 2, 2004 |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref>  Maravich adjusted to a new role as part-time contributor, giving Boston a \"hired gun\" off the bench. He helped the team post a 61\u201321 record in the regular season, best in the league.  And, for the first time since his early career in Atlanta, Maravich was able to participate in the NBA playoffs.  He appeared in nine games during that postseason, but the Celtics were upended by [[Julius Erving]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the Eastern Conference finals, four games to one.\n\nRealizing that his knee problems would never go away, Maravich retired at the end of that season. The NBA instituted the 3-point shot just in time for Maravich's last season in the league. He had always been famous for his long-range shooting, and his final year provided an official statistical gauge of his abilities. Between his limited playing time in Utah and Boston, he made 10 of 15 3-point shots, giving him a career 66.7% completion rate behind the arc.\n\nDuring his ten-year career in the NBA, Maravich played in 658 games, averaging 24.2 points and 5.4 assists per contest.  In 1987, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], and his No. 7 jersey has been retired by both the Jazz and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]], as well as his No. 44 jersey by the [[Atlanta Hawks]].\n\n==NBA career statistics==\n{{NBA player statistics legend|leader=y}}\n\n===Regular season===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 NBA season|1970\u201371]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| '''81''' || ... || 36.1 || .458 || ... || .800 || 3.7 || 4.4 || ... || ... || 23.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 NBA season|1971\u201372]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 66 || ... || 34.9 || .427 || ... || .811 || 3.9 || 6.0 || ... || ... || 19.3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 NBA season|1972\u201373]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 79 || ... || 39.1 || .441 || ... || .800 || 4.4 || '''6.9''' || ... || ... || 26.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 NBA season|1973\u201374]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973-74 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 76 || ... || 38.2 || .457 || ... || .826 || 4.9 || 5.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 27.7\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 NBA season|1974\u201375]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1974-75 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 79 || ... || 36.1 || .419 || ... || .811 || '''5.3''' || 6.2 || 1.5 || .2 || 21.5\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 NBA season|1975\u201376]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1975-76 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 62 || ... || 38.3 || '''.459''' || ... || .811 || 4.8 || 5.4 || 1.4 || '''.4''' || 25.9\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 NBA season|1976\u201377]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1976-77 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 73 || ... || '''41.7''' || .433 || ... || .835 || 5.1 || 5.4 || 1.2 || .3 ||style=\"background:#cfecec;\"|  '''31.1'''*\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 NBA season|1977\u201378]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1977-78 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 50 || ... || 40.8 || .444 || ... || '''.870''' || 3.6 || 6.7 || '''2.0''' || .2 || 27.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 NBA season|1978\u201379]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1978-79 New Orleans Jazz season|New Orleans]]\n| 49 || ... || 37.2 || .421 || ... || .841 || 2.5 || 5.0 || 1.2 || '''.4''' || 22.6\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Utah Jazz season|Utah]]\n| 17 || ... || 30.7 || .412 || .636 || .820 || 2.4 || 3.2 || .9 || .2 || 17.1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 NBA season|1979\u201380]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 26 || 4 || 17.0 || .494 || .750 || .909 || 1.5 || 1.1 || .3 || .1 || 11.5\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Career\n| 658 || ... || 37.0 || .441 || .667 || .820 || 4.2 || 5.4 || 1.4 || .3 || 24.2\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| All-Star\n| 4 || 4 || 19.8 || .409 || ... || .778 || 2.0 || 3.8 || 1.0 || 0.0 || 10.8\n{{s-end}}\n\n===Playoffs===\n{{NBA player statistics start}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971 NBA Playoffs|1971]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1970-71 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 5 || ... || '''39.8''' || .377 || ... || .692 || 5.2 || 4.8 || ... || ... || 22.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972 NBA Playoffs|1972]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1971-72 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 36.5 || .446 || ... || '''.817''' || '''5.3''' || 4.7 || ... || ... || '''27.7'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1973 NBA Playoffs|1973]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1972-73 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta]]\n| 6 || ... || 39.0 || .419 || ... || .794 || 4.8 || '''6.7''' || ... || ... || 26.2\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1980 NBA Playoffs|1980]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[1979-80 Boston Celtics season|Boston]]\n| 9 || ... || 11.6 || '''.490''' || .333 || .667 || .9 || .7 || .3 || .0 || 6.0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Career<ref name=\"Pete Maravich\"/>\n| 26 || ... || 29.1 || .423 || .333 || .784 || 3.6 || 3.8 || ... || ... || 18.7\n|-\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nAfter injuries forced his retirement from the game in the fall of 1980, Maravich became a [[recluse]] for two years.

Beograd'') is a Serbian media company headquartered in Belgrade.\n\nThe company is the owner of [[Pink Media Group]], which operates with: [[Pink TV (Serbia)|Pink TV]] (one of the leading commercial television stations in Serbia); [[Radio Pink]] (a successful radio station covering Belgrade); Fashion TV Southeast Europe, [[Fashion TV SEE]] or FTV SEE (regional channel franchise from [[Fashion TV]] International); and, PFI Studios (international film production studios).\n\n==History==\nRegistered as a limited liability company, Pink International Company is owned by Serbian businessman and entrepreneur [[\u017deljko Mitrovi\u0107]] who amassed his fortune during the 1990s under the regime of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Mitrovi\u0107 was a close personal friend of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's wife [[Mirjana Markovic|Mira Markovi\u0107]] and an influential official of her [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL) party.\n\nMitrovi\u0107 founded Pink International Company in the 1990s following the formation of the radio activities and later expansion into television. The company was re-registered on 25 April 2005, in accordance with new Serbian laws and regulations.\n\nIn June 2018, Pink International Company sold to \"Direct Media\" its Montenegrin and Bosnian divisions \u2013 [[Nova M|Pink M]] and [[Nova BH|Pink BH]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pink International Company i \u017deljko Mitrovi\u0107 potpisali saglasnost Direct Mediji o akviziciji televizija Pink M i Pink BH |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/ekonomija/aktuelno.239.html:731282-Pink-International-Company-i-Zeljko-Mitrovic-potpisali-saglasnost-Direct-Mediji-o-akviziciji-televizija-Pink-M-i-Pink-BH |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=novosti.rs |date=5 June 2018 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nPink International's range of activities encompass:\n\n===Radio===\nRadio Pink was started in 1993, covering only the Belgrade metropolitan area. The premise behind the radio was to focus on music programming. No news is broadcast.\n\n===Television===\n[[Pink TV (Serbia)|Pink TV]] is the leading commercial television station in Serbia. Founded in 1994 and covering initially only the Belgrade area, the station later achieved countrywide reach by the late 1990s. In 1998, Pink TV achieved the leading position in the market. Pink TV's emphasis is on light entertainment programming: movies, sitcoms, music variety shows, talk shows, reality shows and news.\n\n===Satellite Television===\nPink International provides production content for two global satellite channels (Pink Extra and Pink Plus) broadcast to subscribers in Europe, Australia and North America. There are nine direct-to-home (DTH) satellite channels that have been created in cooperation with Serbia's largest cable company, [[Serbia Broadband]] (SBB) although some content from Pink Extra and/or Pink Plus is available on the DTH channels. Pink International provides content for these satellite channels from its own production (TV Pink) and well as content purchased from or co-produced with independent production companies.\n\n===Fashion TV Southeast Europe===\nIn November 2008, Pink International launched Fashion TV Southeast Europe ([[Fashion TV SEE]] or FTV SEE).  Pink International obtained the franchise rights, from [[Fashion TV]] International, for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.  This regional satellite channel is distributed through cable and DTH.  Michel Adam Lisowski, the owner of [[Fashion TV]] International, attended the launch activities with senior Pink representatives including Zeljko Mitrovic in Belgrade, Ljubljana and Zagreb.  [[Fashion TV SEE]] has a potential market reach of more than 20 million viewers.\n\n===Film Production===\nPFI Studios (opened in 2007), a division of Pink International, consists currently of eight sound stages that have been designed and built to attract international productions, primarily American and West European. A ninth sound stage, planned for completion in 2011, will be one of the largest in Europe.

Beograd'') is a Serbian media company headquartered in Belgrade.\n\nThe company is the owner of [[Pink Media Group]], which operates with: [[Pink TV (Serbia)|Pink TV]] (one of the leading commercial television stations in Serbia); [[Radio Pink]] (a successful radio station covering Belgrade); Fashion TV Southeast Europe, [[Fashion TV SEE]] or FTV SEE (regional channel franchise from [[Fashion TV]] International); and, PFI Studios (international film production studios).\n\n==History==\nRegistered as a limited liability company, Pink International Company is owned by Serbian businessman and entrepreneur \u017deljko Mitrovi\u0107 who amassed his fortune during the 1990s under the regime of [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. Mitrovi\u0107 was a close personal friend of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's wife [[Mirjana Markovic|Mira Markovi\u0107]] and an influential official of her [[Yugoslav Left]] (JUL) party.\n\nMitrovi\u0107 founded Pink International Company in the 1990s following the formation of the radio activities and later expansion into television. The company was re-registered on 25 April 2005, in accordance with new Serbian laws and regulations.\n\nIn June 2018, Pink International Company sold to \"Direct Media\" its Montenegrin and Bosnian divisions \u2013 [[Nova M|Pink M]] and [[Nova BH|Pink BH]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pink International Company i \u017deljko Mitrovi\u0107 potpisali saglasnost Direct Mediji o akviziciji televizija Pink M i Pink BH |url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/ekonomija/aktuelno.239.html:731282-Pink-International-Company-i-Zeljko-Mitrovic-potpisali-saglasnost-Direct-Mediji-o-akviziciji-televizija-Pink-M-i-Pink-BH |accessdate=2 October 2018 |work=novosti.rs |date=5 June 2018 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\nPink International's range of activities encompass:\n\n===Radio===\nRadio Pink was started in 1993, covering only the Belgrade metropolitan area. The premise behind the radio was to focus on music programming. No news is broadcast.\n\n===Television===\n[[Pink TV (Serbia)|Pink TV]] is the leading commercial television station in Serbia. Founded in 1994 and covering initially only the Belgrade area, the station later achieved countrywide reach by the late 1990s. In 1998, Pink TV achieved the leading position in the market. Pink TV's emphasis is on light entertainment programming: movies, sitcoms, music variety shows, talk shows, reality shows and news.\n\n===Satellite Television===\nPink International provides production content for two global satellite channels (Pink Extra and Pink Plus) broadcast to subscribers in Europe, Australia and North America. There are nine direct-to-home (DTH) satellite channels that have been created in cooperation with Serbia's largest cable company, [[Serbia Broadband]] (SBB) although some content from Pink Extra and/or Pink Plus is available on the DTH channels. Pink International provides content for these satellite channels from its own production (TV Pink) and well as content purchased from or co-produced with independent production companies.\n\n===Fashion TV Southeast Europe===\nIn November 2008, Pink International launched Fashion TV Southeast Europe ([[Fashion TV SEE]] or FTV SEE).  Pink International obtained the franchise rights, from [[Fashion TV]] International, for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia.  This regional satellite channel is distributed through cable and DTH.  Michel Adam Lisowski, the owner of [[Fashion TV]] International, attended the launch activities with senior Pink representatives including Zeljko Mitrovic in Belgrade, Ljubljana and Zagreb.  [[Fashion TV SEE]] has a potential market reach of more than 20 million viewers.\n\n===Film Production===\nPFI Studios (opened in 2007), a division of Pink International, consists currently of eight sound stages that have been designed and built to attract international productions, primarily American and West European. A ninth sound stage, planned for completion in 2011, will be one of the largest in Europe. In addition to the sound stages, the studio complex consists of administrative office buildings, warehouses and a back lot (12.5 hectares), all located in [[\u0160imanovci]] just 15 minutes outside of Belgrade. PFI Studios provides full production support in addition to studio infrastructure to international film projects. To date, productions such as ''[[Lockout (film)|Lockout]]'' and ''[[The Raven (2011 film)|The Raven]]'' have been shot there.\n\nPFI Studios has also co-produced Serbian films that have achieved local box office acclaim: ''[[Promeni me]]'' (Change Me), ''[[\u010cetvrti \u010dovek]]'' (The Fourth Man), ''[[\u010citulja za Eskobara]]'' (Obituary for Escobar), and ''[[Zona mrtvih]]'' (Zone of the Dead).\n\n==Channels==\n\n===TV===\n\n====Terrestrial====\n*[[Pink TV (Serbia)|Pink TV]] \u2013 [[Serbia]]\n\n====Satellite and Cable====\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Pink Plus]] \u2013 Based in Vienna, Austria\n*[[Nova BH|Pink BH]] \u2013 Based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n*[[Pink M]] \u2013 Based in Podgorica, Montenegro\n*Pink Extra \u2013 Broadcasts programs from [[Nova BH|Pink BH]]<ref>[http://www.pinkmediagroup.net/satellite-television/ Pink Media Group official web site, Satellite channels]</ref>\n*[[Pink 2]]\n*Pink 3 Info\n*Pink Premium \u2013 Broadcasts foreign movies\n*Pink Movies \u2013 Broadcasts foreign action movies\n*Pink Romance \u2013 Broadcasts foreign romance movies\n*Pink Sci-Fi & Fantasy \u2013 Broadcasts foreign sci-fi movies\n*Pink Action \u2013 Broadcasts foreign action movies\n*Pink Thriller \u2013 Broadcasts foreign thriller movies\n*Pink Crime & Mystery\n*Pink Classic \u2013 Broadcasts foreign classic movies\n*Pink Western \u2013 Broadcasts foreign western movies\n*Pink Horror \u2013 Broadcasts foreign horror movies\n*Pink Comedy \u2013 Broadcasts foreign comedy movies\n*Pink World Cinema \u2013 Broadcasts foreign movies\n*Pink Film \u2013 Broadcasts domestic movies\n*Pink Family \u2013 Broadcasts foreign series\n*[[Pink Soap]]\n*Pink Serije \u2013 Broadcasts domestic series\n*Pink Koncert\n*Pink Hits\n*Pink Hits 2\n*Pink N Roll\n*Pink Music\n*Pink Music 2\n*Pink Folk\n*Pink Folk 2\n*Pink Show\n*Pink Parada\n*Bravo Music\n*Pink Pedia\n*Pink Fashion\n*Pink Style\n*Pink Kuvar\n*Pink Super Kids\n*Pink Kids\n*Pink Zabava\n*Pink World\n*Erotic\n*Erotic 2\n*Erotic 3\n*Erotic 4\n*Erotic 5\n*Erotic 6\n*Erotic 7\n*Erotic 8\n*Pink Reality\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Radio===\n*Radio Pink \u2013 Able to be heard all over the world via satellite and internet\n\n====Film Production====\n*PFI Studios\n\n==Former assets==\n* [[Nova M|Pink M]] (2002\u20132018)\n* [[Nova BH|Pink BH]] (2003\u20132018) \n* [[Pink 15]] (2010\u20132012)\n* [[Pink SI|Pink Si]] (2010\u20132012)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1998 establishments in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Belgrade]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1998]]\n[[Category:D.o.o. companies in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Film production companies of Serbia]]\n[[Category:Media companies of Serbia]]\n", "name_user": "SrpskiAnonimac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_International_Company"}
