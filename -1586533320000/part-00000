The population was 1,269 at the 2010 census, up from 1,247 at the 2000 census. It is 8 miles (13&nbsp;km) east of [[Redding, California]].  The communities of [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]] (pop. 2,781), [[Millville, California|Millville]] (pop. 727), [[Shingletown, California|Shingletown]] (pop. 2,283), [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]] (pop. 880),{{sfn|Berkshire Hathaway Home Services}} [[Whitmore, California|Whitmore]] (pop. 999),{{sfn|CLR Choice, Inc.}} and [[Round Mountain, California|Round Mountain]] (pop. 155) lie within a 15-mile (24&nbsp;km) radius.\n\nOriginally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th Century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary, that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the [[Sacramento Valley]] by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (1829) and [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]] (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th Century.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 338.1 people per square mile (130.5/km<sup>2</sup>). Award winning country musician [[Merle Haggard]] lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples===\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n\nPrior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} These tribes included the [[Wintu]], [[Patwin]]s, Nozi, [[Pit River Tribe|Pit Rivers]], Hat Creeks, [[Shasta people|Shastas]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]s, and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Indian tribes.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] Indian tribes on the [[Pacific coast]] or valley included the [[Maidu]], [[Miwok]], [[Ohlone|Constanoan]], [[Yokuts]], Yanas, and other divisions. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} Historians said that California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes, and more different Indian languages in the lower 48 continental United States.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{see|History of California before 1900|Alta California|California grizzly bears}}\nDuring the 18th Century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], in 1769\u20131770, that led to the founding of [[Alta California]], reaching as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe 19th Century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior. In March 1812, the Russian-American Fur Company under [[Ivan Kuskov]] established a colony at [[Fort Ross, California|Fort Ross]] on the coast of what is now Sonoma County.{{sfn|''Fort Ross'' Establishment of the California Settlement 1998}} As early as 1817, Father [[Narciso Dur\u00e1n]], on an expedition sighted a snow capped mountain (Mount Shasta), that he called ''Jesus Maria'', from what is now the Marysville plains. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} Three years later, in 1827, an expedition to the Klammath Mountains from the Coastal Range, by explorer [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello|Luis Arg\u00fcello]] and company, sighted two \"twin\" mountains, believed to be Mount Shasta and Mount Lassen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=11-12}} In 1826, Mount Shasta was seen by Hudson Bay fur trader Peter Skene Odgen.{{sfn|Giles|1949|p=14}} In 1828, Mt.

Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century. The feed store was built on the north side of Old Forty-Four Drive and is still there today.\n\nAs Palo Cedro continued to grow more services were needed, and the first independently owned pharmacy opened in August 1975.  Its first space was a remodelled auto body shop. To accommodate its growing business, it moved to the current location on the south side of Highway 44 off Deschutes Road. Palo Cedro Pharmacy has an eclectic mix of pictures, memorabilia, and antiques collected over the last 40 years showing how the town and pharmacy has changed over the years.

The communities of [[Bella Vista, California|Bella Vista]] (pop. 2,781), [[Millville, California|Millville]] (pop. 727), [[Shingletown, California|Shingletown]] (pop. 2,283), [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]] (pop. 880),{{sfn|Berkshire Hathaway Home Services}} [[Whitmore, California|Whitmore]] (pop. 999),{{sfn|CLR Choice, Inc.}} and [[Round Mountain, California|Round Mountain]] (pop. 155) lie within a 15-mile (24&nbsp;km) radius.\n\nOriginally, indigenous Native Americans lived in Northern California, including what is now Shasta County, prior to European American settlement. European American exploration of inland California started in 1769 and continued on into the 19th Century. Cow Creek, a Sacramento River tributary, that runs south through Palo Cedro, was a conduit for entrance into the [[Sacramento Valley]] by Hudson Bay Fur Company trappers including [[Alexander Roderick McLeod|Alexander McLeod]] (1829) and [[John Work (fur trader)|John Work]] (1832). The town is named after cedarwood trees originally indigenous to the area in the 19th Century.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, Palo Cedro has a population density of 338.1 people per square mile (130.5/km<sup>2</sup>). Award winning country musician [[Merle Haggard]] lived in Palo Cedro for decades until his death on April 6, 2016.\n\n==History==\n===Indigenous peoples===\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n\nPrior to white settlement, various Indian tribes settled and inhabited Northern California.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} These tribes included the [[Wintu]], [[Patwin]]s, Nozi, [[Pit River Tribe|Pit Rivers]], Hat Creeks, [[Shasta people|Shastas]], [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]]s, and [[Modoc people|Modoc]] Indian tribes.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus established their main camp on Cottonwood Creek.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] Indian tribes on the [[Pacific coast]] or valley included the [[Maidu]], [[Miwok]], [[Ohlone|Constanoan]], [[Yokuts]], Yanas, and other divisions. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} Historians said that California has the most native tribes and subdivisions of tribes, and more different Indian languages in the lower 48 continental United States.{{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}} The Wintus were the largest and most peaceful division that settled in Northern California and Oregon. {{sfn|Giles|1949|pp=6-9, 36}}\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{see|History of California before 1900|Alta California|California grizzly bears}}\nDuring the 18th Century, the first recorded Spanish (or any European) land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California, was the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]], in 1769\u20131770, that led to the founding of [[Alta California]], reaching as far north as [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe 19th Century launched many explorations by whites into California and its northern interior.

Miners used this railroad, as did the Terry Lumber Company at Bella Vista.  The train delivered groceries and mail to the villages along its route. It also had a passenger car.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\n{{see|History of California 1900 to present|California}}\nIn the early 1900s, the stage route went from [[Redding, California|Redding]] through Palo Cedro, [[Millville, California|Millville]], [[Oak Run, California|Oak Run]], and on to [[Fall River Mills, California|Fall River Mills]].\n\nPalo Cedro's first school house was located near the corner of Hillside Drive and Deschutes Road on the south side of town. Later it was moved to a site near the Grange Hall, on the north side of town. The school was located there until the \"new\" Junction School was built in 1960 on the south side of town.\n\nIn 1907 or thereabouts, Frank and Mary Love owned the Palo Cedro general store. The store was on the west side of the tracks and their house on the east.  A two-story house on the northeast corner of Deschutes Road and Old Forty-Four Drive may, at one time, have been a stopping place for stage drivers and travelers. Sarah Addington later owned the Palo Cedro store.  She was also the postmaster and handed the position down to her daughter, Mary Jones. She moved the post office next door into her home.\n\nJohn Gebauer has since owned the store. In the 1960s John moved to his new building on the south east side of Palo Cedro; it had several one-story spaces for commercial businesses. The largest business was the Palo Cedro Market. Gebauer's son John now operates it. The post office moved into a part of Gebauer's building. Mary Jones' assistants were her sisters. The next postmaster was Sylvia Metz. As she found the post office needed more space, it moved to a two-story building on the north side of Palo Cedro.\n\nThe first Grange Hall and Feed Store were constructed in the early 1930s, just off Deschutes Road on Old Highway 44.  The building was two stories with the meeting and/or dance hall upstairs. The dining room was downstairs in back and the feed store in front. This building burned down in the early 1940s and was quickly replaced with a one-story building, which is still in use in the 21st century.

The connection between the Sind and [[Islam]] was established by the initial Muslim missions during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. Al-Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi, who attacked [[Makran]] in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]].

The tradition of visiting [[dargah]]s is still practiced today.  Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Data Ganj Baksh ([[Ali Hajweri]]) in [[Lahore]] (ca. 11th century), [[Sultan Bahoo]] in [[Shorkot]] [[Jhang]], [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]] in [[Multan]] and [[Shahbaz Qalander]] in [[Sehwan]] (ca. 12th century) and [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai]] in [[Bhit]], Sindh and [[Rehman Baba]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]]. The [[Urs]] (death anniversary) of Sufi saints accounts for the largest gathering upon their shrines held annually by the devotees. \n\nAlthough, popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance, certain [[tariqa]]s such as [[Sarwari Qadiri|Sarwari Qadri Order]], refrain from such traditions and believe in paying visit to the shrines, making prayers or reciting [[manqabat]]. Moreover, contemporary Islamic fundamentalists also criticize the popular tradition of singing, dance and music, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet [[Mohammad]] and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, five in 2010 that killed 64 people. Presently, the known [[tariqa]]s in Pakistan have maintained their organisations usually known as tehreeks and have their [[khanqah]]s for the [[dhikr]] of Allah, as per the old age Sufi tradition.<ref name=NYTSufivideo>{{cite news|title=Sufism Under attack in Pakistan|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Produced by Charlotte Buchen|format=video|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528051803/http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html|archive-date=May 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=NYTAtWarSufi>{{cite news|title=The Islam That Hard-Liners Hate|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/the-islam-that-hard-liners-hate/|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011|author=Huma Imtiaz|author2=Charlotte Buchen|format=blog}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|first1=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|title=Visiting Shrines of Sufi Saints|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd|isbn=9789699795183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA337&dq=dawat+e+qaboor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAGoVChMI4ejbuMTlyAIVghweCh2HyQNH#v=onepage&q=dawat%20e%20qaboor&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Quranists===\nMuslims who reject the authority of [[hadith]], known as [[Quranist]], Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in Pakistan.<ref>Ali Usman Qasmi, [http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta3/tft/article.php?issue=20130125&page=16 A mosque for Qurani Namaz], ''The Friday Times'', Retrieved February 16, 2013</ref> The largest [[Quranist]] organization in Pakistan is [[Ahle Quran]], followed by Bazm-e-Tolu-e-Islam.

The connection between the Sind and [[Islam]] was established by the initial Muslim missions during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. Al-Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi, who attacked [[Makran]] in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]]. During the caliphate of Ali, many Hindus of Sindh had came under influence of Shi'ism and some even participated in the [[Battle of Camel]] and died fighting for [[Ali]]. Under the Umayyads (661 - 750 AD), many Shias sought asylum in the region of Sindh, to live in relative peace in the remote area. Ziyad Hindi is one of those refugees. In 712 [[Common Era|CE]], a young Arab general [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] conquered most of the [[Indus River|Indus]] region for the [[Umayyad]] empire, to be made the \"As-Sindh\" province with its capital at Al-[[Mansura, Sindh|Mansurah]].<ref name=\"Information of Pakistan\">{{cite web |url=http://www.infopak.gov.pk/History.aspx |title=History in Chronological Order |publisher=Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of Pakistan |access-date=15 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723113602/http://infopak.gov.pk/History.aspx |archive-date=23 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/735610/figuring-qasim-how-pakistan-was-won |title=Figuring Qasim: How Pakistan was won |publisher=Dawn|access-date=19 February 2015|date=2012-07-19 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1175127/the-first-pakistani |title=The first Pakistani? |publisher=Dawn|access-date=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1098562/muhammad-bin-qasim-predator-or-preacher |title=Muhammad Bin Qasim: Predator or preacher? |publisher=Dawn|access-date=19 February 2015|date=2014-04-08 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scroll.in/article/721012/the-curious-case-of-dressing-up-an-8th-century-arab-as-the-true-founder-of-pakistan|title=Why some in Pakistan want to replace Jinnah as the founder of the country with an 8th century Arab|last=Paracha|first=Nadeem F.|work=Scroll.in|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}</ref> By the end of the 10th century CE, the region was ruled by several [[Hindu Shahi]] kings who would be subdued by the [[Ghaznavids]].\n\nAbout 97% of [[Pakistanis]] are Muslims.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1809?_hi=1&_pos=1 |title=Pakistan, Islam in |accessdate=2010-08-29 |work=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]] |quote=Approximately 97 percent of Pakistanis are Muslim.

The tradition of visiting [[dargah]]s is still practiced today.  Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Data Ganj Baksh ([[Ali Hajweri]]) in [[Lahore]] (ca. 11th century), [[Sultan Bahoo]] in [[Shorkot]] [[Jhang]], [[Baha-ud-din Zakariya]] in [[Multan]] and [[Shahbaz Qalander]] in [[Sehwan]] (ca. 12th century) and [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai]] in [[Bhit]], Sindh and [[Rehman Baba]] in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province]]. The [[Urs]] (death anniversary) of Sufi saints accounts for the largest gathering upon their shrines held annually by the devotees. \n\nAlthough, popular Sufi culture is centered on Thursday night gatherings at shrines and annual festivals which feature Sufi music and dance, certain [[tariqa]]s such as [[Sarwari Qadiri|Sarwari Qadri Order]], refrain from such traditions and believe in paying visit to the shrines, making prayers or reciting [[manqabat]]. Moreover, contemporary Islamic fundamentalists also criticize the popular tradition of singing, dance and music, which in their view, does not accurately reflect the teachings and practice of the Prophet [[Mohammad]] and his companions. There have been terrorist attacks directed at Sufi shrines and festivals, five in 2010 that killed 64 people. Presently, the known [[tariqa]]s in Pakistan have maintained their organisations usually known as tehreeks and have their [[khanqah]]s for the [[dhikr]] of Allah, as per the old age Sufi tradition.<ref name=NYTSufivideo>{{cite news|title=Sufism Under attack in Pakistan|url=http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Produced by Charlotte Buchen|format=video|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528051803/http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/01/06/world/asia/1248069532117/sufism-under-attack-in-pakistan.html|archive-date=May 28, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=NYTAtWarSufi>{{cite news|title=The Islam That Hard-Liners Hate|url=http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/the-islam-that-hard-liners-hate/|accessdate=May 21, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2011|author=Huma Imtiaz|author2=Charlotte Buchen|format=blog}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Hazrat Sakhi Sultan|first1=Mohammad Najib ur Rehman|title=Visiting Shrines of Sufi Saints|publisher=Sultan ul Faqr Publications Regd|isbn=9789699795183|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlyMAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA337&dq=dawat+e+qaboor&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAGoVChMI4ejbuMTlyAIVghweCh2HyQNH#v=onepage&q=dawat%20e%20qaboor&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Quranists===\nMuslims who reject the authority of [[hadith]], known as [[Quranist]], Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in Pakistan.<ref>Ali Usman Qasmi, [http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta3/tft/article.php?issue=20130125&page=16 A mosque for Qurani Namaz], ''The Friday Times'', Retrieved February 16, 2013</ref> The largest [[Quranist]] organization in Pakistan is [[Ahle Quran]], followed by Bazm-e-Tolu-e-Islam.
