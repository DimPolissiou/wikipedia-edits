The Appalachian plants are classified as ''Magnolia fraseri'' var. ''fraseri,'' and the more coastal plants as ''M. fraseri'' var. ''pyramidata.''  These two kinds of magnolia are often recognized as distinct species, ''M. fraseri'' and ''M. pyramidata,'' respectively.\n\nFraser magnolia is a small, [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to 14&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) tall, as a basal-branching, fragrant plant, with brown [[Bark (botany)|bark]] with a \"warty\" or \"scaly\" texture. The [[leaf|leaves]] are quite large, 15\u201325&nbsp;cm (rarely up to 53&nbsp;cm) long and 8\u201318&nbsp;cm (rarely up to 29&nbsp;cm) broad, with a pair of [[leaf shape|auricles]] (or \"ear-lobes\") at the base and an entire margin; they are green above and glaucous blue-green below. The showy white [[flower]]s are 16\u201325&nbsp;cm in diameter with nine [[tepal]]s; they open in late spring or early summer, after the foliage. The [[fruit]] is a woody, oblong, cone-like structure (like all Magnolias) 6.5\u201312&nbsp;cm long, covered in small, pod-like follicles each containing one or two red seeds that hang out from the cone by a slender thread when ripe. A good seed crop occurs only about every 4\u20135 years. Reproduction is accomplished by both [[seed]] and [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative sprouts]]. The fruit is eaten by wildlife, helping disperse the seeds.\n\nThis tree grows best on rich, moist, well-drained soil. The very large showy white flowers and large-leaved, coarse-textured foliage make this an attractive [[ornamental plant|ornamental tree]], but otherwise it has little commercial value. It is sometimes cultivated in North America as a native alternative to exotic magnolias, and can be grown a considerable distance north of its natural range if given conditions favorable to its growth.\n\nThere are two [[variety (botany)|varieties]]:\n*''Magnolia fraseri'' var. ''fraseri'', native to the Appalachian Mountains.\n*''Magnolia fraseri'' var. ''pyramidata'' (Bartram) Pampanini, from the Coastal Plain. The vernacular name for this variety is '''Pyramid magnolia'''.\n\nThe [[bigleaf magnolia]] ''(Magnolia macrophylla)'' also has auriculate-lobed leaves.\n\nFraser Magnolia is named for the Scottish botanist [[John Fraser (botanist)|John Fraser]] (1750\u20131811), who collected extensively in the Appalachian Mountains.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"160\" heights=\"160\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Magnoliafraseri rt1.jpg|''M. fraseri'' in young forest, south of Spruce Knob, West Virginia, USA.\nFile:Magnoliafraseri rt2.jpg|''M. fraseri'' flower and foliage.

Combat Logistics Battalions' 22, 24, and 26 are tasked with providing the LCE for MEUs.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\nThe unit was activated 1 August 1944 at [[Pearl Harbor]] as Headquarters and Service Battalion, 8th Field Depot, Supply Service, [[Fleet Marine Force]], under the commanding officer 2ndLt Gordon McPherson. The unit participated in the [[Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign]], most notably, the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] from 19 February to 26 March 1945 providing logistics support to Marines on the front line. In April 1945, it was relocated to [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], Hawaii. The following September, the unit was reassigned to the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], and moved to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]], its current home. On 13 October 1950 it was re-designated as Headquarters and Service Battalion.\n\nOn 1 April 1951, the unit was reassigned to [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]], as a part of Force Service Regiment. Personnel and equipment from the battalion participated in the landings of the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]], and also provided support to mobilized troops during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in late 1962. \n\nThe unit provided relief in autumn 1978 to [[South Carolina]] and [[Puerto Rico]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]]. A month later, elements of the battalion would participate in the [[United States invasion of Panama]]. The following year, the unit would deploy to the Middle East for the [[Gulf War]], remaining for [[Operation Provide Comfort]] until July 1991. From November 1991 to October 1994, the group supported [[Haiti|Haitian]] refugee operations after the [[1991 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Disaster relief efforts from the unit supported [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], Florida after [[Hurricane Andrew]] in late 1992, then elements participated in [[Operation Provide Promise]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the summer of 1994.\n[[File:CLB_22.jpg|thumb|Marines from [[Combat Logistics Battalion 22]] practice fire techniques]]\nIn December 2002, the unit was sent to [[Kuwait]] for more local support, and would then participate in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and subsequent [[Iraq War]]. On 21 April 2006, the battalion was re-designated as Combat Logistics Regiment 27, 2d Marine Logistics Regiment. The regiment provided personnel and equipment for year-long deployment tours to support [[Multi-National Forces West]] in [[Al Anbar Governorate]]. The final deployment as a regiment was in [[Al Taqaddum]] where the unit served as 2d Marine Logistics Regiment Headquarters element, and the unit deployed for its last Iraq tour in January 2009.<ref name=\"2nd MLG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/main5/866FB76710D8C0BB852573E80030C43C?opendocument|title=2nd Marine Logistics Group (Forward) concludes yearlong deployment|last=Klay|first=1stLt Phillip W.|date=7 February 2008|work=Marine Corps News|publisher=United States Marine Corps|accessdate=8 February 2008}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 August 2014 the regiment was re-designated as Headquarters Regiment, and then was re-designated back to Combat Logistics Regiment 27 (CLR 27) on 1 October 2018.

The unit participated in the [[Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign]], most notably, the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] from 19 February to 26 March 1945 providing logistics support to Marines on the front line. In April 1945, it was relocated to [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], Hawaii. The following September, the unit was reassigned to the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd Marine Division]], and moved to [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]], its current home. On 13 October 1950 it was re-designated as Headquarters and Service Battalion.\n\nOn 1 April 1951, the unit was reassigned to [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]], as a part of Force Service Regiment. Personnel and equipment from the battalion participated in the landings of the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]], and also provided support to mobilized troops during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in late 1962. \n\nThe unit provided relief in autumn 1978 to [[South Carolina]] and [[Puerto Rico]] in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Hugo]]. A month later, elements of the battalion would participate in the [[United States invasion of Panama]]. The following year, the unit would deploy to the Middle East for the [[Gulf War]], remaining for [[Operation Provide Comfort]] until July 1991. From November 1991 to October 1994, the group supported [[Haiti|Haitian]] refugee operations after the [[1991 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Disaster relief efforts from the unit supported [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], Florida after [[Hurricane Andrew]] in late 1992, then elements participated in [[Operation Provide Promise]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the summer of 1994.\n[[File:CLB_22.jpg|thumb|Marines from [[Combat Logistics Battalion 22]] practice fire techniques]]\nIn December 2002, the unit was sent to [[Kuwait]] for more local support, and would then participate in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and subsequent [[Iraq War]]. On 21 April 2006, the battalion was re-designated as Combat Logistics Regiment 27, 2d Marine Logistics Regiment. The regiment provided personnel and equipment for year-long deployment tours to support [[Multi-National Forces West]] in [[Al Anbar Governorate]]. The final deployment as a regiment was in [[Al Taqaddum]] where the unit served as 2d Marine Logistics Regiment Headquarters element, and the unit deployed for its last Iraq tour in January 2009.<ref name=\"2nd MLG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usmc.mil/marinelink/mcn2000.nsf/main5/866FB76710D8C0BB852573E80030C43C?opendocument|title=2nd Marine Logistics Group (Forward) concludes yearlong deployment|last=Klay|first=1stLt Phillip W.|date=7 February 2008|work=Marine Corps News|publisher=United States Marine Corps|accessdate=8 February 2008}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 August 2014 the regiment was re-designated as Headquarters Regiment, and then was re-designated back to Combat Logistics Regiment 27 (CLR 27) on 1 October 2018.

He was a promoter and race car owner.\n\n== Early life ==\nAgajanian was born in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California]], just six months after his father had immigrated to the United States, with his entire family, including some cousins, out of war-torn [[Armenia]]. He grew up a hard-working young man in the family's refuse collection and hog ranching businesses, which Aggie would later oversee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2866.htm |title=Agajanian's Hog Farm |publisher=SCVhistory.com |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt 18, Agajanian had saved enough money to buy a race car. When he told his father that he was going to become a race car driver, the elder Agajanian's reaction was not what young Aggie had hoped. Looking at the car in the garage, his father said to J.C., \"So, you are going to be a race driver, that's fine. Just a few things I want you to do first. Go kiss your mother goodbye, pack your bags since you won't be living here anymore and while you're at it, change your name.\" \n\n== Promoting and racing life ==\nThe racing game was brutal in the 1930s. Drivers were dying almost every other week on the dirt ovals of Southern California and Agajanian's father understandably did not want his son to become another statistic. A compromise was settled upon: J.C. could keep the car, but only in the capacity of an owner. J.C. agreed and at 18 became perhaps one of the youngest car owners in automobile racing.\n\nWhile Agajanian never achieved his childhood dream of becoming a race driver, he did almost everything else, from promoting races to building cars and discovering drivers.\n\nWhile promoting a race under the blazing desert sun in Arizona, Agajanian purchased a [[Stetson]] cowboy hat to protect his head, and thereafter he was rarely seen without one.  His trademarks were his Stetson hat and high-heeled boots made especially for him in Spain.\n\nHe was the Armenian heir to a fortune built on pig farming and garbage collection. J.C. was partial to the number \"98\" and used the number on his [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], [[Sprint car racing|Sprint]] and [[Midget car racing|Midget]] cars, a tradition which has continued for generations in the family, including four Indianapolis 500 wins, including the ownership by J.C. in 1952 with driver Troy Ruttman and 1963 with driver Parnelli Jones and co-ownership by son Cary and business partner [[Mike Curb]] with Bryan Herta Autosports in 2011 with driver Dan Wheldon and 2016 with driver Alexander Rossi.\n\nHe was instrumental in the development of the air jack for faster tire changes at Indianapolis and in the 1930s was president of the Western Racing Association.\n\nHis race organizer expertise spanned the country and he became the first race organizer to present 250 [[United States Automobile Club]] events, ranging from Midget races like the traditional [[Turkey Night Grand Prix]] at various Southern California race tracks, still promoted by the family to this day, to numerous Championship [[Dirt track racing|Dirt Car races]] at state fairground tracks.\n\nFrom 1948 through 1971, his cars won three pole positions&nbsp;\u2013 the first with [[Walt Faulkner]] in 1950&nbsp;\u2013 for the [[Indianapolis 500]], set four track records and won the race twice. [[Troy Ruttman]] (1952) and [[Parnelli Jones]] (1963) both won the 500 in Agajanian machines.\n\nAgajanian also gained fame for a moment of quick thinking that may have saved victory for Parnelli Jones at Indianapolis in 1963. With the race in its waning stages and Scotsman Jim Clark closing on Jones, it became apparent that the Agajanian Willard Battery Special had developed a serious oil leak (something that USAC starter Harlan Fengler had specifically warned teams about in pre-race meetings). When Eddie Sachs crashed&nbsp;\u2013 allegedly in oil laid down by Jones' number 98&nbsp;\u2013 Agajanian rushed up to the starter and argued that the leak was stopped, because it had dropped below the level of the crack. By this time, Lotus team owner Colin Chapman had joined the confrontation, demanding that Fengler back up his threat to disqualify cars leaking oil. By the time Jones came around again, the argument was settled. Agajanian's car stayed in the lead, and held it to the end. Chapman and the Lotus engine builder [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] were furious over the result which remains controversial to this day, although they declined to protest as Jones' car (nicknamed \"Calhoun\") had been the fastest in the race. Many experts believe that USAC officials were biased against Clark and the rear engine Lotus, and that had it been an American driving a roadster in second place at the time Jones would have been black flagged.\n\nHe died on May 5, 1984 in [[Gardena, California]].\n\n==Family & Legacy==\n\nWhen he died, J.C. left behind his wife, [http://asbarez.com/56421/los-angeles-born-armenian-hazel-faye-agajanian-dies-at-93/ Hazel Faye Agajanian], their four children, [https://massispost.com/2018/01/joan-agajanian-quinn-honored-armenian-international-womens-association/ Joan Agajanian Quinn](John J), JC Agajanian Jr.(Franci), Cary Agajanian (Judy), Christopher James Agajanian (Laura), 11 grandchildren, his yougest sister Jacqueline Agajanian Cardelucci, and his NFL star brother [[Ben Agajanian]]. \n\nCary Agajanan is an attorney and partner at Agajanian, McFall, Weiss, Tetreault, & Crist LLP in the Los Angeles area who is also a co-owner of the motorsport operations of J.C.'s team, now known as [[Curb-Agajanian Performance Group]] with legendary musician and fellow Californian [[Mike Curb]]. The CAPG won the Indianapolis 500 as co-entrants, in [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]] and [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]] with [[Bryan Herta Autosport]]. J.C.

He was a promoter and race car owner.\n\n== Early life ==\nAgajanian was born in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California]], just six months after his father had immigrated to the United States, with his entire family, including some cousins, out of war-torn [[Armenia]]. He grew up a hard-working young man in the family's refuse collection and hog ranching businesses, which Aggie would later oversee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2866.htm |title=Agajanian's Hog Farm |publisher=SCVhistory.com |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt 18, Agajanian had saved enough money to buy a race car. When he told his father that he was going to become a race car driver, the elder Agajanian's reaction was not what young Aggie had hoped. Looking at the car in the garage, his father said to J.C., \"So, you are going to be a race driver, that's fine. Just a few things I want you to do first. Go kiss your mother goodbye, pack your bags since you won't be living here anymore and while you're at it, change your name.\" \n\n== Promoting and racing life ==\nThe racing game was brutal in the 1930s. Drivers were dying almost every other week on the dirt ovals of Southern California and Agajanian's father understandably did not want his son to become another statistic. A compromise was settled upon: J.C. could keep the car, but only in the capacity of an owner. J.C. agreed and at 18 became perhaps one of the youngest car owners in automobile racing.\n\nWhile Agajanian never achieved his childhood dream of becoming a race driver, he did almost everything else, from promoting races to building cars and discovering drivers.\n\nWhile promoting a race under the blazing desert sun in Arizona, Agajanian purchased a [[Stetson]] cowboy hat to protect his head, and thereafter he was rarely seen without one.  His trademarks were his Stetson hat and high-heeled boots made especially for him in Spain.\n\nHe was the Armenian heir to a fortune built on pig farming and garbage collection. J.C. was partial to the number \"98\" and used the number on his [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], [[Sprint car racing|Sprint]] and [[Midget car racing|Midget]] cars, a tradition which has continued for generations in the family, including four Indianapolis 500 wins, including the ownership by J.C. in 1952 with driver Troy Ruttman and 1963 with driver Parnelli Jones and co-ownership by son Cary and business partner [[Mike Curb]] with Bryan Herta Autosports in 2011 with driver Dan Wheldon and 2016 with driver Alexander Rossi.\n\nHe was instrumental in the development of the air jack for faster tire changes at Indianapolis and in the 1930s was president of the Western Racing Association.\n\nHis race organizer expertise spanned the country and he became the first race organizer to present 250 [[United States Automobile Club]] events, ranging from Midget races like the traditional [[Turkey Night Grand Prix]] at various Southern California race tracks, still promoted by the family to this day, to numerous Championship [[Dirt track racing|Dirt Car races]] at state fairground tracks.\n\nFrom 1948 through 1971, his cars won three pole positions&nbsp;\u2013 the first with [[Walt Faulkner]] in 1950&nbsp;\u2013 for the [[Indianapolis 500]], set four track records and won the race twice. [[Troy Ruttman]] (1952) and [[Parnelli Jones]] (1963) both won the 500 in Agajanian machines.\n\nAgajanian also gained fame for a moment of quick thinking that may have saved victory for Parnelli Jones at Indianapolis in 1963. With the race in its waning stages and Scotsman Jim Clark closing on Jones, it became apparent that the Agajanian Willard Battery Special had developed a serious oil leak (something that USAC starter Harlan Fengler had specifically warned teams about in pre-race meetings). When Eddie Sachs crashed&nbsp;\u2013 allegedly in oil laid down by Jones' number 98&nbsp;\u2013 Agajanian rushed up to the starter and argued that the leak was stopped, because it had dropped below the level of the crack. By this time, Lotus team owner Colin Chapman had joined the confrontation, demanding that Fengler back up his threat to disqualify cars leaking oil. By the time Jones came around again, the argument was settled. Agajanian's car stayed in the lead, and held it to the end. Chapman and the Lotus engine builder [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] were furious over the result which remains controversial to this day, although they declined to protest as Jones' car (nicknamed \"Calhoun\") had been the fastest in the race. Many experts believe that USAC officials were biased against Clark and the rear engine Lotus, and that had it been an American driving a roadster in second place at the time Jones would have been black flagged.\n\nHe died on May 5, 1984 in [[Gardena, California]].\n\n==Family & Legacy==\n\nWhen he died, J.C. left behind his wife, [http://asbarez.com/56421/los-angeles-born-armenian-hazel-faye-agajanian-dies-at-93/ Hazel Faye Agajanian], their four children, [https://massispost.com/2018/01/joan-agajanian-quinn-honored-armenian-international-womens-association/ Joan Agajanian Quinn](John J), JC Agajanian Jr.(Franci), Cary Agajanian (Judy), Chrisotpher James Agajanian (Laura), 11 grandchildren, his yougest sister Jacqueline Agajanian Cardelucci, and his NFL star brother [[Ben Agajanian]]. \n\nCary Agajanan is an attorney and partner at Agajanian, McFall, Weiss, Tetreault, & Crist LLP in the Los Angeles area who is also a co-owner of the motorsport operations of J.C.'s team, now known as [[Curb-Agajanian Performance Group]] with legendary musician and fellow Californian [[Mike Curb]].
