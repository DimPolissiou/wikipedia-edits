{"title_page": "1998\u201399 OHL season", "text_new": "The '''1998\u201399 OHL season''' was the 19th season of the [[Ontario Hockey League]]. The [[Brampton Battalion]] and the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] were added as expansion teams. The league realigned from three divisions into two conferences and four divisions. Brampton were placed in the Midwest division of the Western conference, and Mississauga were placed in the Central division of the Eastern conference. The OHL inaugurated four new trophies this season. The [[Holody Trophy]] was created for the regular season champion of the Midwest division. Two conference playoffs champions were created; the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] for the Eastern conference, and the [[Wayne Gretzky Trophy]] for the Western conference. The fourth new trophy was the [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], to be awarded to the MVP of the playoffs. Twenty teams each played sixty-eight games. The [[Belleville Bulls]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[London Knights]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Brampton Battalion===\nOn December 3, 1996, the [[Brampton Battalion]] was granted an expansion franchise owned by [[Scott Abbott]]. The team began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion's arena was the newly constructed [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]].\n\nBrampton played in their first game on September 24, 1998, losing 5-1 to the [[Peterborough Petes]] on the road. Their first home game was on October 9, as the Battalion dropped a 5-1 decision to the [[Kitchener Rangers]] in front of a sold out crowd of 4,800 at the [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]]. After beginning the season with six losses, Brampton won their first game, defeating the [[Sudbury Wolves]] 5-4 on October 18.\n\n===Mississauga IceDogs===\nOn January 21, 1997, the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] was granted an expansion franchise which included former [[Boston Bruins]] head coach [[Don Cherry]] in their ownership group.

In their home opener on October 30, Mississauga recorded their first win in franchise history, defeating the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] 4-3 in front of a sold out of 6,000 fans at the [[Hershey Centre]].\n\n==Realignment==\nWith the [[Brampton Battalion]] and [[Mississauga IceDogs]] joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1998-99 season, the league underwent a massive realignment in which two new conferences, the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, were created. Within each conference was two five-team divisions. The playoff format changed that the top eight teams in each conference made the post-season.\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====East Division====\nThe East Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[Belleville Bulls]], [[Kingston Frontenacs]], [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Ottawa 67's]], and [[Peterborough Petes]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] left the division, joining the Central Division.\n\n====Central Division====\nThe Central Division underwent some major changes following the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] division. The [[Barrie Colts]], [[North Bay Centennials]] and [[Sudbury Wolves]] remained in the division, however, the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]], and [[Owen Sound Platers]] all left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division in the Western Conference. Joining the Central were the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] from the East Division, and the expansion [[Mississauga IceDogs]].\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Midwest Division====\nThe Midwest Division was a newly created division in the Western Conference. Joining the division were the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]] and [[Owen Sound Platers]] from the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] joined from the West Division. The expanion [[Brampton Battalion]] also joined the division.\n\n====West Division====\nThe West Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[London Knights]], [[Plymouth Whalers]], [[Sarnia Sting]], [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] and [[Windsor Spitfires]]. The [[Erie Otters]] left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division.\n\n==New Arena==\n===Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre===\nThe [[Sarnia Sting]] moved from the [[Sarnia Arena]] to their new home, the [[Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre]].

The [[Brampton Battalion]] and the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] were added as expansion teams. The league realigned from three divisions into two conferences and four divisions. Brampton were placed in the Midwest division of the Western conference, and Mississauga were placed in the Central division of the Eastern conference. The OHL inaugurated four new trophies this season. The [[Holody Trophy]] was created for the regular season champion of the Midwest division. Two conference playoffs champions were created; the [[Bobby Orr Trophy]] for the Eastern conference, and the [[Wayne Gretzky Trophy]] for the Western conference. The fourth new trophy was the [[Wayne Gretzky 99 Award]], to be awarded to the MVP of the playoffs. Twenty teams each played sixty-eight games. The [[Belleville Bulls]] won the [[J. Ross Robertson Cup]], defeating the [[London Knights]].\n\n==Expansion==\n===Brampton Battalion===\nOn December 3, 1996, the [[Brampton Battalion]] was granted an expansion franchise owned by [[Scott Abbott]]. The team began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The Battalion's arena was the newly constructed [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]].\n\nBrampton played in their first game on September 24, 1998, losing 5-1 to the [[Peterborough Petes]] on the road. Their first home game was on October 9, as the Battalion dropped a 5-1 decision to the [[Kitchener Rangers]] in front of a sold out crowd of 4,800 at the [[Brampton Centre for Sports & Entertainment|Brampton Centre]]. After beginning the season with six losses, Brampton won their first game, defeating the [[Sudbury Wolves]] 5-4 on October 18.\n\n===Mississauga IceDogs===\nOn January 21, 1997, the [[Mississauga IceDogs]] was granted an expansion franchise which included former [[Boston Bruins]] head coach [[Don Cherry]] in their ownership group. The IceDogs began play in the 1998-99 season, playing in the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The IceDogs arena was the newly constructed [[Hershey Centre]].\n\nThe IceDogs played in their first game on September 25, 1998, losing a road game to the [[Kingston Frontenacs]] by a score of 10-0. Mississauga began the season with an 11 game road trip, as the club lost each game. In their home opener on October 30, Mississauga recorded their first win in franchise history, defeating the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] 4-3 in front of a sold out of 6,000 fans at the [[Hershey Centre]].\n\n==Realignment==\nWith the [[Brampton Battalion]] and [[Mississauga IceDogs]] joining the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1998-99 season, the league underwent a massive realignment in which two new conferences, the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, were created. Within each conference was two five-team divisions. The playoff format changed that the top eight teams in each conference made the post-season.\n\n===Eastern Conference===\n\n====East Division====\nThe East Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[Belleville Bulls]], [[Kingston Frontenacs]], [[Oshawa Generals]], [[Ottawa 67's]], and [[Peterborough Petes]]. The [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] left the division, joining the Central Division.\n\n===Central Division====\nThe Central Division underwent some major changes following the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] division. The [[Barrie Colts]], [[North Bay Centennials]] and [[Sudbury Wolves]] remained in the division, however, the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]], and [[Owen Sound Platers]] all left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division in the Western Conference. Joining the Central were the [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] from the East Division, and the expansion [[Mississauga IceDogs]].\n\n===Western Conference===\n\n====Midwest Division====\nThe Midwest Division was a newly created division in the Western Conference. Joining the division were the [[Guelph Storm]], [[Kitchener Rangers]] and [[Owen Sound Platers]] from the Central Division, while the [[Erie Otters]] joined from the West Division. The expanion [[Brampton Battalion]] also joined the division.\n\n====West Division====\nThe West Division consisted of five teams that played in the division during the [[1997-98 OHL season|1997-98]] season. The teams were the [[London Knights]], [[Plymouth Whalers]], [[Sarnia Sting]], [[Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds]] and [[Windsor Spitfires]]. The [[Erie Otters]] left the division, joining the newly formed Midwest Division.\n\n==New Arena==\n===Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre===\nThe [[Sarnia Sting]] moved from the [[Sarnia Arena]] to their new home, the [[Sarnia Sports & Entertainment Centre]]. The Sting defeated the [[Kitchener Rangers] 5-2 in their first game at their new home on September 25, 1998 in front of a sold out crowd of 4,635 fans.\n\n==Regular Season==\n===Final standings===\n''Note: DIV = Division; GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; OTL = Overtime Losses; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against; PTS = Points; x = clinched playoff berth; y = clinched division title; z = clinched conference title''\n\n=== Eastern conference ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! | Rank\n! width=\"27.5%\"| Team\n! |DIV\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"6.5%\"| W\n! width=\"6.5%\"| L\n! | T\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Barrie Colts]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 49 || 13 || 6 || '''104''' || 343 || 192\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| y-[[Ottawa 67's]] || align=left| East || 68 || 48 || 13 || 7 || '''103''' || 305 || 164\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Belleville Bulls]] || align=left| East || 68 || 39 || 22 || 7 || '''85''' || 334 || 246\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Oshawa Generals]] || align=left| East || 68 || 39 || 24 || 5 || '''83''' || 280 || 217\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[Peterborough Petes]] || align=left| East || 68 || 40 || 26 || 2 || '''82''' || 266 || 213\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| x-[[Sudbury Wolves]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 25 || 35 || 8 || '''58''' || 261 || 288\n|-\n| 7 || align=left| x-[[North Bay Centennials]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 22 || 40 || 6 || '''50''' || 215 || 248\n|-\n| 8 || align=left| x-[[Kingston Frontenacs]] || align=left| East || 68 || 22 || 42 || 4 || '''48''' || 240 || 320\n|- style=\"background-color:#cccccc;\"\n| || || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n| 9 || align=left| [[Toronto St. Michael's Majors]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 20 || 42 || 6 || '''46''' || 214 || 316\n|-\n| 10 || align=left| [[Mississauga IceDogs]] || align=left| Central || 68 || 4 || 61 || 3 || '''11''' || 145 || 426\n|}\n\n=== Western conference ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! | Rank\n! width=\"27.5%\"| Team\n! |DIV\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GP\n! width=\"6.5%\"| W\n! width=\"6.5%\"| L\n! | T\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GF\n! width=\"6.5%\"| GA\n|-\n| 1 || align=left| z-[[Plymouth Whalers]] || align=left| West || 68 || 51 || 13 || 4 || '''106''' || 313 || 162\n|-\n| 2 || align=left| x-[[Guelph Storm]] || align=left| Midwest || 68 || 44 || 22 || 2 || '''90''' || 300 || 218\n|-\n| 3 || align=left| x-[[Owen Sound Platers]] || align=left| Midwest || 68 || 39 || 24 || 5 || '''83''' || 312 || 293\n|-\n| 4 || align=left| x-[[Sarnia Sting]] || align=left| West || 68 || 37 || 25 || 6 || '''80''' || 279 || 216\n|-\n| 5 || align=left| x-[[London Knights]] || align=left| West || 68 || 34 || 30 || 4 || '''72''' || 260 || 217\n|-\n| 6 || align=left| x-[[Sault Ste.

The oldest parts of the church date from the last quarter of the 12th century, and the last major addition was the disproportionately large [[chancel]], built during the second quarter of the 14th century by a workshop known by its [[notname]] as {{ill|Egypticus|sv}}. The workshop was also responsible for constructing the largest of the church portals, which is also decorated with Gothic stone sculpture. The tower portal contains sculptures attributed to the Romanesque sculptor [[Sigraf]]. The church has been little altered since the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. Lye Church contains the largest preserved set of medieval [[stained glass]] windows in the [[Nordic countries]], and its interior is also decorated by medieval wall paintings, uncovered in the 1950s. The [[altarpiece]] is from 1496, and the church also contains a [[triumphal cross]] from the same period.\n\n==Location and surroundings==\nLye Church is located {{circa}} {{convert|300|m|yd}} south of the main road between [[Hemse]] and [[Ljugarn]], on south-eastern Gotland.<ref name=kyrkomiljon>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/miljo/visaBeskrivning.raa?miljoId=21220000011736&page=beskrivning|title=Gotland kn, Lye kyrka kyrkomilj\u00f6, Gotland|publisher=Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet ([[Swedish National Heritage Board]])|language=Swedish|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> The church lies surrounded by its old [[cemetery]].

The difference between the bases of the tower and the northern nave wall still indicate where the break was made.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=36}} The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] chancel and [[sacristy]] were built during the second quarter of the 14th century and replaced an earlier chancel, built at the same time as the nave.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8, 37}}{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pages=196\u2013198}} They were built by a workshop operating on Gotland which has been assigned the notname Egypticus.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=38}}<ref name=raa/> The [[portal (architecture)|portal]] of the former chancel was removed and reinstated in its present position as north entrance to the nave.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=35}} The intention was probably to also rebuild the nave, but this was never done. The walls connecting the chancel and nave are still the provisional, thin walls without a marked base which were built in anticipation of further changes.{{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pages=196\u2013198}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=37}}\n\n===Later changes===\nThe decorated wooden ceiling dates from the 18th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31}} The three windows of the nave probably all date from the 1850s and replaced earlier, much smaller windows.<ref name=raa/>{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=23}} A major renovation of the interior of the church was carried out in 1891. The floors of the chancel and nave were renewed, and the [[pew]]s replaced with new ones. The [[altar rail]] was replaced, as was the [[Organ (music)|organ facade]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=38\u201339}} Central heating was installed in 1932.<ref name=raa/> In 1939, the presently visible roof of the tower was installed, modeled after an earlier roof possibly designed by architect [[Olof Tempelman]] and dating from 1779.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=27\u201329}} Tempelman's designs were probably executed by builder Hans Hesselby, who also constructed the roof of the tower at [[Ala Church]] in 1780. The earlier roof may have resembled those at [[Garde Church|Garde]] or [[Burs Church|Burs]] churches.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=29}} Another large-scale renovation was done in 1954\u201355 under the guidance of architects {{ill|Erik Fant|sv}} and {{ill|Olle Karth|sv}}.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=39}} The main structural change was that the walls of the nave were heightened {{circa}} {{convert|1|m|ft}} with the dual purpose of exposing the top part of the arch connecting the chancel with the nave, and installing a modern, fire-proof ceiling above the wooden ceiling.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=39}} The walls of the nave and chancel were at the same time cleaned, and the medieval paintings found under layers of [[whitewash]] restored. Wall paintings from the 18th century were removed, and some of the furnishings renovated.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=41}} The exterior was renovated and the presently visible roofs put in place in 1968.<ref name=raa/>\n\n==Architecture==\n===Exterior===\n[[File:Fiestras na torre da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|One of the Romanesque galleries of the tower from the outside]]\nThe building material of Lye Church is mainly grey, tufted [[limestone]]. The exterior is whitewashed. A few details are made of [[brick]] and of limestone of a different colour. The portals, bases and skirtings around some of the windows are of dressed limestone, as are the corners of the chancel and tower.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}} In broad outlines, the nave and tower are Romanesque in style while the chancel is Gothic. The disproportionate aspect of the church is derived from the fact that the rebuilding of the church during the Middle Ages was never finished, hence the later and larger chancel dominates the east end of the church. The shape, not uncommon among churches on Gotland, has been compared to that of a [[pack saddle]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}}\n\nThe tower is the most well-preserved Romanesque part of the church.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=24}} On the north and south side of the first storey there are galleries accessible from inside the tower, each with two openings in the form of [[round arches]] separated by a small column. The outer [[archivolt]]s of these openings are made of alternating limestone and brick, an unusual construction material on Gotland during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=25}} The upper level contains the [[church bell]], which dates from 1650 and was made in [[Stockholm]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=89}} There are three openings for the bell on each side of the square tower. All of them with have round arches and each opening is divided in two by a central, wooden column.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=27}}\n\n====Portals====\n[[File:Relieve no portal da torre da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|Romanesque frieze immured in the tower portal]]\n[[File:Capiteis do portal do coro da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|The western capitals of the chancel portal, depicting the Adoration of the Magi (left) and the Massacre of the Innocents]]\nThe church has four entrance portals. Three of these are [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]: the western entrance in the base of the tower, the northern entrance to the nave and the southern entrance to the nave.the chancel portal is larger and more profusely decorated.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pages=196\u2013198}} \n\nThe tower portal has a round outer arch which consists of alternating red and grey limestone; the inner arch is made of grey, roughly hewn limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} Immured as part of the southern post is a  decorated stone [[sarcophagus]], which may originally have been intended as a grave or a [[reliquary]].{{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}} It has been roughly adjusted to fit into the church wall.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} The exposed sides are decorated with figures in low [[relief]]. The short side facing the door depicts the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] enthroned while the long side, facing the exterior, depicts scenes which have been interpreted as (from left to right) two [[legendary creature]]s fighting, two [[dragon]]s or possible one dragon with two heads, a warrior with armour and weapons, and a horse.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} It has been suggested that the subject matter depicted is the story of [[Sigurd]] slaying the dragon [[Fafnir]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=14}} The reliefs date from the 12th century and have been attributed to the Romanesque artist or workshop [[Sigraf]] (''[[floruit|floruit]]'' {{circa}} 1175\u20131210){{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=15}}<ref name=raa/>{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}\n\nThe northern portal of the nave is the smallest entrance to the church. Its round arched opening is constructed of alternating blocks of limestone and [[sandstone]]. It appears to not be original to its position and may have been removed from the earlier, demolished chancel to its present location during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=15}}\n\nThe southern portal of the nave is constructed of alternating red and grey limestone. Its inner section consists of two pillars of convex cubic form supporting a round arch.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}}\n\nThe chancel portal is the largest of the entrances, and Gothic in style. It is a comparatively richly decorated, pointed arch crowned by a [[wimperg]] made of grey and red limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=16}} The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is decorated with sculpted flowers, and the capitals of the nested columns each contain a set of sculptures with the overarching theme being the childhood of Christ. The sculpted eastern capitals show, from left to right, the [[Annunciation]], the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Christ]], and the [[annunciation to the shepherds]]. The western capitals contain scenes showing, from left to right, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. The wimperg above the portal depicts Christ enthroned, with one hand raised in a blessing and the other resting on a book.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=17}} The sculptures are unusually well preserved, and a few of the figures still contain faint traces of original colour (black, red, and green).{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=20}}<ref name=paint>{{cite journal |last1= Nord|first1= Anders G.|last2= Tronner|first2= Kate|date= 2014|title= F\u00e4rganalys av fem gotlandskyrkors portaler och muralm\u00e5lningar [Analyses of paint from portals and murals in five Medieval churches on Gotland]|url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/7834/2014_118.pdf|journal= Fornv\u00e4nnen.

The westernmost room is the ground floor of the tower. It is a broad, [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] room that opens toward the nave with a wide arch. The nave is rectangular, with a flat, wooden ceiling. The chancel is relatively large and high, lacks an [[apse]], and has a vaulted ceiling.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=30\u201331}} The nave and chancel are connected by a pointed limestone arch.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31}} The sacristy ceiling is supported by a [[groin vault]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=30}} There are three [[niche (architecture)|niches]] in the walls of the chancel. Of the two in the northern wall, one is most probably a medieval [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] with still original doors and flanked by two immured limestone capitals, probably also made by Egypticus.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31\u201332}} The other niche on the same wall consists of three compartments and its doors probably date from the 1891 renovation.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=32\u201333}} On the same wall is the entrance to the sacristy, between a simple [[trefoil]]-shaped portal of limestone. In the church floor there are also several medieval gravestones, including one made for a local man called Jakob, who according to the inscription was killed by a cannonball while participating in a siege of [[Eric of Pomerania]] at [[Visborg|Visborg castle]] in the outskirts of [[Visby]] in 1449.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|p=198}} The walls of the church also contain a number of carvings in the surface of the wall, made in historic times. These include some pictorial, depicting among the subjects a [[Troy Town]] and 15th-century ships, as well as around 40 [[runes|runic inscriptions]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=56}} As late as 2018, an earlier unknown runic inscription was discovered in the church; although its meaning remains unclear, it may be a [[profanity]].<ref name=helagotlan>{{cite web |url= https://www.helagotland.se/kulturnoje/fult-ord-ovantat-fynd-i-kyrka-15392828.aspx|title= Fult ord ov\u00e4ntat fynd i kyrka|last= Thomsson|first= Cecilia|date= 23 December 2018|website= |publisher= Hela Gotland|access-date= 14 March 2020|language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n====Wall paintings====\n{{See also|Church murals in Sweden}}\nThe interior of Lye Church is decorated with medieval wall paintings from three separate periods. The paintings were covered with layers of whitewash during the 18th century exposed and renovated during the church renovation in the 1950s.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=42}} The oldest set of paintings date from {{circa}} 1350 and decorate the chancel vault and its northern wall with large-scale figures. The paintings on the northern wall have been supplemented with other paintings from the 15th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=42\u201343}} The second set of paintings date from around 1450 and adorn the walls of both the nave and the chancel. They depict the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion of Christ]] as well as scenes from [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legends of saints]] and individual saints within frames imitating architecture. These were made by the [[Master of the Passion of Christ]] or that workshop.{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|p=198}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=43}} The third set of paintings date from the second quarter of the 16th century and encompass two scenes on the southern wall of the nave.

The northern half of the window contains scenes from the childhood of Christ until the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]], and the southern half scenes from the Passion until the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]]. The two windows on each side of the middle window, as well as the window in the southern wall of the chancel, contains depictions of individual saints and purely ornamental window panes.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=197}}\n\nThe windows are in a High Gothic style, the figures depicted as slim and delicate, with loose clothes and rhythmically curly hair and beards.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=198}} The overall composition is airy, with few overlaps between the different elements. The colours are dominated by the blue of the background and the red bands that separate the figures;{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=198}} the windows are comparatively paler and cooler in colour than earlier stained glass windows on Gotland.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=98}} The overall impression has been described by art historian [[Johnny Roosval]] as \"incense for the eye\".{{sfn|Roosval|1950|p=46}}\n\nIt has been suggested that the glass windows were made by a workshop active in Visby.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=51}} Johnny Roosval argued that the main stylistic influences for the windows in Lye came from [[English Gothic architecture|English Gothic]], while {{ill|Aron Andersson|sv|Aron Andersson (konsthistoriker)}} instead argued that the main influences came from northern Germany.{{sfn|Andersson|1964|p=99\u2013107}}\n\n==Furnishings==\n[[File:Gotland-Lye kyrka 06.jpg|thumb|right|View towards the chancel.

The oldest parts of the church date from the last quarter of the 12th century, and the last major addition was the disproportionately large [[chancel]], built during the second quarter of the 14th century by a workshop known by its [[notname]] as {{ill|Egypticus|sv}}. The workshop was also responsible for constructing the largest of the church portals, which is also decorated with Gothic stone sculpture. The tower portal contains sculptures attributed to the Romanesque sculptor [[Sigraf]]. The church has been little altered since the end of the [[Middle Ages]]. Lye Church contains the largest preserved set of medieval [[stained glass]] windows in the [[Nordic countries]], and its interior is also decorated by medieval wall paintings, uncovered in the 1950s. The [[altarpiece]] is from 1496, and the church also contains a [[triumphal cross]] from the same period.\n\n==Location and surroundings==\nLye Church is located {{circa}} {{convert|300|m|yd}} south of the main road between [[Hemse]] and [[Ljugarn]], on south-eastern Gotland.<ref name=kyrkomiljon>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/miljo/visaBeskrivning.raa?miljoId=21220000011736&page=beskrivning|title=Gotland kn, Lye kyrka kyrkomilj\u00f6, Gotland|publisher=Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet ([[Swedish National Heritage Board]])|language=Swedish|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> The church lies surrounded by its old [[cemetery]].

The earlier roof may have resembled those at [[Garde Church|Garde]] or [[Burs Church|Burs]] churches.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=29}} Another large-scale renovation was done in 1954\u201355 under the guidance of architects {{ill|Erik Fant|sv}} and {{ill|Olle Karth|sv}}.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=39}} The main structural change was that the walls of the nave were heightened {{circa}} {{convert|1|m|ft}} with the dual purpose of exposing the top part of the arch connecting the chancel with the nave, and installing a modern, fire-proof ceiling above the wooden ceiling.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=39}} The walls of the nave and chancel were at the same time cleaned, and the medieval paintings found under layers of [[whitewash]] restored. Wall paintings from the 18th century were removed, and some of the furnishings renovated.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=41}} The exterior was renovated and the presently visible roofs put in place in 1968.<ref name=raa/>\n\n==Architecture==\n===Exterior===\n[[File:Fiestras na torre da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|One of the Romanesque galleries of the tower from the outside]]\nThe building material of Lye Church is mainly grey, tufted [[limestone]]. The exterior is whitewashed. A few details are made of [[brick]] and of limestone of a different colour. The portals, bases and skirtings around some of the windows are of dressed limestone, as are the corners of the chancel and tower.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}} In broad outlines, the nave and tower are Romanesque in style while the chancel is Gothic. The disproportionate aspect of the church is derived from the fact that the rebuilding of the church during the Middle Ages was never finished, hence the later and larger chancel dominates the east end of the church. The shape, not uncommon among churches on Gotland, has been compared to that of a [[pack saddle]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}}\n\nThe tower is the most well-preserved Romanesque part of the church.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=24}} On the north and south side of the first storey there are galleries accessible from inside the tower, each with two openings in the form of [[round arches]] separated by a small column. The outer [[archivolt]]s of these openings are made of alternating limestone and brick, an unusual construction material on Gotland during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=25}} The upper level contains the [[church bell]], which dates from 1650 and was made in [[Stockholm]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=89}} There are three openings for the bell on each side of the square tower. All of them with have round arches and each opening is divided in two by a central, wooden column.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=27}}\n\n====Portals====\n[[File:Relieve no portal da torre da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|Romanesque frieze immured in the tower portal]]\n[[File:Capiteis do portal do coro da igrexa de Lye.jpg|thumb|right|The western capitals of the chancel portal, depicting the Adoration of the Magi (left) and the Massacre of the Innocents]]\nThe church has four entrance portals. Three of these are [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]: the western entrance in the base of the tower, the northern entrance to the nave and the southern entrance to the nave.the chancel portal is larger and more profusely decorated.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pages=196\u2013198}} \n\nThe tower portal has a round outer arch which consists of alternating red and grey limestone; the inner arch is made of grey, roughly hewn limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} Immured as part of the southern post is a  decorated stone [[sarcophagus]], which may originally have been intended as a grave or a [[reliquary]].{{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}} It has been roughly adjusted to fit into the church wall.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} The exposed sides are decorated with figures in low [[relief]]. The short side facing the door depicts the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Madonna]] enthroned while the long side, facing the exterior, depicts scenes which have been interpreted as (from left to right) two [[legendary creature]]s fighting, two [[dragon]]s or possible one dragon with two heads, a warrior with armour and weapons, and a horse.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=12}} It has been suggested that the subject matter depicted is the story of [[Sigurd]] slaying the dragon [[Fafnir]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=14}} The reliefs date from the 12th century and have been attributed to the Romanesque artist or workshop [[Sigraf]] (''[[floruit|floruit]]'' {{circa}} 1175\u20131210){{sfn|Svahnstr\u00f6m|1973|p=206\u2013208}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=15}}<ref name=raa/>{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}\n\nThe northern portal of the nave is the smallest entrance to the church. Its round arched opening is constructed of alternating blocks of limestone and [[sandstone]]. It appears to not be original to its position and may have been removed from the earlier, demolished chancel to its present location during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=15}}\n\nThe southern portal of the nave is constructed of alternating red and grey limestone. Its inner section consists of two pillars of convex cubic form supporting a round arch.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=8}}\n\nThe chancel portal is the largest of the entrances, and Gothic in style. It is a comparatively richly decorated, pointed arch crowned by a [[wimperg]] made of grey and red limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=16}} The [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is decorated with sculpted flowers, and the capitals of the nested columns each contain a set of sculptures with the overarching theme being the childhood of Christ. The sculpted eastern capitals show, from left to right, the [[Annunciation]], the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]], the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth of Christ]], and the [[annunciation to the shepherds]]. The western capitals contain scenes showing, from left to right, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] and the [[Massacre of the Innocents]]. The wimperg above the portal depicts Christ enthroned, with one hand raised in a blessing and the other resting on a book.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=17}} The sculptures are unusually well preserved, and a few of the figures still contain faint traces of original colour (black, red, and green).{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=20}}<ref name=paint>{{cite journal |last1= Nord|first1= Anders G.|last2= Tronner|first2= Kate|date= 2014|title= F\u00e4rganalys av fem gotlandskyrkors portaler och muralm\u00e5lningar [Analyses of paint from portals and murals in five Medieval churches on Gotland]|url= http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/7834/2014_118.pdf|journal= Fornv\u00e4nnen.

The westernmost room is the ground floor of the tower. It is a broad, [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] room that opens toward the nave with a wide arch. The nave is rectangular, with a flat, wooden ceiling. The chancel is relatively large and high, lacks an [[apse]], and has a vaulted ceiling.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=30\u201331}} The nave and chancel are connected by a pointed limestone arch.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31}} The sacristy ceiling is supported by a [[groin vault]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=30}} There are three [[niche (architecture)|niches]] in the walls of the chancel. Of the two in the northern wall, one is most probably a medieval [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] with still original doors and flanked by two immured limestone capitals, probably also made by Egypticus.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=31\u201332}} The other niche on the same wall consists of three compartments and its doors probably date from the 1891 renovation.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=32\u201333}} On the same wall is the entrance to the sacristy, between a simple [[trefoil]]-shaped portal of limestone. In the church floor there are also several medieval gravestones, including one made for a local man called Jakob, who according to the inscription was killed by a cannonball while participating in a siege of [[Eric of Pomerania]] at [[Visborg|Visborg castle]] in the outskirts of [[Visby]] in 1449.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|p=198}} The walls of the church also contain a number of carvings in the surface of the wall, made in historic times.

They depict the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion of Christ]] as well as scenes from [[Legendary material in Christian hagiography|legends of saints]] and individual saints within frames imitating architecture. These were made by the [[Master of the Passion of Christ]] or that workshop.{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|p=198}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1965|p=43}} The third set of paintings date from the second quarter of the 16th century and encompass two scenes on the southern wall of the nave.

It served as the lead single for her third [[studio album]], ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010). The song features verses from rapper [[Snoop Dogg]]. Both artists co-wrote the song with [[Bonnie McKee]] and its co-producers [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]], with additional production from [[Benny Blanco]]. According to Perry, \"California Gurls\" is an [[answer song]] to \"[[Empire State of Mind]]\" (2009), by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Alicia Keys]].  Its midtempo production incorporates disco-pop and funk-pop with influences of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[electropop]]. Its lyrics are an ode to the state of California, in which both Perry and Snoop Dogg were born and raised.\n\n\"California Gurls\" garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with the majority of them labeling it a \"summer anthem\",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/weekly-us-music-releases-katy-perry-usher-eels-and-fantasia-2059960.html|title=Weekly US music releases: Katy Perry, Usher, Eels, and Fantasia|work=[[The Independent]]|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref> as well as complimenting its production and chorus. Originally intended to be sent to [[contemporary hit radio|mainstream]] and [[rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] airplay on May 25, 2010, the song debuted on May 7, 2010, after clips from the ''Teenage Dream'' album were leaked online. It was subsequently released to [[iTunes]] on May 11, 2010 as the album's lead single. The song was a worldwide success, peaking at number-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for six consecutive weeks, giving Perry her second US number-one single in and Snoop Dogg his third. The song also reached number-one in ten other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nA [[music video]] for the song was released on June 15, 2010, and features Perry and her dancers as pieces of a board game, set in the fictional \"Candyfornia\". Perry has said that the inspiration behind the video was artist [[Will Cotton]], who was also the artistic director of the video. It has been noted that the video is influenced by several other works, including ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and the board game ''[[Candyland]]''. On December 2, 2010, the song received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]].

The settings are inspired in part by ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and the board game [[Candy Land]], with much of the set decorated with [[cupcake]]s, [[ice cream]]s, [[cotton candy]], and [[lollipop]]s. [[Snoop Dogg]] appears in the video as a king named \"Sugar Daddy\" that is holding several young women (Queens of Candyfornia) captive throughout the game, using candy related devices to hold them. Perry moves around, experimenting with objects. She moves through the land, making discoveries and freeing the women. In the chorus, she appears lying down on a cotton candy cloud, naked. Snoop Dogg tries to block her advances in many ways. When all the women are free, Perry leads them in a dance on the beach. Seeing the women freed, \"Sugar Daddy\" becomes enraged, marching on the women's position with an army of [[gummi bear|gummy bears]]. Perry, dressed in a red [[Wonder Woman]] like costume, quickly defeats the army with whip cream guns attached to her breasts, after which the stunned king throws down his staff and surrenders. The video ends with \"Sugar Daddy\" buried up to his neck in the sand by the women, nonetheless admiring their beauty and (in a nod to the [[California Girls|Beach Boys song]]) wishing that women everywhere could be California girls. Various California landmarks appear in the video, such as the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the [[Hollywood Sign]] and some [[List of California beaches|West Coast beaches]] which were all made out of confectionery.<ref>{{YouTube|F57P9C4SAW4|Katy Perry \u2013 California Gurls ft.

It served as the lead single for her third [[studio album]], ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010). The song features verses from rapper [[Snoop Dogg]]. Both artists co-wrote the song with [[Bonnie McKee]] and its co-producers [[Dr. Luke]] and [[Max Martin]], with additional production from [[Benny Blanco]]. According to Perry, \"California Gurls\" is an [[answer song]] to \"[[Empire State of Mind]]\" (2009), by [[Jay-Z]] and [[Alicia Keys]].  Its midtempo production incorporates disco-pop and funk-pop with influences of [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[electropop]]. Its lyrics are an ode to the state of California, in which both Perry and Snoop Dogg were born and raised.\n\n\"California Gurls\" garnered positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with the majority of them labeling it a \"summer anthem\",<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/weekly-us-music-releases-katy-perry-usher-eels-and-fantasia-2059960.html|title=Weekly US music releases: Katy Perry, Usher, Eels, and Fantasia|work=[[The Independent]]|date=August 23, 2010|accessdate=August 21, 2015}}</ref> as well as complimenting its production and chorus. Originally intended to be sent to [[contemporary hit radio|mainstream]] and [[rhythmic contemporary|rhythmic]] airplay on May 25, 2010, the song debuted on May 7, 2010, after clips from the ''Teenage Dream'' album were leaked online. It was subsequently released to [[iTunes]] on May 11, 2010 as the album's lead single. The song was a worldwide success, peaking at number-one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for six consecutive weeks, giving Perry her second US number-one single in and Snoop Dogg his third. The song also reached number-one in ten other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.\n\nA [[music video]] for the song was released on June 15, 2010, and features Perry and her dancers as pieces of a board game, set in the fictional \"Candyfornia\". Perry has said that the inspiration behind the video was artist [[Will Cotton]], who was also the artistic director of the video. It has been noted that the video is influenced by several other works, including ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and the board game ''[[Candyland]]''. On December 2, 2010, the song received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]]. In 2012, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' ranked the song number one on a special [[Billboard (magazine)|The 30 Summer Songs of All Time]] listing.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Snoop Dogg on Stage.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Perry found Snoop Dogg as a rapper with whom to collaborate on \"California Gurls\" through a search on Wikipedia.]]\nIn an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Perry's A&R at the time, [[Chris Anokute]], said that while travelling back from an Oscar after-party Perry [[texted]] him to say she did not think the album was finished and that it needed one more song.

The settings are inspired in part by ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', and the board game [[Candy Land]], with much of the set decorated with [[cupcake]]s, [[ice cream]]s, [[cotton candy]], and [[lollipop]]s. [[Snoop Dogg]] appears in the video as a king named \"Sugar Daddy\" that is holding several young women (Queens of Candyfornia) captive throughout the game, using candy related devices to hold them. Perry moves around, experimenting with objects. She moves through the land, making discoveries and freeing the women. In the chorus, she appears lying down on a cotton candy cloud, naked. Snoop Dogg tries to block her advances in many ways. When all the women are free, Perry leads them in a dance on the beach. Seeing the women freed, \"Sugar Daddy\" becomes enraged, marching on the women's position with an army of [[gummi bear|gummy bears]]. Perry, dressed in a red [[Wonder Woman]] like costume, quickly defeats the army with whip cream guns attached to her breasts, after which the stunned king throws down his staff and surrenders. The video ends with \"Sugar Daddy\" buried up to his neck in the sand by the women, nonetheless admiring their beauty and (in a nod to the [[California Girls|Beach Boys song]]) wishing that women everywhere could be California girls. Various California landmarks appear in the video, such as the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], the [[Hollywood Sign]] and some [[List of California beaches|West Coast beaches]] which were all made out of confectionery.<ref>{{YouTube|F57P9C4SAW4|Katy Perry \u2013 California Gurls ft.
