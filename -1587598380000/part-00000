{"title_page": "Dynamical theory of diffraction", "text_new": "The '''dynamical theory of diffraction''' describes the interaction of [[wave]]s with a regular lattice. The wave fields traditionally described are [[X-rays]], [[neutron radiation|neutron]]s or [[electrons]] and the regular lattice, atomic crystal structures or nanometer scaled multi-layers or self arranged systems. In a wider sense, similar treatment is related to the interaction of light with optical band-gap materials or related wave problems in acoustics.\n[[Image:LaueBraggGeometry.png|thumb|right|250px|Laue and Bragg geometries, top and bottom, as distinguished by the Dynamical theory of diffraction with the Bragg diffracted beam leaving the back or front surface of the crystal, respectively.

The flat top of the peak in Bragg geometry is the so-called [[Darwin Plateau]]. ([http://liss.freeshell.org/kdl/DissLiss/ Ref.])]]\n\n==Principle of theory==\nThe dynamical theory of diffraction considers the wave field in the periodic potential of the crystal and takes into account all multiple scattering effects. Unlike the [[Diffraction formalism|kinematic theory of diffraction]] which describes the approximate position of [[Bragg diffraction|Bragg]] or [[X-ray crystallography|Laue diffraction]] peaks in [[reciprocal space]], dynamical theory corrects for refraction, shape and width of the peaks, extinction and interference effects. Graphical representations are described in [[dispersion surfaces]] around reciprocal lattice points which fulfill the boundary conditions at the crystal interface.\n\n==Outcomes==\n* The crystal potential by itself leads to [[refraction]] and [[specular reflection]] of the waves at the interface to the crystal and delivers the [[refractive index]] off the Bragg reflection. It also corrects for refraction at the Bragg condition and combined Bragg and specular reflection in grazing incidence geometries.\n* A Bragg reflection is the splitting of the dispersion surface at the border of the [[Brillouin zone]] in reciprocal space. There is a gap between the dispersion surfaces in which no travelling waves are allowed. For a non-absorbing crystal, the reflection curve shows a range of [[total reflection]], the so-called [[Darwin plateau]]. Regarding the quantum mechanical [[energy]] of the system, this leads to the [[band gap]] structure which is commonly well known for electrons.\n* Upon Laue diffraction, intensity is shuffled from the forward diffracted beam into the Bragg diffracted beam until extinction. The diffracted beam itself fulfills the Bragg condition and shuffles intensity back into the primary direction. This round-trip period is called the ''[[Pendell\u00f6sung]]'' period.\n* The '''extinction length''' is related to the ''[[Pendell\u00f6sung]]'' period. Even if a crystal is infinitely thick, only the crystal volume within the extinction length contributes considerably to the diffraction in [[Bragg geometry]].\n* In [[Laue geometry]], beam paths lie within the [[Borrmann triangle]]. [[Kato fringes]] are the intensity patterns due to ''[[Pendell\u00f6sung]]'' effects at the exit surface of the crystal.\n* [[Anomalous absorption]] effects take place due to a [[standing wave]] patterns of two wave fields. Absorption is stronger if the standing wave has its anti-nodes on the lattice planes, i.e. where the absorbing atoms are, and weaker, if the anti-nodes are shifted between the planes. The standing wave shifts from one condition to the other on each side of the [[Darwin plateau]] which gives the latter an asymmetric shape.\n\n==Applications==\n* [[X-ray diffraction]]\n* [[Neutron diffraction]]\n* [[Electron diffraction]] and [[transmission electron microscopy]]\n* Structure determination in [[crystallography]]\n* [[grazing incidence diffraction]]\n* [[X-ray standing waves]]\n* [[neutron interferometry|neutron]] and [[X-ray interferometry]].\n* synchrotron crystal optics\n* neutron and X-ray [[diffraction topography]]\n* [[Radiography|X-ray imaging]]\n* [[Crystal monochromator]]s\n* [[Electronic band structure]]s\n\n==See also==\n*[[Volume hologram]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n* J.

According to some of his students, his technique revolved around long, [[legato]] notes, with very little shifting noise from his left hand, resulting in smooth, pure tones, \"each note sounding like a jewel.\" Starker himself described his sound as \"centered\" and \"focused.\" He was known for his ability to produce an extremely wide range of sounds and tone shading. He eschewed the wide vibrato favored by some of his peers\u2014which he viewed as a cover for poor intonation\u2014and was known for his patrician stage presence, preferring to let the music do the emoting.

His two older brothers were violinists, and the young J\u00e1nos (named for the hospital ''Szent J\u00e1nos k\u00f3rh\u00e1z'' [lit. ''St. John's Hospital''] in which he was born) was given a cello before his sixth birthday. A child prodigy, Starker made his first public performances at ages six and seven. He entered the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] in [[Budapest]] to study with [[Adolf Schiffer]] and made his debut there at age 11.

He eschewed the wide vibrato favored by some of his peers\u2014which he viewed as a cover for poor intonation\u2014and was known for his patrician stage presence, preferring to let the music do the emoting.

The move came about as a result of the growing number of churches and ministries purchasing ATS literature in Texas. The leaders of American Tract Society also discovered that it would be cost effective to have the ATS office in Texas.\n\nThe ever-increasing advances in technology and social media present both challenges and opportunities for ATS in disseminating its message. Over the years ATS has developed a number of ways to present the gospel in a relevant and timely manner. ATS continues to develop new tools to communicate Christian teachings to the next generation.\n\nThrough its international division (International Tract Society) ATS has approximately 136 print partners in 70 countries who print and distribute tracts in over 100 languages. The goal is to provide ATS print partners with the necessary resources and funding to print and distribute evangelism tools among disadvantaged churches and evangelists worldwide.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Rorabaugh, W.J.

The move came about as a result of the growing number of churches and ministries purchasing ATS literature in Texas. The leaders of American Tract Society also discovered that it would be cost effective to have the ATS office in Texas.\n\nThe ever-increasing advances in technology and social media present both challenges and opportunities for ATS in disseminating its message. Over the years ATS has developed a number of ways to present the gospel in a relevant and timely manner. ATS continues to develop new tools to communicate Christian teachings to the next generation.\n\nThrough its international division (International Tract Society) ATS has approximately 136 print partners in 70 countries who print and distribute tracts in over 100 languages. The goal is to provide ATS print partners with the necessary resources and funding to print and distribute evangelism tools among disadvantaged churches and evangelists worldwide.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Rorabaugh, W.J.

When at [[bar (establishment)|drinking establishments]], they either abstain from drinking or consume non-alcoholic beverages such as tea, coffee, water, juice, and [[soft drink]]s.\n\nContemporary and [[colloquial]] usage has somewhat expanded teetotalism to include strict abstinence from most \"recreational\" [[intoxicants]] (legal and illegal, see [[controlled substances]]). Most teetotaller organizations also demand from their members that they do not promote or produce alcoholic intoxicants.\n\n===Pleasure===\n{{Further|Work-life balance}}\nA general abstinence from pleasures or [[leisure]], either partial or full, may be motivated by ambition, [[career]] or general self-respect (excluding the point of view that even the latter examples may be regarded as sources of pleasure).\n\nIt is widely accepted that abstinence from [[drug addiction|addictive drugs]] gives successful outcome.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} However, it is not certain whether a general abstinence from pleasures of leisure yields higher productivity. Too much work generates [[Stress (biological)|stress]] and its potential adverse effects. Furthermore, the effort itself to achieve abstinence may consume willpower from its ultimate purpose. Total abstinence from pleasure or leisure is practically impossible and instead an individual [[work-life balance]] is necessary.\n\n===Sexual abstinence===\n{{main|Sexual abstinence}}\n\n===Organizations===\n*[[Alcoholics Anonymous]]\n*[[Narcotics Anonymous]]\n*[[Pagans in Recovery]]\n*[[Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust]] (RAPT)\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Abstinence (psychoanalysis)]]\n* [[Anatta]]\n* [[Asceticism]]\n* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]]\n* [[Self-denial]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Abstinence}}\n*{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Abstinence |short=x}}\n*{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Abstinence |short=x}}\n{{Wiktionary|Wikisaurus:celibate}}\n\n{{sex}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Asceticism]]\n[[Category:Drug rehabilitation]]\n[[Category:Twelve-step programs]]\n", "name_user": "2601:243:4101:bbc0:55d2:a921:975c:bce2", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAbstinence in religion)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstinence"}
