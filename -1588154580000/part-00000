He asked to get out (of Atlanta) and he went to a team that he obviously approved of and had some success. They went to the (2007 Stanley Cup) finals.

It sure doesn't show a good team attitude.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> Graham Snyder, father of Dan Snyder, played a significant role in helping Heatley avoid prison time after the crash that killed his son. He was confused by Heatley's decision to force a trade from Ottawa, saying \"I'm surprised because he signed a long-term deal (with Ottawa) and was playing in a market that seemed to embrace him.\" Snyder said there were \"a lot of ways\" Heatley could have dealt with the decision by Clouston to reduce his playing time and bump him down to the second power-play unit, rather than demanding a trade. \"Certainly, (talking with Clouston) behind the scenes would be a lot more effective, and trying to work through it.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> An Atlanta Thrashers' employee cryptically told the [[Vancouver Sun]] \"We know Dany very well.

Further complicating matters was the partial no-trade clause in Heatley's contract which limited the number of teams Ottawa could negotiate a potential deal with. A trade was worked out to send Heatley to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in exchange for [[Andrew Cogliano]], [[Dustin Penner]] and [[Ladislav \u0160m\u00edd]] on June 30, 2009, but Heatley again surprised the hockey world when he refused to waive the no-trade clause which would have finalized the deal, further angering fans in both Ottawa and Edmonton.<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> NHL Deputy Commissioner [[Bill Daly]] suggested that the Senators may have grounds to file a grievance, as Heatley's contract stipulated the team pay a bonus (due July 1, 2009) of US$4 million. The Edmonton trade would have spared the Senators that expense.\n\nAs Ottawa GM Murray began again to try to accommodate the trade demand, Heatley was still a member of the Senators as the team opened training camp on September 12, 2009. Heatley had little choice but to report for training camp, and the atmosphere between him and his Senators' teammates was described as \"awkward\", \"tense\", and \"untenable\". Team captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] admitted days earlier that a scenario in which Heatley showed up in Ottawa as an unhappy camper would create a massive media headache for the rest of the team. \"If he comes back there's going to be a lot of focus and attention,\" Alfredsson said at the time, adding \"If somebody hits him in practice or something occurs, everything is going to get blown out proportion.\" Heatley himself snuck back into [[Scotiabank Place]], avoiding the cameras and throng of media awaiting some clarification regarding his desire to leave Ottawa. \"When I looked (Heatley) in the eye, I knew the minute he walked out the door that I had to trade him,\" GM Bryan Murray said a short time later. \"I didn\u2019t think there was any chance.

The Sharks were eliminated in the 2010 Conference Finals as, with Dany Heatley in the penalty box, the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] scored the game-winning goal, sweeping the series. However, Head Coach [[Todd McLellan]] revealed that Heatley had been playing the entire playoffs with a torn groin muscle.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, in his first return to Ottawa, Heatley was frequently booed. Though he had said that the city of Ottawa and the fans there had nothing to do with his desire to be moved, Senators fans were in no mood to forgive. Several fans who attended the game held up their #15 Heatley jerseys with certain letters covered up, so the name plate would spell out the word \"H-A-T-E\". Late in the game, a group of 10 fans came down to ice level and simultaneously threw their Heatley jerseys onto the ice in a coordinated protest.

He asked to get out (of Atlanta) and he went to a team that he obviously approved of and had some success. They went to the (2007 Stanley Cup) finals.

It sure doesn't show a good team attitude.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> Graham Snyder, father of Dan Snyder, played a significant role in helping Heatley avoid prison time after the crash that killed his son. He was confused by Heatley's decision to force a trade from Ottawa, saying \"I'm surprised because he signed a long-term deal (with Ottawa) and was playing in a market that seemed to embrace him.\" Snyder said there were \"a lot of ways\" Heatley could have dealt with the decision by Clouston to reduce his playing time and bump him down to the second power-play unit, rather than demanding a trade. \"Certainly, (talking with Clouston) behind the scenes would be a lot more effective, and trying to work through it.\"<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> An Atlanta Thrashers' employee cryptically told the [[Vancouver Sun]] \"We know Dany very well.

Further complicating matters was the partial no-trade clause in Heatley's contract which limited the number of teams Ottawa could negotiate a potential deal with. A trade was worked out to send Heatley to the [[Edmonton Oilers]] in exchange for [[Andrew Cogliano]], [[Dustin Penner]] and [[Ladislav \u0160m\u00edd]] on June 30, 2009, but Heatley again surprised the hockey world when he refused to waive the no-trade clause which would have finalized the deal, further angering fans in both Ottawa and Edmonton.<ref name=\"vancouversun.com\" /> NHL Deputy Commissioner [[Bill Daly]] suggested that the Senators may have grounds to file a grievance, as Heatley's contract stipulated the team pay a bonus (due July 1, 2009) of US$4 million. The Edmonton trade would have spared the Senators that expense.\n\nAs Ottawa GM Murray began again to try to accommodate the trade demand, Heatley was still a member of the Senators as the team opened training camp on September 12, 2009. Heatley had little choice but to report for training camp, and the atmosphere between him and his Senators' teammates was described as \"awkward\", \"tense\", and \"untenable\". Team captain [[Daniel Alfredsson]] admitted days earlier that a scenario in which Heatley showed up in Ottawa as an unhappy camper would create a massive media headache for the rest of the team. \"If he comes back there's going to be a lot of focus and attention,\" Alfredsson said at the time, adding \"If somebody hits him in practice or something occurs, everything is going to get blown out proportion.\" Heatley himself snuck back into [[Scotiabank Place]], avoiding the cameras and throng of media awaiting some clarification regarding his desire to leave Ottawa. \"When I looked (Heatley) in the eye, I knew the minute he walked out the door that I had to trade him,\" GM Bryan Murray said a short time later. \"I didn\u2019t think there was any chance.

However, Head Coach [[Todd McLellan]] revealed that Heatley had been playing the entire playoffs with a torn groin muscle.\n\nOn December 2, 2010, in his first return to Ottawa, Heatley was frequently booed.

Several fans who attended the game held up their #15 Heatley jerseys with certain letters covered up, so the name plate would spell out the word \"H-A-T-E\". Late in the game, a group of 10 fans came down to ice level and simultaneously threw their Heatley jerseys onto the ice in a coordinated protest.

The song was released on 19 March 2019, as the band's debut single. Tamna Tamna is the most covered [[Manipuri]] song on [[Youtube]].\n\n== Music video ==\nAn official music video of Tamna Tamna was released onto Youtube on 19 March 2019 at a total length of nine minutes fifty eight seconds on Studio Dominance channel. The music video is directed by Edwin Haorokcham.\n\nThe story takes place in 1990s, in the small town of [[Manipur]], [[India]]. Tamna Tamna depicts the event of the devastating serial terror attacks in Manipur by an international terrorist group called O.W.L. At the same time, Texas plays as a photographer who is in a relationship with a painter plays by Prinalini Thingom. One day, the photographer finds a [[135 film]] format which he later learns that his girlfriend is part of the O.W.L group which was planning the serial attacks in [[Imphal]] city. He discovers [[Kangla Palace]] to be the next bombing location so he finally decides to take the matter in his own hand and ends the girl's life to save thousands and also to liberates her from the brutal torture and maltreatment of arm forces which was well-known at that time in the north-east region of India.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* Texas as the photographer\n* Prinalini Thingom as the painter/O.W.L informant\n* Niranjoy Luwangcha as O.W.L member\n* Shrikant Chingangbam as the news reader\n\n== Music video production <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://e-pao.net/epSubPageExtractor.asp?src=leisure.Rock_Concert.The_Tamna_Tamna_Video_Critical_Analysis_and_Dissection_By_Ningombam_Captain|title=The Tamna Tamna Video (Critical Analysis and Dissection)|last=Captain|first=Ningombam|date=20 May 2019|website=E-Pao|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Texas,_Prinalini_and_Edwin.jpg|alt=|thumb|''Texas, Prinalini Thingom'' and ''Edwin Haorokcham'' during the production of '''Tamna Tamna'''.

Edwin contacted and teamed up with Ratan Sapam at Studio Dominance to work on the project with Uchek Society. [[Location scouting]] began in early 2019 with the band members. The textures of the wall in every indoor locations were the main concern during the scouting. After finalising the location, Edwin approached the lead actor Texas from a mutual friend and met at [[Porompat]] to discuss the project. Prinalini Thingom was discovered by Edwin from Instagram who turns out to be a daughter of a well-known Manipuri film actor Pritam Thingom. Edwin stated \"the video was based in 1990s because it was the most crucial years of the arms conflict in Manipur\". O.W.L is a fictional group created by Edwin for the music video.

The fossils included evidence of [[cephalopod arm|arm]]s, muscles, rows of suckers, [[cephalopod ink|ink]], and internal gills. The discovery was made by a team led by Dirk Fuchs of the [[Freie University]], which is located at Berlin, Germany.<ref name=msnbc>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29757659 Rare fossil octopuses found], NBC News, March 18, 2009</ref> The fossils were found at Hakel and Hadjoula, [[Lebanon]].<ref name=palaeontology>[https://archive.today/20120902073936/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/121596620/HTMLSTART  New Octopus from the late Cretaceous of Hakel and Hadjoula, Lebanon], Palaeontology, Volume 52, Issue 1, Pages 65-81</ref> Various new ammonoid taxa were named, including ''[[Ivoites]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\"\n|- \n!

At the [[Somosierra]] mountain pass, 60 miles north of Madrid, a heavily outnumbered Spanish detachment of conscripts and [[artillery]] under [[Benito de San Juan]] aimed to block Napoleon's advance on the Spanish capital. Napoleon overwhelmed the Spanish positions in a [[combined arms]] attack, sending the [[uhlan|Polish]] ''[[Chevau-l\u00e9gers]]'' of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]] at the Spanish guns while French infantry advanced up the slopes. The victory removed the last obstacle barring the road to Madrid, which fell several days later.\n\n==Background==\nBy late November 1808 the French ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' had overwhelmed and destroyed both wings of the [[Military history of Spain|Spanish popular army]]. To complete his reconquest of Spain, Napoleon advanced on Madrid with 40,000 men. General San Juan mustered an ad hoc army of [[militia]], reservists and various regular regiments still reeling from earlier defeats \u2013 in all about 12,000 men \u2013 to defend Madrid. In order to screen the many approaches to the city, San Juan dispersed his already greatly outnumbered forces. Under his orders, 9,000 men were sent west to guard the Guadarrama pass while 3,000 occupied an advanced post at [[Sep\u00falveda, Segovia|Sepulveda]], leaving only 9,000 men and 16 guns on the heights of Somosierra. The nature of the terrain and the tenacity of the Spaniards initially worked in their favor. On the evening of November 29 the brigade at Sepulveda repulsed a French attack, inflicted heavy casualties and escaped from overwhelming French numbers in the gathering darkness to the west. The following morning Napoleon advanced his infantry directly toward the pass while small detachments crept up the flanks. Exchanging musket volleys with the defenders, the French made slow but measurable progress toward the enemy guns.\n\n==Battle==\nBecause the Spanish forces could not easily be outflanked by infantry movement, and Napoleon was impatient to proceed, he ordered his [[Polish cavalry|Polish ''Chevaux-L\u00e9gers'']] escort squadron of 125 men{{efn|Unit registers showed that the squadron numbered 125.}} to charge the Spaniards and their fortified artillery batteries. To that number must be added members of other squadrons, totaling some 450 men{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but these entered the battle later. The charge of 125 against the batteries was joined by Niegolewski's platoon returning from reconnaissance. It is not clear, however, whether the number included only front-line troops (''sabres'') or all the soldiers in the units. Napoleon issued no written orders. [[Jan Kozietulski]], who commanded the 3rd squadron that day, mentioned that he called, \"''Lekka jazda k\u0142usem!''\" (\"Light cavalry at the [[trot (horse gait)|trot]]!\") and, passing the little bridge, added, \"''En avant, Vive l'Empereur!''\" (Forward, long live the Emperor''!''\")[[File:Battle of Somosierra by Piotr Micha\u0142owski.PNG|thumb|''Battle of Somosierra'' by [[Piotr Micha\u0142owski]]|left]]Some authors <ref name=\"regan\">Geoffrey Regan, ''Great military blunders'' {{ISBN|978-0-7522-1844-1}}</ref> have assumed that Napoleon had gone out of his mind in ordering the Poles to charge batteries of 16 cannon over several kilometers of extremely difficult terrain. Others,<ref name=\"bielecki\">Robert Bielecki, ''Somosierra 1808''Warszawa: Wydawnictwa Ministerstwa Obrony Narodowej, 1989. {{ISBN|83-11-07620-0}}</ref> however, think Napoleon ordered only the closest battery to be taken, in order to open the way for his infantry, and that Kozietulski had misunderstood the order. No matter \u2013 once the charge had begun, and the ''chevaux-l\u00e9gers'' found themselves under fire from the second battery, they had no choice but to press the attack, as the horses went to the highest speed and were unable to stop. They took the second and third batteries but only a few chevaux-l\u00e9gers reached the last battery, and the Spanish attempted to recapture it. It was then that Napoleon saw his chance and immediately committed the other squadrons.\n\nBenito de San Juan had 16 cannon at his disposal, arranged in four batteries. Some accounts, based mostly on recollections of French officers, assume that the Spaniards placed all their guns at the peak of Somosierra pass. However, with a range of 600\u2013800 metres, the cannons, deployed in this fashion, could not have struck much of the French army&mdash;and there were reports that Napoleon himself was at times under artillery fire. The first battery defended the entrance to the Somosierra pass, the next two covered the pass at its angles and the fourth, only, stood by the heights. It was assumed that all batteries had four cannons, and later theories that the pass was too narrow for that to be possible should be treated as legends.\n13th Bulletin of the Army of Spain mentioned that chevau-l\u00e9gers were commanded by Gen. [[Louis Pierre, Count Montbrun]]. However, both Polish charge participants mentioned above and Lt. Col. [[Pierre Dautancourt]], one of the French tutors of the unit, stressed in their accounts that such was not the case. Datancourt mentioned that Montbrun in conversations with him had laughed at that idea. Yet French historian [[Adolphe Thiers]] gave him the honor of leading the charge, which caused a protest by surviving Polish participants of the battle. Maj. [[Philippe de S\u00e9gur]] in his memoirs wrote that he had commanded the charge, but his accounts were often described as unreliable and, again, both Dautancourt and the Poles denied his role in it.\n[[File:January Suchodolski, Bitwa pod Somosierr\u0105.jpg|thumb|''Somosierra'', by [[January Suchodolski]], 1860]]\nThe charge was led by Kozietulski, but he lost his horse after taking the first battery. The squadron was then joined by Lt. [[Andrzej Niegolewski]], who had previously been on reconnaissance with his soldiers. The charge was continued under Dziewanowski, and when he fell from his horse after taking the third battery he was replaced by [[Piotr Krasi\u0144ski]]. The charge that continued to the last battery was led by Niegolewski, who miraculously survived a fierce attack by Spanish troops \u2013 he received nine wounds from bayonets and two carbine shots to the head.\n\nAccording to many memoirs of veterans of the battle, Kozietulski led his men in a charge with the official cry ''Vive l'Empereur''. However, popular legend has it that the true battle cry was the Polish ''Naprz\u00f3d psiekrwie, Cesarz patrzy'' \u2013 ''Forward, you sons of dogs, the Emperor is watching''.<ref name=\"Nieuwa\u017cny\">{{cite journal | author =Andrzej Nieuwa\u017cny  |date=May 2006 | title =Najpi\u0119kniejsza z szar\u017c (The Most Beautiful of Cavalry charges) | journal = [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] | volume = 123 | issue = 2006-05-27|language=pl}} Cf. [[Pierre Cambronne|word of Cambronne]]</ref>\n\nWhen the fourth battery was taken Napoleon ordered his [[Chasseurs of the Guard]] and the 1st squadron of Poles led by [[Tomasz \u0141ubie\u0144ski]] to resume the attack and drive the Spaniards from the Pass. \u0141ubie\u0144ski tried to give himself the whole glory, minimizing the role of the third squadron (while Niegolewski tried to show that he had taken the cannons and \u0141ubie\u0144ski had therefore had it easy, as the Spanish were shooting at him \"with candies\").\n\n== Charge effects ==\n[[File:WKossak025.jpg|left|thumb|''The Charge'', part of an unfinished panorama of the battle by [[Wojciech Kossak]] and [[Micha\u0142 Wywi\u00f3rski]]]]\nThe 13th bulletin of the Army of Spain mentioned the lead role of the Polish chevaux-l\u00e9gers. Only a cavalry charge was able to take all four batteries, even if French infantry was close enough to press their attack, and caused the en-masse retreat of Spanish [[Andalusia]]n irregular [[militia]] and, in effect, the retreat of the whole army. Spanish artillerymen preferred to die rather than abandon their position \u2013 but no Polish account mentioned any fight with Spanish militia. Militiamen just left their position after seeing how seemingly easily the Poles took the artillery positions \u2013 however, in the smoke they could not see just how few Poles were on the top.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1808.jpg|thumb|''Surrender of Madrid'', by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], 1810, oil on canvas.

Although the victory at Somosierra was more accurately the result of a combined infantry and cavalry attack, with the infantry bearing the heavier fighting, later accounts \u2013 Napoleon's included \u2013 placed all the emphasis on the Polish charge. San Juan was later killed by his own men.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/entre18091810/campanas/la-intervencion-de-napoleon-y-la-primera-campana-inglesa/batalla-de-somosierra#TOC-Muerte-del-general-Benito-San-Juan|title=Batalla de Somosierra - Entre 1809-1810|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref> French patrols reached the outskirts of Madrid on the 1 December.

It was then that Napoleon saw his chance and immediately committed the other squadrons.\n\nBenito de San Juan had 16 cannon at his disposal, arranged in four batteries. Some accounts, based mostly on recollections of French officers, assume that the Spaniards placed all their guns at the peak of Somosierra pass. However, with a range of 600\u2013800 metres, the cannons, deployed in this fashion, could not have struck much of the French army&mdash;and there were reports that Napoleon himself was at times under artillery fire. The first battery defended the entrance to the Somosierra pass, the next two covered the pass at its angles and the fourth, only, stood by the heights. It was assumed that all batteries had four cannons, and later theories that the pass was too narrow for that to be possible should be treated as legends.\n13th Bulletin of the Army of Spain mentioned that chevau-l\u00e9gers were commanded by Gen. [[Louis Pierre, Count Montbrun]]. However, both Polish charge participants mentioned above and Lt. Col. [[Pierre Dautancourt]], one of the French tutors of the unit, stressed in their accounts that such was not the case. Datancourt mentioned that Montbrun in conversations with him had laughed at that idea. Yet French historian [[Adolphe Thiers]] gave him the honor of leading the charge, which caused a protest by surviving Polish participants of the battle. Maj. [[Philippe de S\u00e9gur]] in his memoirs wrote that he had commanded the charge, but his accounts were often described as unreliable and, again, both Dautancourt and the Poles denied his role in it.\n[[File:January Suchodolski, Bitwa pod Somosierr\u0105.jpg|thumb|''Somosierra'', by [[January Suchodolski]], 1860]]\nThe charge was led by Kozietulski, but he lost his horse after taking the first battery. The squadron was then joined by Lt. [[Andrzej Niegolewski]], who had previously been on reconnaissance with his soldiers. The charge was continued under Dziewanowski, and when he fell from his horse after taking the third battery he was replaced by [[Piotr Krasi\u0144ski]]. The charge that continued to the last battery was led by Niegolewski, who miraculously survived a fierce attack by Spanish troops \u2013 he received nine wounds from bayonets and two carbine shots to the head.\n\nAccording to many memoirs of veterans of the battle, Kozietulski led his men in a charge with the official cry ''Vive l'Empereur''. However, popular legend has it that the true battle cry was the Polish ''Naprz\u00f3d psiekrwie, Cesarz patrzy'' \u2013 ''Forward, you sons of dogs, the Emperor is watching''.<ref name=\"Nieuwa\u017cny\">{{cite journal | author =Andrzej Nieuwa\u017cny  |date=May 2006 | title =Najpi\u0119kniejsza z szar\u017c (The Most Beautiful of Cavalry charges) | journal = [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] | volume = 123 | issue = 2006-05-27|language=pl}} Cf. [[Pierre Cambronne|word of Cambronne]]</ref>\n\nWhen the fourth battery was taken Napoleon ordered his [[Chasseurs of the Guard]] and the 1st squadron of Poles led by [[Tomasz \u0141ubie\u0144ski]] to resume the attack and drive the Spaniards from the Pass. \u0141ubie\u0144ski tried to give himself the whole glory, minimizing the role of the third squadron (while Niegolewski tried to show that he had taken the cannons and \u0141ubie\u0144ski had therefore had it easy, as the Spanish were shooting at him \"with candies\").\n\n== Charge effects ==\n[[File:WKossak025.jpg|left|thumb|''The Charge'', part of an unfinished panorama of the battle by [[Wojciech Kossak]] and [[Micha\u0142 Wywi\u00f3rski]]]]\nThe 13th bulletin of the Army of Spain mentioned the lead role of the Polish chevaux-l\u00e9gers. Only a cavalry charge was able to take all four batteries, even if French infantry was close enough to press their attack, and caused the en-masse retreat of Spanish [[Andalusia]]n irregular [[militia]] and, in effect, the retreat of the whole army. Spanish artillerymen preferred to die rather than abandon their position \u2013 but no Polish account mentioned any fight with Spanish militia. Militiamen just left their position after seeing how seemingly easily the Poles took the artillery positions \u2013 however, in the smoke they could not see just how few Poles were on the top.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Capitulation de Madrid, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1808.jpg|thumb|''Surrender of Madrid'', by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], 1810, oil on canvas. Madrid fell in the aftermath of Somosierra.]]\nSan Juan raced his army back to Madrid. Although the victory at Somosierra was more accurately the result of a combined infantry and cavalry attack, with the infantry bearing the heavier fighting, later accounts \u2013 Napoleon's included \u2013 placed all the emphasis on the Polish charge. San Juan was later killed by his own men.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/entre18091810/campanas/la-intervencion-de-napoleon-y-la-primera-campana-inglesa/batalla-de-somosierra#TOC-Muerte-del-general-Benito-San-Juan|title=Batalla de Somosierra - Entre 1809-1810|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrench patrols reached the outskirts of Madrid on the 1 December. The Junta made a half-hearted and futile attempt to defend the capital, and on the 4 December a devastating French artillery barrage brought the Spanish defence to grief. Spaniards surrendered their remaining 2,500 regulars; the 20,000 civilians under their banner dispersed; and the French entered Madrid for the second time that year.\n\nThe Battle of Somosierra is commemorated on the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw]], with the inscription \"SOMOSIERRA 30 XI 1808\".\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Frank Bauer: Somosierra 30.
