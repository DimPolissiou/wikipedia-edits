It was founded in [[Bath, Somerset]], in 1976 by Sir [[Edmund Happold]] when he took up a post at the [[University of Bath]] as Professor of [[Architecture]] and Engineering Design.\n\nOriginally working mainly on projects in the [[Middle East]], the firm now operates worldwide and in almost all areas of engineering for the [[built environment]], working in 24 locations around the world.\n\n==Sir Edmund Happold==\n{{main|Edmund Happold}}\n\nEdmund (or Ted) Happold worked at [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] before founding Buro Happold, where he worked on projects such as the [[Sydney Opera House]] and the [[Pompidou Centre]]. Ted Happold was renowned within the field of lightweight and [[tensile structure]]s. As a result, Buro Happold has undertaken a large number of [[tensile structure|tensile]] and other lightweight structures since its founding (including the [[Millennium Dome]]). Ted Happold died in 1996, but the firm claims to maintain his views on engineering and life.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sharpe|first1=Dennis|title=OBITUARY: Professor Sir Edmund Happold|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-sir-edmund-happold-1324558.html|accessdate=20 September 2017|work=Independent|date=18 January 1996}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Millennium Dome.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Millennium Dome]]]]\nBuro Happold was founded on 1 May 1976, with its first office on Gay Street in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], United Kingdom.<ref name=timeline/> The firm started with eight partners:\n{{columns\n|col1 =\n* [[Edmund Happold]]\n* Peter Buckthorp\n* [[Michael Dickson (engineer)|Michael Dickson]]\n* Terry Ealey\n|col2 =\n* [[Ian Liddell]]\n* Rod Macdonald\n* John Morrison\n* John Reid\n}}\n\nThe King's Office, Council of Ministers and Majlis Al Shura (KOCOMMAS), Central Government Complex in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] was the firm's first major design project in 1976.<ref name=timeline/> Initially, Buro Happold offered only [[structural engineering]] [[consultancy]], with a particular strength in [[tensile structure|lightweight structures]], but in 1977 it added [[civil engineering]] and [[geotechnical engineering]] and in 1978 building services engineering.<ref name=timeline/>   In 1982 Buro Happold started to work with Future Tents Ltd (FTL) on a variety of temporary and recreational structures.

Ted Happold was the first to introduce ethylenetetrafluoroethylene ([[ETFE]]) as a cladding material, and the outcomes of the research carried out by the laboratory led to the development of the designs for the Mannheim Multihall gridshell and a number of landmark fabric structures in the Middle East and the UK, allowing the new building forms to become generally accepted by architects and clients.<ref name=\"Nina Rappaport\"/>\n\nBuro Happold's early projects ranged from designing giant fabric umbrellas for [[Pink Floyd]] concerts<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stufish.com/Pages/Dinosaur/Pink%20Floyd/Animals%20Tour/Pink%20Floyd%20Animals%20Concert%20Tour%201977%2001.html |title=Pink Floyd Animals Concert Tour 1977 |publisher=Stufish |accessdate=22 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224074411/http://www.stufish.com/Pages/Dinosaur/Pink%20Floyd/Animals%20Tour/Pink%20Floyd%20Animals%20Concert%20Tour%201977%2001.html |archivedate=24 February 2007 }}</ref> to the Munich Aviary and the [[Mannheim Multihalle]], both with [[Frei Otto]], an architect who repeatedly worked with Buro Happold on projects which pioneered lightweight structures.

The executive arm of the government consisted of a prime minister and Council of Ministers designated by the king but also responsible to the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of a bicameral legislature. The Senate, or upper house, consisted of eight representatives from each of the three provinces. Half of the senators were nominated by the king, who also had the right to veto legislation and to dissolve the lower house. Local autonomy in the provinces was exercised through provincial governments and legislatures. [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]] served alternately as the national capital.\n\nThe Constitution was drafted under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], and was seen to include significant mechanisms for the protection of human rights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/09/05/libyas-constitution-controversy/|title=Libya's constitution controversy|last=Pickard|first=Duncan|date=2012-09-05|website=Foreign Policy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/where-next-libya|title=Where next for Libya?|website=www.newstatesman.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref> Ultimately, the document established an institutional apparatus that promoted transparency and safeguards against antidemocratic power accumulation.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|url=http://democracy-reporting.org/dri_publications/briefing-paper-28-assessment-of-the-1951-libyan-constitution/|title=Briefing Paper 28: Assessment of the 1951 Libyan Constitution|work=Democracy Reporting International is a non-partisan, independent, not-for-profit organisation registered in Berlin|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}</ref> In particular, the Constitution envisioned mechanisms to guarantee accountability in the exercise of public functions and equality of all Libyan citizens before the law.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\":5\" /> At the time it was produced, it was received as a positive and forward-thinking model of good governance and balance of powers for the region.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Political development===\nSeveral factors, rooted in Libya's history, affected the political development of the newly independent country. They reflected the differing political orientations of the provinces and the ambiguities inherent in Libya's monarchy. First, after the first [[Libyan general election, 1952]], which were held on 19 February, political parties were abolished. The National Congress Party, which had campaigned against a federal form of government, was defeated throughout the country. The party was outlawed, and [[Bashir es Sadawi]] was deported. Second, provincial ties continued to be more important than national ones, and the federal and provincial governments were constantly in dispute over their respective spheres of authority. A third problem derived from the lack of a direct heir to the throne. To remedy this situation, Idris in 1953 designated his sixty-year-old brother to succeed him. When the original heir apparent died, the king appointed his nephew, Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi|Hasan ar Rida]], his successor.\n\nWhen a group of young officers and soldiers seized power under the leadership of Muammar Gaddafi on September 1, 1969, the Crown Prince, who was then ruling the country on behalf of King Idris was imprisoned for two years and subsequently reduced to complete isolation during the following seven years under house arrest.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://24dec1951.com/index.php/libya/the-senussi-family|title=The Senussi Family|last=Administrator|website=24dec1951.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoiMCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=gaddafi+seize+power+crown+prince+arrested&source=bl&ots=5-tvTJBLY2&sig=txzLPLhP4GxPGVbZxPocdze837U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV9tP2hc7VAhUBYSYKHbdpDU4Q6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=gaddafi+seize+power+crown+prince+arrested&f=false|title=From Deep State to Islamic State: The Arab Counter-revolution and Its Jihadi Legacy|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Filiu|date=5 October 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/238562/Kings-without-a-country|title=Kings without a country|last=Pukas|first=Anna|date=2011-04-04|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref> Publicly humiliated by Gaddafi's circle, he suffered a stroke that led him to seek medical treatment in the UK in 1988.

Retrieved July 14, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[Politics of Libya|government]] was in close alliance with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]]; both countries maintained military base rights in Libya. The U.S. supported the [[United Nations resolution]] providing for Libyan independence in 1951 and raised the status of its office at Tripoli from a [[consulate general]] to a [[legation]]. Libya opened a legation at [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1954. Both countries subsequently raised their missions to the [[embassy]] level and exchanged [[ambassador]]s.\n\nIn 1953, Libya concluded a twenty-year treaty of friendship and alliance with the United Kingdom under which the latter received military bases in exchange for financial and military assistance. The next year, Libya and the United States signed an agreement under which the United States also obtained military base rights, subject to renewal in 1970, in return for economic aid to Libya. The most important of the United States installations in Libya was [[Wheelus Air Base]], near Tripoli, considered a strategically valuable installation in the 1950s and early 1960s. Reservations set aside in the desert were used by British and American military aircraft based in Europe as practice firing ranges. Libya forged close ties with [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], and established full diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1955, but declined a Soviet offer of economic aid.\n\n[[File:Piazza 28 Ottobre, Bengasi.jpg|thumb|left|Al Manar Royal Palace in central Benghazi, the [[University of Libya]]'s first campus, founded by royal decree in 1955.]]\nAs part of a broad assistance package, the UN Technical Assistance Board agreed to sponsor a technical aid program that emphasized the development of agriculture and education. The [[University of Libya]] was founded in 1955 by royal decree in Benghazi. Foreign powers, notably Britain and the United States, provided development aid. Steady economic improvement occurred, but the pace was slow, and Libya remained a poor and underdeveloped country heavily dependent on foreign aid.\n\n===Development of the nation===\nThis situation changed suddenly and dramatically in June 1959 when research prospectors from [[Esso]] (later renamed [[Exxon]]) confirmed the location of major petroleum deposits at Zaltan in [[Cyrenaica]]. Further discoveries followed, and commercial development was quickly initiated by concession holders who returned 50 percent of their profits to the Libyan government in taxes. In the petroleum market, Libya's advantages lay not only in the quantity but also in the high quality of its crude product. Libya's proximity and direct linkage to Europe by sea were further marketing advantages. The discovery and exploitation of petroleum turned the vast, sparsely populated, impoverished country into an independently wealthy nation with potential for extensive development and thus constituted a major turning point in Libyan history. [[Petroleum Law of 1955|Libya's petroleum law]], initially passed in 1955, was amended in 1961 and again in 1965 to increase the Libyan government's share of the revenues from oil.<ref>{{citation|title=A history of modern Libya|last=Vandewalle|first=Dirk J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-85048-3|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernl0000vand/page/59 59]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernl0000vand/page/59}}</ref>\n\nAs development of petroleum resources progressed in the early 1960s, Libya launched its first Five-Year Plan, 1963-68. One negative result of the new wealth from petroleum, however, was a decline in agricultural production, largely through neglect. Internal Libyan politics continued to be stable, but the federal form of government had proven inefficient and cumbersome. In April 1963, Prime Minister [[Mohieddin Fikini]] secured adoption by parliament of a bill, endorsed by the king, that abolished the federal form of government, establishing in its place a unitary, monarchical state with a dominant central government. By legislation, the historical divisions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]], and [[Fezzan]] were to be eliminated and the country divided into ten new provinces, each headed by an appointed governor. The legislature revised the constitution in 1963 to reflect the change from a federal to a [[unitary state]].\n\n===International relations===\n[[File:Idris I & Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|left|King Idris with U.S. Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]] in March 1957. Libya sought cordial relations with the West.]]\n[[File:Nasser Idris I.jpg|thumb|King Idris meeting Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt.]]\nIn regional affairs, Libya enjoyed the advantage of not having aggravated boundary disputes with its neighbors. Libya was one of the thirty founding members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), established in 1963, and in November 1964 participated with [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Tunisia]] in forming a joint consultative committee aimed at economic cooperation among North African states. Although it supported Arab causes, including the Moroccan and Algerian independence movements, Libya took little active part in the Arab-Israeli dispute or the tumultuous inter-Arab politics of the 1950s and the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/4313/4928 |title=Pragmatism and Rhetoric in Libya's Policy Toward Israel |last=Abadi |first=Jacob |journal=Journal of Conflict Studies |volume=20 |number=1 |date=Fall 2000 |accessdate=2018-02-21}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the brand of Arab nationalism advanced by Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] exercised an increasing influence, particularly among the younger Libyan generation that were influenced by the influx of Egyptian teachers into Libya. As one report suggests:\n\n<blockquote>The presence of Egyptian teachers explains why so many classrooms show the influence of Egyptian propaganda. Pupils do crayon drawings of Egyptian troops winning victories over Israel or Britain. In Benghazi, Libya, a complete course in Egyptian history is given to secondary school students. A display in a high school art exhibit showed pictures of the leading rules of Egypt; on one side were the \"bad\" rulers, on the other the \"good\" rulers. The bad rulers began with the Pharaoh Cheops, who enslaved his people to build the pyramids, and ended with Farouk. The good rulers began with the idealistic Pharaoh Ikhnaton and ended with, of course, Gamal Abdel Nasser.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nasser Of Egypt: The Search For Dignity|last=Wynn|first=Wilton|publisher=Colonial Press|year=1959|isbn=|location=Clinton, MA|pages=137|quote=|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn response to anti-Western agitation in 1964, Libya's essentially pro-Western government requested the evacuation of British and American bases before the dates specified in the treaties. Most British forces were in fact withdrawn in 1966, although the evacuation of foreign military installations, including Wheelus Air Base, was not completed until March 1970.\n\n[[File:Tripoli International Fairground 1962.ogv|thumb|left|Footage from Tripoli International Fairground, 1962.]]\nThe [[Six-Day War|June 1967 War]] between Israel and its Arab neighbors aroused a strong reaction in Libya, particularly in Tripoli and Benghazi, where dock and oil workers as well as students were involved in violent demonstrations. The United States and British embassies and oil company offices were damaged in rioting. Members of the small Jewish community were also attacked, prompting the emigration of almost all remaining Libyan Jews. The government restored order, but thereafter attempts to modernize the small and ineffective Libyan armed forces and to reform the grossly inefficient Libyan bureaucracy foundered upon conservative opposition to the nature and pace of the proposed reforms.{{clarify|date=August 2011}}\n\nAlthough Libya was clearly on record as supporting Arab causes in general, the country did not play an important role in Arab politics. At the [[1967 Arab League summit|Arab summit conference]] held at [[Khartoum]] in September 1967, however, Libya, along with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]], agreed to provide generous subsidies from oil revenues to aid [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]], defeated in June by Israel. Also, Idris first broached the idea of taking collective action to increase the price of oil on the world market. Libya, nonetheless, continued its close association with the West, while Idris' government steered an essentially conservative course at home.\n\n===1969 coup and end of the monarchy===\n{{main|Libyan coup d'etat (1969)}}\nThe monarchy came to an end on 1 September 1969 when a group of military officers led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] staged a coup d'\u00e9tat against King Idris while he was in [[Turkey]] for medical treatment. The revolutionaries arrested the army chief of staff and the head of security in the kingdom. After hearing about the coup, King Idris dismissed it as \"unimportant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/1/newsid_3911000/3911587.stm|title=1969: Bloodless coup in Libya|date=1 September 1969|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe coup pre-empted King Idris' instrument of abdication dated 4 August 1969 to take effect 2 September 1969 in favour of the Crown Prince, who had been appointed regent following the king's departure for Turkey. Following the overthrow of the monarchy the country was renamed the '''Libyan Arab Republic'''.\n\nIn 2013 the African Union commemorated King Idris' legacy as an African hero and the architect of Libya's independence from Italy's colonial rule in a public event.<ref>http://english.libyanembassy.org/?p=4799</ref> In fact, Idris remains widely regarded as the father of an independent and unified Libya who led the country through its resistance to the colonial powers.

Before he is able to assume constitutional powers the King would need to take an oath before a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives. All laws passed by parliament needed to be sanctioned and promulgated by the king. It was also the king's responsibility to open and close the sessions of Parliament, it is also his responsibility to dissolve the House of Representatives in line with the constitution. The king was head of the kingdom's [[Armed forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|armed forces]].\n\n===Council of ministers===\n[[File:Prime minister in the Kingdom of Libya at 1965 (Bayda, Libya).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister's office in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] (1965).]]\n[[File:Kubar ar Reda Bakeer.JPG|thumb|left|Left to right: Prime Minister [[Abdul Majid Kubar]], Crown Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi|Hasan]] and Taher Bakeer, Governor of [[Tripolitania]].]]\nThe King was responsible for appointing and removing [[List of heads of government of Libya|Prime Minister]]s. The king also appointed and dismissed ministers based on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers were responsible for the direction of the internal and external affairs of the country and the council were accountable to the House of Representatives. Once a prime minister was removed from office this automatically resulted in dismissal of all the other ministers.\n\n== Parliament ==\n\nThe Kingdom's parliament consisted of [[Bicameralism|two chambers]], the Senate and the House of Representatives. Both chambers met and closed at the same time.\n\nThe Senate was made up of twenty-four members appointed by the King. A seat in the Senate was restricted to Libyan nationals of at least forty years. The King appointed the President of the Senate, with the Senate itself electing two vice presidents which the King would then need to approve. The president and vice president served for a fixed two-year term. At the end of this term, the King was free to reappoint the president or replace them with someone else while the vice presidents faced re-election. The term of office for a senator was eight years. A senator could not serve for consecutive terms but could be reappointed in the future. Half of all the senators were to be replaced every four years.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives were elected through [[universal suffrage]] following the constitutional change on 25 April 1963. Women had previously not been able to vote. The number of deputies in the house was determined on the basis of one deputy for twenty thousand people. Elections were held every four years unless parliament was dissolved earlier. The deputies were responsible for electing a speaker and two vice-speakers for the house.\n\n== Subdivisions ==\n\n===Provinces===\n[[File:Ottoman Provinces Of Present day Libyapng.png|thumb|Pre-1963 provinces.]]\nFollowing independence until 1963, the Kingdom was organised into three provinces: [[Tripolitania]], [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Fezzan]], which are the three historic regions of Libya.

They reflected the differing political orientations of the provinces and the ambiguities inherent in Libya's monarchy. First, after the first [[Libyan general election, 1952]], which were held on 19 February, political parties were abolished. The National Congress Party, which had campaigned against a federal form of government, was defeated throughout the country. The party was outlawed, and [[Bashir es Sadawi]] was deported. Second, provincial ties continued to be more important than national ones, and the federal and provincial governments were constantly in dispute over their respective spheres of authority. A third problem derived from the lack of a direct heir to the throne. To remedy this situation, Idris in 1953 designated his sixty-year-old brother to succeed him. When the original heir apparent died, the king appointed his nephew, Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi|Hasan ar Rida]], his successor.\n\nWhen a group of young officers and soldiers seized power under the leadership of Muammar Gaddafi on September 1, 1969, the Crown Prince, who was then ruling the country on behalf of King Idris was imprisoned for two years and subsequently reduced to complete isolation during the following seven years under house arrest.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://24dec1951.com/index.php/libya/the-senussi-family|title=The Senussi Family|last=Administrator|website=24dec1951.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uoiMCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=gaddafi+seize+power+crown+prince+arrested&source=bl&ots=5-tvTJBLY2&sig=txzLPLhP4GxPGVbZxPocdze837U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiV9tP2hc7VAhUBYSYKHbdpDU4Q6AEIODAD#v=onepage&q=gaddafi+seize+power+crown+prince+arrested&f=false|title=From Deep State to Islamic State: The Arab Counter-revolution and Its Jihadi Legacy|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Filiu|date=5 October 2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/238562/Kings-without-a-country|title=Kings without a country|last=Pukas|first=Anna|date=2011-04-04|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en}}</ref> Publicly humiliated by Gaddafi's circle, he suffered a stroke that led him to seek medical treatment in the UK in 1988.

Retrieved July 14, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe [[Politics of Libya|government]] was in close alliance with the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]]; both countries maintained military base rights in Libya. The U.S. supported the [[United Nations resolution]] providing for Libyan independence in 1951 and raised the status of its office at Tripoli from a [[consulate general]] to a [[legation]]. Libya opened a legation at [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1954. Both countries subsequently raised their missions to the [[embassy]] level and exchanged [[ambassador]]s.\n\nIn 1953, Libya concluded a twenty-year treaty of friendship and alliance with the United Kingdom under which the latter received military bases in exchange for financial and military assistance. The next year, Libya and the United States signed an agreement under which the United States also obtained military base rights, subject to renewal in 1970, in return for economic aid to Libya. The most important of the United States installations in Libya was [[Wheelus Air Base]], near Tripoli, considered a strategically valuable installation in the 1950s and early 1960s. Reservations set aside in the desert were used by British and American military aircraft based in Europe as practice firing ranges. Libya forged close ties with [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], and established full diplomatic relations with the [[Soviet Union]] in 1955, but declined a Soviet offer of economic aid.\n\n[[File:Piazza 28 Ottobre, Bengasi.jpg|thumb|left|Al Manar Royal Palace in central Benghazi, the [[University of Libya]]'s first campus, founded by royal decree in 1955.]]\nAs part of a broad assistance package, the UN Technical Assistance Board agreed to sponsor a technical aid program that emphasized the development of agriculture and education. The [[University of Libya]] was founded in 1955 by royal decree in Benghazi. Foreign powers, notably Britain and the United States, provided development aid. Steady economic improvement occurred, but the pace was slow, and Libya remained a poor and underdeveloped country heavily dependent on foreign aid.\n\n===Development of the nation===\nThis situation changed suddenly and dramatically in June 1959 when research prospectors from [[Esso]] (later renamed [[Exxon]]) confirmed the location of major petroleum deposits at Zaltan in [[Cyrenaica]]. Further discoveries followed, and commercial development was quickly initiated by concession holders who returned 50 percent of their profits to the Libyan government in taxes. In the petroleum market, Libya's advantages lay not only in the quantity but also in the high quality of its crude product. Libya's proximity and direct linkage to Europe by sea were further marketing advantages. The discovery and exploitation of petroleum turned the vast, sparsely populated, impoverished country into an independently wealthy nation with potential for extensive development and thus constituted a major turning point in Libyan history. [[Petroleum Law of 1955|Libya's petroleum law]], initially passed in 1955, was amended in 1961 and again in 1965 to increase the Libyan government's share of the revenues from oil.<ref>{{citation|title=A history of modern Libya|last=Vandewalle|first=Dirk J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-521-85048-3|p=[https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernl0000vand/page/59 59]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernl0000vand/page/59}}</ref>\n\nAs development of petroleum resources progressed in the early 1960s, Libya launched its first Five-Year Plan, 1963-68. One negative result of the new wealth from petroleum, however, was a decline in agricultural production, largely through neglect. Internal Libyan politics continued to be stable, but the federal form of government had proven inefficient and cumbersome. In April 1963, Prime Minister [[Mohieddin Fikini]] secured adoption by parliament of a bill, endorsed by the king, that abolished the federal form of government, establishing in its place a unitary, monarchical state with a dominant central government. By legislation, the historical divisions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]], and [[Fezzan]] were to be eliminated and the country divided into ten new provinces, each headed by an appointed governor. The legislature revised the constitution in 1963 to reflect the change from a federal to a [[unitary state]].\n\n===International relations===\n[[File:Idris I & Richard Nixon.jpg|thumb|left|King Idris with U.S. Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]] in March 1957. Libya sought cordial relations with the West.]]\n[[File:Nasser Idris I.jpg|thumb|King Idris meeting Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt.]]\nIn regional affairs, Libya enjoyed the advantage of not having aggravated boundary disputes with its neighbors. Libya was one of the thirty founding members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), established in 1963, and in November 1964 participated with [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Tunisia]] in forming a joint consultative committee aimed at economic cooperation among North African states. Although it supported Arab causes, including the Moroccan and Algerian independence movements, Libya took little active part in the Arab-Israeli dispute or the tumultuous inter-Arab politics of the 1950s and the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/JCS/article/view/4313/4928 |title=Pragmatism and Rhetoric in Libya's Policy Toward Israel |last=Abadi |first=Jacob |journal=Journal of Conflict Studies |volume=20 |number=1 |date=Fall 2000 |accessdate=2018-02-21}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the brand of Arab nationalism advanced by Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] exercised an increasing influence, particularly among the younger Libyan generation that were influenced by the influx of Egyptian teachers into Libya. As one report suggests:\n\n<blockquote>The presence of Egyptian teachers explains why so many classrooms show the influence of Egyptian propaganda. Pupils do crayon drawings of Egyptian troops winning victories over Israel or Britain. In Benghazi, Libya, a complete course in Egyptian history is given to secondary school students. A display in a high school art exhibit showed pictures of the leading rules of Egypt; on one side were the \"bad\" rulers, on the other the \"good\" rulers. The bad rulers began with the Pharaoh Cheops, who enslaved his people to build the pyramids, and ended with Farouk. The good rulers began with the idealistic Pharaoh Ikhnaton and ended with, of course, Gamal Abdel Nasser.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nasser Of Egypt: The Search For Dignity|last=Wynn|first=Wilton|publisher=Colonial Press|year=1959|isbn=|location=Clinton, MA|pages=137|quote=|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn response to anti-Western agitation in 1964, Libya's essentially pro-Western government requested the evacuation of British and American bases before the dates specified in the treaties. Most British forces were in fact withdrawn in 1966, although the evacuation of foreign military installations, including Wheelus Air Base, was not completed until March 1970.\n\n[[File:Tripoli International Fairground 1962.ogv|thumb|left|Footage from Tripoli International Fairground, 1962.]]\nThe [[Six-Day War|June 1967 War]] between Israel and its Arab neighbors aroused a strong reaction in Libya, particularly in Tripoli and Benghazi, where dock and oil workers as well as students were involved in violent demonstrations. The United States and British embassies and oil company offices were damaged in rioting. Members of the small Jewish community were also attacked, prompting the emigration of almost all remaining Libyan Jews. The government restored order, but thereafter attempts to modernize the small and ineffective Libyan armed forces and to reform the grossly inefficient Libyan bureaucracy foundered upon conservative opposition to the nature and pace of the proposed reforms.{{clarify|date=August 2011}}\n\nAlthough Libya was clearly on record as supporting Arab causes in general, the country did not play an important role in Arab politics. At the [[1967 Arab League summit|Arab summit conference]] held at [[Khartoum]] in September 1967, however, Libya, along with [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]], agreed to provide generous subsidies from oil revenues to aid [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]], defeated in June by Israel. Also, Idris first broached the idea of taking collective action to increase the price of oil on the world market. Libya, nonetheless, continued its close association with the West, while Idris' government steered an essentially conservative course at home.\n\n===1969 coup and end of the monarchy===\n{{main|Libyan coup d'etat (1969)}}\nThe monarchy came to an end on 1 September 1969 when a group of military officers led by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] staged a coup d'\u00e9tat against King Idris while he was in [[Turkey]] for medical treatment. The revolutionaries arrested the army chief of staff and the head of security in the kingdom. After hearing about the coup, King Idris dismissed it as \"unimportant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/1/newsid_3911000/3911587.stm|title=1969: Bloodless coup in Libya|date=1 September 1969|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe coup pre-empted King Idris' instrument of abdication dated 4 August 1969 to take effect 2 September 1969 in favour of the Crown Prince, who had been appointed regent following the king's departure for Turkey. Following the overthrow of the monarchy the country was renamed the '''Libyan Arab Republic'''.\n\nIn 2013 the African Union commemorated King Idris' legacy as an African hero and the architect of Libya's independence from Italy's colonial rule in a public event.<ref>http://english.libyanembassy.org/?p=4799</ref> In fact, Idris remains widely regarded as the father of an independent and unified Libya who led the country through its resistance to the colonial powers. As a quiet but firm ruler, he played a unifying role both in Libya, between the various strains of Islam and the plethora of Libyan tribes, and across the region.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/26/obituaries/king-idris-ousted-in-69-by-qaddafi-dies-in-cairo.html|title=KING IDRIS, OUSTED IN '69 BY QADDAFI, DIES IN CAIRO|last=AP|date=1983-05-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOw0DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=king+idris+unifying+role&source=bl&ots=lr397Xm5Zl&sig=dvEi5kdcNypHNYcfXdpH70h6nvo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiarb3izs_VAhUIOyYKHVmxCC0Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=king+idris+unifying+role&f=false|title=Libya in Western Foreign Policies, 1911\u20132011|first=Saskia Van|last=Genugten|date=18 May 2016|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books}}</ref> He is remembered as \"uncompromising\" against his enemies, no matter the consequences of his actions.<ref name=\":4\" /> The obituary posted by Associated Press in 1983 recalled that he stripped thirty members of the royal household of their privileges and rights, exiled seven princes and ruled in favor of the execution of one of his nephew who had murdered a trusted royal adviser.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n===2011 Libyan revolution===\n[[File:A Benghazi citizen holding King Idris's photo.JPG|thumb|A young Benghazian carrying King Idris's photo during the [[2011 Libyan civil war|2011 civil war]].]]\nAlthough the king and the crown prince died in exile and most of the younger generation of Libyans were born after the monarchy, the Senussi dynasty has enjoyed somewhat of a comeback during the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], especially in the dynasty's traditional stronghold of [[Cyrenaica]]. Opposition demonstrators to Colonel Gaddafi used the old tricolour flag of the monarchy, some carried portraits of the king,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/ |title=The liberated east: Building a new Libya |date=24 February 2011 |work=The Economist |accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> and played the old national anthem ''[[Libya, Libya, Libya]]''.

Before he is able to assume constitutional powers the King would need to take an oath before a joint session of the Senate and the House of Representatives. All laws passed by parliament needed to be sanctioned and promulgated by the king. It was also the king's responsibility to open and close the sessions of Parliament, it is also his responsibility to dissolve the House of Representatives in line with the constitution. The king was head of the kingdom's [[Armed forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|armed forces]].\n\n===Council of ministers===\n[[File:Prime minister in the Kingdom of Libya at 1965 (Bayda, Libya).jpg|thumb|left|Prime Minister's office in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] (1965).]]\n[[File:Kubar ar Reda Bakeer.JPG|thumb|left|Left to right: Prime Minister [[Abdul Majid Kubar]], Crown Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi|Hasan]] and Taher Bakeer, Governor of [[Tripolitania]].]]\nThe King was responsible for appointing and removing [[List of heads of government of Libya|Prime Minister]]s. The king also appointed and dismissed ministers based on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Council of Ministers were responsible for the direction of the internal and external affairs of the country and the council were accountable to the House of Representatives. Once a prime minister was removed from office this automatically resulted in dismissal of all the other ministers.\n\n== Parliament ==\n\nThe Kingdom's parliament consisted of [[Bicameralism|two chambers]], the Senate and the House of Representatives. Both chambers met and closed at the same time.\n\nThe Senate was made up of twenty-four members appointed by the King. A seat in the Senate was restricted to Libyan nationals of at least forty years. The King appointed the President of the Senate, with the Senate itself electing two vice presidents which the King would then need to approve. The president and vice president served for a fixed two-year term. At the end of this term, the King was free to reappoint the president or replace them with someone else while the vice presidents faced re-election. The term of office for a senator was eight years. A senator could not serve for consecutive terms but could be reappointed in the future. Half of all the senators were to be replaced every four years.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives were elected through [[universal suffrage]] following the constitutional change on 25 April 1963. Women had previously not been able to vote. The number of deputies in the house was determined on the basis of one deputy for twenty thousand people. Elections were held every four years unless parliament was dissolved earlier. The deputies were responsible for electing a speaker and two vice-speakers for the house.\n\n== Subdivisions ==\n\n===Provinces===\n[[File:Ottoman Provinces Of Present day Libyapng.png|thumb|Pre-1963 provinces.]]\nFollowing independence until 1963, the Kingdom was organised into three provinces: [[Tripolitania]], [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Fezzan]], which are the three historic regions of Libya.
