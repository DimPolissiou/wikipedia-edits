Sherwood Rowland in 1973 as a postdoctoral fellow.

The basic scientific question Molina asked was \"What is the consequence of society releasing something to the environment that wasn\u2019t there before?\"<ref name=\"AOA\"/>\n\nRowland and Molina had investigated compounds similar to CFCs before. Together they developed the CFC ozone depletion theory, by combining basic scientific knowledge about the chemistry of ozone, CFCs and atmospheric conditions with computer modelling. First Molina tried to figure out how CFCs could be decomposed. At lower levels of the atmosphere, they were inert. Molina realized that if CFCs released into the atmosphere do not decay by other processes, they will continually rise to higher altitudes. Higher in the atmosphere, different conditions apply. The highest levels of the stratosphere are exposed to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light. A thin layer of ozone floating high in the stratosphere protects lower levels of the atmosphere from that type of radiation.<ref name=\"ScienceHistoryBio\"/> \n\nMolina theorized that photons from ultraviolet light, known to break down oxygen molecules, could also break down CFCs,  releasing a number of products including [[chlorine]] atoms into the stratosphere. Chlorine atoms (Cl) are radicals: they have an unpaired electron and are very reactive. Chlorine atoms react easily with ozone molecules (O<sub>3</sub>), removing one oxygen atom to leave O<sub>2</sub> and [[chlorine monoxide]] (ClO).<ref name=\"ScienceHistoryBio\"/><ref name=\"Wiberg\">{{cite book |first1=Arnold Frederick|last1= Holleman|first2= Bernhard J. |last2=Aylett|first3= William|last3= Brewer |first4=Mary |last4=Eagleson|first5= Egon|last5= Wiberg |title=Inorganic chemistry |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn= |edition=1st English| page= 462}}</ref>\n\n:Cl\u00b7 + {{chem|O|3}} \u2192 ClO\u00b7 + {{chem|O|2}}\n\nClO is also a radical, which reacts with ozone to release two O<sub>2</sub> molecules and a Cl atom. The radical Cl atom is not consumed in these reactions, so it remains in the system.<ref name=\"ScienceHistoryBio\"/><ref name=\"Wiberg\"/>\n\n:ClO\u00b7 + O\u00b7 \u2192 Cl\u00b7 + {{chem|O|2}}\n\nMolina and Rowland predicted that chlorine atoms, produced by this decomposition of CFCs, would act as an ongoing catalyst for the destruction of ozone. When they calculated the amounts involved they realized that CFCs could start a seriously damaging chain reaction to the ozone layer in the stratosphere.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/><ref name=\"Chemistry 1995 P 245-249\"/><ref name=\"AOA\"/>\n\nRowland and Molina published their findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on June 28, 1974, and also made an effort to announce their findings outside of the scientific community, informing policy makers and the news media of their work. As a result of their work, laws were established to protect the ozone layer by regulating the use of CFCs.<ref name=\"Chemistry 1995 P 245-249\"/><ref name=\"AOA\">{{cite web|title= Mario J.

The basic scientific question Molina asked was \"What is the consequence of society releasing something to the environment that wasn\u2019t there before?\"<ref name=\"AOA\"/>\n\nRowland and Molina had investigated compounds similar to CFCs before. Together they developed the CFC ozone depletion theory, by combining basic scientific knowledge about the chemistry of ozone, CFCs and atmospheric conditions with computer modelling. First Molina tried to figure out how CFCs could be decomposed. At lower levels of the atmosphere, they were inert. Molina realized that if CFCs released into the atmosphere do not decay by other processes, they will continually rise to higher altitudes. Higher in the atmosphere, different conditions apply. The highest levels of the stratosphere are exposed to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light. A thin layer of ozone floating high in the stratosphere protects lower levels of the atmosphere from that type of radiation.<ref name=\"ScienceHistoryBio\"/> \n\nMolina theorized that photons from ultraviolet light, known to break down oxygen molecules, could also break down CFCs,  releasing a number of products including [[chlorine]] atoms into the stratosphere. Chlorine atoms (Cl) are radicals: they have an unpaired electron and are very reactive. Chlorine atoms react easily with ozone molecules (O<sub>3</sub>), removing one oxygen atom to leave O<sub>2</sub> and [[chlorine monoxide]] (ClO).<ref name=\"ScienceHistoryBio\"/><ref name=\"Wiberg\">{{cite book |first1=Arnold Frederick|last1= Holleman|first2= Bernhard J. |last2=Aylett|first3= William|last3= Brewer |first4=Mary |last4=Eagleson|first5= Egon|last5= Wiberg |title=Inorganic chemistry |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn= |edition=1st English| page= 462}}</ref>\n\n:Cl\u00b7 + {{chem|O|3}} \u2192 ClO\u00b7 + {{chem|O|2}}\n\nClO is also a radical, which reacts with ozone to release two O<sub>2</sub> molecules and a Cl atom. The radical Cl atom is not consumed in these reactions, so it remains in the system.<ref name=\"ScienceHistoryBio\"/><ref name=\"Wiberg\"/>\n\n:ClO\u00b7 + O\u00b7 \u2192 Cl\u00b7 + {{chem|O|2}}\n\nMolina and Rowland predicted that chlorine atoms, produced by this decomposition of CFCs, would act as an ongoing catalyst for the destruction of ozone. When they calculated the amounts involved they realized that CFCs could start a seriously damaging chain reaction to the ozone layer in the stratosphere.<ref name=\"Landmark\"/><ref name=\"Chemistry 1995 P 245-249\"/><ref name=\"AOA\"/>\n\nRowland and Molina published their findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on June 28, 1974, and also made an effort to announce their findings outside of the scientific community, informing policy makers and the news media of their work.

It is a suburban development situated {{convert|10.1|mi|km|1}} south west of [[Charing Cross]]. Nearby places include [[Surbiton]], [[New Malden]], [[Old Malden]], [[Tolworth]] and [[Chessington]]. [[Berrylands railway station]] is 24 minutes from [[London Waterloo station|London Waterloo]] by train.\n\n==History==\nBerrylands is a settlement of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] origin that is close to the [[Thames]]. Berrylands originally formed part of the [[Municipal Borough of Surbiton]], however in 1965 it was incorporated as part of the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]].\nMost of the present housing development took place in the 1930s on the former Berrylands Farm.\n\nThe [[Surbiton Lagoon]] lido opened in 1934, but later closed in 1980, and then demolished at the end of the decade.<ref>[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/oliver.merrington/lidos/lidos1closed.htm#surbiton Surbiton Lagoon was built in 1934 closed in 1980, and then demolished in the late 1980s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050903094756/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/oliver.merrington/lidos/lidos1closed.htm#surbiton |date=3 September 2005 }}]</ref>\nThis area was subsequently transformed into a park now owned and managed by Kingston Council, known as Berrylands Park,<ref>[https://www.kingston.gov.uk/directory_record/11364/berrylands_park Kingston Council - Berrylands Park]</ref> with a small area to the south developed into housing, creating Meldone Close.<ref>[http://londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.php?ID=KIN005 London Gardens Online - Berrylands Park]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nBerrylands is a [[place-name]] that misleadingly suggests \"land where berries grow\". It actually means \"land on a [[tumulus]] or hill\", from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''beorg'' (modern [[dialect]]al \"barrow\" meaning \"hill\"), [[cognate]] with [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] ''bergr'', ''bjorgr'' and ''borgr'' which mean the same thing, and [[Old English language|Old English]] ''land'' (\"land\"). The name was recorded as Berilendes in 1126, and as Berulind in 1148 (wrongly suggesting [[Old English language|Old English]] ''lindr'' \"[[lime-tree]]\" as the second element), and more recently as Barrilands in 1378, which shows the true origin as being from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''beorg''.\n\nIn a sense, the name corresponds to the modern English \"Hill Farm\", a common name for farms (and some new [[House|residences]]) across the United Kingdom.\n\n==Housing, shops and transport==\nThere are four separate parades of shops, these are Alexandra Drive, Berrylands Road, Chiltern Drive and a smaller parade along Surbiton Hill Park. Chiltern Drive is at the centre of Berrylands, and houses over 22 businesses as well as the Berrylands public house, the Berrylands, known locally as 'The Berry'. The shops were built in the 1930s, and currently consist of a newsagents, doctors surgery, hairdressers, beauty salon, CCTV shop,<ref>[http://berrylandscctv.co.uk Berrylands CCTV website]</ref> barbers, coffee shop, printer and bookshop, as well as the [[Berrylands railway station|Berrylands]] railway station.\n\nThe neighbourhood is primarily residential. It houses a large [[commuter]] population using [[Transport for London]] travel routes, including two bus routes, the [[London Buses route K2|K2]] and 665, and the [[Berrylands railway station|Berrylands]], [[Surbiton railway station|Surbiton]] or [[Tolworth railway station|Tolworth]] links to [[London Waterloo railway station|London Waterloo]].\n\nThe majority of houses in the neighbourhood were built in the 1930s and have features typically<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23956650 BBC \u2013 Which era of house do people like best?]</ref> found in housing stock of the inter-war period.
