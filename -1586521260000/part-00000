In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the [[Bharathidasan University]] umbrella, of which Dr. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]] served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor.

The founding principal was Prof. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]], a pioneering educationist in India. He was a graduate of [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola College]], [[Chennai]] and the [[Technical University of Nova Scotia]] (now known as [[Faculty of Engineering, Dalhousie University|Faculty of Engineering]], [[Dalhousie University]]), [[Canada]]; he pioneered the formation of Computer Science as a separate educational stream on the Indian scene.

In 1982, the college was thus incorporated under the [[Bharathidasan University]] umbrella, of which Dr. [[P. S. Manisundaram|P.S. Manisundaram]] served as the inaugural Vice-Chancellor. The Institute would grant degrees under this name for the next 20 years, except for a brief stint under [[Anna University]] in 2001 and 2002. The college continued its progress under [[Bharathidasan University]] and introduced a Computer Science Department around 1984, split off the Mechanical Engineering Department's manufacturing stream into a Production Engineering Department and introduced the Instrumentation and Control Engineering Department in 1992.\n\nIn 2001, [[Anna University]] was granted authority over REC Trichy.

Most \u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 are said to have previously existed in the spirit world (''\u00f2run'') as ''Irumole'', and then become incarnated as human beings here on Earth. Others are said to be humans who are recognised as deities upon their death due to extraordinary feats accomplished in life.<ref name=\"baxter\"/>\n\nMany \u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 have found their way to most of the [[New World]] as a result of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and are now expressed in practices as varied as [[Santer\u00eda]], [[Candombl\u00e9 Ketu|Candombl\u00e9]], [[Trinidad odisha]], [[Umbanda]], and [[Oyotunji]], among others. The concept of odisha is similar to those of deities in the traditional religions of the [[Bini people]] of [[Edo State]] in southern Nigeria, the [[Ewe people]] of [[Benin]], [[Ghana]], and [[Togo]], and the [[Fon people]] of Benin.<ref name=\"baxter\"/><ref name=\"b\"/>\n\n==Number==\n\nYoruba tradition often says that there are 400 + 1 \u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0, which is associated with a sacred number. Other sources suggest that the number is \"as many as you can think of, plus one more \u2013 an innumerable number.\" Different oral traditions refer to 400, 700, or 1,440 odisha.<ref name=\"Clark2012\"/><ref name=\"falola\"/><ref name=\"MerWeb1999\"/>\n\n==Beliefs==\n\nPractitioners traditionally believe that daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ''ori''. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean a portion of the [[soul]] that determines personal [[destiny]].<ref name=\"b\"/>\n\nSome \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 are rooted in ancestor worship; warriors, kings, and founders of cities were celebrated after death and joined the pantheon of Yoruba deities. The ancestors did not die, but were seen to have \"disappeared\" and become \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0. Some odishas based on historical figures are confined to worship in their families or towns of origin; others are venerated across wider geographic areas.<ref name=\"b\"/>\n\n===Ashe===\n\n''[[Ase (Yoruba)|Ashe]]'' is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. It is described as the power to make things happen. It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and [[prayers]], as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Or\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 devotees strive to obtain Ashe through ''iwa-pele'', gentle and good [[Moral character|character]], and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others might call inner [[peace]] and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine [[energy]] that comes from Olodumare, the [[creator deity]], and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ashe is sometimes associated with [[Eshu]], the messenger \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0.<ref name=\"Pelton1989\"/> For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the odishas, and the ancestors.<ref>Cynthia Duncan, Ph.D., [http://www.aboutsanteria.com/ About santeria]</ref>\n\nThe concept is regularly referenced in [[Capoeira|Brazilian capoeira]]. Ax\u00e9 in this context is used as a greeting or farewell, in songs and as a form of praise.

Most \u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 are said to have previously existed in the spirit world (''\u00f2run'') as ''Irumole'', and then become incarnated as human beings here on Earth. Others are said to be humans who are recognised as deities upon their death due to extraordinary feats accomplished in life.<ref name=\"baxter\"/>\n\nMany \u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 have found their way to most of the [[New World]] as a result of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and are now expressed in practices as varied as [[Santer\u00eda]], [[Candombl\u00e9 Ketu|Candombl\u00e9]], [[Trinidad Orisha]], [[Umbanda]], and [[Oyotunji]], among others. The concept of orisha is similar to those of deities in the traditional religions of the [[Bini people]] of [[Edo State]] in southern Nigeria, the [[Ewe people]] of [[Benin]], [[Ghana]], and [[Togo]], and the [[Fon people]] of Benin.<ref name=\"baxter\"/><ref name=\"b\"/>\n\n==Number==\n\nYoruba tradition often says that there are 400 + 1 \u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0, which is associated with a sacred number. Other sources suggest that the number is \"as many as you can think of, plus one more \u2013 an innumerable number.\" Different oral traditions refer to 400, 700, or 1,440 orisha.<ref name=\"Clark2012\"/><ref name=\"falola\"/><ref name=\"MerWeb1999\"/>\n\n==Beliefs==\n\nPractitioners traditionally believe that daily life depends on proper alignment and knowledge of one's ''ori''. Ori literally means the head, but in spiritual matters, it is taken to mean a portion of the [[soul]] that determines personal [[destiny]].<ref name=\"b\"/>\n\nSome \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 are rooted in ancestor worship; warriors, kings, and founders of cities were celebrated after death and joined the pantheon of Yoruba deities. The ancestors did not die, but were seen to have \"disappeared\" and become \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0. Some orishas based on historical figures are confined to worship in their families or towns of origin; others are venerated across wider geographic areas.<ref name=\"b\"/>\n\n===Ashe===\n\n''[[Ase (Yoruba)|Ashe]]'' is the life-force that runs through all things, living and inanimate. It is described as the power to make things happen. It is an affirmation that is used in greetings and [[prayers]], as well as a concept of spiritual growth. Or\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 devotees strive to obtain Ashe through ''iwa-pele'', gentle and good [[Moral character|character]], and in turn they experience alignment with the ori, what others might call inner [[peace]] and satisfaction with life. Ashe is divine [[energy]] that comes from Olodumare, the [[creator deity]], and is manifested through Olorun, who rules the heavens and is associated with the sun. Without the sun, no life could exist, just as life cannot exist without some degree of ashe. Ashe is sometimes associated with [[Eshu]], the messenger \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0.<ref name=\"Pelton1989\"/> For practitioners, ashe represents a link to the eternal presence of the supreme deity, the orishas, and the ancestors.<ref>Cynthia Duncan, Ph.D., [http://www.aboutsanteria.com/ About santeria]</ref>\n\nThe concept is regularly referenced in [[Capoeira|Brazilian capoeira]]. Ax\u00e9 in this context is used as a greeting or farewell, in songs and as a form of praise. Saying that someone \"has ax\u00e9\" in capoeira is complimenting their energy, fighting spirit, and attitude.<ref name=\"MerWeb1999\"/>\n\n== Pantheon ==\n\nThe \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 are grouped as those represented by the color white, who are characterized as ''tutu'' \"cool, calm, gentle, and temperate\"; and those represented by the colors red or black, who are characterized as ''gbigbona'' \"harsh, aggressive, demanding, and quick tempered\".
