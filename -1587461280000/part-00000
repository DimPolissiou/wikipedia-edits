could play a part in Wuornos's psychological state, including her biological mother's departure as well as her grandmother ignoring the abuse she endured from her grandfather, thus leading to the lack of development of a \"mother-daughter\" bond for Wuornos as a young girl.<ref name=\"Arrigo 2004\" /> \n\nThe damage was then made worse because both Wuornos and her brother believed that their grandparents were their biological parents, but at the age of 11 they learned that this was not the case, which further damaged the relationship between Wuornos and her adoptive parents.<ref name=\"Arrigo 2004\" /> Wuornos was also known to have early behavioral problems such as having an explosive temper which limited her ability to make friends, as well as making it increasingly difficult for her to maintain relationships.\n\nHer traumatic upbringing, including her physical and sexual abuse, have been partially linked to the development of her borderline personality disorder.<ref name=\"Myers\"/> Such severe trauma can also interrupt the development of the mind and result in \"primitive, dissociative, and splitting defenses to ward off the intensity of emotional

grandparents were their biological parents, but at the age of 11 they learned that this was not the case, which further damaged the relationship between Wuornos and her adoptive parents.<ref

difficult for her to maintain relationships.\n\nHer traumatic upbringing, including her physical and sexual abuse, have been partially linked to the development of her borderline personality

In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered [[columns]] and [[Row (database)|rows]]. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a [[BLOB]] (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most [[relational database]] management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated column patterns that vary from row to row<ref name=\"InmonUntang14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/untangling-definition-unstructured-data |title=Untangling the Definition of Unstructured Data |author=Inmon, W.H. |work=Big Data & Analytics Hub |publisher=IBM |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> or files of natural language that do not have detailed metadata.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10462-017-9588-9|url=http://sentic.net/natural-language-based-financial-forecasting.pdf|title=Natural language based financial forecasting: a survey|year=2018|last1=Xing|first1=F.

E.|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|volume=50|issue=1|pages=49\u201373|hdl=1721.1/116314}}</ref>\n\nMany of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PDFs, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.\nTherefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data,<ref name = blumberg /> but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.\n\nUnstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.\n\n===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===\nThere are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon & Nesavich,<ref name = inmon>Inmon, B. & A. Nesavich, \"Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization\" from \"Managing Unstructured data in the organization\", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1\u201313</ref> some of those are:\n\n* Physically accessing unstructured textual data&nbsp;\u2013 unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.\n* [[Terminology]]&nbsp;\u2013 Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology.\n* Volume of data&nbsp;\u2013 As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.\n* Searchability of unstructured textual data&nbsp;\u2013 A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon & Nesavich, 2008)<ref name = inmon /> gives an example: \u201ca search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.\u201d\n\n===Metadata===\nTo solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of [[metadata]].<ref name = rao /> Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. summaries, topics, people, or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and [[information extraction]].\n\n==Applications==\nBusiness intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:<ref name=\"FeldmanDeveloping13\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDXfeopC-kMC&pg=PA140 |title=Developing Business Intelligence Apps for SharePoint |author1=Feldman, D. |author2=Himmelstein, J.  |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=140\u20131 |year=2013 |isbn=9781449324681 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n* [[Performance metrics]] and [[benchmarking]] inform business leaders of progress towards business goals ([[business process management]]).\n* [[Analytics]] quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[statistical analysis]], [[predictive analytics]], [[predictive modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[data lineage]], [[complex event processing]], and [[prescriptive analytics]].\n* [[Business reporting]] can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve [[data visualization]], [[executive information system]], and/or [[OLAP]]\n* BI can facilitate [[collaboration]] both inside and outside the business by enabling [[data sharing]] and [[electronic data interchange]]\n* [[Knowledge management]] is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general.

In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered [[columns]] and [[Row (database)|rows]]. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a [[BLOB]] (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most [[relational database]] management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated column patterns that vary from row to row<ref name=\"InmonUntang14\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/untangling-definition-unstructured-data |title=Untangling the Definition of Unstructured Data |author=Inmon, W.H. |work=Big Data & Analytics Hub |publisher=IBM |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> or files of natural language that do not have detailed metadata.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10462-017-9588-9|url=http://sentic.net/natural-language-based-financial-forecasting.pdf|title=Natural language based financial forecasting: a survey|year=2018|last1=Xing|first1=F.

E.|journal=Artificial Intelligence Review|volume=50|issue=1|pages=49\u201373|hdl=1721.1/116314}}</ref>\n\nMany of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PDFs, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.\nTherefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data,<ref name = blumberg /> but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.\n\nUnstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.\n\n===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===\nThere are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon & Nesavich,<ref name = inmon>Inmon, B. & A. Nesavich, \"Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization\" from \"Managing Unstructured data in the organization\", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1\u201313</ref> some of those are:\n\n* Physically accessing unstructured textual data&nbsp;\u2013 unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.\n* [[Terminology]]&nbsp;\u2013 Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology.\n* Volume of data&nbsp;\u2013 As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.\n* Searchability of unstructured textual data&nbsp;\u2013 A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon & Nesavich, 2008)<ref name = inmon /> gives an example: \u201ca search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.\u201d\n\n===Metadata===\nTo solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of [[metadata]].<ref name = rao /> Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. summaries, topics, people, or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and [[information extraction]].\n\n==Applications==\nBusiness intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:<ref name=\"FeldmanDeveloping13\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDXfeopC-kMC&pg=PA140 |title=Developing Business Intelligence Apps for SharePoint |author1=Feldman, D. |author2=Himmelstein, J.  |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=140\u20131 |year=2013 |isbn=9781449324681 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n* [[Performance metrics]] and [[benchmarking]] inform business leaders of progress towards business goals ([[business process management]]).\n* [[Analytics]] quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[statistical analysis]], [[predictive analytics]], [[predictive modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[data lineage]], [[complex event processing]], and [[prescriptive analytics]].\n* [[Business reporting]] can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve [[data visualization]], [[executive information system]], and/or [[OLAP]]\n* BI can facilitate [[collaboration]] both inside and outside the business by enabling [[data sharing]] and [[electronic data interchange]]\n* [[Knowledge management]] is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general.

{"title_page": "Pigeon racing", "text_new": "{{For|the bicycle company|Flying Pigeon}}\n{{see also|Pigeon keeping}}\n[[Image:Postduiven.jpg|right|225px|thumb]]\n'''Pigeon racing''' is the sport of releasing specially trained [[racing pigeon]]s, which then return to their homes over a carefully measured distance. The time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and the bird's rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest speed.\n\nPigeon racing requires a specific breed of pigeon bred for the sport, the [[Racing Homer]]. Competing pigeons are specially trained and conditioned for races that vary in distance from approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} to {{convert|1000|km|mi}}.  Despite these lengths, races can be won and lost by seconds, so many different timing and measuring devices have been developed. The traditional timing method involves rubber rings being placed into a specially designed clock, whereas a newer development uses [[RFID]] tags to record arrival time.\n\nWhile there is no definite proof, there are compelling reasons to think the sport of racing pigeons may go back at least as far as 220 AD.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, South Carolina|page=4| isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}</ref>  The sport achieved a great deal of popularity in Belgium in the mid-19th century.

Once quite popular, the sport has experienced a downturn in participants in some parts of the world in recent years, possibly due to the rising [[cost of living]], ageing fanciers, and a severe lack of public interest. [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] is also a reason why some people are leaving the sport.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17660891 | doi=10.3132/pcrj.2007.00046 | volume=16 | issue=4 | title=Pigeon hypersensitivity pneumonitis: immunohistochemical demonstration of the causative antigen in the lung | journal=Prim Care Respir J | pages=252\u20136 | last1 = Le\u00f3n | first1 = DE | last2 = Retana | first2 = VN | last3 = Hern\u00e1ndez-Pando | first3 = R | last4 = Arellano | first4 = J | last5 = Ortiz | first5 = LG | last6 = Valle | first6 = FC | last7 = Mart\u00ednez-Cordero | first7 = E| year=2007 | pmc = 6634217 }}</ref>\n\nOne recent development in the sport of pigeon racing is \"one loft racing\", where birds are raced against each other under the same training regimen, from the same location. The principle being to find the best individual race bird irrespective of the race trainer. This will determine which bird is then the most successful. \n[[File:Kabi.jpg|thumb|280px| Racing pigeons are often transported in specially modified trucks.]]\n\n==History==\n[[Pigeons]] are the oldest domesticated bird.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The predecessors of modern-day racing pigeons were pigeons bred for their homing ability, primarily to carry messages. \"[[Pigeon post]]s\" have been established all over the world and while mainly used in the [[War pigeon|military]], some are still in service today. Modern pigeon racing originated in Belgium in the mid 19th century.<ref name=LeviBelgium/>\n\nThe sport was aided by several new technologies of the era. The advent of the railroad permitted pigeons to be sent to distant release points quickly and at modest cost. In addition, the creation of mass-produced, sophisticated timing clocks brought accurate and secure timing to the sport. These clocks were designed with special compartments where an entry band, removed from the returning race bird was placed. When struck, the clock recorded the time and also placed the band in a compartment that could only be opened by race officials.\n\nThe importance of homing pigeons in the centuries before electronic communications, such as the telegraph and telephone, is seldom recognised. However, the Reuters News Agency, the world's largest information provider, began as a pigeon service carrying closing stock prices between Belgium and Germany, basically between the western and eastern terminus of the telegraph in Europe. Also, the use of homing pigeons by financier Nathan Rothschild to gain advance news of Napoleon's unexpected defeat at Waterloo is thought to have led to a fortune being made in the bond market of the day.\n\n==Racing==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0212-034, Sporttaubenz\u00fcchter.jpg|thumb|275px|A fancier with racing pigeons]]\nPigeon racing has been described as a \"sport with a single starting gate and a thousand finish lines.\"<ref name=\"Jenner\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paccomfilms.com/Articles.asp?ID=138|title=Pigeon Racing Films|first=Jim|last=Jenner|website=Paccom Films|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115095409/http://www.paccomfilms.com/Articles.asp?ID=138|archivedate=2010-01-15}}</ref> In short, competing birds are taken from their lofts and must race home.

Such feats are uncommon, however, and the average racing career rarely exceeds three years.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} Hazards can also come from weather conditions on the day of the race. Pigeons can become grounded and disoriented, and therefore not finish the race. In one instance in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]], in 1941, a family found a pigeon on their property. Since the bird was sporting an identifying leg band, the Wisconsin Conservation Commission was called, who identified the owner as a man from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]].<ref>Capital Times, Madison, WI. Sunday Nov. 23, 1941. p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn the early days of racing, paint was used to identify birds for owners. Belgium then developed a \u215b-inch brass leg band, that was sent to racers in America to use.<ref>\"Pigeon Racing Popular Among Belgians\", Wisconsin Tercentenary, ''Green Bay Press Gazette''. July 1934</ref> Since then, to compete in a race, it must wear a permanent, unique numbered [[bird ringing|ring or band]] that is placed on its leg at about five days old. For a race to be conducted, the competing pigeons must be entered into the race, usually at the organisation's clubhouse, and taken away from their home to be released at a predetermined time and location. The distance between the bird's home loft and the race point is carefully measured by [[GPS]] and the time taken by the bird to return is measured using one of the two acceptable timing methods. Sometimes in some leagues, there are two divisions: one for the young birds (usually yearlings in their first year of competition) and another for older birds.\n\n===Traditional timing method===\n[[Image:Duivenklok-Zandberg binnenin overzicht.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Inside an older pigeon clock]]\n[[Image:Duivenringpotjes.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Some old style pigeon clocks use thimbles.]]\nThe traditional method of timing racing pigeons involves [[rubber]] rings with unique [[identification numbers]] and a specially designed pigeon racing clock. The ring is attached around the [[bird anatomy|bird's leg]] before being sent to race. The serial number is recorded, the clock is set and sealed, and the bird carries the ring home.\nWhen the first bird returns, its trainer removes the ring and places it in a slot in the clock. The time that the ring was placed in the clock is recorded as the official time that the competing bird arrived home. From this time stamp an average speed is measured and a winner of the race can be found.\n\nAlthough serving its purpose, this method has proved somewhat problematic for a few reasons:\n* The pigeon's \"official time\" is not the actual time it arrived, it is the time the ring was removed, placed in the clock and recorded, which could be many vital seconds later.\n* Exceptional pigeons may arrive home first on multiple occasions; [[Pigeon intelligence|knowing]] it is going to have the ring removed speedily, which may be uncomfortable, the pigeon could be reluctant to enter the loft for the trainer.\n\n===Electronic timing method===\nThe latest development and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the '''Electronic Timing System'''. The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier does not even have to be at the loft to clock the birds as they return.<ref name=\"Simmons\">{{cite web | last =Simmons | first =Morgan | title =For racing pigeons, there's no place like home | publisher =Knox news | url =http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/feb/24/winged-wonders/ | format =Web article | accessdate =25 February 2008 | url-status =live | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081012081128/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/feb/24/winged-wonders/ | archivedate =12 October 2008 }}</ref> Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny [[RFID]] chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons' arrival. The pad or [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock is attached to the antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to [[transponder timing]] systems used in human races.<ref>{{cite web| title =Racing Pigeons Race Day | publisher =Canadian Racing Pigeon Union Inc | url =http://www.canadianracingpigeonunion.com/Race_day.aspx | format =Web article | accessdate =19 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116213650/http://www.canadianracingpigeonunion.com/Race_day.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 16 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2008 the members of the Penygraog Homing Society Racing Pigeon Club in [[Wales]] won an award to fund a new electronic timing device. The club was able to obtain the device thanks to funding from the All Wales award initiative. Club secretary John Williams said: \"The electronic timer certainly makes it a lot easier for us\".<ref>{{cite web| last =Leader | first =Rhondda | title =Fanciers get a real buzz from racing  | publisher =icWales | url =http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/sports/grassroots/rhondda-sport/2008/02/14/pigeon-racing-fanciers-get-a-real-buzz-from-racing-91466-20466452/ | format =Web article   | accessdate =19 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of electronic timing system recording birds\u2019 arrival has never been easier. The ETS technology is developing year on year and it is taking over the pigeon world, changing it and making it fit for today's conditions. As a result of this new way of registering a bird's arrival, several loft management software have been created in the last 10 years to help fanciers with record keeping, pigeon pedigree, publishing race results or keep track of treatment and vaccination records.\n\n==One-loft racing==\nOne-loft racing originated from local futurity races. Futurity races are when the bird's race home from the racing station to their homes. The difference between regular racing and futurity races is futurity races has prize money involved. Usually, the prize is used for a bragging right more so than to win the money. The process of racing could be a bit complicated as handlers of their racing pigeons compete with one another. Some handlers could be better than some when it comes down to racing. Therefore, one-loft racing was created. One-loft racing is the process of training birds bred by many different breeders in the same loft, under the same trainer and in the same conditions (as opposed to trainer against trainer in their own lofts and usually with their own birds). It is thought to be the fairest method of proving which [[bloodline]] or breeder is best and usually provides the highest amount of [[prize money]]. Pigeons are recorded by electronic timing systems scanning the birds as they enter the home loft with winners decided by as little as 100th of a second. The birds are all taken to the same release point and they return to the same home loft, so therefore it is the fastest bird to complete the journey from A to B. One-loft racing is now becoming very popular all around the world with fanciers able to compare their bloodlines on an equal basis against the best breeders.\n\n==Training==\nRacing pigeons are housed together in a specially designed [[dovecote]] or [[Pigeon keeping#Pigeon housing|loft]]. From about four weeks of age until the end of its racing career, the racing loft is the pigeon's home and is where it returns to on race day.\n\nAfter 22 to 28 days in the nest (depending on the owner's preference) the young birds are removed and placed in a section of a large loft or in a smaller loft built for the purpose. After a few days of learning how to locate the water and eating by themselves they are allowed to wander out of the loft and peck around in the garden, while doing this they are constantly observing their surroundings and becoming familiar with them. At about age six to seven weeks the birds will begin taking off, flying in very small circles around their loft and owner's house. As their confidence grows they gradually wander farther and farther from home until they are out of sight and can remain so for as much as two hours before returning. When a few trainers fly their pigeons in the same area, these flying \"batches\" (as flocks of pigeons are called) can number in the thousands. It does not, however, help them much in relation to finding their home from long distances away, a fundamental of pigeon racing. As confident flyers, the young pigeons are taken on progressively longer 'training tosses', driven a distance away from their home and released. This method of training is a way to condition the birds mentally and physically to prepare them for the races. This practice of loft flying and tossing continues throughout a pigeon's career to keep their homing instincts sharp.\n\nThere are many ways to train racing pigeons. Like every sport out there, racing pigeons is an evolving sport. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds' desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the [[nestbox]] is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their [[mating|mate]] or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning is one of the key elements in a lot of racing programs.\n\nDue to advancements in technology researchers have been able to use small [[Global Positioning Systems]] to track the flight paths that their birds follow.  Small GPS systems have recently begun to hit the consumer market. Companies like PigeonTrack and GEM Supplements currently sell GPS units for novice to advanced race trainers to use to gather data.\n\n==Hazards==\n[[Image:Falco peregrinus nest USFWS free.jpg|left|thumb|The [[peregrine falcon]] is a major predator of racing pigeons.]]\nAs pigeon racing takes place over great distances in the sky, instead of on a [[racetrack]], there are many hazards that could befall a pigeon during racing as well as training. The main hazard encountered by racing pigeons is predation by [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Pigeon racing: Lawrence's big passion | publisher =Oxford Mail | url =http://archive.oxfordmail.net/2002/6/15/38848.html | format =Web article | accessdate =25 February 2008 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090531061710/http://archive.oxfordmail.net/2002/6/15/38848.html | archivedate =31 May 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"one\">{{cite web | title =Birds of Pray . . .The Peregrine Falcons of St Mary's Cathedral, Kilkenny | publisher =Kilkenny People, 18 Jan 2012 | url =http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/local/birds_of_pray_the_peregrine_falcons_of_st_mary_s_cathedral_kilkenny_1_3429021 | format =Web article | accessdate =1 May 2012 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120120014940/http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/local/birds_of_pray_the_peregrine_falcons_of_st_mary_s_cathedral_kilkenny_1_3429021 | archivedate =20 January 2012 }}</ref> The killing of valuable pigeons by wild [[predator]]s has led to some pigeon fanciers being suspected of killing birds of prey such as [[falcon]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=270&id=812202004|title=Pigeon racers suspected in falcon killings|work=The Scotsman}}</ref>\n\nAnother hazard that racing pigeons encounter is flying into objects they sometimes cannot see, mostly when flying at high speeds or in darker weather conditions. The most common obstructions are electricity pylons or TV aerials.<ref>//www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/pigeons_raptors_report.pdf</ref> Pigeon fanciers will often have one of their pigeons return home with wounds or missing feathers from the [[Bird anatomy|belly or flanks]] region.\n\nIt is thought that racing pigeons rely on the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to find their way home. Some evidence has surfaced indicating that [[mobile phone tower]]s may be interrupting the birds' [[navigation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omega.twoday.net/stories/286416/|title=Mobile phone mast blamed for vanishing pigeons|work=Omega News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626161347/http://omega.twoday.net/stories/286416/|archivedate=2006-06-26}}</ref> although no published research has investigated this theory.\n{{-}}\n\n==Breeding==\n[[Image:Jung Homing pigeons.JPG|right|thumb|A pair of young racing pigeons, 9 days old.]]\nPigeons are [[sexually mature]] at about six months of age. However, fanciers will often wait until the pigeon is at least a few months older before [[animal husbandry|breeding]]. A hen bird will usually only lay two eggs in a clutch, laid every other day, after which incubation begins. The incubation period is 17 days. [[Pigeon keeping|Pigeon breeders]] are careful in selecting birds to pair together so as to continue improving the breed and gain a competitive edge. It is this [[selective breeding]] that has given rise to the racing pigeons of today, capable of finding their way home from over {{convert|1600|km|mi}} away and flying at speeds in excess of {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h}} with a tail wind but average {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h}} on a calm day.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Hens are often capable of laying upwards of 12 eggs per year, and squabs usually leave the nest at approximately three to four weeks of age.\n\n==Doping==\nDoping in pigeon racing is the practice of giving [[doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] to avian racers. The drugs are used to produce similar effects to those found in human athletes, building up muscle tissue and opening the respiratory tracts. In addition, [[corticosteroid]]s can be used to delay [[moulting]], allowing a bird to race late into a season.<ref name=\"WSJ2004\" />\n\nIn October 2013, blood samples from twenty Belgian pigeons were sent by the Pigeon Fanciers Association to South Africa for testing. This was the result of an exchange visit by the association to the National Horseracing Authority of Southern Africa.<ref name=\"Tel-25-10-13\" /> While tests in Belgium had not found traces of any drugs the South African laboratory discovered that six samples contained unusual substances. Five samples were found to include traces of [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol), a widely used [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[analgesic]] (pain reliever) and [[antipyretic]] (fever reducer). The sixth sample was erroneously reported in the press as having shown indications of [[cocaine]] use, but the lab reported that it was indications of [[caffeine]] usage.<ref name=\"Pipa-07-28-13\" /> As the samples were sent anonymously no action could be taken against the owners of any of the birds.<ref name=\"Ind-25-10-13\" />\n\nIn 2001 a series of raids across 80 homes led to the confiscation of large quantities of illegal performance-enhancers.<ref name=\"WSJ2004\" /><ref name=\"Guard-06-02-09\" />  Currently, all race winners are tested and over 100 samples were collected and tested in 2013.\n\nIn 1995 the Belgian Ministry of Health mandated drug testing in order to protect the welfare of the birds.<ref name=\"WSJ2004\" /> The sport's governing body was looking at the possibility of implementing new anti-doping rules for the sport prior to the commencement of the 2014 season.<ref name=\"Ind-25-10-13\" />\n\n==By region==\n\n=== The Americas ===\n\n====United States====\nThe sport was introduced into the United States about 1875, although regular racing did not begin until 1878.<ref name=\"EB1911 vol. 21, p. 596\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Pigeon-flying |volume=21 |page=596 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri21chisrich#page/596/mode/1up}}</ref> The sport of pigeon racing is well established in the US,<ref>{{cite web | last =Steeves | first =Heather | title =Look Homeward | publisher =The Elsworth American (29 May 2008) | url =http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content | accessdate =24 June 2008 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5YoXq3PRR | archivedate =24 June 2008 }}</ref> and growing.

The time it takes the animal to cover the specified distance is measured and the bird's rate of travel is calculated and compared with all of the other pigeons in the race to determine which animal returned at the highest speed.\n\nPigeon racing requires a specific breed of pigeon bred for the sport, the [[Racing Homer]]. Competing pigeons are specially trained and conditioned for races that vary in distance from approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} to {{convert|1000|km|mi}}.  Despite these lengths, races can be won and lost by seconds, so many different timing and measuring devices have been developed. The traditional timing method involves rubber rings being placed into a specially designed clock, whereas a newer development uses [[RFID]] tags to record arrival time.\n\nWhile there is no definite proof, there are compelling reasons to think the sport of racing pigeons may go back at least as far as 220 AD.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, South Carolina|page=4| isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}</ref>  The sport achieved a great deal of popularity in Belgium in the mid-19th century.

Once quite popular, the sport has experienced a downturn in participants in some parts of the world in recent years, possibly due to the rising [[cost of living]], ageing fanciers, and a severe lack of public interest. [[Hypersensitivity pneumonitis]] is also a reason why some people are leaving the sport.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 17660891 | doi=10.3132/pcrj.2007.00046 | volume=16 | issue=4 | title=Pigeon hypersensitivity pneumonitis: immunohistochemical demonstration of the causative antigen in the lung | journal=Prim Care Respir J | pages=252\u20136 | last1 = Le\u00f3n | first1 = DE | last2 = Retana | first2 = VN | last3 = Hern\u00e1ndez-Pando | first3 = R | last4 = Arellano | first4 = J | last5 = Ortiz | first5 = LG | last6 = Valle | first6 = FC | last7 = Mart\u00ednez-Cordero | first7 = E| year=2007 | pmc = 6634217 }}</ref>\n\nOne recent development in the sport of pigeon racing is \"one loft racing\", where birds are raced against each other under the same training regimen, from the same location. The principle being to find the best individual race bird irrespective of the race trainer. This will determine which bird is then the most successful. \n[[File:Kabi.jpg|thumb|280px| Racing pigeons are often transported in specially modified trucks.]]\n\n==History==\n[[Pigeons]] are the oldest domesticated bird.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The predecessors of modern-day racing pigeons were pigeons bred for their homing ability, primarily to carry messages. \"[[Pigeon post]]s\" have been established all over the world and while mainly used in the [[War pigeon|military]], some are still in service today. Modern pigeon racing originated in Belgium in the mid 19th century.<ref name=LeviBelgium/>\n\nThe sport was aided by several new technologies of the era. The advent of the railroad permitted pigeons to be sent to distant release points quickly and at modest cost. In addition, the creation of mass-produced, sophisticated timing clocks brought accurate and secure timing to the sport. These clocks were designed with special compartments where an entry band, removed from the returning race bird was placed. When struck, the clock recorded the time and also placed the band in a compartment that could only be opened by race officials.\n\nThe importance of homing pigeons in the centuries before electronic communications, such as the telegraph and telephone, is seldom recognised. However, the Reuters News Agency, the world's largest information provider, began as a pigeon service carrying closing stock prices between Belgium and Germany, basically between the western and eastern terminus of the telegraph in Europe. Also, the use of homing pigeons by financier Nathan Rothschild to gain advance news of Napoleon's unexpected defeat at Waterloo is thought to have led to a fortune being made in the bond market of the day.\n\n==Racing==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0212-034, Sporttaubenz\u00fcchter.jpg|thumb|275px|A fancier with racing pigeons]]\nPigeon racing has been described as a \"sport with a single starting gate and a thousand finish lines.\"<ref name=\"Jenner\">{{cite web|url=http://www.paccomfilms.com/Articles.asp?ID=138|title=Pigeon Racing Films|first=Jim|last=Jenner|website=Paccom Films|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115095409/http://www.paccomfilms.com/Articles.asp?ID=138|archivedate=2010-01-15}}</ref> In short, competing birds are taken from their lofts and must race home. The time taken and distance are recorded and the [[velocity|fastest bird]] is declared the winner. Races are generally between {{convert|100|km|mi}} and {{convert|1000|km|mi}} in distance. In the United States flights of up to {{convert|1800|km|mi}} have been recorded.<ref name=walcott>{{cite journal\n |last        = Walcott\n |first       = Charles\n |year        = 1996\n |title       = Pigeon Homing: Observations, Experiments and Confusions\n |journal     = Journal of Experimental Biology\n |volume      = 199\n |issue       = 1\n |pages       = 21&ndash;27\n |url         = http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/21.pdf\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227193747/http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/199/1/21.pdf\n |archivedate = 2008-02-27\n}}</ref>\n\nProvided it survives the many [[#Hazards|hazards]] associated with racing, a single pigeon could compete from about six months of age and still be in competition at over ten years of age. Such feats are uncommon, however, and the average racing career rarely exceeds three years.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} Hazards can also come from weather conditions on the day of the race. Pigeons can become grounded and disoriented, and therefore not finish the race. In one instance in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]], in 1941, a family found a pigeon on their property. Since the bird was sporting an identifying leg band, the Wisconsin Conservation Commission was called, who identified the owner as a man from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]].<ref>Capital Times, Madison, WI. Sunday Nov. 23, 1941. p. 11.</ref>\n\nIn the early days of racing, paint was used to identify birds for owners. Belgium then developed a \u215b-inch brass leg band, that was sent to racers in America to use.<ref>\"Pigeon Racing Popular Among Belgians\", Wisconsin Tercentenary, ''Green Bay Press Gazette''. July 1934</ref> Since then, to compete in a race, it must wear a permanent, unique numbered [[bird ringing|ring or band]] that is placed on its leg at about five days old. For a race to be conducted, the competing pigeons must be entered into the race, usually at the organisation's clubhouse, and taken away from their home to be released at a predetermined time and location. The distance between the bird's home loft and the race point is carefully measured by [[GPS]] and the time taken by the bird to return is measured using one of the two acceptable timing methods. Sometimes in some leagues, there are two divisions: one for the young birds (usually yearlings in their first year of competition) and another for older birds.\n\n===Traditional timing method===\n[[Image:Duivenklok-Zandberg binnenin overzicht.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Inside an older pigeon clock]]\n[[Image:Duivenringpotjes.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Some old style pigeon clocks use thimbles.]]\nThe traditional method of timing racing pigeons involves [[rubber]] rings with unique [[identification numbers]] and a specially designed pigeon racing clock. The ring is attached around the [[bird anatomy|bird's leg]] before being sent to race. The serial number is recorded, the clock is set and sealed, and the bird carries the ring home.\nWhen the first bird returns, its trainer removes the ring and places it in a slot in the clock. The time that the ring was placed in the clock is recorded as the official time that the competing bird arrived home. From this time stamp an average speed is measured and a winner of the race can be found.\n\nAlthough serving its purpose, this method has proved somewhat problematic for a few reasons:\n* The pigeon's \"official time\" is not the actual time it arrived, it is the time the ring was removed, placed in the clock and recorded, which could be many vital seconds later.\n* Exceptional pigeons may arrive home first on multiple occasions; [[Pigeon intelligence|knowing]] it is going to have the ring removed speedily, which may be uncomfortable, the pigeon could be reluctant to enter the loft for the trainer.\n\n===Electronic timing method===\nThe latest development and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the '''Electronic Timing System'''. The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier does not even have to be at the loft to clock the birds as they return.<ref name=\"Simmons\">{{cite web | last =Simmons | first =Morgan | title =For racing pigeons, there's no place like home | publisher =Knox news | url =http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/feb/24/winged-wonders/ | format =Web article | accessdate =25 February 2008 | url-status =live | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20081012081128/http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/feb/24/winged-wonders/ | archivedate =12 October 2008 }}</ref> Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny [[RFID]] chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons' arrival. The pad or [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock is attached to the antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to [[transponder timing]] systems used in human races.<ref>{{cite web| title =Racing Pigeons Race Day | publisher =Canadian Racing Pigeon Union Inc | url =http://www.canadianracingpigeonunion.com/Race_day.aspx | format =Web article | accessdate =19 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080116213650/http://www.canadianracingpigeonunion.com/Race_day.aspx <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 16 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2008 the members of the Penygraog Homing Society Racing Pigeon Club in [[Wales]] won an award to fund a new electronic timing device. The club was able to obtain the device thanks to funding from the All Wales award initiative. Club secretary John Williams said: \"The electronic timer certainly makes it a lot easier for us\".<ref>{{cite web| last =Leader | first =Rhondda | title =Fanciers get a real buzz from racing  | publisher =icWales | url =http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/sports/grassroots/rhondda-sport/2008/02/14/pigeon-racing-fanciers-get-a-real-buzz-from-racing-91466-20466452/ | format =Web article   | accessdate =19 February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWith the advent of electronic timing system recording birds\u2019 arrival has never been easier. The ETS technology is developing year on year and it is taking over the pigeon world, changing it and making it fit for today's conditions. As a result of this new way of registering a bird's arrival, several loft management software have been created in the last 10 years to help fanciers with record keeping, pigeon pedigree, publishing race results or keep track of treatment and vaccination records.\n\n==One-loft racing==\nOne-loft racing originated from local futurity races. Futurity races are when the bird's race home from the racing station to their homes. The difference between regular racing and futurity races is futurity races has prize money involved. Usually, the prize is used for a bragging right more so than to win the money. The process of racing could be a bit complicated as handlers of their racing pigeons compete with one another. Some handlers could be better than some when it comes down to racing. Therefore, one-loft racing was created. One-loft racing is the process of training birds bred by many different breeders in the same loft, under the same trainer and in the same conditions (as opposed to trainer against trainer in their own lofts and usually with their own birds). It is thought to be the fairest method of proving which [[bloodline]] or breeder is best and usually provides the highest amount of [[prize money]]. Pigeons are recorded by electronic timing systems scanning the birds as they enter the home loft with winners decided by as little as 100th of a second. The birds are all taken to the same release point and they return to the same home loft, so therefore it is the fastest bird to complete the journey from A to B. One-loft racing is now becoming very popular all around the world with fanciers able to compare their bloodlines on an equal basis against the best breeders.\n\n==Training==\nRacing pigeons are housed together in a specially designed [[dovecote]] or [[Pigeon keeping#Pigeon housing|loft]]. From about four weeks of age until the end of its racing career, the racing loft is the pigeon's home and is where it returns to on race day.\n\nAfter 22 to 28 days in the nest (depending on the owner's preference) the young birds are removed and placed in a section of a large loft or in a smaller loft built for the purpose. After a few days of learning how to locate the water and eating by themselves they are allowed to wander out of the loft and peck around in the garden, while doing this they are constantly observing their surroundings and becoming familiar with them. At about age six to seven weeks the birds will begin taking off, flying in very small circles around their loft and owner's house. As their confidence grows they gradually wander farther and farther from home until they are out of sight and can remain so for as much as two hours before returning. When a few trainers fly their pigeons in the same area, these flying \"batches\" (as flocks of pigeons are called) can number in the thousands. It does not, however, help them much in relation to finding their home from long distances away, a fundamental of pigeon racing. As confident flyers, the young pigeons are taken on progressively longer 'training tosses', driven a distance away from their home and released. This method of training is a way to condition the birds mentally and physically to prepare them for the races. This practice of loft flying and tossing continues throughout a pigeon's career to keep their homing instincts sharp.\n\nThere are many ways to train racing pigeons. Like every sport out there, racing pigeons is an evolving sport. One of the most popular systems is widowhood. This system uses the birds' desire to reproduce as motivation to try to give the bird a sense of urgency on race day. The use of widowhood is usually begun by first allowing the racer to raise a baby in their nest box. After the baby is weaned the hen is removed and often the [[nestbox]] is closed off, from then on the only time these birds are allowed to see their [[mating|mate]] or enter the nest box is upon returning from training or a race. This conditioning is one of the key elements in a lot of racing programs.\n\nDue to advancements in technology researchers have been able to use small [[Global Positioning Systems]] to track the flight paths that their birds follow.  Small GPS systems have recently begun to hit the consumer market. Companies like PigeonTrack and GEM Supplements currently sell GPS units for novice to advanced race trainers to use to gather data.\n\n==Hazards==\n[[Image:Falco peregrinus nest USFWS free.jpg|left|thumb|The [[peregrine falcon]] is a major predator of racing pigeons.]]\nAs pigeon racing takes place over great distances in the sky, instead of on a [[racetrack]], there are many hazards that could befall a pigeon during racing as well as training. The main hazard encountered by racing pigeons is predation by [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]].<ref>{{cite web | title =Pigeon racing: Lawrence's big passion | publisher =Oxford Mail | url =http://archive.oxfordmail.net/2002/6/15/38848.html | format =Web article | accessdate =25 February 2008 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090531061710/http://archive.oxfordmail.net/2002/6/15/38848.html | archivedate =31 May 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"one\">{{cite web | title =Birds of Pray . . .The Peregrine Falcons of St Mary's Cathedral, Kilkenny | publisher =Kilkenny People, 18 Jan 2012 | url =http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/local/birds_of_pray_the_peregrine_falcons_of_st_mary_s_cathedral_kilkenny_1_3429021 | format =Web article | accessdate =1 May 2012 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20120120014940/http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/news/local/birds_of_pray_the_peregrine_falcons_of_st_mary_s_cathedral_kilkenny_1_3429021 | archivedate =20 January 2012 }}</ref> The killing of valuable pigeons by wild [[predator]]s has led to some pigeon fanciers being suspected of killing birds of prey such as [[falcon]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=270&id=812202004|title=Pigeon racers suspected in falcon killings|work=The Scotsman}}</ref>\n\nAnother hazard that racing pigeons encounter is flying into objects they sometimes cannot see, mostly when flying at high speeds or in darker weather conditions. The most common obstructions are electricity pylons or TV aerials.<ref>//www.snh.org.uk/pdfs/pigeons_raptors_report.pdf</ref> Pigeon fanciers will often have one of their pigeons return home with wounds or missing feathers from the [[Bird anatomy|belly or flanks]] region.\n\nIt is thought that racing pigeons rely on the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to find their way home. Some evidence has surfaced indicating that [[mobile phone tower]]s may be interrupting the birds' [[navigation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://omega.twoday.net/stories/286416/|title=Mobile phone mast blamed for vanishing pigeons|work=Omega News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626161347/http://omega.twoday.net/stories/286416/|archivedate=2006-06-26}}</ref> although no published research has investigated this theory.\n{{-}}\n\n==Breeding==\n[[Image:Jung Homing pigeons.JPG|right|thumb|A pair of young racing pigeons, 9 days old.]]\nPigeons are [[sexually mature]] at about six months of age. However, fanciers will often wait until the pigeon is at least a few months older before [[animal husbandry|breeding]]. A hen bird will usually only lay two eggs in a clutch, laid every other day, after which incubation begins. The incubation period is 17 days. [[Pigeon keeping|Pigeon breeders]] are careful in selecting birds to pair together so as to continue improving the breed and gain a competitive edge. It is this [[selective breeding]] that has given rise to the racing pigeons of today, capable of finding their way home from over {{convert|1600|km|mi}} away and flying at speeds in excess of {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h}} with a tail wind but average {{convert|60|km/h|mi/h}} on a calm day.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Hens are often capable of laying upwards of 12 eggs per year, and squabs usually leave the nest at approximately three to four weeks of age.\n\n==Doping==\nDoping in pigeon racing is the practice of giving [[doping in sport|performance-enhancing drugs]] to avian racers. The drugs are used to produce similar effects to those found in human athletes, building up muscle tissue and opening the respiratory tracts. In addition, [[corticosteroid]]s can be used to delay [[moulting]], allowing a bird to race late into a season.<ref name=\"WSJ2004\" />\n\nIn October 2013, blood samples from twenty Belgian pigeons were sent by the Pigeon Fanciers Association to South Africa for testing. This was the result of an exchange visit by the association to the National Horseracing Authority of Southern Africa.<ref name=\"Tel-25-10-13\" /> While tests in Belgium had not found traces of any drugs the South African laboratory discovered that six samples contained unusual substances. Five samples were found to include traces of [[acetaminophen]] (paracetamol), a widely used [[over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] [[analgesic]] (pain reliever) and [[antipyretic]] (fever reducer). The sixth sample was erroneously reported in the press as having shown indications of [[cocaine]] use, but the lab reported that it was indications of [[caffeine]] usage.<ref name=\"Pipa-07-28-13\" /> As the samples were sent anonymously no action could be taken against the owners of any of the birds.<ref name=\"Ind-25-10-13\" />\n\nIn 2001 a series of raids across 80 homes led to the confiscation of large quantities of illegal performance-enhancers.<ref name=\"WSJ2004\" /><ref name=\"Guard-06-02-09\" />  Currently, all race winners are tested and over 100 samples were collected and tested in 2013.\n\nIn 1995 the Belgian Ministry of Health mandated drug testing in order to protect the welfare of the birds.<ref name=\"WSJ2004\" /> The sport's governing body was looking at the possibility of implementing new anti-doping rules for the sport prior to the commencement of the 2014 season.<ref name=\"Ind-25-10-13\" />\n\n==By region==\n\n=== The Americas ===\n\n====United States====\nThe sport was introduced into the United States about 1875, although regular racing did not begin until 1878.<ref name=\"EB1911 vol. 21, p. 596\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Pigeon-flying |volume=21 |page=596 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri21chisrich#page/596/mode/1up}}</ref> The sport of pigeon racing is well established in the US,<ref>{{cite web | last =Steeves | first =Heather | title =Look Homeward | publisher =The Elsworth American (29 May 2008) | url =http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content | accessdate =24 June 2008 | url-status =dead | archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5YoXq3PRR | archivedate =24 June 2008 }}</ref> and growing.

Gooch|publisher = |year = 2007|isbn = 978-1-4419-6246-1|location = |pages = 318}}</ref>  In this theory, two forces are considered to impact on colloidal stability: [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals forces]] and [[Coulombic force|Coulombic]] (Entropic) forces.\n\nThe total [[potential energy]] is described as the sum of the attraction potential and the repulsion potential. When two particles approach each other, electrostatic repulsion increases and the interference between their electrical [[Double layer (surface science)|double layers]] increases. Meanwhile, the [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] attraction increases as they get closer. At each distance, the net potential energy of the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/103103033/module3/lecture5.pdf. |title=NPTEL Chemical Engineering Interfacial Engineering |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe combination of these forces results in a deep attractive well, which is referred to as the primary minimum. At larger distances, the energy profile goes through a maximum energy barrier, and subsequently passes through a shallow minimum, which is referred to as the secondary minimum.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.zeta-meter.com/5min.pdf|title = The DLVO theory explains the tendency of colloids to agglomerate or remain discrete.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}</ref>\n\nAt maximum energy barrier, repulsion is greater than attraction. Particles rebound after interparticle contact, and remain dispersed throughout the medium. The maximum energy needs to be greater than the thermal energy. Otherwise, particles will aggregate due to the attraction potential.<ref name=\":1\" /> The height of the barrier indicates how stable the system is. Since particles have to overcome this barrier in order to aggregate, two particles on a collision course must have sufficient [[kinetic energy]] due to their velocity and mass.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the barrier is cleared, then the net interaction is all attractive, and as a result the particles aggregate. This inner region is often referred to as an energy trap since the [[colloid]]s can be considered to be trapped together by [[Van der Waals force]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor a [[colloidal system]], the thermodynamic equilibrium state may be reached when the particles are in deep primary minimum. At primary minimum, attractive forces overpower the repulsive forces at low molecular distances. Particles coagulate and this process is not reversible.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Laboratory of Colloid and Surface Chemistry (LCSC)|url = http://www.colloid.ch/index.php?name=dlvo|website = www.colloid.ch|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}</ref> However, when the maximum energy barrier is too high to overcome, the colloid particles may stay in the secondary minimum, where particles are held together weaker than the primary minimum.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Extended DLVO theory: Electrostatic and non-electrostatic forces in oxide suspensions|author1=Bostr\u00f6m, Deniz |author2=Franks, Ninham |date = |journal = Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 26|volume = 123}}</ref> Particles form weak attractions but are easily redispersed.

This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced\ncounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the [[Gibbs free energy]] of EDL formation.\n\nThe thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the [[Debye screening length]] <math>1/\\kappa</math>.

When two particles approach each other, electrostatic repulsion increases and the interference between their electrical [[Double layer (surface science)|double layers]] increases. Meanwhile, the [[Van der Waals force|Van der Waals]] attraction increases as they get closer. At each distance, the net potential energy of the smaller value is subtracted from the larger value.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://nptel.ac.in/courses/103103033/module3/lecture5.pdf. |title=NPTEL Chemical Engineering Interfacial Engineering |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe combination of these forces results in a deep attractive well, which is referred to as the primary minimum.

Particles rebound after interparticle contact, and remain dispersed throughout the medium. The maximum energy needs to be greater than the thermal energy. Otherwise, particles will aggregate due to the attraction potential.<ref name=\":1\" /> The height of the barrier indicates how stable the system is. Since particles have to overcome this barrier in order to aggregate, two particles on a collision course must have sufficient [[kinetic energy]] due to their velocity and mass.<ref name=\":0\" /> If the barrier is cleared, then the net interaction is all attractive, and as a result the particles aggregate.

The simplified way to derive it is to add the two parts together.\n\n===van der Waals attraction===\n{{main article|van der Waals force}}\nvan der Waals force is actually the total name of dipole-dipole force, dipole-induced dipole force and dispersion forces,<ref name=\"Jacob\">Jacob N.

This results in the development of a wall surface potential which will attract counterions from the surrounding solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhanced\ncounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the wall charge and minimizes the [[Gibbs free energy]] of EDL formation.\n\nThe thickness of the diffuse electric double layer is known as the [[Debye screening length]] <math>1/\\kappa</math>.

Conflict means [[online harassment]], [[trolling]] and competition which women generally do not like; Criticism refers to women's unwillingness to edit someone else's work and to let their work be edited by someone else; Confidence shows that women are often not too confident about their own expertise and ability in editing and contributing to a certain work.<ref name=\":04\" /> Wikipedia's free to edit policy gives Internet users an open platform, while also unconsciously breeding a competitive and critical environment that limits women's incentives to participate.\n\nThrough examining the power infrastructure of Wikipedia, Ford and Wajcman pointed out another cause that may reinforce Wikipedia's gender bias.

The gender research literature  suggests that  the  difference  in  contribution  rates  could  be  due  to three factors:  (1) the high levels of conflict in discussions, (2)  dislike  of  critical  environments,  and  (3)  lack  of confidence in editing other contributors' work.<ref>https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2145204.2145265</ref><ref name=nytimes20jun2015>{{cite web |author1 = Andrew Lih |title = Can Wikipedia Survive? |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |website = www.nytimes.com |accessdate = 21 June 2015 |location = Washington |date = 20 June 2015 |quote = ...the considerable and often-noted gender gap among Wikipedia editors; in 2011, less than 15 percent were women. |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150621032208/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/21/opinion/can-wikipedia-survive.html |archivedate = 21 June 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=EditorSurveys>Statistics based on Wikimedia Foundation Wikipedia editor surveys [https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AEditor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf&page=1 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702163818/https://wikimediafoundation.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AEditor_Survey_Report_-_April_2011.pdf&page=1 |date=2 July 2017 }} (Nov. 2010-April 2011) and [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011 November 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605124632/https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011 |date=5 June 2016 }} (April \u2013 October 2011)</ref><ref name=PLOS>{{cite journal |last1 = Hill |first1 = Benjamin Mako |last2 = Shaw |first2 = Aaron |last3 = S\u00e1nchez |first3 = Angel |title = The Wikipedia Gender Gap Revisited: Characterizing Survey Response Bias with Propensity Score Estimation |journal = PLoS ONE |date = 26 June 2013 |volume = 8 |issue = 6 |pages = e65782 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0065782 |pmid = 23840366 |pmc = 3694126 |bibcode = 2013PLoSO...865782H |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Consequently, Wikipedia has been criticized by some academics and journalists for having primarily male contributors,<ref name=Cohen110130 /><ref>{{cite web |url = http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4291/3381 |title = \"Free as in sexist?\": Free culture and the gender gap |work = [[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]] |accessdate = 10 October 2015 |author = Reagle, Joseph |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150520205049/http://firstmonday.org/article/view/4291/3381 |archivedate = 20 May 2015 |df = dmy-all |author-link = Joseph Reagle }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2/ |title = Joseph Reagle on the gender gap in geek culture |date = 26 February 2013 |accessdate = 10 October 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015917/http://surprisinglyfree.com/2013/02/26/joseph-reagle-2/ |archivedate = 17 November 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> and for having fewer and less extensive articles about women or topics important to women.

The authors found that when editors determine if a subject is notable enough to include on Wikipedia, they hold women to a higher standard of notability, resulting in women on Wikipedia being slightly more notable than men on Wikipedia. As for topical bias, biographies about women tend to focus more on family-, gender-, and relationship-related topics. This is especially true for biographies of women born before 1900. The authors also found structural differences in terms of meta-data and hyperlinks, which have consequences for information-seeking activities.\n\nA 2017 study found that women participating in an experiment by editing a Wikipedia-like site tended to view other editors as male, and to view their responses as more critical than if the other editor was [[gender-neutral]].

Conflict means [[online harassment]], [[trolling]] and competition which women generally do not like; Criticism refers to women's unwillingness to edit someone else's work and to let their work be edited by someone else; Confidence shows that women are often not too confident about their own expertise and ability in editing and contributing to a certain work.<ref name=\":04\" /> Wikipedia's free to edit policy gives Internet users an open platform, while also unconsciously breeding a competitive and critical environment that limits women's incentives to participate.\n\nThrough examining the power infrastructure of Wikipedia, Ford and Wajcman pointed out another cause that may reinforce Wikipedia's gender bias. Editing on Wikipedia requires \"particular forms of [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical]] expertise and authority that constitute the knowledge or [[epistemological]] infrastructure of Wikipedia\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|date=August 2017|title='Anyone can edit', not everyone does: Wikipedia's infrastructure and the gender gap|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume=47|issue=4|pages=511\u2013527|doi=10.1177/0306312717692172|pmid=28791929|issn=0306-3127|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/1/Wajcman_Anyone%20can%20edit_Final_2017.pdf|access-date=8 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919063205/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68675/1/Wajcman_Anyone%20can%20edit_Final_2017.pdf|archive-date=19 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>  People who are equipped with this expertise and skill are considered more likely to reach positions with power in Wikipedia.
