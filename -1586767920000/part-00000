It saw action in [[World War II]] with [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where they later named it the '''Maryland'''.\n\n==Design and development==\n\nIn response to a [[United States Army Air Corps]] light bomber requirement issued in 1938, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] produced its '''Model 167''', which was given the official designation '''XA-22'''. Martin's design was a twin-engine all-metal monoplane, capable of around 310&nbsp;mph (500&nbsp;km/h) with a crew of three. The XA-22 was not adopted for operational service in the U.S., as the contract was won by the [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas DB-7]], which became the A-20 Havoc, but Martin received foreign orders, and about 450 of these fast, twin-engined bombers were built.\n\nThe prototype Model 167W was powered by twin-row [[Pratt & Whitney]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|R-1830-37 Twin Wasp]] engines, which were replaced in French production aircraft by single-row nine-cylinder [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] engines, although the Twin Wasps were then restored for the British Maryland. All versions of the Model 167 were armed with six machine guns, four fixed guns in the wings (mainly for ground-attack), one dorsal gun and one ventral gun. In the prototype, these guns were all 0.30&nbsp;in [[Browning Model 1919 machine gun|Browning machine guns]]. The dorsal gun was mounted in a fully retractable turret. The French aircraft used license-built Belgian [[Fabrique Nationale]] FN-Brownings, and used a lighter semi-retractable dorsal turret. The weight saved helped to increase the top speed to {{convert|288|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Martin XA-22 13 April 1939.jpg|thumb|Martin XA-22, 13 April 1939]]\nThe Model 167 was a fairly typical twin-engined bomber of the period. The most unusual feature of the Model 167 was the very narrow fuselage, although it was shared with a number of late prewar contemporaries. The crew of three was carried in two isolated compartments: the [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] sat in the nose below the pilot and the gunner was in the mid-upper twin-[[machine gun]] turret in a separate rear compartment, isolated by a bulkhead.\n\n[[Glenn L. Martin]] doubled the size of the Baltimore factory, and built all 115 aircraft in six months, but they were then prevented from delivering them by a US government [[arms embargo]]. Despite this the French placed an order for an additional 100 aircraft. The embargo was lifted in October 1939, and the 115 aircraft from the first order were delivered by late November 1939. Deliveries then slowed down, and only 25 of the second batch reached France before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]].\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===French service===\n[[File:Captured French Martin 167F at Aleppo 1941.jpg|thumb|A captured French Martin 167F at Aleppo, Syria, in 1941.]]\nFacing a massive [[Nazi Germany|German]] arms buildup and desperate for modern aircraft, the [[French Air Force]] purchased U.S. aircraft of numerous types in the late 1930s. Martin received an order for more than 200 '''167 F'''s which incorporated French equipment such as metric instruments. French officials expected deliveries to begin in January 1939 but the type, locally called the '''Glenn Martin 167 A-3''' entered service only in early 1940.\n\nBecause of the U.S. embargo on arms exports after the beginning of the war, many aircraft were impounded for two months before being shipped to [[Europe]]. When the [[Battle of France]] began, there were only four ''Groupes de bombardement'' (bomber squadrons) equipped. The ''Glenns'' were quickly sent to the front lines where they performed well with their adequate speed and excellent manoeuvrability for an aircraft in this class.<ref>[http://www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/news/05_fall/time_capsule.html \"The Martin Maryland goes to war, 23 October 1941.\" :Fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005010233/http://www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/news/05_fall/time_capsule.html |date=5 October 2012 }} ''Maryland Aviation Museum''. Retrieved: 2 July 2012/</ref> In about 400 sorties, they suffered a 4 per cent loss rate, much better than the 16 per cent endured by [[LeO 451]] crews against similar targets.\n\nImmediately before the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|June 1940 Armistice]], units flying the Glenn Martin 167 were evacuated to [[French North Africa]] to avoid capture by the Germans. One of them landed in Spain and was interned, being tested by the [[Spanish Air Force]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Some examples were transferred to the [[Aviation Navale|A\u00e9ronautique Navale]]. During [[Vichy France|Vichy rule]] of the [[French colonial empires|French empire]], French Martins bombed [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth forces]], most notably during the [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]] of 1941.<ref>Documented in the memoirs of [[Roald Dahl]] and [[John Masters]] (''The Road Past Mandalay'') (1961.)</ref> As French North Africa got back in the Allied camp in 1943, M.167s were replaced with more modern Allied types, including the [[Martin B-26 Marauder]]. Approximately 215 Martin 167s were delivered to France.\n\n===British service===\n[[File:Martin Maryland bombers in NAfrica 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Martin Maryland bombers fly past in formation, North Africa 1941]]\nJust before the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|Franco-German Armistice]], the remaining 75 aircraft on the French order were signed over to the United Kingdom; 32 Marylands had been completed to French specifications and were converted to British requirements in the UK. Engines were changed from the [[Wright R-1820|Cyclone 9]] to the [[Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp]] and various weapons and instruments were replaced. The last 43 of the order were completed as required by Glenn Martin. All these aircraft became the '''Maryland Mk.I'''. A further 150 aircraft had been ordered directly by Britain with two-speed [[supercharger]]s on their Twin Wasps as the '''Maryland Mk.II'''.<ref>[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_martin_maryland.html Military History Encyclopedia on the Web: Weapons - Martin Maryland]</ref>\n\nMany of the aircraft were shipped to [[Egypt]] and [[Malta]] in time for the 1941 fighting there.

It saw action in [[World War II]] with [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]], where they later named it the '''Maryland'''.\n\n==Design and development==\n\nIn response to a [[United States Army Air Corps]] light bomber requirement issued in 1938, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] produced its '''Model 167''', which was given the official designation '''XA-22'''. Martin's design was a twin-engine all-metal monoplane, capable of around 310&nbsp;mph (500&nbsp;km/h) with a crew of three. The XA-22 was not adopted for operational service in the U.S., as the contract was won by the [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Douglas DB-7]], which became the A-20 Havoc, but Martin received foreign orders, and about 450 of these fast, twin-engined bombers were built.\n\nThe prototype Model 167W was powered by twin-row [[Pratt & Whitney]] [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|R-1830-37 Twin Wasp]] engines, which were replaced in French production aircraft by single-row nine-cylinder [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] engines, although the Twin Wasps were then restored for the British Maryland. All versions of the Model 167 were armed with six machine guns, four fixed guns in the wings (mainly for ground-attack), one dorsal gun and one ventral gun. In the prototype, these guns were all 0.30&nbsp;in [[Browning Model 1919 machine gun|Browning machine guns]]. The dorsal gun was mounted in a fully retractable turret. The French aircraft used license-built Belgian [[Fabrique Nationale]] FN-Brownings, and used a lighter semi-retractable dorsal turret. The weight saved helped to increase the top speed to {{convert|288|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Martin XA-22 13 April 1939.jpg|thumb|Martin XA-22, 13 April 1939]]\nThe Model 167 was a fairly typical twin-engined bomber of the period. The most unusual feature of the Model 167 was the very narrow fuselage, although it was shared with a number of late prewar contemporaries. The crew of three was carried in two isolated compartments: the [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] sat in the nose below the pilot and the gunner was in the mid-upper twin-[[machine gun]] turret in a separate rear compartment, isolated by a bulkhead.\n\n[[Glenn L. Martin]] doubled the size of the Baltimore factory, and built all 115 aircraft in six months, but they were then prevented from delivering them by a US government [[arms embargo]]. Despite this the French placed an order for an additional 100 aircraft. The embargo was lifted in October 1939, and the 115 aircraft from the first order were delivered by late November 1939. Deliveries then slowed down, and only 25 of the second batch reached France before the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]].\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===French service===\n[[File:Captured French Martin 167F at Aleppo 1941.jpg|thumb|A captured French Martin 167F at Aleppo, Syria, in 1941.]]\nFacing a massive [[Nazi Germany|German]] arms buildup and desperate for modern aircraft, the [[French Air Force]] purchased U.S. aircraft of numerous types in the late 1930s. Martin received an order for more than 200 '''167 F'''s which incorporated French equipment such as metric instruments. French officials expected deliveries to begin in January 1939 but the type, locally called the '''Glenn Martin 167 A-3''' entered service only in early 1940.\n\nBecause of the U.S. embargo on arms exports after the beginning of the war, many aircraft were impounded for two months before being shipped to [[Europe]]. When the [[Battle of France]] began, there were only four ''Groupes de bombardement'' (bomber squadrons) equipped. The ''Glenns'' were quickly sent to the front lines where they performed well with their adequate speed and excellent manoeuvrability for an aircraft in this class.<ref>[http://www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/news/05_fall/time_capsule.html \"The Martin Maryland goes to war, 23 October 1941.\" :Fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005010233/http://www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/news/05_fall/time_capsule.html |date=5 October 2012 }} ''Maryland Aviation Museum''. Retrieved: 2 July 2012/</ref> In about 400 sorties, they suffered a 4 per cent loss rate, much better than the 16 per cent endured by [[LeO 451]] crews against similar targets.\n\nImmediately before the [[Armistice with France (Second Compi\u00e8gne)|June 1940 Armistice]], units flying the Glenn Martin 167 were evacuated to [[French North Africa]] to avoid capture by the Germans. One of them landed in Spain and was interned, being tested by the [[Spanish Air Force]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Some examples were transferred to the [[Aviation Navale|A\u00e9ronautique Navale]].

Approximately 215 Martin 167s were delivered to France.\n\n===British service===\n[[File:Martin Maryland bombers in NAfrica 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Martin Maryland bombers fly past in formation, North Africa 1941]]\nJust before the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|Franco-German Armistice]], the remaining 75 aircraft on the French order were signed over to the United Kingdom; 32 Marylands had been completed to French specifications and were converted to British requirements in the UK. Engines were changed from the [[Wright R-1820|Cyclone 9]] to the [[Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp]] and various weapons and instruments were replaced. The last 43 of the order were completed as required by Glenn Martin. All these aircraft became the '''Maryland Mk.I'''. A further 150 aircraft had been ordered directly by Britain with two-speed [[supercharger]]s on their Twin Wasps as the '''Maryland Mk.II'''.<ref>[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_martin_maryland.html Military History Encyclopedia on the Web: Weapons - Martin Maryland]</ref>\n\nMany of the aircraft were shipped to [[Egypt]] and [[Malta]] in time for the 1941 fighting there.

The most Retinger was able to achieve was to push through the [[Sikorski-Mayski Agreement]], signed on 30 July 1941, which provided for the formation of the [[Anders' army]], thus ridding Stalin of the immediate human problem posed by the hundreds of thousands of Polish [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s and deportees from the [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u201345)|Soviet occupied]] [[Kresy Zachodnie|Kresy]] regions of the former [[Second Polish Republic]], who after an arduous odyssey across thousands of miles would eventually end up as the [[United Kingdom]]'s human problem.<ref>{{cite book|author=Anders, Lt.-General W\u0142adys\u0142aw|title= An Army in Exile|publisher= MacMillan & Co.

He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{harvnb|Schumann|1982}}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Jensen|2001}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Litzmann|1913}}</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvatertanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}}</ref> In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=20}}</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].<ref>J\u00e4nisch W, Nauhaus G. \"Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document\", ''Zentralbl Allg Pathol'' 1986; 132: 129\u201336.</ref> In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.<ref>Scott M. \"Musical hallucinations from meningioma\", ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' 1979; 241: 1683. {{pmid|430721}}</ref> It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,<ref>Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\"], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562</ref> or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 }}</ref>\n\nSchumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.

({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283u\u02d0man|lang}}; 8 June 1810{{spaced ndash}}29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a [[virtuoso]] pianist. His teacher, [[Friedrich Wieck]], a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.\n\nIn 1840, after a long and acrimonious legal battle with Wieck, who opposed the marriage, Schumann married Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]]. A lifelong partnership in music began, as Clara herself was an established pianist and music prodigy. Clara and Robert also maintained a close relationship with German composer [[Johannes Brahms]].\n\nUntil 1840, Schumann wrote exclusively for the piano. Later, he composed piano and orchestral works, and many [[Lied]]er (songs for voice and piano). He composed four [[Symphony|symphonies]], one [[opera]], and other orchestral, [[choral]], and [[chamber music|chamber]] works. His best-known works include ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', ''[[Kinderszenen]]'', ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', and the ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]''. Schumann was known for infusing his music with characters through motifs, as well as references to works of literature. These characters bled into his editorial writing in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (New Journal for Music), a [[Leipzig]]-based publication that he co-founded.\n\nSchumann suffered from a [[mental disorder]] that first manifested in 1833 as a severe [[melancholic depression|melancholic depressive]] episode\u2014which recurred several times alternating with phases of \"exaltation\" and increasingly also delusional ideas of being poisoned or threatened with metallic items. What is now thought to have been a combination of [[bipolar disorder]] and perhaps [[mercury poisoning]] led to \"manic\" and \"depressive\" periods in Schumann's compositional productivity. After a suicide attempt in 1854, Schumann was admitted at his own request to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] in [[Endenich]] near [[Bonn]]. Diagnosed with ''psychotic [[melancholia]]'', he died of pneumonia two years later at the age of 46, without recovering from his mental illness.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[File:Schumannhaus ALT.JPG|thumb|left|Schumann's birth house, now the [[Robert Schumann House]], after an anonymous colourized lithograph]]\n[[File:Rob.Schumann.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of Robert Schumann in the museum of [[Zwickau]]]]\n\nSchumann was born in [[Zwickau]], in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] (today [[Central Germany (cultural area)|Central Germany]]), the fifth and last child of Johanna Christiane (n\u00e9e Schnabel) and August Schumann.<ref>{{harvnb|Ostwald|1985|p=11}}</ref> Schumann began to compose before the age of seven, but his boyhood was spent in the cultivation of literature as much as music\u2014undoubtedly influenced by his father, a bookseller, publisher, and novelist.<ref>{{harvnb|Schumann|1982}}</ref>\n\nAt age seven, Schumann began studying general music and piano with Johann Gottfried Kuntzsch, a teacher at the Zwickau high school. The boy immediately developed a love of music, and worked on his own compositions, without the aid of Kuntzsch. Even though he often disregarded the principles of musical composition, he created works regarded as admirable for his age. The ''Universal Journal of Music'' 1850 supplement included a biographical sketch of Schumann that noted, \"It has been related that Schumann, as a child, possessed rare taste and talent for portraying feelings and characteristic traits in melody,\u2014ay, he could sketch the different dispositions of his intimate friends by certain figures and passages on the piano so exactly and comically that everyone burst into loud laughter at the similitude of the portrait.\"<ref>[[Eric Himy]], pianist, Recording ''Homage to Schumann'', CD Notes, (Centaur, 2006), CEN 2858, chosen by BBC December 2007 as CD of the month, includes \"Kinderscenen\", \"Tr\u00e4umerei\"</ref>\n\nAt age 14, Schumann wrote an essay on the aesthetics of music and also contributed to a volume, edited by his father, titled ''Portraits of Famous Men''. While still at school in Zwickau, he read the works of the German poet-philosophers [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], as well as [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and the [[Tragedy#Ancient Greek tragedy|Greek tragedians]]. His most powerful and permanent literary inspiration was [[Jean Paul]], a German writer whose influence is seen in Schumann's youthful novels ''Juniusabende'', completed in 1826, and ''Selene''.\n\nSchumann's interest in music was sparked by attending a performance of [[Ignaz Moscheles]] playing at [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]], and he later developed an interest in the works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. His father, who had encouraged his musical aspirations, died in 1826 when Schumann was 16. Thereafter, neither his mother nor his guardian encouraged him to pursue a music career. In 1828, Schumann left high school, and after a trip during which he met the poet [[Heinrich Heine]] in Munich, he left to study law at the University of Leipzig under family pressure. But in Leipzig Schumann instead focused on improvisation, song composition, and writing novels. He also began to seriously study piano with Friedrick Wieck, a well-known piano teacher. In 1829, he continued his law studies in [[Heidelberg]], where he became a lifelong member of [[Corps Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg]].\n\n{{See also|German Student Corps|Corps}}\n\n===1830\u201334===\n[[File:Robert-Schumann-Haus.JPG|thumb|upright|Schumann's music room in Zwickau]]\n\nDuring [[Eastertide]] 1830, he heard the Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] play in [[Frankfurt]]. In July he wrote to his mother, \"My whole life has been a struggle between Poetry and Prose, or call it Music and Law.\" With her permission, by Christmas he was back in Leipzig, at age 20 taking piano lessons from his old master [[Friedrich Wieck]], who assured him that he would be a successful concert pianist after a few years' study with him.<ref>{{harvnb|Perrey|2007|p=11}}</ref> During his studies with Wieck, some stories claim that Schumann permanently injured a finger on his right hand. Wieck claimed that Schumann damaged his finger by using a mechanical device that held back one finger while he exercised the others\u2014which was supposed to strengthen the weakest fingers.<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Jensen|2001}}</ref> [[Clara Schumann]] discredited the story, saying the disability was not due to a mechanical device, and Robert Schumann himself referred to it as \"an affliction of the whole hand.\" Some argue that, as the disability appeared to have been chronic and have affected the hand, and not just a finger, it was not likely caused by a finger strengthening device.<ref>{{cite journal| jstor= 954772 | first= Eric| last= Sams | title= Schumann's hand injury| journal= The Musical Times| volume= 112| pages= 1156\u20131159| number= 1546 |date= December 1971| doi= 10.2307/954772}}</ref>\n\nSchumann abandoned the idea of a concert career and devoted himself instead to composition. To this end he began a study of music theory under [[Heinrich Dorn]], a German composer six years his senior and, at that time, conductor of the [[Leipzig Opera]].\n\n====''Papillons''====\nSchumann's fusion of literary ideas with musical ones\u2014known as [[program music]]\u2014may have first taken shape in ''[[Papillons]]'', Op. 2 (''Butterflies''), a musical portrayal of events in [[Jean Paul]]'s novel ''Die Flegeljahre''. In a letter from Leipzig dated April 1832, Schumann bids his brothers, \"Read the last scene in Jean Paul's ''Flegeljahre'' as soon as possible, because the ''Papillons'' are intended as a musical representation of that masquerade.\" This inspiration is foreshadowed to some extent in his first written criticism\u2014an 1831 essay on [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|variations on a theme]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', published in the ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung]]''. In it, Schumann\ncreates imaginary characters who discuss Chopin's work: Florestan (the embodiment of Schumann's passionate, voluble side) and Eusebius (his dreamy, introspective side)\u2014the counterparts of Vult and Walt in ''Flegeljahre.'' They call on a third, Meister Raro, for his opinion. Raro may represent either the composer himself, Wieck's daughter [[Clara Schumann|Clara]], or the combination of the two (Cla'''ra''' + '''Ro'''bert).\n\nIn the winter of 1832, at age 22, Schumann visited relatives in Zwickau and [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]], where he performed the first movement of his ''Symphony in G minor'' (without opus number, known as the \"Zwickauer\"). In Zwickau, the music was performed at a concert given by Clara Wieck, who was then just 13 years old. On this occasion Clara played bravura Variations by [[Henri Herz]], a composer whom Schumann was already deriding as a philistine.<ref>Robert Schumann, musical Journal</ref> Schumann's mother said to Clara, \"You must marry my Robert one day.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Litzmann|1913}}</ref> The ''Symphony in G minor'' was not published during Schumann's lifetime but has been played and recorded in recent times.\n\nThe 1833 deaths of Schumann's brother Julius and his sister-in-law Rosalie in the [[Second cholera pandemic (1829-1851)|worldwide cholera pandemic]] brought on a [[Major depressive disorder|severe depressive]] episode.\n\n[[File:Robert Schumann in youth.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A youthful Robert Schumann]]\n\n====''Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik''====\nBy spring 1834, Schumann had sufficiently recovered to inaugurate ''[[Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik|Die Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik]]'' (\"New Journal for Music\"), first published on 3 April 1834. In his writings, Schumann created a fictional music society based on people in his life, called the ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndler]]'', named after the biblical King David who fought against the Philistines. Schumann published most of his critical writings in the journal, and often lambasted the popular taste for flashy technical displays from figures whom Schumann perceived as inferior composers, or \"philistines\". Schumann campaigned to revive interest in major composers of the past, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. He also promoted the work of some contemporary composers, including [[Chopin]] (about whom Schumann famously wrote, \"Hats off, Gentlemen! A genius!\")<ref>[[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]'s notes, Favourite Chopin</ref> and [[Hector Berlioz]], whom he praised for creating music of substance. On the other hand, Schumann disparaged the school of [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. Among Schumann's associates at this time were composers [[Norbert Burgm\u00fcller]] and [[Ludwig Schuncke]] (to whom Schumann dedicated his ''Toccata in C'').\n\nDuring the summer of 1834 Schumann became engaged to 16-year-old Ernestine von Fricken, the adopted daughter of a rich Bohemian-born noble. In August 1835, he learned that Ernestine von Fricken was born illegitimate, which meant that she would have no dowry. Fearful that her limited means would force him to earn his living like a \"day-labourer,\" Schumann made a complete break with her toward the end of the year. He felt a growing attraction to 15-year-old Clara Wieck. They made mutual declarations of love in December in Zwickau, where Clara appeared in concert. His budding romance with Clara was disrupted when her father learned of their trysts during the Christmas holidays. He summarily forbade them further meetings, and ordered all their correspondence burnt.\n\n====''Carnaval''====\n''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', Op. 9 (1834) is one of Schumann's most characteristic piano works. Schumann begins nearly every section of ''Carnaval'' with a [[musical cryptogram]], the musical notes signified in German by the letters that spell [[A\u0161|Asch]] (A, E-flat, C, and B, or alternatively A-flat, C, and B; in German these are A, Es, C and H, and As, C and H respectively), the [[Bohemia]]n town in which Ernestine was born, and the notes are also the musical letters in Schumann's own name. Eusebius and Florestan, the imaginary figures appearing so often in his critical writings, also appear, alongside brilliant imitations of Chopin and Paganini. To each of these characters he devotes a section of ''Carnaval''. The work comes to a close with a march of the ''Davidsb\u00fcndler''\u2014the league of [[King David]]'s men against the [[Philistines]]\u2014in which may be heard the clear accents of truth in contest with the dull clamour of falsehood embodied in a [[Musical quotation|quotation]] from the seventeenth century ''[[Grossvatertanz|Grandfather's Dance]]''. The march, a step nearly always in duple meter, is here in 3/4 time (triple meter). The work ends in joy and a degree of mock-triumph. In ''Carnaval'', Schumann went further than in ''Papillons'', by conceiving the story as well as the musical representation (and also displaying a maturation of compositional resource).\n\n===1835\u201339===\nOn 3 October 1835, Schumann met [[Felix Mendelssohn]] at Wieck's house in Leipzig, and his enthusiastic appreciation of that artist<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=134}}</ref> was shown with the same generous freedom that distinguished his acknowledgement of the greatness of Chopin and other colleagues, and later prompted him to publicly pronounce the then-unknown [[Johannes Brahms]] a genius.\n[[File:Andreas Staub - Clara Wieck (Lithographie 1839, cropped).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|[[Clara Wieck]] in an idealized lithograph by [[Andreas Staub]], c. 1839]]\n[[File:Friedrich Wieck um 1838.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Friedrich Wieck]] in a sketch by [[Pauline Viardot-Garcia]], around 1838]]\n\nIn 1837 Schumann published his ''[[Symphonic Studies (Schumann)|Symphonic Studies]]'', a complex set of ''\u00e9tude''-like variations written in 1834\u20131835, which demanded a finished piano technique. These variations were based on a theme by the adoptive father of Ernestine von Fricken. The work\u2014described as \"one of the peaks of the piano literature, lofty in conception and faultless in workmanship\" [Hutcheson]\u2014was dedicated to the young English composer [[William Sterndale Bennett]], for whom Schumann had had a high regard when they worked together in Leipzig.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe ''[[Davidsb\u00fcndlert\u00e4nze]]'', Op.&nbsp;6, (also published in 1837 despite the low opus number) literally \"Dances of the League of David\", is an embodiment of the struggle between enlightened Romanticism and musical philistinism. Schumann credited the two sides of his character with the composition of the work (the more passionate numbers are signed F. (Florestan) and the more dreamy signed E. (Eusebius)). The work begins with the \"motto of C.&nbsp;W.\" (Clara Wieck) denoting her support for the ideals of the ''Davidsbund''. The ''Bund'' was a music society of Schumann's imagination, members of which were kindred spirits (as he saw them) such as Chopin, Paganini and Clara, as well as the personalized Florestan and Eusebius.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''[[Kinderszenen]]'', Op. 15, completed in 1838 and a favourite of Schumann's piano works, depicts the innocence and playfulness of childhood. The \"Tr\u00e4umerei\" in F major, No. 7 of the set, is one of the most famous piano pieces ever written, and has been performed in myriad forms and transcriptions. It has been the favourite [[Encore (concert)|encore]] of several great pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]]. Melodic and deceptively simple, the piece is \"complex\" in its harmonic structure.<ref>[[Alban Berg]], replying to charges that modern music was overly complex, pointed out that ''Kinderszenen'' is constructed on a complex base.</ref>\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Kreisleriana]], Op. 16 (1838)\n| filename    = Robert Schumann Kreisleriana Op. 16 N3 Giorgi Latsabidze.ogg\n| title       = N8.

[[Johannes Kreisler]] was a fictional musician created by poet [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]], and characterized as a \"romantic brought into contact with reality.\" Schumann used the figure to express \"fantastic and mad\" emotional states. According to [[Ernest Hutcheson#Works|Hutcheson (\"The Literature of the Piano\")]], this work is \"among the finest efforts of Schumann's genius. He never surpassed the searching beauty of the slow movements (Nos. 2, 4, 6) or the urgent passion of others (Nos. 1, 3, 5, 7) [\u2026] To appreciate it a high level of aesthetic intelligence is required [\u2026] This is no facile music, there is severity alike in its beauty and its passion.\"\n\nThe ''[[Fantasie in C (Schumann)|Fantasie in C]]'', Op. 17, composed in the summer of 1836, is a work of passion and deep pathos, imbued with the spirit of the late Beethoven. Schumann intended to use proceeds from sales of the work toward the construction of [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|a monument to Beethoven]], who had died in 1827. The first movement of the ''Fantasie'' contains a [[Musical quotation|musical quote]] from Beethoven's song cycle, ''[[An die ferne Geliebte]]'', Op. 98 (at the Adagio coda, taken from the last song of the cycle). The original titles of the movements were ''Ruins'', ''Triumphal Arch'', and ''The Starry Crown''. According to [[Franz Liszt]],<ref>Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''</ref> who played the work for Schumann and to whom it was dedicated, the ''Fantasie'' was apt to be played too heavily, and should have a dreamier (''tr\u00e4umerisch'') character than vigorous German pianists tended to impart. Liszt also said: \"It is a noble work, worthy of Beethoven, whose career, by the way, it is supposed to represent\".<ref>Anton Strelezki: ''Personal Recollections of Chats with Liszt''. London, 1893.</ref> Again, according to Hutcheson: \"No words can describe the Phantasie, no quotations set forth the majesty of its genius. It must suffice to say that it is Schumann's greatest work in large form for piano solo.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n{{listen\n| header   = [[Arabeske (Schumann)|Arabeske in C major, Op. 18 (1839)]]\n| filename    = Schumann-arabeske-andrea-valori.ogg\n| title       = Arabeske (Schumann)\n| description = [[Mario Andrea Valori]], piano, 2011\n| format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nAfter a visit to [[Vienna]], during which he discovered [[Franz Schubert]]'s previously unknown [[Symphony No. 9 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 9 in C]], in 1839 Schumann wrote the ''[[Faschingsschwank aus Wien]]'' (''Carnival Prank from Vienna''). Most of the joke is in the central section of the first movement, which makes a thinly veiled reference to ''[[La Marseillaise]]''. (Vienna had banned the song due to harsh memories of [[Napoleon]]'s invasion.) The festive mood does not preclude moments of melancholic introspection in the Intermezzo.\n\n===1840\u201349===\nFrom 1832 to 1839, Schumann wrote almost exclusively for piano, but in 1840 alone he wrote at least 138 songs. Indeed, 1840 (the ''Liederjahr'' or ''year of song'') is highly significant in Schumann's musical legacy, despite his earlier deriding of works for piano and voice as inferior.\n\nAfter a long and acrimonious legal battle with her father, Schumann married Clara Wieck on 12 September 1840, at [[Leipzig-Sch\u00f6nefeld|Sch\u00f6nefeld]], the day before her 21st birthday. Had they waited another day, they would no longer have required her father's consent. Their marriage supported a remarkable business partnership, with Clara  acting as an inspiration, critic, and confidante to her husband. Despite her delicate appearance, she was an extremely strong-willed and energetic woman, who kept up a demanding schedule of concert tours in between bearing several children. Two years after their marriage, Friedrich Wieck at last reconciled himself with the couple, eager to see his grandchildren.\n\nPrior to the legal case and subsequent marriage, the lovers exchanged love letters and rendezvoused in secret. Robert often waited for hours in a cafe in a nearby city just to see Clara for a few minutes after one of her concerts. The strain of this long courtship and its consummation may have led to this great outpouring of Lieder (vocal songs with piano accompaniment). This is evident in ''Widmung'', for example, where he uses the melody from [[Franz Schubert|Schubert's]] [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|''Ave Maria'']] in the postlude in homage to Clara. Schumann's biographers attribute the sweetness, doubt, and despair of these songs to the emotions aroused by his love for Clara and the uncertainties of their future together.\n\nRobert and Clara had eight children, Emil (1846\u20131847), who died at 1 year; Marie (1841\u20131929); Elise (1843\u20131928); Julie (1845\u20131872); Ludwig (1848\u20131899); Ferdinand (1849\u20131891); [[Eugenie Schumann|Eugenie]] (1851\u20131938); and Felix (1854\u20131879).\n\n[[File:Robert and Clara Schumann.jpg|thumb|The stylized profiles of Clara and Robert Schumann]]\n\nHis chief song-cycles in this period were settings of the ''[[Liederkreis, Op. 39|Liederkreis]]'' of [[Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff|Joseph von Eichendorff]], Op. 39 (depicting a series of moods relating to or inspired by nature); the ''[[Frauenliebe und -leben]]'' of [[Adelbert von Chamisso|Chamisso]], Op. 42 (relating the tale of a woman's marriage, childbirth and widowhood); the ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' of [[Heinrich Heine|Heine]], Op. 48 (depicting a lover rejected, but coming to terms with his painful loss through renunciation and forgiveness); and ''Myrthen'', a collection of songs, including poems by Goethe, [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert|R\u00fcckert]], Heine, Byron, [[Robert Burns|Burns]] and Moore. The songs ''Belsatzar'', Op. 57 and ''Die beiden Grenadiere'', Op. 49, both to Heine's words, show Schumann at his best as a ballad writer, although the dramatic ballad is less congenial to him than the introspective lyric. The Op. 35, 40 and 98a sets (words by [[Justinus Kerner]], Chamisso and Goethe respectively), although less well known, also contain songs of lyric and dramatic quality.\n\n{{listen\n | header       = Andante and Variations, Op. 46 (1843)<br />Performed by Neal and Nancy O'Doan (pianos), Carter Enyeart and Toby Saks (cellos) and Christopher Leuba (horn)\n | filename     = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Introduction, Theme and Variations 01-05.ogg\n | title        = Introduction, Theme and Variations 1\u20135\n | format       = [[ogg]]\n | description  =\n | filename2    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 06-10.ogg\n | title2       = Variations 6\u201310\n | format2      = [[ogg]]\n | description2 =\n | filename3    = Robert Schumann - Andante and Variations - Variations 11-15.ogg\n | title3       = Variations 11\u201315\n | format3      = [[ogg]]\n | description3 =\n | image        = none\n}}\n\nIn 1841 he wrote two of his four symphonies, [[Symphony No. 1 (Schumann)|No. 1 in B-flat]], Op. 38, ''Spring'' and [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|No. 4 in D minor]] (the latter a pioneering work in \"cyclic form\", was performed that year but published only much later after revision and extensive re-orchestration as Op. 120). He devoted 1842 to composing chamber music, including the [[Piano Quintet (Schumann)|Piano Quintet in E-flat]], Op. 44, now one of his best known and most admired works; the [[Piano Quartet (Schumann)|Piano Quartet]] and [[String Quartets (Schumann)|three string quartets]]. In 1843 he wrote ''[[Paradise and the Peri]]'', his first attempt at concerted vocal music, an [[oratorio]] style work based on ''[[Lalla-Rookh]]'' by [[Thomas Moore]]. After this, his compositions were not confined to any one form during any particular period.\n\nThe stage in his life when he was deeply engaged in setting Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' to music (1844\u201353) was a turbulent one for his health. He spent the first half of 1844 with Clara on tour in Russia, and his depression grew worse as he felt inferior to Clara as a musician. On returning to Germany, he abandoned his editorial work and left Leipzig for [[Dresden]], where he suffered from persistent \"[[nervous prostration]]\". As soon as he began to work, he was seized with fits of shivering and an apprehension of death, experiencing an abhorrence of high places, all metal instruments (even keys), and drugs. Schumann's diaries also state that he suffered perpetually from imagining that he had the [[A (musical note)#Designation by octave|note A5]] sounding in his ears.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHis state of unease and [[neurasthenia]] is reflected in his [[Symphony No. 2 (Schumann)|Symphony in C]], numbered second but third in order of composition, in which the composer explores states of exhaustion, obsession, and depression, culminating in Beethovenian spiritual triumph. Also published in 1845 was his [[Piano Concerto (Schumann)|Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 54]], originally conceived and performed as a one-movement ''Fantasy for Piano and Orchestra'' in 1841. It is one of the most popular and oft-recorded of all piano concertos; according to Hutcheson \"Schumann achieved a masterly work and we inherited the finest piano concerto since Mozart and Beethoven\".<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n[[File:Robert u Clara Schumann 1847.jpg|thumb|left|Robert and Clara Schumann in 1847, lithograph with a personal dedication]]\n\nIn 1846, he felt he had recovered. In the winter, the Schumanns revisited Vienna, traveling to [[Prague]] and Berlin in the spring of 1847 and in the summer to Zwickau, where he was received with enthusiasm. This pleased him, since until that time he was famous in only Dresden and Leipzig.\n\nHis only opera, ''[[Genoveva]]'', Op. 81, premiered in Spring 1850.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|1997|p=334}}</ref> In it, Schumann attempted to abolish [[recitative]], which he regarded as an interruption to the musical flow (an influence on [[Richard Wagner]]; Schumann's consistently flowing melody can be seen as a forerunner to Wagner's ''Melos''). The subject of ''Genoveva''\u2014based on [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Christian Friedrich Hebbel]]'s plays\u2014was not seen an ideal choice. The text is often considered to lack dramatic qualities; the work has not remained in the repertoire. As early as 1842 the possibilities of German opera had been keenly realized by Schumann, who wrote, \"Do you know my prayer as an artist, night and morning? It is called 'German Opera.' Here is a real field for enterprise ... something simple, profound, German\". And in his notebook of suggestions for the text of operas are found amongst others: ''[[Nibelung]]en'', ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' and ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]''.\n\nThe music to [[Lord Byron|Byron]]'s ''[[Manfred]]'' was written in 1849, the overture of which is one of Schumann's most frequently performed orchestral works. The [[May Uprising in Dresden|insurrection of Dresden]] caused Schumann to move to [[Kreischa]], a little village a few miles outside the city. In August 1849, on the occasion of the centenary of Goethe's birth, completed scenes of Schumann's ''[[Scenes from Goethe's Faust]]'' were performed in Dresden, Leipzig and [[Weimar]]. Liszt gave him assistance and encouragement. The rest of the work was written later in 1849, and the overture (which Schumann described as \"one of the sturdiest of [his] creations\") in 1853.\n\n===After 1850===\n[[File:Schumann-photo1850.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Schumann in an 1850 [[daguerreotype]]]]\n\nFrom 1850 to 1854, Schumann composed in a wide variety of genres. Critics have disputed the quality of his work at this time; a widely held view has been that his music showed signs of mental breakdown and creative decay. More recently, critics have suggested that the changes in style may be explained by \"lucid experimentation\".<ref name=\":1\">{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1850, Schumann succeeded [[Ferdinand Hiller]] as musical director at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], but he was a poor conductor and quickly aroused the opposition of the musicians. According to [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his 1967 ''The Great Conductors'': \"The great composer was impossible on the platform ... There is something heartrending about poor Schumann's epochal inefficiency as a conductor.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse |url-access=registration |author=[[Harold C. Schonberg]] |title=The Great Conductors |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1967 |page=[https://archive.org/details/greatconductors0000unse/page/126 126]}}</ref> His contract was eventually terminated. By the end of that year he completed his [[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Symphony No. 3, \"Rhenish\"]] (a work containing five movements and whose 4th movement is apparently intended to represent an episcopal coronation ceremony). In 1851 he revised what would be published as his [[Symphony No. 4 (Schumann)|fourth symphony]]. From 1851 to 1853 he visited Switzerland, Belgium and Leipzig.\n\nOn 30 September 1853, the 20-year-old composer [[Johannes Brahms]] arrived unannounced at the door of the Schumanns carrying a letter of introduction from violinist [[Joseph Joachim]]. (Schumann was not at home, and would not meet Brahms until the next day.) Brahms amazed Clara and Robert with his music, stayed with them for several weeks, and became a close family friend. (He later worked closely with Clara to popularize Schumann's compositions during her long widowhood.)\n\nDuring this time Schumann, Brahms and Schumann's pupil [[Albert Dietrich]] collaborated on the composition of the ''[[F-A-E Sonata|''F-A-E'' Sonata]]'' for Joachim; Schumann also published an article, \"Neue Bahnen\" (\"New Paths\") in the ''Neue Zeitschrift'' (his first article in many years), hailing the unknown young Brahms from Hamburg, a man who had published nothing, as \"the Chosen One\" who \"was destined to give ideal expression to the times.\"<ref>Robert Schumann's \"Artikel Neue Bahnen\", 28 October 1853</ref> It was an extraordinary way to present Brahms to the musical world, setting up great expectations that he did not fulfill for many years.<ref>Brahms' [[A German Requiem (Brahms)|''A German Requiem'']], published in 1868, brought the first widespread recognition of his talent.</ref> In January 1854, Schumann went to [[Hanover]], where he heard a performance of his ''Paradise and the Peri'' organized by Joachim and Brahms. Two years later at Schumann's request, the work received its first English performance conducted by [[William Sterndale Bennett]].\n[[File:Bonn graveyard robert schumann 20080509.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of Robert and Clara Schumann at [[Bonn]]]]\n\nSchumann returned to D\u00fcsseldorf and began to edit his complete works and make an anthology on the subject of music. He suffered a renewal of the symptoms that had threatened him earlier. Besides the single note sounding in his ear (possibly evidence of [[tinnitus]],<ref name=\":0\" />) he imagined that voices sounded in his ear and he heard angelic music.<ref name=\":0\" /> One night he suddenly left his bed, having dreamt or imagined that a ghost (purportedly the spirit of either Schubert or Mendelssohn) had dictated a \"spirit theme\" to him. The theme was one he had used several times before: in his Second String Quartet, again in his ''Lieder-Album f\u00fcr die Jugend'', and finally in the slow movement of his [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]]. In the days leading up to his suicide attempt, Schumann wrote five variations on this theme for the piano, his last completed work, today known as the ''[[Geistervariationen]]'' (Ghost Variations).<ref>{{cite web |first=Joseph |last=Stevenson |title=Robert Schumann: Variations on an original theme, for piano in E flat major (\"Geister-Variationen\"), WoO 24 |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/composition/variations-on-an-original-theme-for-piano-in-e-flat-major-geister-variationen-woo-24-mc0002377594 |accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> Brahms published it in a supplementary volume to the complete edition of Schumann's piano music. In 1861 Brahms published his ''Variations for Piano Four Hands'', Op. 23, based on this theme.\n\n[[File:Robertschumann.jpg|thumb|upright|Robert Schumann monument at his birthplace [[Zwickau]], Germany]]\n\n===Final illness and death===\nIn late February 1854, Schumann's symptoms increased, the angelic visions sometimes being replaced by demonic ones. He warned Clara that he feared he might do her harm. On 27 February, he attempted suicide by throwing himself from a bridge into the [[Rhine]] River (his elder sister Emilie had committed suicide in 1825, possibly by drowning herself). Rescued by boatmen and taken home, he asked to be taken to an asylum for the insane. He entered Dr. Franz Richarz's [[sanatorium]] in [[Endenich]], a quarter of [[Bonn]], and remained there until he died on 29 July 1856 at the age of 46. During his confinement, he was not allowed to see Clara, although Brahms was free to visit him. Clara finally visited him two days before his death. He appeared to recognize her, but was able to speak only a few words.<ref>{{harvnb|Daverio|Sams|2001|p=20}}</ref>\n\nGiven his reported symptoms, one modern view is that he died from [[syphilis]], which he could have contracted during his student days, and which could have remained latent during most of his marriage.<ref>Reich, Nancy B., ''Clara Schumann: The Artist and the Woman,'' Cornell University Press, 1985, p. 151.</ref> According to studies by the musicologist and literary scholar [[Eric Sams]], Schumann's symptoms during his terminal illness and death appear consistent with those of [[mercury poisoning]]; mercury was a common treatment for syphilis and other conditions. Another possibility is that his neurological problems were the result of an intracranial mass. A report by Janisch and Nauhaus on Schumann's autopsy indicates that he had a \"gelatinous\" tumor at the base of the brain; it may have represented a [[colloid cyst]], a [[craniopharyngioma]], a [[chordoma]], or a chordoid [[meningioma]].<ref>J\u00e4nisch W, Nauhaus G. \"Autopsy report of the corpse of the composer Robert Schumann: publication and interpretation of a rediscovered document\", ''Zentralbl Allg Pathol'' 1986; 132: 129\u201336.</ref> In particular, meningiomas are known to produce musical auditory hallucinations such as Schumann reported.<ref>Scott M. \"Musical hallucinations from meningioma\", ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' 1979; 241: 1683. {{pmid|430721}}</ref> It has also been hypothesised that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], or [[schizoaffective disorder]]; bipolar type,<ref>Yasmeen Cooper and Mark Agius, [http://www.psychiatria-danubina.com/UserDocsImages/pdf/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207/dnb_vol30_noSuppl%207_559.pdf \"Does Schizoaffective Disorder Explain the Mental Illness of Robert Schumann and Vincent Van Gogh?\"], Psychiatria Danubina, 2018; Vol. 30, Suppl. 7, pp 559-562</ref> or [[bipolar disorder]] and [[bipolar II disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/4/325 |title=Robert Schumann's contribution to the genetics of psychosis |first=Katharina |last=Domschke |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=196 |issue=4 |page=325 |date=March 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2015|doi=10.1192/bjp.196.4.325 |pmid=20357311 }}</ref>\n\nSchumann heard a persistent A-note at the end of his life. It was a form of tinnitus, or perhaps an auditory hallucination related to his major depressive episode. At times, he had musical hallucinations that were longer than just the single A, but his diaries include comments about hearing that annoying single note.<ref>Moore, Lindsay. \"Since You Asked ...,\" Robert Schumann: Then, Now and Always.

From mid-career on, she mainly performed music by leading composers. A hired cook and housekeeper tended to the children while she traveled. In 1856, she first visited England. The critics received Robert's music coolly, with [[Henry Fothergill Chorley]] being particularly harsh. She returned to London in 1865 and made regular appearances there in later years, often performing chamber music with the violinist [[Joseph Joachim]] and others. She became the authoritative editor of her husband's works for [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. It was rumoured that she and Brahms destroyed many of Schumann's later works, which they thought were tainted by his madness, but only the ''Five Pieces for Cello and Piano'' are known to have been destroyed. Most of Schumann's late works, particularly the [[Violin Concerto (Schumann)|Violin Concerto]], the ''Fantasy for Violin and Orchestra'' and the Violin Sonata No. 3, all from 1853, have entered the repertoire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|left|Birthplace of Robert Schumann in Zwickau in 2005]]\n[[File:GDR stamp Robert Schumann 1956-vertical.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[East Germany]] 1956 Schumann/Schubert error: Schubert's music is on the top stamp, and Schumann's on the bottom]]\n[[File:1960 CPA 2422.jpg|thumb|upright|1960 [[Russian Post#Soviet Union|Post of the USSR]] stamp marking the 150th anniversary of Schumann's birth.]]\n\nSchumann had considerable influence in the nineteenth century and beyond, despite his adoption of more conservative modes of composition after his marriage. He left an array of acclaimed music in virtually all the forms then known. Partly through his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Brahms, Schumann's ideals and musical vocabulary became widely disseminated. Composer Sir [[Edward Elgar]] called Schumann \"my ideal.\"\n\nSchumann has often been confused with Austrian composer [[Franz Schubert]]; one well-known example occurred in 1956, when [[East Germany]] issued a pair of postage stamps featuring Schumann's picture against an open score that featured Schubert's music.
