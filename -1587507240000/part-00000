The S100A1 homodimer is high affinity (nanomolar range or tighter), and is formed through [[hydrophobic]] packing of an X-type 4-helix bundle created between helices 1, 1', 4, and 4'. [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] structural information on the homodimeric form of this protein shows that each monomer is helical and contains two [[EF hand|EF-hand calcium-binding loops]]; one in the [[N-terminus]] and a canonical [[EF hand]] in the [[C-terminus]] having higher [[calcium]] affinity ([[dissociation constant]] of roughly 20 micromolar). The two [[EF hand]] domains neighbor each other in three dimensional space, and are connected to each other through a short [[beta sheet]] region (residues 27\u201329 and 68\u201370).\n\nUpon binding calcium, helix 3 of S100A1 re-orients from being relatively antiparallel to [[alpha helix|helix]] 4 to being roughly perpendicular.  This conformational change is different from most [[EF hand]]s, in that the entering helix, and not the exiting helix, moves.  This conformational change exposes a large hydrophobic pocket between helix 3, 4, and the hinge region of S100A1 that is involved in virtually all [[calcium]]-dependent target protein interactions.  These biophysical properties seem to be well conserved across the S100 family of proteins.  Helix 3, 4, and the hinge region are the most divergent areas between individual S100 proteins, and so it is likely that the sequence of these regions is pivotal in fine-tuning calcium-dependent target binding by S100 proteins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=NT|last2=Cannon|first2=BR|last3=Zimmer|first3=DB|last4=Weber|first4=DJ|title=S100A1: Structure, Function, and Therapeutic Potential.|journal=Current Chemical Biology|date=1 May 2009|volume=3|issue=2|pages=138\u2013145|pmid=19890475|doi=10.2174/2212796810903020138|pmc=2771873}}</ref> [[S-Nitrosylation]] of S100A1 at [[cysteine|Cys]]85 reorganizes the conformation of S100A1 at the [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] helix and the linker connecting the two [[EF hand]] domains.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lenar\u010di\u010d \u017divkovi\u0107|first1=M|last2=Zar\u0119ba-Kozio\u0142|first2=M|last3=Zhukova|first3=L|last4=Pozna\u0144ski|first4=J|last5=Zhukov|first5=I|last6=Wys\u0142ouch-Cieszy\u0144ska|first6=A|title=Post-translational S-nitrosylation is an endogenous factor fine tuning the properties of human S100A1 protein.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=23 November 2012|volume=287|issue=48|pages=40457\u201370|pmid=22989881|doi=10.1074/jbc.m112.418392|pmc=3504761}}</ref>\n\nThe most accurate high-resolution solution structure of human apo-S100A1 protein (PDB accession code: 2L0P) has been determined by means of NMR spectroscopy in 2011.<ref name=\"pmid21296671\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nowakowski M, Jaremko \u0141, Jaremko M, Zhukov I, Belczyk A, Bierzy\u0144ski A, Ejchart A | title = Solution NMR structure and dynamics of human apo-S100A1 protein | journal = Journal of Structural Biology | volume = 174 | issue = 2 | pages = 391\u20139 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21296671 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsb.2011.01.011 | url = http://eprints.ibb.waw.pl/454/1/manuscript.doc }}</ref>\n\nS100 genes include at least 19 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Donato R | title = Functional roles of S100 proteins, calcium-binding proteins of the EF-hand type | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1450 | issue = 3 | pages = 191\u2013231 | date = Jul 1999 | pmid = 10395934 | doi=10.1016/s0167-4889(99)00058-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicki R, Sch\u00e4fer BW, Erne P, Heizmann CW | title = Characterization of the human and mouse cDNAs coding for S100A13, a new member of the S100 protein family | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 227 | issue = 2 | pages = 594\u20139 | date = Oct 1996 | pmid = 8878558 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1551 }}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\nS100 proteins are localized in the [[cytoplasm]] and/or [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as [[cell cycle]] progression and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]].

The S100A1 homodimer is high affinity (nanomolar range or tighter), and is formed through [[hydrophobic]] packing of an X-type 4-helix bundle created between helices 1, 1', 4, and 4'. [[Protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] structural information on the homodimeric form of this protein shows that each monomer is helical and contains two [[EF hand|EF-hand calcium-binding loops]]; one in the [[N-terminus]] and a canonical [[EF hand]] in the [[C-terminus]] having higher [[calcium]] affinity ([[dissociation constant]] of roughly 20 micromolar). The two [[EF hand]] domains neighbor each other in three dimensional space, and are connected to each other through a short [[beta sheet]] region (residues 27\u201329 and 68\u201370).\n\nUpon binding calcium, helix 3 of S100A1 re-orients from being relatively antiparallel to [[alpha helix|helix]] 4 to being roughly perpendicular.  This conformational change is different from most [[EF hand]]s, in that the entering helix, and not the exiting helix, moves.  This conformational change exposes a large hydrophobic pocket between helix 3, 4, and the hinge region of S100A1 that is involved in virtually all [[calcium]]-dependent target protein interactions.  These biophysical properties seem to be well conserved across the S100 family of proteins.  Helix 3, 4, and the hinge region are the most divergent areas between individual S100 proteins, and so it is likely that the sequence of these regions is pivotal in fine-tuning calcium-dependent target binding by S100 proteins.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=NT|last2=Cannon|first2=BR|last3=Zimmer|first3=DB|last4=Weber|first4=DJ|title=S100A1: Structure, Function, and Therapeutic Potential.|journal=Current Chemical Biology|date=1 May 2009|volume=3|issue=2|pages=138\u2013145|pmid=19890475|doi=10.2174/2212796810903020138|pmc=2771873}}</ref> [[S-Nitrosylation]] of S100A1 at [[cysteine|Cys]]85 reorganizes the conformation of S100A1 at the [[C-terminus|C-terminal]] helix and the linker connecting the two [[EF hand]] domains.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lenar\u010di\u010d \u017divkovi\u0107|first1=M|last2=Zar\u0119ba-Kozio\u0142|first2=M|last3=Zhukova|first3=L|last4=Pozna\u0144ski|first4=J|last5=Zhukov|first5=I|last6=Wys\u0142ouch-Cieszy\u0144ska|first6=A|title=Post-translational S-nitrosylation is an endogenous factor fine tuning the properties of human S100A1 protein.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=23 November 2012|volume=287|issue=48|pages=40457\u201370|pmid=22989881|doi=10.1074/jbc.m112.418392|pmc=3504761}}</ref>\n\nThe most accurate high-resolution solution structure of human apo-S100A1 protein (PDB accession code: 2L0P) has been determined by means of NMR spectroscopy in 2011.<ref name=\"pmid21296671\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nowakowski M, Jaremko \u0141, Jaremko M, Zhukov I, Belczyk A, Bierzy\u0144ski A, Ejchart A | title = Solution NMR structure and dynamics of human apo-S100A1 protein | journal = Journal of Structural Biology | volume = 174 | issue = 2 | pages = 391\u20139 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21296671 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsb.2011.01.011 | url = http://eprints.ibb.waw.pl/454/1/manuscript.doc }}</ref>\n\nS100 genes include at least 19 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Donato R | title = Functional roles of S100 proteins, calcium-binding proteins of the EF-hand type | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1450 | issue = 3 | pages = 191\u2013231 | date = Jul 1999 | pmid = 10395934 | doi=10.1016/s0167-4889(99)00058-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicki R, Sch\u00e4fer BW, Erne P, Heizmann CW | title = Characterization of the human and mouse cDNAs coding for S100A13, a new member of the S100 protein family | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 227 | issue = 2 | pages = 594\u20139 | date = Oct 1996 | pmid = 8878558 | doi = 10.1006/bbrc.1996.1551 }}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\nS100 proteins are localized in the [[cytoplasm]] and/or [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as [[cell cycle]] progression and [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]].

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An aerial view of Interstate 5 and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|An aerial view of Interstate 5 and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.
