Rock operas are typically released as [[concept album]]s and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from [[opera]]s, although several have been adapted as [[rock musical]]s. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as [[rap opera]].\n\n== History ==\nIn an early use of the term, the July 4, 1966, edition of ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]]'' (published in Toronto) reported that \"[[Bruce Cockburn]] and Mr [[William Hawkins (songwriter and poet)|[William] Hawkins]] are working on a Rock Opera, operating on the premise that to write you need only 'something to say'.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Maconie|title=The People\u2019s Songs: The Story of Modern Britain in 50 Records|date=2013|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xmq82qoq70C&pg=PA167}}</ref>\n\nColin Fleming of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' described ''[[The Story of Simon Simopath]]'' (1967) by British psychedelic band [[Nirvana (British band)|Nirvana]] as an \"early foray into the rock opera sub-genre\".<ref name=atlantic>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/the-who-made-the-best-rock-opera-ever-but-its-not-the-one-you-think/248431/|title=The Who Made the Best Rock Opera Ever, but It's Not the One You Think|last=Fleming|first=Colin|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=2011-11-15|accessdate=2014-05-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140524142611/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/11/the-who-made-the-best-rock-opera-ever-but-its-not-the-one-you-think/248431/|archivedate=May 24, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Neil Strauss of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that ''[[S.F.

However, there is no copyright for a reproduction, whether by photograph or even a painted reproduction, since there is no original creativity. One famous court case which explained that was ''[[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.]]'' in 1999: The \"skill, labor or judgment merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality . . . .\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/36_FSupp2d_191.htm \"BRIDGEMAN ART LIBRARY, LTD. v.

Getty has over 200 million items for sale, most of which have been scanned and digitized to be sold and distributed online. Its vast collection includes many images of two-dimensional public domain works. Other digital libraries, including [[ARTstor]] and Art Resource, have claimed copyright over images they supply and imposed restrictions on how the images can be used.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|16}}\n\n===Original artworks, manuscripts and archives===\nBesides online digital libraries, a number of libraries, archives and museums which hold original manuscripts, photos and fine art, have claimed to have a copyright over copies they make of those items because they possess the original. However, many of those items were created before the 20th century and have become part of the public domain. One example that Mazzone gives is that of the [[American Antiquarian Society]], which has a large archive of early American documents. Its terms and conditions for obtaining a copy of any of those documents requires agreeing to their license, along with payment.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|16}}<ref>[https://www.americanantiquarian.org/license.pdf American Antiquarian Society license]</ref>\n\nAnother repository, the [[New York State Historical Association]]'s [[Fenimore Art Museum]] in New York, similarly requires that a user of its archive first agree to their terms before visiting or reproducing anything from its collection of nineteenth and early twentieth century photographs, most of which have long become part of the public domain.<ref>[https://www.fenimoreartmuseum.org/privacy-terms-copyright Fenimore Art Museum terms and conditions]</ref>\n\n[[File:VanGogh-starry night.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of public domain works by artists such as [[van Gogh]] are often printed by museums with a questionable copyright notice.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1042}}]]\nAccording to Mazzone, archives and museums typically assert ownership of copyrights where none exists, and wrongly require a user agree to their license and terms and conditions.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|17}} Former president of the [[Society of American Archivists]], Peter Hirtle, has written that \"many repositories would like to maintain a kind of quasi-copyright-like control over the further use of materials in their holding, comparable to the monopoly granted to a copyright owner.\"<ref>Hirtle Peter.\"Archives or Assets?\", ''The American Archivist'': Fall/Winter 2003, Vol. 66, No. 2, pp. 235-247</ref> Mazzone, for one, finds the trend of false claims of copyright by public, taxpayer supported institutions, especially troubling: \"We should be able to expect in return that public domain works be left in the public domain.\" Although he credits the [[Library of Congress]] among the shrinking list of archives that properly states whether a work is copyrighted.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|18}}\n\nThe [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], for example, includes in its vast collection of artworks many from the nineteenth century.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|17}} Although they have become part of the public domain, the museum claims they own the copyrights to them and therefore requires a visitor to agree to its terms before obtaining a copy of any works, i.e.: \"The Images are not simple reproductions of the works depicted and are protected by copyright... The MFA regularly makes images available for reproduction and publication in, for example, research papers and textbooks ...\"<ref>[https://www.mfa.org/collections/mfa-images/terms-and-conditions MFA-Boston Terms and Conditions]</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it remains standard practice for museums and repositories to claim rights over images of material in their collections, and to charge reproduction fees. In November 2017, 27 prominent art historians, museum curators and critics wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, to urge that \"fees charged by the UK's national museums to reproduce images of historic paintings, prints and drawings are unjustified, and should be abolished\". They commented that \"[m]useums claim they create a new copyright when making a faithful reproduction of a 2D artwork by photography or scanning, but it is doubtful that the law supports this\". They argued that the fees inhibit the dissemination of knowledge, the very purpose of public museums and galleries, and so \"pose a serious threat to art history\". Therefore, they advised the UK's national museums \"to follow the example of a growing number of international museums (such as the Netherlands' [[Rijksmuseum]]) and provide open access to images of publicly owned, out-of-copyright paintings, prints and drawings so that they are free for the public to reproduce\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Bendor|display-authors=et al|last=Grosvenor |author-link=Bendor Grosvenor |title=Museums' fees for image reproduction |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=November 6, 2017 |page=34}}</ref>\n\n===Public domain films===\nThe owners of the actual physical copies of public domain footage often impose restrictions on its use along with charging licensing fees. The result is that documentary filmmakers have in many cases found it nearly impossible to either make a film or else have dropped projects entirely. In one example, filmmaker [[Gordon Quinn]] of [[Kartemquin Films]] in Chicago learned that the public domain federal government footage he wanted to use in a film was considered copyrighted by a director who then wanted payment to use it.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|18}} Similarly, Stanford professor Jan Krawitz needed to incorporate a public domain clip into an instructional film, but the archive who had the film made no distinction between copyrighted works and public domain works, thereby requiring her to pay a substantial fee.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|18}}\n\nAccording to [[Matt Dunne]], who wrote about this problem in a popular filmmaking trade journal, filmmakers are now \"abandoning projects because of cost or self-censoring materials...the sense in the [independent filmmaker]] community is that the problem [of clearance authorization] has reached a crisis point.\"<ref>Dunne, Matt. [http://independent-magazine.org/files/2014/09/independentmagaz28foun.pdf \"The Cost of Clearance\"], ''The Independent'', April 2005 pp. 30-31</ref> As a result, ''MovieMaker'' magazine, another trade journal, suggests that producers should \"never assume that any film clip is in the public domain.\"<ref>[https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/how-to-avoid-a-lawsuit-in-waiting-3256/ \"How to Avoid a Lawsuit in Waiting\"], ''MovieMaker'', Feb. 11, 2003</ref> Mazzone describes this new \"licensing culture\" as becoming an entrenched norm built on fear of using any prior work without permission.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|19}} These clearance fees are typically a major portion of a film's budget, which leads more producers to simply cut any footage out of a film rather than deal with obtaining permissions. The industry motto, according to entertainment attorney Fernando Ramirez, is \"When in doubt, cut it out.\"<ref>[http://independent-magazine.org/2005/12/many-meanings-fair-use/ \"The Many Meanings of \u201cFair Use\"], ''Independent'' magazine, Dec. 1, 2005</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=As a practical matter it is usually too expensive and difficult to file a lawsuit to establish that a copyright claim is spurious.

The Copyright Act provides for no civil penalty for falsely claiming ownership of public domain materials. There is also no remedy under the Act for individuals who wrongly refrain from legal copying or who make payment for permission to copy something they are in fact entitled to use for free. While falsely claiming copyright is technically a criminal offense under the Act, prosecutions are extremely rare. These circumstances have produced fraud on an untold scale, with millions of works in the public domain deemed copyrighted, and countless dollars paid out every year in licensing fees to make copies that could be made for free. Copyfraud stifles valid forms of reproduction and undermines free speech.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>}}\n\nHe also adds that \"[C]opyfraud upsets the constitutional balance and undermines First Amendment values\", chilling free expression and stifling creativity.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1029\u201330}}\n\n==Relevant U.S. and foreign laws==\n[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|left|Modern editions of public domain books hundreds of years old, such as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), are often sold under a claim of copyright by the new publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/false-copyright-claims.html |title=False copyright claims are more common than you think |publisher=Public Domain Sherpa |accessdate=2 April 2019 }}</ref>]]\n\nIn the U.S. Copyright Act, only two sections deal with improper assertions of copyright on public domain materials: Section 506(c) criminalizes fraudulent uses of copyright notices, and Section 506(e) punishes knowingly making a false representation of a material fact in the application for copyright registration.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1036}} Section 512(f) additionally punishes using the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|safe harbor]] provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to remove material the issuer knows is not infringing. \n\nBut the U.S. Copyright Act does not expressly provide for any civil actions to remedy illegal copyright claims over public domain materials, nor does the Act prescribe relief for individuals who have been damaged: either by refraining from copying or by paying for a license to use public domain material.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1030}} Professor [[Peter Suber]] has argued that the U.S. government should \"make the penalties for copyfraud (false claim of copyright) at least as severe as the penalties for infringement; that is, take the wrongful decrease in the circulation of ideas at least as seriously as the wrongful increase in the circulation of ideas.\"<ref>Suber, Peter.

This includes false claims of copyright ownership of public domain material, or claims to impose copyright restrictions beyond those permitted by the law.\n\nAmerican legal scholar [[Paul J. Heald]] wrote that payment demands for spurious copyright infringement might be resisted in civil lawsuits under a number of commerce-law theories: (1) Breach of warranty of title; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud; and (4) false advertising.<ref>Heald, Paul J.

It ceased paying royalties, and after being sued by the owner of the abandoned copyright, counterclaimed for damages in the amount paid to the owner on a breach of warranty/failure of consideration theory.

However, there is no copyright for a reproduction, whether by photograph or even a painted reproduction, since there is no original creativity. One famous court case which explained that was ''[[Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.]]'' in 1999: The \"skill, labor or judgment merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality . . . .\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/36_FSupp2d_191.htm \"BRIDGEMAN ART LIBRARY, LTD. v.

Getty has over 200 million items for sale, most of which have been scanned and digitized to be sold and distributed online. Its vast collection includes many images of two-dimensional public domain works. Other digital libraries, including [[ARTstor]] and Art Resource, have claimed copyright over images they supply and imposed restrictions on how the images can be used.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|16}}\n\n===Original artworks, manuscripts and archives===\nBesides online digital libraries, a number of libraries, archives and museums which hold original manuscripts, photos and fine art, have claimed to have a copyright over copies they make of those items because they possess the original. However, many of those items were created before the 20th century and have become part of the public domain. One example that Mazzone gives is that of the [[American Antiquarian Society]], which has a large archive of early American documents. Its terms and conditions for obtaining a copy of any of those documents requires agreeing to their license, along with payment.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|16}}<ref>[https://www.americanantiquarian.org/license.pdf American Antiquarian Society license]</ref>\n\nAnother repository, the [[New York State Historical Association]]'s [[Fenimore Art Museum]] in New York, similarly requires that a user of its archive first agree to their terms before visiting or reproducing anything from its collection of nineteenth and early twentieth century photographs, most of which have long become part of the public domain.<ref>[https://www.fenimoreartmuseum.org/privacy-terms-copyright Fenimore Art Museum terms and conditions]</ref>\n\n[[File:VanGogh-starry night.jpg|thumb|Reproductions of public domain works by artists such as [[van Gogh]] are often printed by museums with a questionable copyright notice.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1042}}]]\nAccording to Mazzone, archives and museums typically assert ownership of copyrights where none exists, and wrongly require a user agree to their license and terms and conditions.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|17}} Former president of the [[Society of American Archivists]], Peter Hirtle, has written that \"many repositories would like to maintain a kind of quasi-copyright-like control over the further use of materials in their holding, comparable to the monopoly granted to a copyright owner.\"<ref>Hirtle Peter.\"Archives or Assets?\", ''The American Archivist'': Fall/Winter 2003, Vol. 66, No. 2, pp. 235-247</ref> Mazzone, for one, finds the trend of false claims of copyright by public, taxpayer supported institutions, especially troubling: \"We should be able to expect in return that public domain works be left in the public domain.\" Although he credits the [[Library of Congress]] among the shrinking list of archives that properly states whether a work is copyrighted.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|18}}\n\nThe [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], for example, includes in its vast collection of artworks many from the nineteenth century.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|17}} Although they have become part of the public domain, the museum claims they own the copyrights to them and therefore requires a visitor to agree to its terms before obtaining a copy of any works, i.e.: \"The Images are not simple reproductions of the works depicted and are protected by copyright... The MFA regularly makes images available for reproduction and publication in, for example, research papers and textbooks ...\"<ref>[https://www.mfa.org/collections/mfa-images/terms-and-conditions MFA-Boston Terms and Conditions]</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it remains standard practice for museums and repositories to claim rights over images of material in their collections, and to charge reproduction fees. In November 2017, 27 prominent art historians, museum curators and critics wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, to urge that \"fees charged by the UK's national museums to reproduce images of historic paintings, prints and drawings are unjustified, and should be abolished\". They commented that \"[m]useums claim they create a new copyright when making a faithful reproduction of a 2D artwork by photography or scanning, but it is doubtful that the law supports this\". They argued that the fees inhibit the dissemination of knowledge, the very purpose of public museums and galleries, and so \"pose a serious threat to art history\". Therefore, they advised the UK's national museums \"to follow the example of a growing number of international museums (such as the Netherlands' [[Rijksmuseum]]) and provide open access to images of publicly owned, out-of-copyright paintings, prints and drawings so that they are free for the public to reproduce\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Bendor|display-authors=et al|last=Grosvenor |author-link=Bendor Grosvenor |title=Museums' fees for image reproduction |newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=November 6, 2017 |page=34}}</ref>\n\n===Public domain films===\nThe owners of the actual physical copies of public domain footage often impose restrictions on its use along with charging licensing fees. The result is that documentary filmmakers have in many cases found it nearly impossible to either make a film or else have dropped projects entirely. In one example, filmmaker [[Gordon Quinn]] of [[Kartemquin Films]] in Chicago learned that the public domain federal government footage he wanted to use in a film was considered copyrighted by a director who then wanted payment to use it.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|18}} Similarly, Stanford professor Jan Krawitz needed to incorporate a public domain clip into an instructional film, but the archive who had the film made no distinction between copyrighted works and public domain works, thereby requiring her to pay a substantial fee.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|18}}\n\nAccording to [[Matt Dunne]], who wrote about this problem in a popular filmmaking trade journal, filmmakers are now \"abandoning projects because of cost or self-censoring materials...the sense in the [independent filmmaker]] community is that the problem [of clearance authorization] has reached a crisis point.\"<ref>Dunne, Matt. [http://independent-magazine.org/files/2014/09/independentmagaz28foun.pdf \"The Cost of Clearance\"], ''The Independent'', April 2005 pp. 30-31</ref> As a result, ''MovieMaker'' magazine, another trade journal, suggests that producers should \"never assume that any film clip is in the public domain.\"<ref>[https://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/how-to-avoid-a-lawsuit-in-waiting-3256/ \"How to Avoid a Lawsuit in Waiting\"], ''MovieMaker'', Feb. 11, 2003</ref> Mazzone describes this new \"licensing culture\" as becoming an entrenched norm built on fear of using any prior work without permission.<ref name=Mazzone/>{{rp|19}} These clearance fees are typically a major portion of a film's budget, which leads more producers to simply cut any footage out of a film rather than deal with obtaining permissions. The industry motto, according to entertainment attorney Fernando Ramirez, is \"When in doubt, cut it out.\"<ref>[http://independent-magazine.org/2005/12/many-meanings-fair-use/ \"The Many Meanings of \u201cFair Use\"], ''Independent'' magazine, Dec. 1, 2005</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = MistyRose|quote=As a practical matter it is usually too expensive and difficult to file a lawsuit to establish that a copyright claim is spurious.

The Copyright Act provides for no civil penalty for falsely claiming ownership of public domain materials. There is also no remedy under the Act for individuals who wrongly refrain from legal copying or who make payment for permission to copy something they are in fact entitled to use for free. While falsely claiming copyright is technically a criminal offense under the Act, prosecutions are extremely rare. These circumstances have produced fraud on an untold scale, with millions of works in the public domain deemed copyrighted, and countless dollars paid out every year in licensing fees to make copies that could be made for free. Copyfraud stifles valid forms of reproduction and undermines free speech.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>}}\n\nHe also adds that \"[C]opyfraud upsets the constitutional balance and undermines First Amendment values\", chilling free expression and stifling creativity.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1029\u201330}}\n\n==Relevant U.S. and foreign laws==\n[[File:Wealth of Nations.jpg|thumb|left|Modern editions of public domain books hundreds of years old, such as [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776), are often sold under a claim of copyright by the new publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/false-copyright-claims.html |title=False copyright claims are more common than you think |publisher=Public Domain Sherpa |accessdate=2 April 2019 }}</ref>]]\n\nIn the U.S. Copyright Act, only two sections deal with improper assertions of copyright on public domain materials: Section 506(c) criminalizes fraudulent uses of copyright notices, and Section 506(e) punishes knowingly making a false representation of a material fact in the application for copyright registration.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1036}} Section 512(f) additionally punishes using the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act|safe harbor]] provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] to remove material the issuer knows is not infringing. \n\nBut the U.S. Copyright Act does not expressly provide for any civil actions to remedy illegal copyright claims over public domain materials, nor does the Act prescribe relief for individuals who have been damaged: either by refraining from copying or by paying for a license to use public domain material.<ref name=Copyfraud-NYULR/>{{rp|1030}} Professor [[Peter Suber]] has argued that the U.S. government should \"make the penalties for copyfraud (false claim of copyright) at least as severe as the penalties for infringement; that is, take the wrongful decrease in the circulation of ideas at least as seriously as the wrongful increase in the circulation of ideas.\"<ref>Suber, Peter.

This includes false claims of copyright ownership of public domain material, or claims to impose copyright restrictions beyond those permitted by the law.\n\nAmerican legal scholar [[Paul J. Heald]] wrote that payment demands for spurious copyright infringement might be resisted in civil lawsuits under a number of commerce-law theories: (1) Breach of warranty of title; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud; and (4) false advertising.<ref>Heald, Paul J.

It ceased paying royalties, and after being sued by the owner of the abandoned copyright, counterclaimed for damages in the amount paid to the owner on a breach of warranty/failure of consideration theory.

{"title_page": "Neoromanticism (music)", "text_new": "'''Neoromanticism in music''' is a return (at any of several points in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries) to the emotional expression associated with nineteenth-century [[Romantic music|Romanticism]]. Since the mid-1970s the term has come to be identified with [[neoconservative postmodernism]], especially in Germany, Austria, and the United States, with composers such as [[Wolfgang Rihm]] and [[George Rochberg]]. Currently active [[United States|US]]-based composers widely described as neoromantic include [[David Del Tredici]] and [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] {{harv|Pasler|2001}}. [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Henri Sauguet]] were French composers considered neoromantic {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}} while [[Virgil Thomson]] {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}, [[Nicolas Nabokov]] {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}, [[Howard Hanson]] ({{harvnb|Simmons|2004|loc=111}}; {{harvnb|Barkan|2001|loc=149}}; {{harvnb|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}; {{harvnb|Watanabe and Perone|2001}}) and [[Douglas Moore]] were American composers considered neoromantic {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}.\n\n==Definitions==\nNeoromanticism was a term that originated in literary theory in the early 19th century to distinguish later kinds of romanticism from earlier manifestations. In music, it was first used by [[Richard Wagner]] in his polemical 1851 article \"[[Opera and Drama|Oper und Drama]]\", as a disparaging term for the French romanticism of [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] from 1830 onwards, which he regarded as a degenerated form of true romanticism. The word came to be used by historians of ideas to refer to music from 1850 onwards, and to the work of Wagner in particular. The designation \"neo\" was used to acknowledge the fact that music of the second half of the 19th century remained in a romantic mode in an unromantic age, dominated by [[positivism]], when literature and painting had moved on to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]] {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=98\u201399}}. In the twentieth century, composers such as [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Richard Danielpour]] have been described as neoromantics ({{harvnb|Boone|1983}}; {{harvnb|Hill, Carlin, and Hubbs|2005|loc=64}}).\n\nAccording to Daniel Albright, <blockquote>In the late twentieth century, the term Neoromanticism came to suggest a music that imitated the high emotional saturation of the music of (for example) Schumann [ [[Romanticism#Music|Romanticism]] ], but in the 1920s it meant a subdued and modest sort of emotionalism, in which the excessive gestures of the [[Expressionism|Expressionists]] were boiled down into some solid residue of stable feeling. {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=278\u201380}}</blockquote> Thus, in Albright's view, neoromanticism in the 1920s was not a return to romanticism but, on the contrary, a tempering of an overheated [[post-romanticism]]. See: [[Romantic music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)]].\n\nIn this sense, [[Virgil Thomson]] proclaimed himself to be \"most easily-labeled practitioner [of Neo-Romanticism] in America,\" {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}:\n<blockquote>Neo-Romanticism involves rounded [[melody|melodic]] material (the [[Neoclassicism#Neoclassicism_in_music|neo-Classicists]] affected angular [[theme (music)|themes]]) and the frank expression of personal sentiments. . . . That position is an [[esthetic]] one purely, because technically we are eclectic. Our contribution to contemporary esthetics has been to pose the problems of sincerity in a new way. We are not out to impress, and we dislike inflated emotions. The feelings we really have are the only ones we think worthy of expression. . . . [[Sentimentality|Sentiment]] is our subject and sometimes [[landscape]], but preferably a landscape with figures. ({{harvnb|Hoover and Cage|1959|loc=250}}; {{harvnb|Thomson|2002|loc=268\u201369}})</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Neo-romanticism]]\n*[[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Albright|2004}}|reference=Albright, Daniel. 2004.

Since the mid-1970s the term has come to be identified with [[neoconservative postmodernism]], especially in Germany, Austria, and the United States, with composers such as [[Wolfgang Rihm]] and [[George Rochberg]]. Currently active [[United States|US]]-based composers widely described as neoromantic include [[David Del Tredici]] and [[Ellen Taaffe Zwilich]] {{harv|Pasler|2001}}. [[Francis Poulenc]] and [[Henri Sauguet]] were French composers considered neoromantic {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}} while [[Virgil Thomson]] {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}, [[Nicolas Nabokov]] {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}, [[Howard Hanson]] ({{harvnb|Simmons|2004|loc=111}}; {{harvnb|Barkan|2001|loc=149}}; {{harvnb|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}; {{harvnb|Watanabe and Perone|2001}}) and [[Douglas Moore]] were American composers considered neoromantic {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}.\n\n==Definitions==\nNeoromanticism was a term that originated in literary theory in the early 19th century to distinguish later kinds of romanticism from earlier manifestations. In music, it was first used by [[Richard Wagner]] in his polemical 1851 article \"[[Opera and Drama|Oper und Drama]]\", as a disparaging term for the French romanticism of [[Hector Berlioz]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] from 1830 onwards, which he regarded as a degenerated form of true romanticism. The word came to be used by historians of ideas to refer to music from 1850 onwards, and to the work of Wagner in particular. The designation \"neo\" was used to acknowledge the fact that music of the second half of the 19th century remained in a romantic mode in an unromantic age, dominated by [[positivism]], when literature and painting had moved on to [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]] {{harv|Dahlhaus|1979|loc=98\u201399}}. In the twentieth century, composers such as [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] and [[Richard Danielpour]] have been described as neoromantics ({{harvnb|Boone|1983}}; {{harvnb|Hill, Carlin, and Hubbs|2005|loc=64}}).\n\nAccording to Daniel Albright, <blockquote>In the late twentieth century, the term Neoromanticism came to suggest a music that imitated the high emotional saturation of the music of (for example) Schumann [ [[Romanticism#Music|Romanticism]] ], but in the 1920s it meant a subdued and modest sort of emotionalism, in which the excessive gestures of the [[Expressionism|Expressionists]] were boiled down into some solid residue of stable feeling. {{harv|Albright|2004|loc=278\u201380}}</blockquote> Thus, in Albright's view, neoromanticism in the 1920s was not a return to romanticism but, on the contrary, a tempering of an overheated [[post-romanticism]]. See: [[Romantic music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)]].\n\nIn this sense, [[Virgil Thomson]] proclaimed himself to be \"most easily-labeled practitioner [of Neo-Romanticism] in America,\" {{harv|Thomson|2002|loc=268}}:\n<blockquote>Neo-Romanticism involves rounded [[melody|melodic]] material (the [[Neoclassicism#Neoclassicism_in_music|neo-Classicists]] affected angular [[theme (music)|themes]]) and the frank expression of personal sentiments. . . . That position is an [[esthetic]] one purely, because technically we are eclectic. Our contribution to contemporary esthetics has been to pose the problems of sincerity in a new way. We are not out to impress, and we dislike inflated emotions. The feelings we really have are the only ones we think worthy of expression. . . . [[Sentimentality|Sentiment]] is our subject and sometimes [[landscape]], but preferably a landscape with figures. ({{harvnb|Hoover and Cage|1959|loc=250}}; {{harvnb|Thomson|2002|loc=268\u201369}})</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Neo-romanticism]]\n*[[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k]]\n\n==Sources==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Albright|2004}}|reference=Albright, Daniel. 2004.
