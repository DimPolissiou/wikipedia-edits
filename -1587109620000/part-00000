The single reached No. 11 in Australia, but only 68 in the UK due to distribution problems. It was clear at this point that the hit single career was beginning to wane. A second single from the ''Rock Hard'' album, titled \"Lipstick\", was released in February 1981, but radio refused to play it as they claimed it sounded too much like ''[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]'' by [[Them (band)|Them]].

Quatro also released a cover version of \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" in November 1986, as a duet with [[The Troggs]] singer [[Reg Presley]]. \"Can the Can\"/\"Devil Gate Drive\" were re-released in 1987 as a single and reached number 87 in the UK charts.<ref name=timeline /> She was also part of the [[Ferry Aid]] charity single \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", which was a UK No. 1, 13 years and 26 days after Quatro's last UK No. 1. \n\nIn 1989, Quatro released a prerecorded backing track single \"Baby You're a Star\", which was released in the UK, though it failed to chart. By the late 80's, it was clear that Quatro's hitmaking days were over, though she still recorded persistently despite lack of chart success. During the 1990s, Quatro released four new albums, though ''Unreleased Emotion'' had been recorded several years previously. ''[[What Goes Around \u2013 Greatest & Latest]]'' was released in 1995 and consisted of mainly older hits rerecorded; this proved a success in Denmark. Except for 1999's ''[[Free the Butterfly]]'' [[self-help]] album, it would take a further 11 years for Quatro to release a new album. ''[[Back to the Drive]]'' in 2006 showed a return to Quatro's harder rock roots, rather than the smoother sounds of her previous albums. ''Back to the Drive'' also returned Quatro to the worldwide charts - her first album to do so since 1980's ''Rock Hard''. ''Back to the Drive'' also produced a download only single \"I'll Walk Through the Fire with You\". Quatro released ''[[In the Spotlight]]'' in 2011 with the lead single, \"Whatever Love Is\".

She's never had their best material (they don't play many games with her) and each of her singles has been less gripping than the one before. Unless they suddenly imagine a new joke, she's in danger of petering out and she lacks the resources to fight back. None of her own musical talents has been needed and so they've been ignored (except on the throwaway B-sides) and while Sweet and Mud have their histories and themselves to draw on for support, Suzi's present has nothing to do with her past and her group was formed only to play Chinnichap music. Mud may become a top cabaret act and Sweet a respected rock group, but Suzi will only be a memory. Mickie Most's skill in the '60s was to make pop music out of British blues and R&B and folk; Chinn and Chapman's skill in the '70s has been to make pop music out of an audience. As this audience ages and changes, so will its music and Suzi Quatro will have been just an affectionate part of growing up.<ref name=\"PhonographFrith1974\" />}}\n\nIn 1983, journalist [[Tom Hibbert]] wrote that Quatro may have overstated her role as a leading light among female rock musicians.

The single reached No. 11 in Australia, but only 68 in the UK due to distribution problems. It was clear at this point that the hit single career was beginning to wane. A second single from the ''Rock Hard'' album, titled \"Lipstick\", was released in February 1981, but radio refused to play it as they claimed it sounded too much like ''[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]'' by [[Them (band)|Them]].

By the late 80's, it was clear that Quatro's hitmaking days were over, though she still recorded persistently despite lack of chart success. During the 1990s, Quatro released four new albums, though ''Unreleased Emotion'' had been recorded several years previously. ''[[What Goes Around \u2013 Greatest & Latest]]'' was released in 1995 and consisted of mainly older hits rerecorded; this proved a success in Denmark. Except for 1999's ''[[Free the Butterfly]]'' [[self-help]] album, it would take a further 11 years for Quatro to release a new album. ''[[Back to the Drive]]'' in 2006 showed a return to Quatro's harder rock roots, rather than the smoother sounds of her previous albums.

As this audience ages and changes, so will its music and Suzi Quatro will have been just an affectionate part of growing up.<ref name=\"PhonographFrith1974\" />}}\n\nIn 1983, journalist [[Tom Hibbert]] wrote that Quatro may have overstated her role as a leading light among female rock musicians. He said that {{quote|...&nbsp;it was in the wake of the 1977 punk revolution that the traditions of rock were turned upside down and female musicians truly came to the fore. But Suzi Quatro, with her tomboy sneers, her bass guitar and her stompingly persuasive teen-tunes, had at least laid down a challenge to the male-dominated rock orthodoxy. On stage in the Eighties, Quatro was still conveying energy and excitement{{snd}} and she still lacked class.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Rock: Oh, Suzi Q!! |year=1983 |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/oh-suzi-q |first=Tom |last=Hibbert}} {{subscription required}}</ref>}}\n\n===Views of scholars===\nIn his 2008 paper ''Suzi Quatro: A prototype in the archsheology {{sic}} of rock'', Frank Oglesbee writes that \"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women\u2014often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens\u2014in rock usually sang songs as person\u00e6 utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends\". He describes Quatro as \"a female rock pioneer, in some ways ''the'' female rock pioneer ... a cornerstone in the archsheology of rock.\" He said she grew up to become \"the first female lead singer and bassist, an electric ax-woman, who sang and played as freely as the males, inspiring other females.\"<ref name=\"archsheology\">\n{{cite journal\n | last = Oglesbee\n | first = Frank W.\n | date = July 24, 2008\n | title = Suzi Quatro: A prototype in the archsheology of rock\n |journal= Popular Music and Society\n | volume = 23\n | issue = 2\n | page = 29\n | doi = 10.1080/03007769908591731\n }}</ref>\n\nPhilip Auslander says that \"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\".

After that is done, there are several scenarios in which a bill may or may not be enacted into law.\n* The president may sign the bill within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This enacts the bill into law.\n* The president may return the bill to Congress with a statement of objections within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This is a \"veto.\"\n* If the president vetoes a bill, the president's objections shall be considered by the Congress. Each house may vote to override the president's veto. If 2/3 of each house agree to override the president's veto, the bill is enacted into law.\n* The president may do nothing, and after 10 days (excluding Sundays) if Congress has not yet adjourned, the bill is enacted into law.\n* The president may do nothing, and if Congress adjourns before the 10th day (excluding Sundays), the bill is not enacted into law. This is known as \"[[pocket veto]]\". (It can't be overridden and must be reintroduced.)\n\nAlthough each case is unique and involves a plethora of influences, one general rule can be acknowledged: presidents use their prerogative to veto legislation when such legislation does not represent their viewpoint or agenda.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=What Time Is It?

There is no record of what constitutes a \"veto threat\" or how many have been made over the years, but it has become a staple of presidential politics and a sometimes effective way of shaping policy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A president may also warn Congress of a veto of a particular bill so as to persuade Congress not to waste time passing particular legislation or including certain provisions in a bill when the president is prepared to veto it.\n\nThis list below contains many of the bills vetoed and pocket vetoed by presidents.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC}}\n\n==Summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!'''#'''\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n! scope=\"col\" | Regular<br>vetoes<ref name=VetoCounts>{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm|title=U.S. Senate: President Veto Counts|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Pocket veto|Pocket<br>vetoes]]<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | Total<br>vetoes<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | Vetoes<br>overridden<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | % of vetoes<br>overridden<ref>Computed by dividing the \"Vetoes overridden\" column by the \"Total vetoes\" column and rounding to the nearest whole number.

After that is done, there are several scenarios in which a bill may or may not be enacted into law.\n* The president may sign the bill within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This enacts the bill into law.\n* The president may return the bill to Congress with a statement of objections within 10 days (excluding Sundays). This is a \"veto.\"\n* If the president vetoes a bill, the president's objections shall be considered by the Congress. Each house may vote to override the president's veto. If 2/3 of each house agree to override the president's veto, the bill is enacted into law.\n* The president may do nothing, and after 10 days (excluding Sundays) if Congress has not yet adjourned, the bill is enacted into law.\n* The president may do nothing, and if Congress adjourns before the 10th day (excluding Sundays), the bill is not enacted into law. This is known as \"[[pocket veto]]\". (It can't be overridden and must be reintroduced.)\n\nAlthough each case is unique and involves a plethora of influences, one general rule can be acknowledged: presidents use their prerogative to veto legislation when such legislation does not represent their viewpoint or agenda.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=What Time Is It? The Use of Power in Four Different Types of Presidential Time | journal=The Journal of Politics | volume=59 | issue=3 | year=1996 | page=683}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally, a president either publicly or privately threatens Congress with a veto to influence the content or passage of legislation. There is no record of what constitutes a \"veto threat\" or how many have been made over the years, but it has become a staple of presidential politics and a sometimes effective way of shaping policy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A president may also warn Congress of a veto of a particular bill so as to persuade Congress not to waste time passing particular legislation or including certain provisions in a bill when the president is prepared to veto it.\n\nThis list below contains many of the bills vetoed and pocket vetoed by presidents.\n\n{{Horizontal TOC}}\n\n==Summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n!'''#'''\n! scope=\"col\" | President\n! scope=\"col\" | Regular<br>vetoes<ref name=VetoCounts>{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/Legislation/Vetoes/vetoCounts.htm|title=U.S. Senate: President Veto Counts|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=July 21, 2016}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Pocket veto|Pocket<br>vetoes]]<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | Total<br>vetoes<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | Vetoes<br>overridden<ref name=VetoCounts />\n! scope=\"col\" | % of vetoes<br>overridden<ref>Computed by dividing the \"Vetoes overridden\" column by the \"Total vetoes\" column and rounding to the nearest whole number.

Already at reduced strength, the regiment was further decimated when a battalion from Fort Devens was redesignated as the Third Battalion, Eighth Cavalry Regiment, and sent to Korea to join the First Cavalry Division.\n\nThe 7th Regiment sailed from San Francisco, California, on 20 August 1950,<ref>Cowart, Glenn C. (1992). ''Miracle In Korea: The Evacuation of X Corps from the Hungnam Beachhead''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press.</ref> and landed in Japan on 16 September 1950. There its strength was augmented by hundreds of [[KATUSA]] (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army\u2014Korean conscripts detailed to serve with U.S. units). Two months later, the regiment embarked again and landed at [[Wonsan]] on Korea's eastern coast on 21 November 1950. It joined with the 15th and 65th Infantry Regiments and moved to the northwest of the Hungnam area where it covered vis-\u00e0-vis [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir order of battle|Task Force Dog]]<ref>Taylor, George O.

During the next two years, the regiment supported 3rd Division's combat operations in the [[Chorwon County|Chorwon]]-[[Cheorwon County|Kumwha]] area, fought at the [[Battle of Jackson Heights]] and Arrowhead outposts, and blocked a [[Battle of Kumsong|PVA push in the Kumsong Area]] in July 1953.\n\nDuring eight campaigns on the Korean battlefield, the elements of the 7th Infantry were awarded Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citations. In addition, the First Battalion, Seventh Infantry Regiment won a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Distinguished Unit Citation]] for its bravery at Choksong, the Second Battalion for its bravery at Kowang-ni and the Third Battalion for bravery at [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)#Korean War|Segok]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.benning.army.mil/museum/outside_tour/monuments/3rd_inf_div.htm|title=US Army National Infantry Museum|author=|date=|website=army.mil|accessdate=22 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam War===\nDuring the Vietnam War, elements of the regiment were assigned to the [[199th Infantry Brigade]].\n\n===Modern era===\nPresently the regiment consists of mechanized infantry units equipped with the M-2 [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]], and a Light Infantry Battalion.\n* 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry, [[Fort Stewart]], Georgia, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division\n* 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry, in 1973\u201375 was a maneuver battalion of the 197th Separate Infantry Brigade then reorganizing and training as the XVIII Airborne Corps heavy force element. The battalion, continuing to be organized as an infantry battalion in the early phase of the 197th Brigade's reorganization into a separate mechanized infantry brigade, performed a number of important missions for the Army during this period one of which was the support of the U. S. Army Infantry Board with a detachment of 69 then 49 soldiers from headquarters and A companies to conduct the Squad Automatic Weapons Developmental/Operational Tests 1 and 2 for four months. Subsequently, the battalion became an element of the 24th Infantry Division and later the battalion operated as a maneuver battalion (light infantry battalion) of 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division Ft. Stewart, Georgia.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Battalions and as already noted the 3rd Battalion were assigned to the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division (United States) at Fort Stewart, Georgia on 16 December 1987. Elements of all three battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment saw action in the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[Kosovo]] and more recently [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. On 16 February 1996, the battalions were assigned to the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]].\n\n;1990\u201391 Gulf War\nThe 1st Battalion 7th Infantry Regiment and the 4th Battalion 7th Infantry Regiment (from Aschaffenburg, Germany) patrolled the Czechoslovakia border with Germany for years in preparation for war with The Soviet Union (USSR). They served during Operation(s) Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and both battalions of the regiment were to serve in the theater of operations. The battalions belonged to 3rd (Phantom) Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. The brigade itself was a round-out brigade for the 1st Armored Division and served as \"Old Ironsides\" lead element 1st brigade. The 4th battalion consisted of 4 companies of the new M2-A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, of which three companies had some augmented mix of M1 Abrams tanks attached from the brigade's 4th Battalion-[[66th Armor Regiment (United States)|66th Armor Regiment]]. Only Bravo company 4/7 \"Blackhawks\" remained wholly infantry. It was the mission of Bravo Company to conduct urban and trench warfare for the battalion. Several regiment personnel received Silver and Bronze Stars with \"V\" devices for their actions during the ground war phase. Both 1/7 and 4/7 participated in the largest tank battle in US history: The Battle of Medina Ridge.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe Battle of Medina Ridge was a decisive tank battle fought during the Gulf War on 27 February 1991, between the U.S. 1st Armored Division and the entrenched 2nd Brigade of the Iraqi Republican Guard Medina Luminous Division outside Basra. It is estimated more than 5,000 vehicles (A mix of tanks, armored fighting vehicles, armored transports, heavy & light trucks-shared by both sides) clashed during this particular engagement. The 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 M1A1 Abrams tanks. The brunt of the fighting at Medina Ridge was conducted by the 3rd (Phantom) Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division which was the only brigade from the 3rd Infantry Division in the war. The brigade replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade and was commanded by Colonel James Riley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMedina Ridge was one of the few battles during Desert Storm in which American forces encountered significant Iraqi resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. During the battle, American forces suffered one fatality (An M3 Bradley Scout driver - SPC Cash-from 4th Battalion, 66th Armor) due to friendly fire, while destroying 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly T-72Ms, Asad Babils, and Type 69s), and 127 armored vehicles. Only four Abrams tanks were hit by direct fire and disabled; none were destroyed. Upon returning from Iraq in May 1991, both battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment and the rest of Phantom Brigade received orders to deactivate and draw down from Aschaffenburg, Germany. During the summer of 1992, 4/7 Infantry regiment closed its doors at Fiori Kaserne for the last time.\n\n;Gulf War\nDuring the Gulf War, two units of the 7th Infantry Regiment fell in the ranks of VII Corps. Corps normally command three divisions at full strength (other units such as artillery, corps-level engineers, and support units are attached as well). However, VII Corps had far more firepower under its command. 2/7 and 3/7 served with the 24th Infantry Division during the first gulf war, deploying from Fort Stewart Georgia, as part of the XVIII Airborne Corps.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nVII Corps' principal combat strength consisted of the following units: U.S. 1st & 3rd Armored Divisions, and U.S. 1st Infantry Division. In addition, the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment (scout force), US 1st Cavalry Division, and British 1st Armored Division, as well as the U.S. 11th Aviation Group were attached for the operation.\n\n;2003\u2013present, Operation Iraqi Freedom\nBoth the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment assigned to 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the regiment's most notable achievements included seizing crossing sites over the Euphrates River and seizing the Iraqi regime's most prized possessions, [[Baghdad International Airport]]. SFC [[Paul Ray Smith]], assigned to Company B, 11th Engineer Battalion, which directly supported 7th Infantry Regiment and was the first soldier awarded the Medal of Honor in the Global War on Terror for his actions in Iraq. They returned to Fort Stewart in September 2003. \n[[File:U.S. Army Spc.

Prior to that, the 3-7th Infantry had been assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. This was a product of 3rd Infantry Division transforming to the new modular [[brigade]] concept after its return from Iraq in late 2003. 2-7th Infantry remained with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, while 3-7th Infantry joined the new 4th Brigade Combat Team. Delta Companies were also established in both 2nd and 3rd Battalions, designated as armor units and its infantry C Companies reorganized under 3-69 AR and 4-64 AR respectively while their C Companies moved under the infantry battalions to form combat arms battalions (CAB). Under transformation, E Companies were added from the 11th Engineer Battalion and forward support companies were added to support the CAB.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAfter a tough train-up period during 2004, the reorganized 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 7th Infantry Regiment deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom III with their respective brigade combat teams (1st and 4th Brigade Combat Teams). 2-7 Infantry deployed to [[Iraq]] for a second tour in December 2004 until January 2006, to Saddam Hussien's hometown of [[Tikrit]]. The 3rd Battalion assumed responsibility of Western Rashid in [[Baghdad]], an area encompassing more than 800,000 Iraqis. The 7th Infantry Regiment's most notable achievement was ensuring the security of over 100 polling sites during two Iraqi national elections.\n\nIn January 2007, 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a third, 15-month tour. The unit served in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], the largest province in Iraq, under the command and control of Multi-National Forces West. TF 2-7 deployed to [[H\u012bt]], with Company C, 2-7 IN attached to TF [[3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment|3-69 AR]] (Speed and Power) in south-central [[Ramadi]]. Cold Steel was instrumental, with its Iraqi Army and Police partners in bringing peace and stability to Ramadi during the [[Anbar Awakening]]. The 2nd Battalion redeployed in April 2008. In 2007 the 4th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was alerted for deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2007. 3-7 Infantry became critical to the success of the surge ordered by President Bush. Numerous Operations were conducted, and most notably Operation Marne Avalanche. One AO in particular (Wasit Provence) was controlled by a single armor platoon of 16 men and was the largest AO in Iraq. The 4th Brigade, including the 3-7th Infantry, continued to serve in that country into 2008.\n\nIn December 2009, 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a fourth time as an advise and assist battalion. B-Co. 2-7 was located south of Baghdad in the town of Mahmudiyah.\n\nFrom July 2010 to July 2011, 3-7 Infantry deployed to [[Ramadi]] with the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation New Dawn (Iraq, 2010\u20132011)|Operation New Dawn]], with Attack Company providing Advise and Assist to the Iraqi Army at [[Al-Taqqaddum Air Base]].

The battalion, continuing to be organized as an infantry battalion in the early phase of the 197th Brigade's reorganization into a separate mechanized infantry brigade, performed a number of important missions for the Army during this period one of which was the support of the U. S. Army Infantry Board with a detachment of 69 then 49 soldiers from headquarters and A companies to conduct the Squad Automatic Weapons Developmental/Operational Tests 1 and 2 for four months. Subsequently, the battalion became an element of the 24th Infantry Division and later the battalion operated as a maneuver battalion (light infantry battalion) of 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division Ft. Stewart, Georgia.\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Battalions and as already noted the 3rd Battalion were assigned to the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division (United States) at Fort Stewart, Georgia on 16 December 1987. Elements of all three battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment saw action in the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Operation Desert Storm]], [[Kosovo]] and more recently [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. On 16 February 1996, the battalions were assigned to the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]].\n\n;1990\u201391 Gulf War\nThe 1st Battalion 7th Infantry Regiment and the 4th Battalion 7th Infantry Regiment (from Aschaffenburg, Germany) patrolled the Czechoslovakia border with Germany for years in preparation for war with The Soviet Union (USSR). They served during Operation(s) Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and both battalions of the regiment were to serve in the theater of operations. The battalions belonged to 3rd (Phantom) Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. The brigade itself was a round-out brigade for the 1st Armored Division and served as \"Old Ironsides\" lead element 1st brigade. The 4th battalion consisted of 4 companies of the new M2-A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, of which three companies had some augmented mix of M1 Abrams tanks attached from the brigade's 4th Battalion-[[66th Armor Regiment (United States)|66th Armor Regiment]]. Only Bravo company 4/7 \"Blackhawks\" remained wholly infantry. It was the mission of Bravo Company to conduct urban and trench warfare for the battalion. Several regiment personnel received Silver and Bronze Stars with \"V\" devices for their actions during the ground war phase. Both 1/7 and 4/7 participated in the largest tank battle in US history: The Battle of Medina Ridge.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe Battle of Medina Ridge was a decisive tank battle fought during the Gulf War on 27 February 1991, between the U.S. 1st Armored Division and the entrenched 2nd Brigade of the Iraqi Republican Guard Medina Luminous Division outside Basra. It is estimated more than 5,000 vehicles (A mix of tanks, armored fighting vehicles, armored transports, heavy & light trucks-shared by both sides) clashed during this particular engagement. The 1st Armored Division, commanded by Major General Ron Griffith, consisted of some 3,000 vehicles including 348 M1A1 Abrams tanks. The brunt of the fighting at Medina Ridge was conducted by the 3rd (Phantom) Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division which was the only brigade from the 3rd Infantry Division in the war. The brigade replaced 1st Armored Division's 1st Brigade and was commanded by Colonel James Riley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMedina Ridge was one of the few battles during Desert Storm in which American forces encountered significant Iraqi resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. During the battle, American forces suffered one fatality (An M3 Bradley Scout driver - SPC Cash-from 4th Battalion, 66th Armor) due to friendly fire, while destroying 186 Iraqi tanks (mostly T-72Ms, Asad Babils, and Type 69s), and 127 armored vehicles. Only four Abrams tanks were hit by direct fire and disabled; none were destroyed. Upon returning from Iraq in May 1991, both battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment and the rest of Phantom Brigade received orders to deactivate and draw down from Aschaffenburg, Germany. During the summer of 1992, 4/7 Infantry regiment closed its doors at Fiori Kaserne for the last time.\n\n;Gulf War\nDuring the Gulf War, two units of the 7th Infantry Regiment fell in the ranks of VII Corps. Corps normally command three divisions at full strength (other units such as artillery, corps-level engineers, and support units are attached as well). However, VII Corps had far more firepower under its command. 2/7 and 3/7 served with the 24th Infantry Division during the first gulf war, deploying from Fort Stewart Georgia, as part of the XVIII Airborne Corps.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nVII Corps' principal combat strength consisted of the following units: U.S. 1st & 3rd Armored Divisions, and U.S. 1st Infantry Division. In addition, the U.S. 2nd Cavalry Regiment (scout force), US 1st Cavalry Division, and British 1st Armored Division, as well as the U.S. 11th Aviation Group were attached for the operation.\n\n;2003\u2013present, Operation Iraqi Freedom\nBoth the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment assigned to 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the regiment's most notable achievements included seizing crossing sites over the Euphrates River and seizing the Iraqi regime's most prized possessions, [[Baghdad International Airport]]. SFC [[Paul Ray Smith]], assigned to Company B, 11th Engineer Battalion, which directly supported 7th Infantry Regiment and was the first soldier awarded the Medal of Honor in the Global War on Terror for his actions in Iraq. They returned to Fort Stewart in September 2003. \n[[File:U.S. Army Spc.

Prior to that, the 3-7th Infantry had been assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. This was a product of 3rd Infantry Division transforming to the new modular [[brigade]] concept after its return from Iraq in late 2003. 2-7th Infantry remained with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, while 3-7th Infantry joined the new 4th Brigade Combat Team. Delta Companies were also established in both 2nd and 3rd Battalions, designated as armor units and its infantry C Companies reorganized under 3-69 AR and 4-64 AR respectively while their C Companies moved under the infantry battalions to form combat arms battalions (CAB). Under transformation, E Companies were added from the 11th Engineer Battalion and forward support companies were added to support the CAB.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAfter a tough train-up period during 2004, the reorganized 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 7th Infantry Regiment deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom III with their respective brigade combat teams (1st and 4th Brigade Combat Teams). 2-7 Infantry deployed to [[Iraq]] for a second tour in December 2004 until January 2006, to Saddam Hussien's hometown of [[Tikrit]]. The 3rd Battalion assumed responsibility of Western Rashid in [[Baghdad]], an area encompassing more than 800,000 Iraqis. The 7th Infantry Regiment's most notable achievement was ensuring the security of over 100 polling sites during two Iraqi national elections.\n\nIn January 2007, 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a third, 15-month tour. The unit served in [[Al Anbar Governorate]], the largest province in Iraq, under the command and control of Multi-National Forces West. TF 2-7 deployed to [[H\u012bt]], with Company C, 2-7 IN attached to TF [[3rd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment|3-69 AR]] (Speed and Power) in south-central [[Ramadi]]. Cold Steel was instrumental, with its Iraqi Army and Police partners in bringing peace and stability to Ramadi during the [[Anbar Awakening]]. The 2nd Battalion redeployed in April 2008. In 2007 the 4th Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division was alerted for deployment to Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2007. 3-7 Infantry became critical to the success of the surge ordered by President Bush. Numerous Operations were conducted, and most notably Operation Marne Avalanche. One AO in particular (Wasit Provence) was controlled by a single armor platoon of 16 men and was the largest AO in Iraq. The 4th Brigade, including the 3-7th Infantry, continued to serve in that country into 2008.\n\nIn December 2009, 2-7 Infantry deployed to Iraq for a fourth time as an advise and assist battalion. B-Co. 2-7 was located south of Baghdad in the town of Mahmudiyah.\n\nFrom July 2010 to July 2011, 3-7 Infantry deployed to [[Ramadi]] with the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation New Dawn (Iraq, 2010\u20132011)|Operation New Dawn]], with Attack Company providing Advise and Assist to the Iraqi Army at [[Al-Taqqaddum Air Base]]. After the new year, the Cottonbalers moved to [[al Asad Airbase]] where they provided training to the Iraqi Army before redeploying to a brand new Light Infantry Brigade facility at [[Fort Stewart]], Georgia.\n\n;Operation Enduring Freedom\n\nFrom September 2012 to May 2013, 2/7 Infantry deployed to numerous locations in some of the most rugged and hostile areas throughout Afghanistan as part of a Combined Joint Special Operations task force. The Battalion returned to Fort Stewart at the end of this deployment.\n\nIn March 2013, 3/7 Infantry deployed to Logar Province, Afghanistan as division reserve force at Forward Operating Base Shank. They returned to the stated at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/114173/3rd_ID__Cottonbalers__complete_mission_in_eastern_Afghanistan/|title=3rd ID 'Cottonbalers' complete mission in eastern Afghanistan|author=|date=|website=army.mil|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Decorations===\n{{div col}}\n* Navy Unit Commendation for HIT, Iraq (13 January 2007 \u2013 26 March 2008) attachment to 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force\n* Presidential Unit Citation (Army) for COLMAR\n* Presidential Unit Citation (Army) for [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)#Korean War|CHOKSONG]]\n* Presidential Unit Citation (Army) for [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)#Korean War|SEGOK]]\n* Presidential Unit Citation (Army) for [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)#Korean War|KOWANG-NI]]\n* Valorous Unit Award for SAIGON \u2013 LONG BINH\n* Presidential Unit Citation IRAQ \u2013 KUWAIT (1990\u201391)\n* Valorous Unit Award for IRAQ \u2013 KUWAIT (1990\u201391)(C co 3-7 INF per DAGO 1994-27)\n* Meritorious Unit Award (Army) for IRAQ \u2013 KUWAIT (1990\u201391)\n* Army Superior Unit Award for 1994\n* French Croix de Guerre with Gilt Star, World War I for AISNE-MARNE\n* French Croix de Guerre with Palm, World War II for COLMAR\n* French Croix de Guerre, World War II, Fourragere\n* Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for UIJONGBU CORRIDOR\n* Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for IRON TRIANGLE\n* Chryssoun Aristion Andrias (Bravery Gold Medal of Greece) for KOREA\n* Presidential Unit Citation (Army) for OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM I (2003)\n* Valorous Unit Award for Operation Iraqi Freedom III\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Notable members===\n{{div col}}\n* [[James Arness]], actor\n* [[Lloyd James Austin III]], General, Commander, United States Forces \u2013 Iraq\n* [[Hugh Boyd Casey|Hugh B.

A large tract of land in Pickering, Uxbridge, and Markham townships was [[Eminent domain|expropriated]] for the airport in 1972\u20131973. Opposition to the project was widespread. Preliminary airport construction activity was halted in 1975 when the provincial partner in the enterprise, the [[Government of Ontario]], declared it would not build the roads or sewers needed to service the site. In 2010, the GTAA completed a Pickering Airport \"[[Needs assessment|Needs Assessment Study]]\" commissioned by the federal government. The study's report recommended that the federal government retain the Pickering lands, \"thereby preserving the option of building an airport, if and when required\".<ref name=\"GTAA 2010 p. 9\">GTAA. \"Needs Assessment Study: Pickering Lands, Final Report\" (2010), ch. 12, p. 9.</ref> The Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, an association of private plane owners and pilots, took exception to the methodology and conclusions of the study, arguing that \"the process to implement a new airport at Pickering should be well underway right now\".<ref>Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, [http://www.copanational.org/files/Review%20of%20GTAA%20Study.pdf Review of the GTAA \"Needs Assessment Study \u2013 Pickering Lands\"] (2011), 4.4, p. 52.</ref> Transport Action Ontario, in its own response to the study report, questioned some of the study's claims and suggested that, in lieu of building a new airport, \"higher-speed, electrified rail\" would be a \"far superior alternative\" for much of the short-haul traffic currently handled by Pearson Airport.<ref>Transport Action Ontario, [http://transport-action-ontario.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TAO-Pickering-Airport-Needs-Assessment-2014-02.pdf \"Response to: Transport Canada Needs Assessment Study \u2013 Pickering Lands\"] (February 2014), p.2.</ref>\n\nIn an announcement in June 2013, the federal government reaffirmed its intention to hold land on the site for a future airport, stating that the needs assessment study's conclusion was that the airport would be needed within the 2027\u20132037 time-frame.<ref>Cf.

Strong local-community opposition to Malton's expansion caused the government to decide instead, in December 1968, to build a second Toronto airport.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=39}}</ref> An Airport Planning Team spent 1969 evaluating nearly 60 sites within a 50-nautical-mile radius of Malton.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=41}}</ref> The final contenders were [[Lake Scugog]], [[Lake Simcoe]], [[Orangeville, Ontario|Orangeville]], and [[Guelph]], with the Guelph site ranked highest.<ref>Szende, Andrew. \"Airport document shows planners didn't want Pickering\" (April 10, 1972).

This eastern emphasis became a cause of friction between the federal and provincial governments: the federal government preferred an airport location to the west, the province wanted an eastern site. In an attempt to resolve the impasse, the federal government proposed a plan to build three new airports instead of one. Two small 2,000\u20134,000 hectare (5,000\u201310,000 acre) airports would be built to handle short-haul traffic, on sites previously eliminated as unsuitable for a large airport. The first of these small airports would be constructed in the west, in Beverly Township, near [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], followed immediately by the second one in the east, in Pickering Township. A third airport \u2013 a large 6,000\u20138,000 hectare (15,000\u201320,000 acre) international airport \u2013 would be built later, at an undetermined location.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> In December 1971, the province told the federal government that it could not afford to service both a Beverly and a Pickering site and that it had committed funds to build sewer and water facilities only to the east of Toronto.\n\nThe federal government abandoned its plan for three new airports and decided instead to build one large international airport east of Toronto.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=77}}</ref> On March 2, 1972, the federal Minister of Transport announced the construction of a \"major airport\" in Pickering,<ref name=\"HoCD28\">{{cite web |title=House of Commons Debates, 28th Parliament, 4th Session : Vol. 1 |url=http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC2804_01/453?r=0&s=3 |publisher=Library of Parliament |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref> while the Treasurer of the Province of Ontario simultaneously announced plans for a new satellite city, called Cedarwood, to be built immediately south of the airport.<ref name=\"Slinger\">Slinger, John. \"Terminal open by 1979: City of 200,000 to rise near airport in Pickering\" (March 3, 1972).

The 1974 Gibson inquiry did review the process and found \"No new evidence to suggest that Pickering site was not appropriate\" (pp.&nbsp;29\u201332, Airport Inquiry Commission, Justice Hugh Gibson). Local residents and several newspapers disagreed. It was claimed that In June 1971, a federal Department of Transport team, having visited the Pickering site with a consultant, reported that a Pickering airport would disrupt community development plans and destroy \"high quality farmland\", that the rolling countryside would be costly to level, and that the town of Claremont would have to be phased out. Furthermore, the site offered no room for expansion. It was suitable for a two-runway airport, with four runways possible \"but with considerably greater difficulty\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=72}}</ref> In August 1971, Ontario planners came to similar conclusions, stating that a Pickering airport would prevent the creation of two planned towns called Brock and Audley, destroy an area designated as a provincial agricultural and recreational preserve, and \"have a major influence on the operation of Toronto International\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=76}}</ref> Despite the site's drawbacks, which had led to Pickering's elimination early in the original site selection process, the federal announcement of March 1972, described Pickering as an \"excellent\" site.<ref name=\"Slinger\"/><ref name=\"HoCD28\"/> This was not the case. The Pickering site was chosen because it was the only site left in the provincially preferred area east of Toronto, after Lake Scugog had been disqualified for being too far out, too costly to develop, too important a recreational area to disrupt, and too prone to poor weather.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=47}}</ref> The Lake Scugog site had also been described as \"unfavourable, as the majority of users, as well as Malton airport itself, are separated from the site by Metropolitan Toronto\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=60}}</ref> The argument helped to eliminate Lake\nScugog but was never used against Pickering, although it is claimed that it applied there equally well.\n\n===Political decisions favouring a new airport over expansion of the existing airport===\nWell into the 1970s, the Department of Transport remained adamant that Malton could not be expanded, citing noise and safety concerns.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|pp=52\u201354}}</ref> However, there were also political reasons behind the federal government's wish to build a second airport. Representatives of the local anti-airport protest group, People or Planes, meeting in Ottawa in 1972 with Transport Minister Jean Marchand, were told by him that he did not want to be the \"French Canadian who could be accused of not giving an airport to Ontario after having given one to Quebec [Mirabel]\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=100}}</ref> Together with Minister Marchand's desire to give Toronto what he had just given Montreal, there was the advice of chief consultant Philip Beinhaker, of Peat Marwick and Partners, who, while admitting a preference for expanding Malton, had pronounced the expansion \"politically unsaleable\", in part because Malton and a vocal group of anti-expansion residents there were in Premier-in-waiting William Davis's electoral riding.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|pp=56\u201358}}</ref><ref>Budden, Sandra.

The Markham Airport, home to the Canadian Air Land Sea Museum, is the most at risk as it is right next door and under the approach to runway 10R at the new airport. In addition part of Markham airport, including half of its only runway, was originally expropriated for the Pickering airport. Questions on if the construction of the Pickering Airport next to an existing airport (Markham CNU8) would violate the Aeronautical Act have been raised by the airports opponents. The [[Toronto/Markham Airport|Markham Airport]], has been around since 1965 and is currently looking to expand to a 6,000&nbsp;ft runway and take-on the new role of private aviation airport if the closure of [[Toronto/Buttonville Municipal Airport|Buttonville Airport]] takes place. The land that Buttonville Airport sits on has been sold for development to Cadillac Fairview. No firm date for Buttonvilles closure has been announced. The city of Oshawa has passed a resolution in council affirming that Oshawa airport will remain open until 2032 or longer. There are no operational and physical constraints that would inhibit Oshawa airport from operating when Pickering opens.\n\nIn the draft plan presented by the GTAA in 2004, it purpose closing all three GA airport to jumpstart traffic at Pickering airport.

The 1974 Gibson inquiry did review the process and found \"No new evidence to suggest that Pickering site was not appropriate\" (pp.&nbsp;29\u201332, Airport Inquiry Commission, Justice Hugh Gibson). Local residents and several newspapers disagreed. It was claimed that In June 1971, a federal Department of Transport team, having visited the Pickering site with a consultant, reported that a Pickering airport would disrupt community development plans and destroy \"high quality farmland\", that the rolling countryside would be costly to level, and that the town of Claremont would have to be phased out. Furthermore, the site offered no room for expansion. It was suitable for a two-runway airport, with four runways possible \"but with considerably greater difficulty\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=72}}</ref> In August 1971, Ontario planners came to similar conclusions, stating that a Pickering airport would prevent the creation of two planned towns called Brock and Audley, destroy an area designated as a provincial agricultural and recreational preserve, and \"have a major influence on the operation of Toronto International\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=76}}</ref> Despite the site's drawbacks, which had led to Pickering's elimination early in the original site selection process, the federal announcement of March 1972, described Pickering as an \"excellent\" site.<ref name=\"Slinger\"/><ref name=\"HoCD28\"/> This was not the case. The Pickering site was chosen because it was the only site left in the provincially preferred area east of Toronto, after Lake Scugog had been disqualified for being too far out, too costly to develop, too important a recreational area to disrupt, and too prone to poor weather.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=47}}</ref> The Lake Scugog site had also been described as \"unfavourable, as the majority of users, as well as Malton airport itself, are separated from the site by Metropolitan Toronto\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=60}}</ref> The argument helped to eliminate Lake\nScugog but was never used against Pickering, although it is claimed that it applied there equally well.\n\n===Political decisions favouring a new airport over expansion of the existing airport===\nWell into the 1970s, the Department of Transport remained adamant that Malton could not be expanded, citing noise and safety concerns.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|pp=52\u201354}}</ref> However, there were also political reasons behind the federal government's wish to build a second airport. Representatives of the local anti-airport protest group, People or Planes, meeting in Ottawa in 1972 with Transport Minister Jean Marchand, were told by him that he did not want to be the \"French Canadian who could be accused of not giving an airport to Ontario after having given one to Quebec [Mirabel]\".<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|p=100}}</ref> Together with Minister Marchand's desire to give Toronto what he had just given Montreal, there was the advice of chief consultant Philip Beinhaker, of Peat Marwick and Partners, who, while admitting a preference for expanding Malton, had pronounced the expansion \"politically unsaleable\", in part because Malton and a vocal group of anti-expansion residents there were in Premier-in-waiting William Davis's electoral riding.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|pp=56\u201358}}</ref><ref>Budden, Sandra.

Malton's general manager accused federal officials of stalling improvements to the airport as a way of making Ontario reverse its position and provide support infrastructure for Pickering after all. In November 1978, Minister Lang told the House of Commons that Malton would not be expanded, and a study into a possible fourth runway was stopped.<ref>{{harvp|Stewart|1979|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref>\n\nThe interdiction did not last.

At Malton, passenger numbers in 1970 totalled 6.4 million, but consultants' forecasts for the turn of the century ranged from 25 million to 198 million.

The Markham Airport, home to the Canadian Air Land Sea Museum, is the most at risk as it is right next door and under the approach to runway 10R at the new airport. In addition part of Markham airport, including half of its only runway, was originally expropriated for the Pickering airport. Questions on if the construction of the Pickering Airport next to an existing airport (Markham CNU8) would violate the Aeronautical Act have been raised by the airports opponents. The [[Toronto/Markham Airport|Markham Airport]], has been around since 1965 and is currently looking to expand to a 6,000&nbsp;ft runway and take-on the new role of private aviation airport if the closure of [[Toronto/Buttonville Municipal Airport|Buttonville Airport]] takes place. The land that Buttonville Airport sits on has been sold for development to Cadillac Fairview. No firm date for Buttonvilles closure has been announced. The city of Oshawa has passed a resolution in council affirming that Oshawa airport will remain open until 2032 or longer. There are no operational and physical constraints that would inhibit Oshawa airport from operating when Pickering opens.\n\nIn the draft plan presented by the GTAA in 2004, it purpose closing all three GA airport to jumpstart traffic at Pickering airport. Mixing the displaced general aviation traffic with increased heavy passenger jet traffic is a concern to many small aircraft pilots who would have no choice but to use the new airport, as larger airports tend to be less GA friendly, and more difficult for student pilot training.\n\n===2015 federal election issue===\nThe future of the Pickering Airport Lands became an election issue in the [[2015 Canadian federal election]].

He works as the Ajax A1 assistant manager.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nDe Boer's first youth club was De Zouaven in [[Lutjebroek]] where he played before being selected for the Ajax youth programme in 1983. On the professional club level, De Boer played for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (1988\u201391 and 1993\u201399), [[FC Twente|Twente]] (1991\u201393), [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1999\u20132000), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (2000\u201304), [[Al Rayyan Sports Club|Al-Rayyan]] (2004\u201305) and [[Al-Shamal]] (2005\u201308). In both Qatari clubs, he was reunited again with his brother Frank, his teammate at Ajax, Barcelona and Rangers.\n\nIn his first spell at Ajax from 1988 to 1991, he won the [[Eredivisie]] title in [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390]] under manager [[Leo Beenhakker]]. After two seasons at [[FC Twente|Twente]] from 1991 to 1993, he returned to Ajax under manager [[Louis van Gaal]], and had his most successful spell as a player, winning three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles in [[1993\u201394 Eredivisie|1993\u201394]], [[1994\u201395 Eredivisie|1994\u201395]] and [[1995\u201396 Eredivisie|1995\u201396]].

Ajax had agreed verbally that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed.

De Boer also played in [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nIn the Dutch national team, De Boer was used in various positions, including right-half, centre forward and attacking midfielder. In his early Ajax years, De Boer played either centre forward or attacking midfielder. In later years, he shifted to right midfield.\n\nDe Boer was never officially captain of the Dutch national team or Ajax, but he has worn the captain's armband on several occasions for both club teams and the national team when the first-choice captain was not playing.

football|footballer]] who played as [[midfielder]]. He played for the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] as well as a host of professional clubs in Europe. He is the older twin brother of [[Frank de Boer]]. The majority of his success as a football player was with [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]. He works as the Ajax A1 assistant manager.\n\n==Playing career==\n===Club===\nDe Boer's first youth club was De Zouaven in [[Lutjebroek]] where he played before being selected for the Ajax youth programme in 1983. On the professional club level, De Boer played for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (1988\u201391 and 1993\u201399), [[FC Twente|Twente]] (1991\u201393), [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] (1999\u20132000), [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (2000\u201304), [[Al Rayyan Sports Club|Al-Rayyan]] (2004\u201305) and [[Al-Shamal]] (2005\u201308). In both Qatari clubs, he was reunited again with his brother Frank, his teammate at Ajax, Barcelona and Rangers.\n\nIn his first spell at Ajax from 1988 to 1991, he won the [[Eredivisie]] title in [[1989\u201390 Eredivisie|1989\u201390]] under manager [[Leo Beenhakker]]. After two seasons at [[FC Twente|Twente]] from 1991 to 1993, he returned to Ajax under manager [[Louis van Gaal]], and had his most successful spell as a player, winning three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles in [[1993\u201394 Eredivisie|1993\u201394]], [[1994\u201395 Eredivisie|1994\u201395]] and [[1995\u201396 Eredivisie|1995\u201396]]. He also won the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|1995 UEFA Champions League]], the [[1995 Intercontinental Cup]], and the [[1995 UEFA Super Cup]]. He was also a runner-up of the [[1996 UEFA Champions League Final|1996 UEFA Champions League]], where Ajax lost on penalties to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. When Louis van Gaal left Ajax for Barcelona in July 1997, [[Morten Olsen]] became the new Ajax manager, and De Boer won a fifth Eredivisie title in [[1997\u201398 Eredivisie|1997\u201398]] and also won the [[1997\u201398 KNVB Cup]].\n\nThere was then controversy soon after De Boer and his twin brother [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] signed a six-year contract extension with Ajax at the start [[1998\u201399 AFC Ajax season|1998\u201399 season]], when Ronald and Frank took successful legal action to have the contract voided. Ajax had agreed verbally that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the UEFA Champions League.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/29/sports/29iht-soccer.t_14.html The De Boers tackle contract law] New York Times, 29 July 1998.</ref>\n\nThe fallout over the contract situation led to an increasing conflict between the De Boer twins and the Ajax hierarchy, with match results for Ajax suffering and manager Morten Olsen soon getting sacked.

He played for the Netherlands in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], where he played in six matches and scored two goals. He missed a penalty in the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the 1998 semi-finals. De Boer also played in [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].\n\nIn the Dutch national team, De Boer was used in various positions, including right-half, centre forward and attacking midfielder. In his early Ajax years, De Boer played either centre forward or attacking midfielder. In later years, he shifted to right midfield.\n\nDe Boer was never officially captain of the Dutch national team or Ajax, but he has worn the captain's armband on several occasions for both club teams and the national team when the first-choice captain was not playing. In most teams, this was his brother Frank, with whom he has played side by side for most of his career.\n\n==Managerial career==\nDe Boer is Ajax A1 assistant manager.\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n:Source:<ref>{{NFT|4645|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=3 | Club performance\n! colspan=2 | League\n! colspan=2 | Cup\n! colspan=2 | League Cup\n! colspan=2 | Continental\n! colspan=2 | Total\n|-\n!
