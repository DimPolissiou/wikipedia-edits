The film is a loose adaptation of the legend of [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], which claims that she escaped the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of her family]]. Its basic plot centers around an eighteen-year-old [[amnesia]]c orphan named Anya who, in hopes of finding some trace of her family, sides with con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess; thus the film shares its plot with [[Anastasia (1956 film)|Fox's prior film from 1956]], which, in turn, was based on the 1955 play of the same name by [[Marcelle Maurette]].\n\nThough it enjoyed a positive reception from many critics and audiences by praising the animation, themes, characters, voice performances, and the soundtrack, the film was met with criticism by some historians for its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess. From a $50 million budget, ''Anastasia'' grossed over $139 million worldwide, making it the most profitable film from Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to date. It received nominations for several awards, including for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[Journey to the Past]]\") and [[Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]]. The success of ''Anastasia'' spawned various adaptations of the film into other media, including a [[Bartok the Magnificent|direct-to-video spin-off film]], a computer game,<ref>{{cite web | title = IGN: Anastasia: Adventures with Pooka and Bartok | website = IGN | url = http://pc.ign.com/objects/854/854157.html | accessdate = December 30, 2010}}</ref> books, toys and a [[Anastasia (musical)|stage musical]], which premiered in 2016.<ref name=\"GroupedRef5\">{{cite web | first=Rialto | last=Chatter | date=July 28, 2012 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=Exclusive: Crawford, Barrett, Halston, Page Join Tveit, Lansbury, Lazar in ANASTASIA Reading! | url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Crawford-Barrett-Halston-Page-Join-Tveit-Lansbury-Lazar-in-ANASTASIA-Reading-20120728 | accessdate=July 1, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=April 23, 2015 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=ANASTASIA Musical to Make World Premiere at Hartford Stage Next Summer; Darko Tresnjak to Direct! | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/ANASTASIA-Musical-to-Make-World-Premiere-at-Hartford-Stage-Next-Summer-Darko-Tresnjak-to-Direct-20150423 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the creation of Fox Animation Studios, ''Anastasia'' is the first 20th Century Fox animated film to be produced by its own animation division [[20th Century Fox Animation]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1916 [[Saint Petersburg]], during a ball celebrating the [[Romanov Tercentenary|Romanov tricentennial]] at the [[Catherine Palace]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]] gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words \"Together in [[Paris]]\" as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, 8-year-old [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]]. The ball is suddenly interrupted by [[Grigori Rasputin]], a sorcerer and the former royal adviser to the Romanov family until he was [[exile|exiled]] for [[treason]]. Seeking revenge, Rasputin [[Deal with the Devil|sells his soul]] in exchange for an unholy [[reliquary]], which he uses to place a curse on the Romanovs, sparking the [[Russian Revolution]]. As revolutionaries siege the palace, Marie and Anastasia escape through a secret passageway with the aid of 10-year-old servant boy Dimitri. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but, as Marie climbs aboard, Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and subsequently suffering [[amnesia]].\n\nTen years later, Russia is under [[Soviet Union|communist rule]] and Marie has publicly offered 10 million [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime, Vladimir, search for an Anastasia look-alike to bring to Paris so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, the now 18-year-old Anastasia\u2013going by the name \"Anya\"\u2013leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up. Accompanied by a stray puppy she names \"Pooka\", she decides to head to Paris, inspired by the inscription on her necklace, but finds she is unable to leave Russia without an [[exit visa]]. An old woman advises her to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace; there, Anya experiences visions of her past. The two men are impressed by Anya\u2019s resemblance to the \"real\" Anastasia, and decide to take her with them to Paris.\n\nRasputin's albino bat minion, Bartok, is nearby and notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasia's presence; it drags him to limbo, where he finds Rasputin has survived. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his [[demon|demonic]] minions from the reliquary to kill her. Despite Rasputin\u2019s attempts to crash a train and tricking Anya into nearly sleepwalking off a ship, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil his plans, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface. During their journey, Dimitri and Anya begin to fall in love.\n\nThe trio eventually reach Paris and go to see Marie, who has given up the search after meeting numerous imposters. Despite this, Marie's cousin Sophie quizzes Anya to confirm her identity. Though Anastasia offers every answer taught to her, Dimitri finally realizes she is the real Anastasia when she (without being taught) vaguely recalls how he helped her escape the palace siege. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Marie at the [[Palais Garnier|Palais Garnier Opera House]]. There, Dimitri tries to establish an introduction but Marie refuses, having already heard of Dimitri's initial scheme to con her. Anya overhears the conversation and angrily leaves. Dimitri abducts Marie in her car to force her to see Anya, and persuades her by presenting the music box Anya dropped during the palace siege. As Marie and Anya finally converse, Anya regains her memories. Opening the music box and singing their lullaby, Marie is convinced and the two are joyfully reunited.\n\nMarie offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who saved them; to her surprise, he refuses it and leaves for Russia. At Anastasia's return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitri's gesture, leaving Anastasia torn between staying or going with him. Pooka suddenly runs off; Anastasia chases him to the [[Pont Alexandre III]], where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is soon injured and knocked unconscious. In the struggle, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crushes it under her foot, avenging her family as Rasputin disintegrates and dies.\n\nIn the aftermath, Anastasia and Dimitri reconcile; they [[elope]], and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat before bidding the audience farewell.\n\n== Voice cast==\n*[[Meg Ryan]] as [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia \"Anya\" Romanova]]: Raised as an orphan, sets out on a journey to discover her true heritage. \n*[[John Cusack]] as Dimitri: A young con-man, a former servant of the Romanovs, and Anastasia's love interest.\n*[[Kelsey Grammer]] as Vladimir \"Vlad\" Vanya Voinitsky Vasilovich: A former nobleman turned con-artist, and a friend of Dimitri.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jim|title=Has Disney Been 'Lion' About Jeremy Irons' Singing Voice?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/lion-king-voice-actors_b_968140.html|accessdate=June 7, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 19, 2011}}</ref> \n*[[Christopher Lloyd]] as [[Grigori Rasputin]]: A dangerous and power-crazed [[magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] who cast a curse upon the Romanov family.\n*[[Hank Azaria]] as Bartok: Rasputin's butler and mild-mannered, talking, albino [[bat]], whom he treats as a pet.\n*[[Angela Lansbury]] as [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna Romanov]]: The Dowager Empress, mother of Nicholas II, and Anastasia's grandmother.\n*[[Bernadette Peters]] as Sophie Stanislovskievna Somorkov-Smirnoff, Marie's first cousin, and lady-in-waiting\n\n'''Other Voices'''\n*[[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Lacey Chabert]] portrayed the speaking and singing voices for young Anastasia, respectively.\n*Glenn Walker Harris, Jr. provided the voice-over for young Dimitri.\n*[[Andrea Martin]] as \"Comrade\" Phlegmenkoff, the orphanage's inconsiderate owner\n*[[Rick Jones (voice actor)|Rick Jones]] as [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II Romanov]], the last [[Tsar]] of Imperial Russia and Anastasia's father.\n**Jones also provided voice-over work for the voices a Revolutionary Soldier, a servant, and a ticket agent.\n*Charity James as Anastasia impostor\n*[[Debra Mooney]] as an Actress\n*[[Arthur Malet]] as Traveling Man [[Majordomo]]\n\n[[J.

Eventually, Bluth and Goldman decided the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film.<ref name=\"Battleroyal\" /> In 1995, Graham and Susan Gauthier reworked Tuchman's script into a light-hearted romantic comedy.

Instead, they decided to have [[Grigori Rasputin]] as the villain with Goldman explaining it was because of \"all the different things they did to try to destroy Rasputin and what a horrible man he really was, the more it seemed appetizing to make him the villain\".<ref name=\"OnceUponaNovember\" /> In reality, Rasputin was already dead when the Romanovs were assassinated. In addition to this, Bluth created the idea for Bartok, the albino bat, as a sidekick for Rasputin. \"I just thought the villain had to have a comic sidekick, just to let everyone know that it was all right to laugh.

[[Animation|animated]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[drama film]] produced and directed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]] in association with [[Fox Animation Studios]], distributed by [[20th Century Fox]], and starring the voices of [[Meg Ryan]], [[John Cusack]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Hank Azaria]], [[Christopher Lloyd]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], and [[Angela Lansbury]]. The film is a loose adaptation of the legend of [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]], which claims that she escaped the [[Execution of the Romanov family|execution of her family]]. Its basic plot centers around an eighteen-year-old [[amnesia]]c orphan named Anya who, in hopes of finding some trace of her family, sides with con men who wish to take advantage of her likeness to the Grand Duchess; thus the film shares its plot with [[Anastasia (1956 film)|Fox's prior film from 1956]], which, in turn, was based on the 1955 play of the same name by [[Marcelle Maurette]].\n\nThough it enjoyed a positive reception from many critics and audiences by praising the animation, themes, characters, voice performances, and the soundtrack, the film was met with criticism by some historians for its fantastical retelling of the life of the Grand Duchess. From a $50 million budget, ''Anastasia'' grossed over $139 million worldwide, making it the most profitable film from Bluth and Fox Animation Studios to date. It received nominations for several awards, including for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] (\"[[Journey to the Past]]\") and [[Best Original Musical or Comedy Score]] at the [[70th Academy Awards]]. The success of ''Anastasia'' spawned various adaptations of the film into other media, including a [[Bartok the Magnificent|direct-to-video spin-off film]], a computer game,<ref>{{cite web | title = IGN: Anastasia: Adventures with Pooka and Bartok | website = IGN | url = http://pc.ign.com/objects/854/854157.html | accessdate = December 30, 2010}}</ref> books, toys and a [[Anastasia (musical)|stage musical]], which premiered in 2016.<ref name=\"GroupedRef5\">{{cite web | first=Rialto | last=Chatter | date=July 28, 2012 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=Exclusive: Crawford, Barrett, Halston, Page Join Tveit, Lansbury, Lazar in ANASTASIA Reading! | url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/Exclusive-Crawford-Barrett-Halston-Page-Join-Tveit-Lansbury-Lazar-in-ANASTASIA-Reading-20120728 | accessdate=July 1, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=April 23, 2015 | work=Broadway World | publisher=Wisdom Digital Media | title=ANASTASIA Musical to Make World Premiere at Hartford Stage Next Summer; Darko Tresnjak to Direct! | url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/ANASTASIA-Musical-to-Make-World-Premiere-at-Hartford-Stage-Next-Summer-Darko-Tresnjak-to-Direct-20150423 | accessdate=April 24, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the creation of Fox Animation Studios, ''Anastasia'' is the first 20th Century Fox animated film to be produced by its own animation division [[20th Century Fox Animation]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1916 [[Saint Petersburg]], during a ball celebrating the [[Romanov Tercentenary|Romanov tricentennial]] at the [[Catherine Palace]], [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna]] gives a music box and a necklace inscribed with the words \"Together in [[Paris]]\" as parting gifts to her youngest granddaughter, 8-year-old [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]]. The ball is suddenly interrupted by [[Grigori Rasputin]], a sorcerer and the former royal adviser to the Romanov family until he was [[exile|exiled]] for [[treason]]. Seeking revenge, Rasputin [[Deal with the Devil|sells his soul]] in exchange for an unholy [[reliquary]], which he uses to place a curse on the Romanovs, sparking the [[Russian Revolution]]. As revolutionaries siege the palace, Marie and Anastasia escape through a secret passageway with the aid of 10-year-old servant boy Dimitri. Rasputin confronts the two royals outside on a frozen river, only to fall through the ice and drown. The pair manage to reach a moving train, but, as Marie climbs aboard, Anastasia falls, hitting her head on the platform and subsequently suffering [[amnesia]].\n\nTen years later, Russia is under [[Soviet Union|communist rule]] and Marie has publicly offered 10 million [[Soviet ruble|rubles]] for the safe return of her granddaughter. Dimitri and his friend/partner-in-crime, Vladimir, search for an Anastasia look-alike to bring to Paris so they can collect the reward. Elsewhere, the now 18-year-old Anastasia\u2013going by the name \"Anya\"\u2013leaves the rural orphanage where she grew up; accompanied by a stray puppy she names \"Pooka\", she decides to head to Paris, inspired by the inscription on the necklace, but finds she is unable to leave Russia without an [[exit visa]]. An old woman advises her to see Dimitri at the abandoned palace; there, Anya experiences visions of her past. The two men are impressed by Anya\u2019s resemblance to the \"real\" Anastasia, and decide to take her with them to Paris.\n\nRasputin's albino bat minion, Bartok, is nearby and notices his master's dormant reliquary suddenly revived by Anastasia's presence; it drags him to limbo, where Rasputin, slowly decomposing, survives. Enraged to hear that Anastasia escaped the curse, Rasputin sends his [[demon|demonic]] minions from the reliquary to kill her. Despite Rasputin\u2019s attempts, including crashing a train and tricking Anya into nearly sleepwalking off a ship, the trio manage to (unwittingly) foil his plans, forcing Rasputin and Bartok to travel back to the surface. Along the way, Dimitri and Anya begin to fall in love.\n\nThe trio eventually reach Paris and go to see Marie, who has given up the search after meeting numerous imposters. Despite this, Marie's cousin Sophie quizzes Anya to confirm her identity. Though Anastasia offers every answer taught to her, Dimitri finally realizes she is the real Anastasia when she (without being taught) vaguely recalls how he helped her escape the palace siege. Sophie, also convinced, arranges a meeting with Marie at the [[Palais Garnier|Palais Garnier Opera House]]. There, Dimitri tries to establish an introduction but Marie refuses, having already heard of Dimitri's initial scheme to con her. Anya overhears the conversation and angrily leaves. Dimitri abducts Marie in her car to force her to see Anya, but she still refuses; she is finally persuaded when Dimitri presents her with the music box. At first, Marie still believes Anya is an impostor, but Anya regains her memories as they converse; opening the music box and singing their lullaby, Marie is convinced and the two are joyfully reunited.\n\nMarie offers Dimitri the reward money the next day, recognizing him as the servant boy who saved them; to her surprise, he refuses it and leaves for Russia. At Anastasia's return celebration, Marie informs her of Dimitri's gesture, leaving Anastasia torn between staying or going with him. Pooka suddenly runs off; Anastasia chases him to the [[Pont Alexandre III]], where she is trapped and attacked by Rasputin. Dimitri returns to save her, but is soon injured and knocked unconscious. In the struggle, Anastasia manages to get hold of Rasputin's reliquary and crushes it under her foot, avenging her family as Rasputin disintegrates and dies.\n\nIn the aftermath, Anastasia and Dimitri reconcile; they elope, and Anastasia sends a farewell letter to Marie and Sophie, promising to return one day. Bartok shares a kiss with a female bat before bidding the audience farewell.\n\n== Voice cast==\n*[[Meg Ryan]] as [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Anastasia \"Anya\" Romanova]]: Raised as an orphan, sets out on a journey to discover her true heritage. \n*[[John Cusack]] as Dimitri: A young con-man, a former servant of the Romanovs, and Anastasia's love interest.\n*[[Kelsey Grammer]] as Vladimir \"Vlad\" Vanya Voinitsky Vasilovich: A former nobleman turned con-artist, and a friend of Dimitri.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Jim|title=Has Disney Been 'Lion' About Jeremy Irons' Singing Voice?|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/lion-king-voice-actors_b_968140.html|accessdate=June 7, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=September 19, 2011}}</ref> \n*[[Christopher Lloyd]] as [[Grigori Rasputin]]: A dangerous and power-crazed [[magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] who cast a curse upon the Romanov family.\n*[[Hank Azaria]] as Bartok: Rasputin's butler and mild-mannered, talking, albino [[bat]], whom he treats as a pet.\n*[[Angela Lansbury]] as [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Marie Feodorovna Romanov]]: The Dowager Empress, mother of Nicholas II, and Anastasia's grandmother.\n*[[Bernadette Peters]] as Sophie Stanislovskievna Somorkov-Smirnoff, Marie's first cousin, and lady-in-waiting\n\n'''Other Voices'''\n*[[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Lacey Chabert]] portrayed the speaking and singing voices for young Anastasia, respectively.\n*Glenn Walker Harris, Jr. provided the voice-over for young Dimitri.\n*[[Andrea Martin]] as \"Comrade\" Phlegmenkoff, the orphanage's inconsiderate owner\n*[[Rick Jones (voice actor)|Rick Jones]] as [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II Romanov]], the last [[Tsar]] of Imperial Russia and Anastasia's father.\n**Jones also provided voice-over work for the voices a Revolutionary Soldier, a servant, and a ticket agent.\n*Charity James as Anastasia impostor\n*[[Debra Mooney]] as an Actress\n*[[Arthur Malet]] as Traveling Man [[Majordomo]]\n\n[[J.

Eventually, Bluth and Goldman decided the history of Anastasia and the Romanov dynasty was too dark for their film.<ref name=\"Battleroyal\" /> In 1995, Graham and Susan Gauthier reworked Tuchman's script into a light-hearted romantic comedy.

Instead, they decided to have [[Grigori Rasputin]] as the villain with Goldman explaining it was because of \"all the different things they did to try to destroy Rasputin and what a horrible man he really was, the more it seemed appetizing to make him the villain\".<ref name=\"OnceUponaNovember\" /> In reality, Rasputin was already dead when the Romanovs were assassinated. In addition to this, Bluth created the idea for Bartok, the albino bat, as a sidekick for Rasputin. \"I just thought the villain had to have a comic sidekick, just to let everyone know that it was all right to laugh.

These machinations allowed them to control the [[Kingdom of Kotte]], but the main beneficiary was the [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]], which from 1521\u201387 was able to expand \u2013 through conquest of other native kingdoms \u2013 to cover most of Ceylon. King [[Rajasinha I]] of Sitawaka then attempted to expel the Portuguese from the island, but was repulsed with heavy losses at the [[Siege of Colombo]] in 1587\u20138. Most of the newly conquered territories then rebelled against Sitawaka. The divided and disorganised rival kingdoms became easy targets for Portuguese expansion. In a series of military conflicts and political manoeuvres the Portuguese extended their control over the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]] (1551), [[Jaffna Kingdom|Jaffna]] (1591), [[Kingdom of Raigama|Raigama]] (1593) and [[Kingdom of Sitawaka|Sitawaka]] (1593).\n\nIn 1592 the Portuguese placed a client ruler on the throne of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]], but he died soon after in suspicious circumstances and they were forced to withdraw. Seeking to subdue the last major kingdom on Ceylon, the Portuguese launched a full military invasion of Kandy in the [[Campaign of Danture]] of 1594. The invasion was a disaster for the Portuguese, with their entire army wiped out by Kandyan [[guerilla warfare]]. The war became a stalemate, with further Portuguese attempts to conquer Kandy repeatedly repulsed, whilst the Kandyans were unable to oust the Portuguese from the rest of the island. A series of rebellions in both Portuguese Ceylon and Kandy led both sides to agree a truce in 1621. The treaty led to Kandy formally becoming a [[vassal state]] of Portugal, but in reality maintaining its independence. This allowed both sides to crush the rebellions in their respective territories, and ended direct conflict between them for the next seventeen years. The Portuguese were also able to conquer the [[Vannimai|Vanni chieftains]] in 1621.\n\nThe uneasy peace was eventually broken by the intervention of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1638, who sought to exploit the situation to take over Portuguese colonial possessions as part of the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]]. The Dutch formed an alliance with Kandy; together they won several battles against the Portuguese, most notably the [[Siege of Galle (1640)|Siege of Galle]] in 1640. However, the Dutch-Kandyan alliance broke down and the three remaining powers fought each other in triangular warfare for a time. The Dutch and Kandyans renewed their alliance in 1649 to drive the Portuguese from the island. The Portuguese capital [[Colombo]] was conquered in 1656, but once this was done the Dutch immediately betrayed their allies, keeping the Portuguese possessions for themselves.\n\nBy the end of the war in 1658 all Portuguese forces had been expelled from the island, ending [[Portuguese Ceylon]]. The Kingdom of Kandy was the only surviving indigenous state on Ceylon, ruling almost half of the territory. The Dutch were left in control of the major population centres, forming [[Dutch Ceylon]].\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505<ref>S.G.

After killing Vijayabahu, his sons ([[Bhuvanaikabahu VII of Kotte|Bhuvanekabahu]], [[Raigama Bandara|Pararajasingha]] and [[Mayadunne of Sitawaka|Mayadunne]]) divided the kingdom among themselves in the '[[Wijayaba Kollaya|Spoiling of Vijayabahu]]'. Mayadunne received the [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]], Pararajasingha was given the [[Principality of Raigama]] (taking the name Raigama Bandara), and Bhuvanekabahu ruled over the remaining part of Kotte (as Bhuvanekabahu VII). The subsequent rivalries between these three new realms gave the Portuguese an opportunity to expand their influence on the island, by becoming involved in its internal politics.<ref>Rajavaliya p. 77.</ref><ref>S.G. Perera p 20.</ref>\n\nAt first the Portuguese limited themselves to securing their share of the cinnamon trade in Colombo and supporting - and defending - their allies the rulers of Kotte. It was only after [[Dharmapala of Kotte|Dom Jo\u00e3o Dharmapalla]] converted to Christianity and bequeathed his kingdom to the King of Portugal upon his death in 1597, that the Portuguese regarded Kotte as their territory, and considered the conquest of the entire island to secure it.\n\n== Early stages 1521\u20131538 ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n\nDuring the initial encounters, the Portuguese lent their assistance to the Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte to defend against the attacks from Sitawaka.<ref>S.G.

He timed the campaign to begin shortly after the start of the [[monsoon season]], so the Portuguese would not be able to send reinforcements by sea. The Sinhalese army appeared around Colombo on 4 June, consisting of 50,000 men, 2200 pack elephants, 40,000 oxen and 150 small calibre bronze cannon. Supporting the army were 65 light galleys which were to blockade the fortress by sea. The Portuguese captain defending Colombo was [[Jo\u00e3o Correia de Brito]], who had 300 Portuguese soldiers assisted by 700 [[Lascarin]]s, plus a civilian population of some 60,000. Foreseeing the possibility of a siege, he had stockpiled supplies of food and ammunition. The Portuguese flotilla of 6 [[galley]]s was beached due to the weather, but nevertheless Brito sent a small craft over the sea to [[Goa]] with a distress call.<ref>Saturnino Monteiro (2011) ''Portuguese Sea Battles - Volume IV - 1580-1603'' p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:Portuguese Colombo 1650.jpg|thumb|right|Plan view of Portuguese Colombo, made in 1650]]\n\nKnowing of Colombo's defences, which included a lagoon serving as a [[moat]] by its southern side, Rajasinha began the siege by having entrenchments dug around the walls and the lagoon drained, which lasted a month. With the digging complete, Rajasinha rallied his entire army outside Colombo in a display of force, shouting war-cries to intimidate the besieged. Undaunted, Brito ordered a [[Sortie|sally]] against the troops closest to the city, throwing them into great confusion.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 197</ref>\n\nOn the night of 3 August, the Rajasinha ordered the first mass assault. Thousands of Sinhalese attempted to scale Colombo's earthen walls, while [[sapper]]s (aided by hundreds of elephants) tried to breach them. They were met with superior Portuguese firepower. Some Sinhalese were able to climb onto the bastions ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'' and ''S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo'', but were repelled by a swift Portuguese [[counter attack]]. By the following morning, the Sinhalese had been driven off, having suffered 400 dead and 2,000 wounded.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 198</ref>\n\nOver the following months Rajasinha attempted three more assaults on Colombo, along with attempts to undermine the walls, while the Portuguese conducted [[sortie]]s against Sinhalese positions. With the end of the monsoon, the first Portuguese reinforcements from Goa arrived on 11 September. Further ships carrying reinforcements arrived on 4 October, 23 October, 4 November and 15 February. Finally, on 18 February a large fleet of eighteen galleys commanded by [[Manuel de Sousa Coutinho]] arrived, after raiding Sitawakan shores in northwestern Ceylon. The fleet sailed in battle formation and sounded its guns; the Portuguese defenders greeted it by ringing their church bells and firing a general salvo from the fortress' cannon.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 202</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the reinforcements, there were now 2,000 Portuguese soldiers inside the fortress, in addition to the lascarins and civilian defenders. Rajasinha realised that the opportunity to take Colombo had been lost and lifted the siege shortly afterwards. Over the eight-month campaign, the Sinhalese had lost 5,000 men.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 203</ref>\n\n== Portuguese campaign in Jaffna and takeover of Sitawaka 1588\u20131593 ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n{{main|Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom}}\nIn 1588 Kandy rebelled against its new Sitawaka rulers. However, the heirs of the Kandyan royal family had fallen under Portuguese influence and were held in Colombo. In 1592 the Portuguese intervened in Kandy, placing their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Yamasinghe Bandara]] on the throne. However, the new ruler died in suspicious circumstances shortly after his coronation. The Portuguese accused a rival Kandyan faction of poisoning Bandara, but the Kandyans blamed the Portuguese, who were forced to withdraw. [[Vimaladharmasuriya I]] became the new king of Kandy.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Jaffna Kingdom]] in the north of the island [[Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom|fell increasingly under Portuguese influence]]. In 1591 a Portuguese expedition deposed (and killed) the Jaffna king [[Puviraja Pandaram]], then installed his son [[Ethirimana Cinkam]] as a [[client ruler]].\n\nIn 1593 Sitawaka forces attempted to re-take Kandy, but were repulsed and their king [[Rajasinha I]] died of disease contracted during the fighting. One of the rival claimants to his throne defected to the Portuguese, enabling them to take complete control over Sitawaka.\n== Campaign of Danture 1594 ==\n[[File:Campaign of Danture 1594.png|thumb|right|Key locations in the Campaign of Danture, 1594]]\n\n{{Main|Campaign of Danture}}\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe Portuguese tried again to put their preferred candidate on the throne of Kandy as a [[client ruler]]. This time it was [[Dona Catarina]], a Kandyan princess who had been entrusted to the care of the Portuguese and brought up in a Catholic European style. She was then aged ten or twelve.\n\n[[Pedro Lopes de Sousa]] led a force of about 20,000 in an invasion of Kandy, of which one thousand were Portuguese troops (the majority transferred from [[Goa]] in India for the expedition), 15,400 native [[Lascarin]] allies, 47 [[elephant]]s used as [[pack animal]]s,{{#tag:ref|The elephants were used for [[logistics]] and not as combat [[war elephants]]|group=\"note\"|name=\"elephant\"}} and the remainder [[Badagas|Badaga]] mercenaries from India and [[coolie]] labourers. The initial number of opposing Kandyan forces is unknown, but is estimated at 10,000. The defenders held a distinct advantage in the terrain, as Kandy is a mountainous region and the invading force would be forced to traverse well-defended [[mountain pass]]es.\n\nThe Portuguese stormed the pass at [[Balana]] with heavy losses, after which the Kandyan forces began to retreat before the invaders. The Portuguese were able to enter the capital [[Kandy]] without resistance, finding it abandoned by King [[Vimaladharmasuriya I]]. Dona Catarina was crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy. However, she and her Portuguese advisers were unpopular rulers, particularly after rumours spread that she was to be married to a Portuguese husband (as the Portuguese were indeed planning).\n\nVimaladharmasuriya's forces engaged in [[guerilla]] tactics, attacking Portuguese foraging parties and cutting off lines of supply and communication. A large Portuguese-Lascarin raiding party of 3,000 men was surrounded and destroyed in the Uva region. Shortly thereafter, evidence was found that [[Jayavira Bandara Mudali]], one of the [[Lascarin]] chieftains, was preparing to betray the Portuguese to Vimaladharmasuriya. Part of this evidence was later shown to be fabricated by Vimaladharmasuriya, but Jayavira was killed as a traitor before this was realised.\n\n[[File:The murder of Jayavira Bandara Mudali by the Portuguese.PNG|thumb|right|Portuguese soldiers kill the [[Lascarin]] leader [[Jayavira Bandara Mudali|Jayavira]] and his attendants, who were suspected of treason. Woodcut by [[Philippus Baldaeus]].]]\nThe death of Jayavira led many of the Lascarins to desert, along with all of the Badaga mercenaries. Less than a thousand native allies were left with the Portuguese forces, who were now massively outnumbered, lacking supplies, and faced a mass rebellion. The Portuguese attempted to retreat from Kandy to the fort at [[Balana]]. Losses to guerilla warfare and further Lascarin desertions reduced their forces to about 360 Portuguese and an equal number of Lascarins by the time they reached [[Danture]]. In contrast, defections and troops arriving from other parts of the kingdom had swelled Vimaladharmasuriya's forces to about 20,000 men.\n\nAt Danture, the Portuguese forces were attacked as they retreated. The organised columns disintegrated in the forest and most were wiped out. Sousa surrendered with the remaining 93 European troops. In a departure from usual Sinhalese warfare, the prisoners were tortured and mutilated. Sousa died of the wounds he sustained during the fighting. With the exception of a patrol sent back to the lowlands during the early part of the campaign, only three Portuguese soldiers escaped back to Colombo.\n\nVimaladharmasuriya solidified his control over Kandy by marrying Dona Catarina. In an attempt to prevent further Portuguese incursions he built new fortifications in the Balana pass.\n\n== Portuguese consolidation of Kotte and attacks on Kandy 1595\u20131617 ==\n[[File:De jure political map of Sri Lanka, early 17th century.png|thumb|right|Political situation on Ceylon in the early 17th century]]\nWith the death of Pedro Lopes de Sousa at Danture, [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo|Dom Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo]] succeeded him as Captain-General of Ceylon, and despite the losses in the battle, Kandy was unable to advance into the lowlands as the Portuguese forts and garrisons remained intact.<ref>Chandra Richard De Silva (1972) [https://books.google.pt/books?id=DUEKAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y ''The Portuguese in Ceylon 1617-1638''] H. W. Cave & Company, Colombo</ref>\n\nDom Jer\u00f3nimo proceeded to reform Kotte's provincial administration, dividing it into four provinces, or ''disavas'', each administered by the eponymous ''disava'', with military and judicial powers. The tax system was also reformed and the old system of tributes replaced with fixed mandatory payments. The original military system of castes and levies however, remained organized under the local ''[[mudaliar]]'' commanders, who assisted the Portuguese troops. Dom Jer\u00f3nimo also encouraged missionary work by the [[Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in addition to the [[Franciscans]].<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 12</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the defeat at Danture sparked a number of uprisings in Kotte which Dom Jer\u00f3nimo had to defeat before he could move on Kandy. He considered the defeat of Kandy an utmost priority to secure Ceylon and secured Kotte first with the construction of fortified encampments in [[Matara fort|Matara]], Sabaragamuwa, [[Menikkadawara fort|Manikkadawara]] and [[Malwana fort|Malwana]], where he established the army HQ.<ref name=\"Silva 1972\">C. R. de Silva (1972) p. 13</ref>\n\nBy 1603, Kotte was firmly secured and Dom Jer\u00f3nimo led his troops into Kandy through the mountain pass, where he seized the Kandian fort at Balana and proceeded towards the city of Kandy itself. However, the kingdom could not be subjugated then due to a rebellion among the Lascarins, and was forced to return to Colombo.<ref name=\"Silva 1972\" />\n\nUnable to capture Kandy, Dom Jer\u00f3nimo adopted a policy of first weakening Kandy through devastating raid warfare by land, twice every year, at harvest time, resorting to light contingents of troops, while blockading the eastern Kandian ports of [[Trincomalee]] and [[Batticaloa]] by sea, between 1604 and 1612 with considerable success. This coincided with a succession crisis in Kandy after the death of king Vimaladharmasuryia in 1604, that was only solved months later with the succession of his cousin [[Senarat of Kandy|Senarat]] to the throne.<ref name=\"Silva 1972\" />\n\nSenarat proved to be an unpopular ruler and unable to prevent the Portuguese from causing great devastation upon Kandian villages and crops. In 1612, Dom Jer\u00f3nimo was appointed as the next viceroy of Portuguese India and was succeeded in Ceylon by [[Francisco de Meneses|Dom Francisco Meneses]] (1612\u20131614), [[Manuel Mascarenhas Homem]] (1614\u20131616) and [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira (Governor)|Dom Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] (1616\u20131618). Because of his great experience in Ceylon, as viceroy Dom [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo]] kept the Portuguese garrisons well supplied and reinforced, which caused the depopulation of Kandy on account of the systematic Portuguese raids.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 15</ref>\n\n== Rebellions against both powers and submission of Kandy 1617\u20131621 ==\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Sinhalese Warriors.jpg|thumb|right|A Portuguese illustration of Sinhalese warriors, produced {{circa|1540}}]]\n===Uprisings in Portuguese territory===\nThe taxes imposed by the Portuguese, and the desecration of Buddhist temples by missionaries caused great discontent among the Sinhalese peasantry and in late 1616 an uprising broke out in Sabaragamuwa. Disava Filipe de Oliveira's forces camped in the Seven Korales were dispatched south, but in his absence, in December 1616 a much greater revolt broke out in eastern Seven Korales, led by a disgraced grain measurer who claimed to be the grandson of Rajasinha, late prince Nikapitiya Bendara, dead since 1611. Senarat immediately took the opportunity to support Nikapitiya with a force of 2000 men commanded by the former rebel leader Kangara Aratchi, and the Prince of [[Uva Province|Uva]], [[Kuruvita Rala]], to march his forces southwards into Matara and Sabaragamuwa. Under these conditions, the Portuguese were overwhelmed: part of Sabaragmuwa and Matara were overrun while a considerable portion of the Seven Korales fell to Nikapitiya's rebellion.<ref> C. R. de Silva 1972, pg. 22-23</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Kandy===\nDespite initial cordiality, Senarat quickly grew distrustful of Nikapitiyas' success and attitude towards Kandy. Fearing a future rival, he withdrew all his aid and ordered Kuruvita Rala to suspend operations while he attempted to gain a truce with the Portuguese. This in turn caused [[Kuruvita Rala]], a native from Kotte, to rebell in indignation against Senarat, choosing instead to ally with Nikapityia, march against his former ruler and invite Mayadunne of Denawaka exiled in India to become King of Kandy instead (since his lowly caste disallowed him from crowning himself king). In this regard, C.R. de Silva considers Kuruvita Rala to have been \"the true Sinhalese patriot, for it was he who put national above dynastic interests\".<ref> C. R. de Silva 1972, pp. 25\u201326</ref> [[File:Codice Casanatense Sri Lankan Women.png|thumb|right|A Portuguese illustration of Sinhalese women and children, produced {{circa|1540}}]]\n\nKuruvita Rala, ruling much of southern Sri Lanka including the port of Batticaloa, now posed a much graver threat to Senarat than Nikapitiya. Thus, after recapturing the Balana fort from the Portuguese turned to them for a treaty and an alliance, but only when he released all the Portuguese prisoners was captain-general Dom Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira convinced that Senarat's proposal was genuine.<ref> C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 27</ref>\n\n===The Luso-Kandian Treaty===\nBy this sudden turn of events, in August 17 an agreement between the Portuguese and Kandy was reached and a treaty put into effect. In negotiating with the Portuguese, Senarat proved rather capable, refusing most of Portuguese demands but stil had to formally pledge vassalage to the King of Portugal, agree not interfere in missionary work in Kandy (Senarat even entrusted his children to be educated by Franciscans), offer several noblemen as hostages in Colombo and pay two large elephants a year as a token tribute. The Portuguese on their part agreed to a formal alliance and recognized Senerat as the rightful King of Kandy.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, pp. 32\u201334</ref>\n\nWith the coming of favourable winds in March 1617, important Portuguese reinforcements had arrived in Colombo. In June, developments in [[Jaffna kingdom|Jaffna]] favoured the Portuguese as [[Cankili I]] usurped the throne through a coup and in exchange for Portuguese recognition, agreed to prevent supplies and weapons from reaching the rebels from there. Between July and September the Portuguese were able to recapture the Seven Korales, and Nikapitiya fled to the jungles inhabited by the Vanni in northeastern Sri Lanka, never to be seen again.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 31</ref>\n\n==Portuguese conquest of Jaffna 1619==\n[[File:Ceil\u00e3o.png|thumb|right|Maximum extent of [[Portuguese Ceylon]] (cyan), after the conquest of Jaffna in 1619 and the Vanni Chieftains in 1621]]\n{{Main|Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom}}\nAlthough the Portuguese confirmed Cankili as the ruler of Jaffna, Cankilis' brutal murder of political rivals made him an unpopular ruler, and incapable of preventing dissatisfaction especially from the rising number of native Christians of the Kingdom. In August 1618, a rebellion instigated by Christian mudaliars Dom Pedro and Dom Luiz and aided by local Portuguese ''casados'' evicted Cankili from the throne, but was eventually suppressed with the assistance of 5000 men of the Hindu [[Nayak of Tanjore]], in south-east India.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 42</ref> As Cankili was a weak ruler who failed to prevent growing unrest in the kingdom, to pay due tribute to the Portuguese, and was rumoured to be allowing supplies to reach the southern rebels and even seeking aid from the Dutch, in March 1619 the Portuguese captain-general of Ceylon Dom Constantino de S\u00e1 decided to dispatch Filipe de Oliveira ahead of 230 Portuguese and 3000 lascarins to subjugate Jaffna. Furthermore, the captain-general had received reports that a Christian Malabarese privateer on the service of the Zamorin, Dom Pedro Rodrigues, was attacking Portuguese and allied shipping in the vicinity of the island of Mannar, and tasked Oliveira to deal with the issue en route.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 44</ref>\n\nUpon reaching Mannar, Dom Pedro sailed away, and Oliveira proceeded towards Jaffna. Once there, he demanded the payment of due tributes but as negotiations with Cankili failed, in June the Portuguese-Sinhalese forces of Filipe de Oliveira marched on the capital [[Nallur (Jaffna)|Nallur]], defeated the Tamil forces at Jaffna, captured Cankili and formally annexed Jaffna to the Portuguese Crown.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 46</ref> The ancient capital of Jaffna was moved to the coastal city of Jaffna itself (''Jafanapat\u00e3o''), and with the kingdom secured from outside threats by February 1621, navigation in the Palk Strait became much safer.

Only by June 1620 did the Portuguese captain-general Dom Constantino de S\u00e1 de Noronha manage to recapture the southern lowlands, for Kuruvita Rala was a skilled and popular commander and knew the territory well.<ref>C.

In 1620, Senarat received the first expedition of the [[Danish East India Company]] led by [[Ove Gjedde]], who reached Ceylon after a perilous journey of over two years, that claimed more than half its personnel. Senarat placed great expectations on a Danish alliance against the Portuguese and agreed to sign a treaty and grant them the port of Trincomalee, where the great [[Koneswaram temple]] of was located. However, until the Danish could prove capable against the Portuguese, Senarat was not willing to relinquish his hard-won peace with them or grant the Danes any further concessions. Thus, just two weeks after the treaty was signed, the Danish evacuated Trincomalee and left for [[Tranquebar]] in [[Tanjore]], where they established a fort.<ref>C.

This [[Iberian Union]] possessed a vast empire of colonial possessions, but lacked the strength (particularly naval forces) to defend them. Other colonial powers sought to take advantage of this weakness to obtain their own empires, particularly after the [[Habsburg Spain#The road to Rocroi (1626\u20131643)|collapse of the Iberian economy in 1627]]. The Spanish overseas possessions were generally better defended than Portuguese ones, which were widely scattered and difficult to reinforce.\n\nThe rival [[Dutch Empire]] \u2013 engaged in the [[Eighty Years' War]] against its former master, Spain \u2013 concentrated its overseas efforts on conquering parts of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]]. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) sought to oust the Portuguese from the [[East Indies]] and [[Indian subcontinent]] so they could control the lucrative [[spice trade]]. Seeing an opportunity to undermine the Portuguese on Ceylon, the VOC made contact with the [[Kingdom of Kandy]]. Confidence in the Kandyan forces rose after they defeated a Portuguese army at the [[Battle of Gannoruwa]] in March 1638. Shortly thereafter, the VOC and [[Rajasinha II of Kandy]] [[Kandyan Treaty of 1638|signed a treaty in May 1638]], by which the VOC promised to aid Kandy in its continuing war against the Portuguese in exchange for a [[monopoly]] on many trading goods.\n\nThe combined VOC and Kandyan forces gradually wore down the Portuguese forces, pushing them out of their strongholds across the island. [[Batticaloa]] on the East coast fell to Dutch forces in 1639, then [[Negombo]] on the West coast in 1640. [[Galle]] was [[Siege of Galle (1640)|captured after a siege in 1640]], providing the Dutch with a port and naval base. However the Kandyans became suspicious of their new allies, correctly believing that the VOC goal was not just to remove the Portuguese from Ceylon, but to replace them as the colonial power. The alliance fell apart after a ceasefire was agreed between Dutch and Portuguese forces at some point between 1641 and 1645.\n\nKandyan forces engaged in skirmishing with both Dutch and Portuguese forces over the following years, but were unable to make inroads. The VOC and Kandy returned to negotiations and reformed their alliance in 1649, albeit on different terms. Meanwhile, the Iberian Union had ended in 1640, depriving the Portuguese colonies of Spanish support. The [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] in 1648 had ended the Dutch war with Spain (but not Portugal). These developments together acted to free up Dutch forces from other conflicts, allowing them to concentrate on their attacks on Portuguese colonies.\n\nThe VOC-Kandy alliance went on the offensive in Ceylon from 1652. Whilst Kandy controlled the interior of the island, it was landlocked and the Dutch fleet were able to dominate the coast. Two naval actions were fought between the Dutch and Portuguese on [[Action of 23 March 1654|23 March]] near Colombo and [[Action of 2 May 1654|2 May 1654]] near [[Goa]]; the Portuguese won the first battle but lost their entire Indian subcontinent fleet in the second. The Dutch placed the main Portuguese base of [[Colombo]] under siege in 1655. Rajasingha no longer trusted the Dutch and insisted that Colombo be ceded to Kandy as soon as it fell. However, when the city finally fell in 1656, the Dutch immediately closed the gates against their ally.\n\nFaced with a complete breakdown in relations with the Dutch, the Kandyan's broke off the alliance and pillaged the area around Colombo. They then retreated back inland and resumed their war with the Dutch, which would continue intermittently for the next century.\n\nThe last Portuguese forces were expelled from Ceylon entirely in 1658. The VOC was left in control of Colombo and much of the surrounding coastline, forming [[Dutch Ceylon]].\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main|Dutch Ceylon}}\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nBy the end of the war, the Portuguese had lost all of their possessions on Ceylon along with their trading rights. [[Portuguese Ceylon]] ceased to exist.\n\nThe Dutch were left in control of numerous ports and fortifications along the coastline, along with the major population centres of [[Colombo]] and [[Galle]]. Their possessions on the island were organised into the colony of [[Dutch Ceylon]]. Over the following century the colony gradually expanded its holdings on Ceylon, and engaged in sporadic warfare with Kandy. Eventually the [[Kew Letters]] of 1795 led to the transfer of the Dutch possessions on the island to the British in 1796, forming [[British Ceylon]].\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Kandy]] retreated to the highlands in the interior and east of the island. They continued to resist European influence on Ceylon, engaging in skirmishing and guerilla warfare without making significant inroads into the lowlands. Kandy maintained its independence until 1815 when it [[Kandyan Wars|ceded its power to the British]].\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{needs footnotes|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* B.

These machinations allowed them to control the [[Kingdom of Kotte]], but the main beneficiary was the [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]], which from 1521\u201387 was able to expand \u2013 through conquest of other native kingdoms \u2013 to cover most of Ceylon. King [[Rajasinha I]] of Sitawaka then attempted to expel the Portuguese from the island, but was repulsed with heavy losses at the [[Siege of Colombo]] in 1587\u20138. Most of the newly conquered territories then rebelled against Sitawaka. The divided and disorganised rival kingdoms became easy targets for Portuguese expansion. In a series of military conflicts and political manoeuvres the Portuguese extended their control over the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kotte|Kotte]] (1551), [[Jaffna Kingdom|Jaffna]] (1591), [[Kingdom of Raigama|Raigama]] (1593) and [[Kingdom of Sitawaka|Sitawaka]] (1593).\n\nIn 1592 the Portuguese placed a client ruler on the throne of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]], but he died soon after in suspicious circumstances and they were forced to withdraw. Seeking to subdue the last major kingdom on Ceylon, the Portuguese launched a full military invasion of Kandy in the [[Campaign of Danture]] of 1594. The invasion was a disaster for the Portuguese, with their entire army wiped out by Kandyan [[guerilla warfare]]. The war became a stalemate, with further Portuguese attempts to conquer Kandy repeatedly repulsed, whilst the Kandyans were unable to oust the Portuguese from the rest of the island. A series of rebellions in both Portuguese Ceylon and Kandy led both sides to agree a truce in 1621. The treaty led to Kandy formally becoming a [[vassal state]] of Portugal, but in reality maintaining its independence. This allowed both sides to crush the rebellions in their respective territories, and ended direct conflict between them for the next seventeen years. The Portuguese were also able to conquer the [[Vannimai|Vanni chieftains]] in 1621.\n\nThe uneasy peace was eventually broken by the intervention of the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1638, who sought to exploit the situation to take over Portuguese colonial possessions as part of the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]]. The Dutch formed an alliance with Kandy; together they won several battles against the Portuguese, most notably the [[Siege of Galle (1640)|Siege of Galle]] in 1640. However, the Dutch-Kandyan alliance broke down and the three remaining powers fought each other in triangular warfare for a time. The Dutch and Kandyans renewed their alliance in 1649 to drive the Portuguese from the island. The Portuguese capital [[Colombo]] was conquered in 1656, but once this was done the Dutch immediately betrayed their allies, keeping the Portuguese possessions for themselves.\n\nBy the end of the war in 1658 all Portuguese forces had been expelled from the island, ending [[Portuguese Ceylon]]. The Kingdom of Kandy was the only surviving indigenous state on Ceylon, ruling almost half of the territory. The Dutch were left in control of the major population centres, forming [[Dutch Ceylon]].\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505<ref>S.G.

After killing Vijayabahu, his sons ([[Bhuvanaikabahu VII of Kotte|Bhuvanekabahu]], [[Raigama Bandara|Pararajasingha]] and [[Mayadunne of Sitawaka|Mayadunne]]) divided the kingdom among themselves in the '[[Wijayaba Kollaya|Spoiling of Vijayabahu]]'. Mayadunne received the [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]], Pararajasingha was given the [[Principality of Raigama]] (taking the name Raigama Bandara), and Bhuvanekabahu ruled over the remaining part of Kotte (as Bhuvanekabahu VII). The subsequent rivalries between these three new realms gave the Portuguese an opportunity to expand their influence on the island, by becoming involved in its internal politics.<ref>Rajavaliya p. 77.</ref><ref>S.G. Perera p 20.</ref>\n\nAt first the Portuguese limited themselves to securing their share of the cinnamon trade in Colombo and supporting - and defending - their allies the rulers of Kotte. It was only after [[Dharmapala of Kotte|Dom Jo\u00e3o Dharmapalla]] converted to Christianity and bequeathed his kingdom to the King of Portugal upon his death in 1597, that the Portuguese regarded Kotte as their territory, and considered the conquest of the entire island to secure it.\n\n== Early stages 1521\u20131538 ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n\nDuring the initial encounters, the Portuguese lent their assistance to the Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte to defend against the attacks from Sitawaka.<ref>S.G.

He timed the campaign to begin shortly after the start of the [[monsoon season]], so the Portuguese would not be able to send reinforcements by sea. The Sinhalese army appeared around Colombo on 4 June, consisting of 50,000 men, 2200 pack elephants, 40,000 oxen and 150 small calibre bronze cannon. Supporting the army were 65 light galleys which were to blockade the fortress by sea. The Portuguese captain defending Colombo was [[Jo\u00e3o Correia de Brito]], who had 300 Portuguese soldiers assisted by 700 [[Lascarin]]s, plus a civilian population of some 60,000. Foreseeing the possibility of a siege, he had stockpiled supplies of food and ammunition. The Portuguese flotilla of 6 [[galley]]s was beached due to the weather, but nevertheless Brito sent a small craft over the sea to [[Goa]] with a distress call.<ref>Saturnino Monteiro (2011) ''Portuguese Sea Battles - Volume IV - 1580-1603'' p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:Portuguese Colombo 1650.jpg|thumb|right|Plan view of Portuguese Colombo, made in 1650]]\n\nKnowing of Colombo's defences, which included a lagoon serving as a [[moat]] by its southern side, Rajasinha began the siege by having entrenchments dug around the walls and the lagoon drained, which lasted a month. With the digging complete, Rajasinha rallied his entire army outside Colombo in a display of force, shouting war-cries to intimidate the besieged. Undaunted, Brito ordered a [[Sortie|sally]] against the troops closest to the city, throwing them into great confusion.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 197</ref>\n\nOn the night of 3 August, the Rajasinha ordered the first mass assault. Thousands of Sinhalese attempted to scale Colombo's earthen walls, while [[sapper]]s (aided by hundreds of elephants) tried to breach them. They were met with superior Portuguese firepower. Some Sinhalese were able to climb onto the bastions ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o'' and ''S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo'', but were repelled by a swift Portuguese [[counter attack]]. By the following morning, the Sinhalese had been driven off, having suffered 400 dead and 2,000 wounded.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 198</ref>\n\nOver the following months Rajasinha attempted three more assaults on Colombo, along with attempts to undermine the walls, while the Portuguese conducted [[sortie]]s against Sinhalese positions. With the end of the monsoon, the first Portuguese reinforcements from Goa arrived on 11 September. Further ships carrying reinforcements arrived on 4 October, 23 October, 4 November and 15 February. Finally, on 18 February a large fleet of eighteen galleys commanded by [[Manuel de Sousa Coutinho]] arrived, after raiding Sitawakan shores in northwestern Ceylon. The fleet sailed in battle formation and sounded its guns; the Portuguese defenders greeted it by ringing their church bells and firing a general salvo from the fortress' cannon.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 202</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the reinforcements, there were now 2,000 Portuguese soldiers inside the fortress, in addition to the lascarins and civilian defenders. Rajasinha realised that the opportunity to take Colombo had been lost and lifted the siege shortly afterwards. Over the eight-month campaign, the Sinhalese had lost 5,000 men.<ref>Monteiro 2011, p. 203</ref>\n\n== Portuguese campaign in Jaffna and takeover of Sitawaka 1588\u20131593 ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n{{main|Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom}}\nIn 1588 Kandy rebelled against its new Sitawaka rulers. However, the heirs of the Kandyan royal family had fallen under Portuguese influence and were held in Colombo. In 1592 the Portuguese intervened in Kandy, placing their prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Yamasinghe Bandara]] on the throne. However, the new ruler died in suspicious circumstances shortly after his coronation. The Portuguese accused a rival Kandyan faction of poisoning Bandara, but the Kandyans blamed the Portuguese, who were forced to withdraw. [[Vimaladharmasuriya I]] became the new king of Kandy.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Jaffna Kingdom]] in the north of the island [[Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom|fell increasingly under Portuguese influence]]. In 1591 a Portuguese expedition deposed (and killed) the Jaffna king [[Puviraja Pandaram]], then installed his son [[Ethirimana Cinkam]] as a [[client ruler]].\n\nIn 1593 Sitawaka forces attempted to re-take Kandy, but were repulsed and their king [[Rajasinha I]] died of disease contracted during the fighting. One of the rival claimants to his throne defected to the Portuguese, enabling them to take complete control over Sitawaka.\n== Campaign of Danture 1594 ==\n[[File:Campaign of Danture 1594.png|thumb|right|Key locations in the Campaign of Danture, 1594]]\n\n{{Main|Campaign of Danture}}\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe Portuguese tried again to put their preferred candidate on the throne of Kandy as a [[client ruler]]. This time it was [[Dona Catarina]], a Kandyan princess who had been entrusted to the care of the Portuguese and brought up in a Catholic European style. She was then aged ten or twelve.\n\n[[Pedro Lopes de Sousa]] led a force of about 20,000 in an invasion of Kandy, of which one thousand were Portuguese troops (the majority transferred from [[Goa]] in India for the expedition), 15,400 native [[Lascarin]] allies, 47 [[elephant]]s used as [[pack animal]]s,{{#tag:ref|The elephants were used for [[logistics]] and not as combat [[war elephants]]|group=\"note\"|name=\"elephant\"}} and the remainder [[Badagas|Badaga]] mercenaries from India and [[coolie]] labourers. The initial number of opposing Kandyan forces is unknown, but is estimated at 10,000. The defenders held a distinct advantage in the terrain, as Kandy is a mountainous region and the invading force would be forced to traverse well-defended [[mountain pass]]es.\n\nThe Portuguese stormed the pass at [[Balana]] with heavy losses, after which the Kandyan forces began to retreat before the invaders. The Portuguese were able to enter the capital [[Kandy]] without resistance, finding it abandoned by King [[Vimaladharmasuriya I]]. Dona Catarina was crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy. However, she and her Portuguese advisers were unpopular rulers, particularly after rumours spread that she was to be married to a Portuguese husband (as the Portuguese were indeed planning).\n\nVimaladharmasuriya's forces engaged in [[guerilla]] tactics, attacking Portuguese foraging parties and cutting off lines of supply and communication. A large Portuguese-Lascarin raiding party of 3,000 men was surrounded and destroyed in the Uva region. Shortly thereafter, evidence was found that [[Jayavira Bandara Mudali]], one of the [[Lascarin]] chieftains, was preparing to betray the Portuguese to Vimaladharmasuriya. Part of this evidence was later shown to be fabricated by Vimaladharmasuriya, but Jayavira was killed as a traitor before this was realised.\n\n[[File:The murder of Jayavira Bandara Mudali by the Portuguese.PNG|thumb|right|Portuguese soldiers kill the [[Lascarin]] leader [[Jayavira Bandara Mudali|Jayavira]] and his attendants, who were suspected of treason. Woodcut by [[Philippus Baldaeus]].]]\nThe death of Jayavira led many of the Lascarins to desert, along with all of the Badaga mercenaries. Less than a thousand native allies were left with the Portuguese forces, who were now massively outnumbered, lacking supplies, and faced a mass rebellion. The Portuguese attempted to retreat from Kandy to the fort at [[Balana]]. Losses to guerilla warfare and further Lascarin desertions reduced their forces to about 360 Portuguese and an equal number of Lascarins by the time they reached [[Danture]]. In contrast, defections and troops arriving from other parts of the kingdom had swelled Vimaladharmasuriya's forces to about 20,000 men.\n\nAt Danture, the Portuguese forces were attacked as they retreated. The organised columns disintegrated in the forest and most were wiped out. Sousa surrendered with the remaining 93 European troops. In a departure from usual Sinhalese warfare, the prisoners were tortured and mutilated. Sousa died of the wounds he sustained during the fighting. With the exception of a patrol sent back to the lowlands during the early part of the campaign, only three Portuguese soldiers escaped back to Colombo.\n\nVimaladharmasuriya solidified his control over Kandy by marrying Dona Catarina. In an attempt to prevent further Portuguese incursions he built new fortifications in the Balana pass.\n\n== Portuguese consolidation of Kotte and attacks on Kandy 1595\u20131617 ==\n[[File:De jure political map of Sri Lanka, early 17th century.png|thumb|right|Political situation on Ceylon in the early 17th century]]\nWith the death of Pedro Lopes de Sousa at Danture, [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo|Dom Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo]] succeeded him as Captain-General of Ceylon, and despite the losses in the battle, Kandy was unable to advance into the lowlands as the Portuguese forts and garrisons remained intact.<ref>Chandra Richard De Silva (1972) [https://books.google.pt/books?id=DUEKAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y ''The Portuguese in Ceylon 1617-1638''] H. W. Cave & Company, Colombo</ref>\n\nDom Jer\u00f3nimo proceeded to reform Kotte's provincial administration, dividing it into four provinces, or ''disavas'', each administered by the eponymous ''disava'', with military and judicial powers. The tax system was also reformed and the old system of tributes replaced with fixed mandatory payments. The original military system of castes and levies however, remained organized under the local ''[[mudaliar]]'' commanders, who assisted the Portuguese troops. Dom Jer\u00f3nimo also encouraged missionary work by the [[Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] in addition to the [[Franciscans]].<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 12</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the defeat at Danture sparked a number of uprisings in Kotte which Dom Jer\u00f3nimo had to defeat before he could move on Kandy. He considered the defeat of Kandy an utmost priority to secure Ceylon and secured Kotte first with the construction of fortified encampments in [[Matara fort|Matara]], Sabaragamuwa, [[Menikkadawara fort|Manikkadawara]] and [[Malwana fort|Malwana]], where he established the army HQ.<ref name=\"Silva 1972\">C. R. de Silva (1972) p. 13</ref>\n\nBy 1603, Kotte was firmly secured and Dom Jer\u00f3nimo led his troops into Kandy through the mountain pass, where he seized the Kandian fort at Balana and proceeded towards the city of Kandy itself. However, the kingdom could not be subjugated then due to a rebellion among the Lascarins, and was forced to return to Colombo.<ref name=\"Silva 1972\">C. R. de Silva (1972) p.13</ref>\n\nUnable to capture Kandy, Dom Jer\u00f3nimo adopted a policy of first weakening Kandy through devastating raid warfare by land, twice every year, at harvest time, resorting to light contingents of troops, while blockading the eastern Kandian ports of [[Trincomalee]] and [[Batticaloa]] by sea, between 1604 and 1612 with considerable success. This coincided with a succession crisis in Kandy after the death of king Vimaladharmasuryia in 1604, that was only solved months later with the succession of his cousin [[Senarat of Kandy|Senarat]] to the throne.<ref name=\"Silva 1972\">C. R. de Silva (1972) p.13</ref>\n\nSenarat proved to be an unpopular ruler and unable to prevent the Portuguese from causing great devastation upon Kandian villages and crops. In 1612, Dom Jer\u00f3nimo was appointed as the next viceroy of Portuguese India and was succeeded in Ceylon by [[Francisco de Meneses|Dom Francisco Meneses]] (1612\u20131614), [[Manuel Mascarenhas Homem]] (1614\u20131616) and [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira (Governor)|Dom Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] (1616\u20131618). Because of his great experience in Ceylon, as viceroy Dom [[Jer\u00f3nimo de Azevedo]] kept the Portuguese garrisons well supplied and reinforced, which caused the depopulation of Kandy on account of the systematic Portuguese raids.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 15</ref>\n\n== Rebellions against both powers and submission of Kandy 1617\u20131621 ==\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Sinhalese Warriors.jpg|thumb|right|A Portuguese illustration of Sinhalese warriors, produced {{circa|1540}}]]\n===Uprisings in Portuguese territory===\nThe taxes imposed by the Portuguese, and the desecration of Buddhist temples by missionaries caused great discontent among the Sinhalese peasantry and in late 1616 an uprising broke out in Sabaragamuwa. Disava Filipe de Oliveira's forces camped in the Seven Korales were dispatched south, but in his absence, in December 1616 a much greater revolt broke out in eastern Seven Korales, led by a disgraced grain measurer who claimed to be the grandson of Rajasinha, late prince Nikapitiya Bendara, dead since 1611. Senarat immediately took the opportunity to support Nikapitiya with a force of 2000 men commanded by the former rebel leader Kangara Aratchi, and the Prince of [[Uva Province|Uva]], [[Kuruvita Rala]], to march his forces southwards into Matara and Sabaragamuwa. Under these conditions, the Portuguese were overwhelmed: part of Sabaragmuwa and Matara were overrun while a considerable portion of the Seven Korales fell to Nikapitiya's rebellion.<ref> C. R. de Silva 1972, pg. 22-23</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Kandy===\nDespite initial cordiality, Senarat quickly grew distrustful of Nikapitiyas' success and attitude towards Kandy. Fearing a future rival, he withdrew all his aid and ordered Kuruvita Rala to suspend operations while he attempted to gain a truce with the Portuguese. This in turn caused [[Kuruvita Rala]], a native from Kotte, to rebell in indignation against Senarat, choosing instead to ally with Nikapityia, march against his former ruler and invite Mayadunne of Denawaka exiled in India to become King of Kandy instead (since his lowly caste disallowed him from crowning himself king). In this regard, C.R. de Silva considers Kuruvita Rala to have been \"the true Sinhalese patriot, for it was he who put national above dynastic interests\".<ref> C. R. de Silva 1972, pp. 25\u201326</ref> [[File:Codice Casanatense Sri Lankan Women.png|thumb|right|A Portuguese illustration of Sinhalese women and children, produced {{circa|1540}}]]\n\nKuruvita Rala, ruling much of southern Sri Lanka including the port of Batticaloa, now posed a much graver threat to Senarat than Nikapitiya. Thus, after recapturing the Balana fort from the Portuguese turned to them for a treaty and an alliance, but only when he released all the Portuguese prisoners was captain-general Dom Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira convinced that Senarat's proposal was genuine.<ref> C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 27</ref>\n\n===The Luso-Kandian Treaty===\nBy this sudden turn of events, in August 17 an agreement between the Portuguese and Kandy was reached and a treaty put into effect. In negotiating with the Portuguese, Senarat proved rather capable, refusing most of Portuguese demands but stil had to formally pledge vassalage to the King of Portugal, agree not interfere in missionary work in Kandy (Senarat even entrusted his children to be educated by Franciscans), offer several noblemen as hostages in Colombo and pay two large elephants a year as a token tribute. The Portuguese on their part agreed to a formal alliance and recognized Senerat as the rightful King of Kandy.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, pp. 32\u201334</ref>\n\nWith the coming of favourable winds in March 1617, important Portuguese reinforcements had arrived in Colombo. In June, developments in [[Jaffna kingdom|Jaffna]] favoured the Portuguese as [[Cankili I]] usurped the throne through a coup and in exchange for Portuguese recognition, agreed to prevent supplies and weapons from reaching the rebels from there. Between July and September the Portuguese were able to recapture the Seven Korales, and Nikapitiya fled to the jungles inhabited by the Vanni in northeastern Sri Lanka, never to be seen again.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 31</ref>\n\n==Portuguese conquest of Jaffna 1619==\n[[File:Ceil\u00e3o.png|thumb|right|Maximum extent of [[Portuguese Ceylon]] (cyan), after the conquest of Jaffna in 1619 and the Vanni Chieftains in 1621]]\n{{Main|Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom}}\nAlthough the Portuguese confirmed Cankili as the ruler of Jaffna, Cankilis' brutal murder of political rivals made him an unpopular ruler, and incapable of preventing dissatisfaction especially from the rising number of native Christians of the Kingdom. In August 1618, a rebellion instigated by Christian mudaliars Dom Pedro and Dom Luiz and aided by local Portuguese ''casados'' evicted Cankili from the throne, but was eventually suppressed with the assistance of 5000 men of the Hindu [[Nayak of Tanjore]], in south-east India.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 42</ref> As Cankili was a weak ruler who failed to prevent growing unrest in the kingdom, to pay due tribute to the Portuguese, and was rumoured to be allowing supplies to reach the southern rebels and even seeking aid from the Dutch, in March 1619 the Portuguese captain-general of Ceylon Dom Constantino de S\u00e1 decided to dispatch Filipe de Oliveira ahead of 230 Portuguese and 3000 lascarins to subjugate Jaffna. Furthermore, the captain-general had received reports that a Christian Malabarese privateer on the service of the Zamorin, Dom Pedro Rodrigues, was attacking Portuguese and allied shipping in the vicinity of the island of Mannar, and tasked Oliveira to deal with the issue en route.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 44</ref>\n\nUpon reaching Mannar, Dom Pedro sailed away, and Oliveira proceeded towards Jaffna. Once there, he demanded the payment of due tributes but as negotiations with Cankili failed, in June the Portuguese-Sinhalese forces of Filipe de Oliveira marched on the capital [[Nallur (Jaffna)|Nallur]], defeated the Tamil forces at Jaffna, captured Cankili and formally annexed Jaffna to the Portuguese Crown.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 46</ref> The ancient capital of Jaffna was moved to the coastal city of Jaffna itself (''Jafanapat\u00e3o''), and with the kingdom secured from outside threats by February 1621, navigation in the Palk Strait became much safer. Cankili was sent to Goa to face trial, where he was found guilty. However, he agreed to convert before being formally executed.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 47</ref>\n\n===Developments in southern Ceylon===\n[[File:Saint Francis Xavier Inspiring Portuguese Troops.png|thumb|right|Portuguese soldiers in Asia in the 17th century, painted by Andr\u00e9 Reinoso]]\nElsewhere, in early 1620 Senarat achieved another truce \u2013 with Mayadunne and [[Kuruvita Rala]] \u2013 by promising them the throne of Kotte instead. Only by June 1620 did the Portuguese captain-general Dom Constantino de S\u00e1 de Noronha manage to recapture the southern lowlands, for Kuruvita Rala was a skilled and popular commander and knew the territory well.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 36</ref> A month later, Kuruvita Rala was himself ambushed and killed by the disava{{typo help inline|reason=similar to dissava|date=November 2019}} of Matara Dom Costantino Barreto (a Christian Sinhalese) in Panama, southeastern Ceylon. The departure of Mayadunne of Denawaka back to India in March 1621 brought the end of the rebellion in Kandy, and peace between the Portuguese and Kandy.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 54</ref>\n\n==The Danish==\n[[File:TempleoftheoriginalTrincoKoneswaramKovilCompounds.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Portuguese drawing of the Koneswaram temple]]\nThe second European power to establish a foothold on Ceylon were the Danes. In 1620, Senarat received the first expedition of the [[Danish East India Company]] led by [[Ove Gjedde]], who reached Ceylon after a perilous journey of over two years, that claimed more than half its personnel. Senarat placed great expectations on a Danish alliance against the Portuguese and agreed to sign a treaty and grant them the port of Trincomalee, where the great [[Koneswaram temple]] of was located. However, until the Danish could prove capable against the Portuguese, Senarat was not willing to relinquish his hard-won peace with them or grant the Danes any further concessions. Thus, just two weeks after the treaty was signed, the Danish evacuated Trincomalee and left for [[Tranquebar]] in [[Tanjore]], where they established a fort.<ref>C. R. de Silva 1972, pg. 53-54</ref>\n\n== Dutch intervention 1638\u20131658 ==\n{{See also|Dutch\u2013Portuguese War|Battle of Gannoruwa}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:The Dutch Storm the fort of Galle - 1640.png|thumb|right|Dutch forces storm the fort of Galle in 1640, by [[Philippus Baldaeus]]]]\nThe kingdoms of Spain and Portugal had been in [[dynastic union]] under the [[Spanish Habsburgs]] since [[Portuguese succession crisis of 1580|a Portuguese succession crisis in 1580]]. This [[Iberian Union]] possessed a vast empire of colonial possessions, but lacked the strength (particularly naval forces) to defend them. Other colonial powers sought to take advantage of this weakness to obtain their own empires, particularly after the [[Habsburg Spain#The road to Rocroi (1626\u20131643)|collapse of the Iberian economy in 1627]]. The Spanish overseas possessions were generally better defended than Portuguese ones, which were widely scattered and difficult to reinforce.\n\nThe rival [[Dutch Empire]] \u2013 engaged in the [[Eighty Years' War]] against its former master, Spain \u2013 concentrated its overseas efforts on conquering parts of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the [[Dutch\u2013Portuguese War]]. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) sought to oust the Portuguese from the [[East Indies]] and [[Indian subcontinent]] so they could control the lucrative [[spice trade]]. Seeing an opportunity to undermine the Portuguese on Ceylon, the VOC made contact with the [[Kingdom of Kandy]]. Confidence in the Kandyan forces rose after they defeated a Portuguese army at the [[Battle of Gannoruwa]] in March 1638. Shortly thereafter, the VOC and [[Rajasinha II of Kandy]] [[Kandyan Treaty of 1638|signed a treaty in May 1638]], by which the VOC promised to aid Kandy in its continuing war against the Portuguese in exchange for a [[monopoly]] on many trading goods.\n\nThe combined VOC and Kandyan forces gradually wore down the Portuguese forces, pushing them out of their strongholds across the island. [[Batticaloa]] on the East coast fell to Dutch forces in 1639, then [[Negombo]] on the West coast in 1640. [[Galle]] was [[Siege of Galle (1640)|captured after a siege in 1640]], providing the Dutch with a port and naval base. However the Kandyans became suspicious of their new allies, correctly believing that the VOC goal was not just to remove the Portuguese from Ceylon, but to replace them as the colonial power. The alliance fell apart after a ceasefire was agreed between Dutch and Portuguese forces at some point between 1641 and 1645.\n\nKandyan forces engaged in skirmishing with both Dutch and Portuguese forces over the following years, but were unable to make inroads. The VOC and Kandy returned to negotiations and reformed their alliance in 1649, albeit on different terms. Meanwhile, the Iberian Union had ended in 1640, depriving the Portuguese colonies of Spanish support. The [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] in 1648 had ended the Dutch war with Spain (but not Portugal). These developments together acted to free up Dutch forces from other conflicts, allowing them to concentrate on their attacks on Portuguese colonies.\n\nThe VOC-Kandy alliance went on the offensive in Ceylon from 1652. Whilst Kandy controlled the interior of the island, it was landlocked and the Dutch fleet were able to dominate the coast. Two naval actions were fought between the Dutch and Portuguese on [[Action of 23 March 1654|23 March]] near Colombo and [[Action of 2 May 1654|2 May 1654]] near [[Goa]]; the Portuguese won the first battle but lost their entire Indian subcontinent fleet in the second. The Dutch placed the main Portuguese base of [[Colombo]] under siege in 1655. Rajasingha no longer trusted the Dutch and insisted that Colombo be ceded to Kandy as soon as it fell. However, when the city finally fell in 1656, the Dutch immediately closed the gates against their ally.\n\nFaced with a complete breakdown in relations with the Dutch, the Kandyan's broke off the alliance and pillaged the area around Colombo. They then retreated back inland and resumed their war with the Dutch, which would continue intermittently for the next century.\n\nThe last Portuguese forces were expelled from Ceylon entirely in 1658. The VOC was left in control of Colombo and much of the surrounding coastline, forming [[Dutch Ceylon]].\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Main|Dutch Ceylon}}\n\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\nBy the end of the war, the Portuguese had lost all of their possessions on Ceylon along with their trading rights. [[Portuguese Ceylon]] ceased to exist.\n\nThe Dutch were left in control of numerous ports and fortifications along the coastline, along with the major population centres of [[Colombo]] and [[Galle]]. Their possessions on the island were organised into the colony of [[Dutch Ceylon]]. Over the following century the colony gradually expanded its holdings on Ceylon, and engaged in sporadic warfare with Kandy. Eventually the [[Kew Letters]] of 1795 led to the transfer of the Dutch possessions on the island to the British in 1796, forming [[British Ceylon]].\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Kandy]] retreated to the highlands in the interior and east of the island. They continued to resist European influence on Ceylon, engaging in skirmishing and guerilla warfare without making significant inroads into the lowlands. Kandy maintained its independence until 1815 when it [[Kandyan Wars|ceded its power to the British]].\n\n== References and notes ==\n{{needs footnotes|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Notes ===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* B.
