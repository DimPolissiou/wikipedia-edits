De Bono identifies six distinct directions in which the brain can be challenged. In each of these directions the brain will identify and bring into conscious thought certain aspects of issues being considered (e.g. gut instinct, pessimistic judgement, neutral facts). None of these directions is a completely natural way of thinking, but rather how some of us already represent the results of our thinking.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nSince the hats do not represent natural modes of thinking, each hat must be used for a limited time only.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Also, some will feel that using the hats is unnatural, uncomfortable or even counterproductive and against their better judgement.\n\nA compelling example presented is sensitivity to \"mismatch\" stimuli. This is presented as a valuable survival instinct, because, in the natural world: the thing that is out of the ordinary may well be dangerous. This mode is identified as the root of negative judgement and [[critical thinking]].\n\nColored hats are used as metaphors for each direction.  Switching to a direction is [[symbol]]ized by the act of putting on a colored hat, either literally or metaphorically. This metaphor of using an imaginary hat or cap as a symbol for a different thinking direction was first mentioned by De Bono as early as 1971 in his book \"Lateral Thinking for Management\" when describing a brainstorming framework.<ref>Edward De Bono 1971. Lateral Thinking for Management: A Handbook Of Creativity. American Management Association, New York. pp. 116</ref> These metaphors allow for a more complete and elaborate segregation of the thinking directions. The six thinking hats indicate problems and solutions about an idea the thinker may come up with. \n\nSimilarly, \"The Five Stages of Thinking\" method\u2014a set of tools corresponding to all six thinking hats\u2014first appears in his CoRT Thinking Programme in 1973:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|  style=\"background:lightgrey; width:12%;\"| '''HAT'''\n| style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| '''OVERVIEW'''\n| style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| '''TECHNIQUE'''\n|-\n| style=\"background:blue; color:white; width:12%;\"| '''BLUE'''\n| \"The Big Picture\"\n| CAF; FIP\n|-\n| style=\"background:white; width:12%;\"| '''WHITE'''\n| \"Facts & Information\"\n| Information\n|-\n| style=\"background:red; color:white; width:12%;\"| '''RED'''\n| \"Feelings & Emotions\"\n| Emotions and Ego\n|-\n| style=\"background:black; color:white; width:12%;\"| '''BLACK'''\n| \"Critical Judgement\"\n| PMI; Evaluation\n|-\n| style=\"background:yellow; width:12%;\"| '''YELLOW'''\n| \"Positive\"\n| PMI\n|-\n| style=\"background:green; color:white; width:12%;\"| '''GREEN'''\n| \"New Ideas\"\n| Concept Challenge; Yes, No, Po\n|}<ref>de Bono, Edward, CoRT Thinking Program, Workcards and Teacher\u2019s Notes, 1973a, Sydney: Direct Education Services.\n</ref>\n\n==Strategies and programs==\nHaving identified the six modes of thinking that can be accessed, distinct programs can be created. These are sequences of hats which encompass and structure the [[thought|thinking process]] toward a distinct goal. A number of these are included in the materials provided to support the franchised training of the six hats method; however it is often necessary to adapt them to suit an individual purpose. Also, programs are often \"emergent\", which is to say that the group might plan the first few hats then the facilitator will see what seems to be the right way to go.\n\nSequences always begin and end with a blue hat; the group agrees together how they will think, then they do the thinking, then they evaluate the outcomes of that thinking and what they should do next.\nSequences (and indeed hats) may be used by individuals working alone or in groups. Example programs are shown below, each hat is typically used for approximately 2 minutes at a time \u2013 although at the start of a process an extended white hat session is common to get everyone onto the same page, and the red hat is recommended to be used for a very short period to get a visceral gut reaction \u2013 about 30 seconds, and in practice often takes the form of [[dot-voting]].<ref>Six Thinking Hats; Official training materials, DeBono Thinking Systems</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightgrey;| '''ACTIVITY'''\n| style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| '''HAT SEQUENCE'''\n|-\n| '''Initial Ideas'''\n| Blue, White, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Choosing between alternatives'''\n| Blue, White, (Green), Yellow, Black, Red, Blue\n|-\n| '''Identifying Solutions'''\n| Blue, White, Black, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Quick Feedback'''\n| Blue, Black, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Strategic Planning'''\n| Blue, Yellow, Black, White, Blue, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Process Improvement'''\n| Blue, White, White (Other People's Views), Yellow, Black, Green, Red, Blue\n|-\n| '''Solving Problems'''\n| Blue, White, Green, Red, Yellow, Black, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Performance Review'''\n| Blue, Red, White, Yellow, Black, Green, Blue\n|}\n\n== Use ==\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}\nSpeedo researchers are said to have tried the six thinking hats in the creation of swimsuits. \"They tried the \"Six Thinking Hats\" method of [[brainstorming]], a green hat for creative ways to attack a problem, a black one to look at the feasibility of those ideas.\"<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Spanx-on-Steroids-How-Speedo-Created-the-New-Record-Breaking-Swimsuit-160581545.html?c=y&story=fullstor ''Spanx on Steroids: How Speedo Created the New Record-Breaking Swimsuit'']</ref>\n\n<p>Typically, a project will begin with an extended white hat action, as facts are assembled. Thereafter each hat is used for a few minutes at a time only, except the red hat which is limited to a very short 30 seconds or so to ensure that it is an instinctive [[gut reaction]], rather than a form of judgement. This pace is believed to have a positive impact on the thinking process, in accordance with [[Malcolm Gladwell]]'s theories on \"[[Blink (book)|blink]]\" thinking.</P>\n\n<p>De Bono believed<ref>{{cite book | title=De zes denkende hoofddeksels | publisher=Uitgeverij | author=De Bono, E | year=2005 | location=Amsterdam | trans-title=Six Thinking Hats | edition=16th}}</ref> that the key to a successful use of the Six Thinking Hats methodology was the deliberate focusing of the discussion on a particular approach as needed during the meeting or collaboration session.  For instance, a meeting may be called to review a particular problem and to develop a solution for the problem.  The Six Thinking Hats method could then be used in a sequence to first explore the problem, then develop a set of solutions, and to finally choose a solution through critical examination of the solution set.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting may start with everyone assuming the '''Blue''' hat to discuss how the meeting will be conducted and to develop the goals and objectives.  The discussion may then move to '''Red''' hat thinking in order to collect opinions and reactions to the problem.  This phase may also be used to develop constraints for the actual solution such as who will be affected by the problem and/or solutions.  Next the discussion may move to the ('''Yellow''' then) '''Green''' hat in order to generate ideas and possible solutions.  Next the discussion may move between '''White''' hat thinking as part of developing information and '''Black''' hat thinking to develop criticisms of the solution set.</p>\n\n<p>Because everyone is focused on a particular approach at any one time, the group tends to be more collaborative than if one person is reacting emotionally (Red hat) while another person is trying to be objective (White hat) and still another person is being critical of the points which emerge from the discussion (Black hat). The hats aid individuals in addressing problems from a variety of angles, and focus individuals on deficiencies in the way that they approach problem solving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujhKRrrd9dwC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58|title=InnovationNet: the Art of Creating and Benefiting from Innovation Networks|date=23 December 2017|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|via=Google Books|page=58|isbn=9789023243656}}</ref></p>\n\n\n\n==Publication data==\n* Edward de Bono.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coloured hat]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[Lateral thinking]]\n* [[Team Role Inventories]]\n* [[Wiktionary:thinking cap]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Books about creativity]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology]]\n[[Category:1985 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Self-help books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Blue hat|the [[security hacker]] term|BlueHat}}\n{{Infobox book\n<!-- |italic title = (see above) -->\n| name             = Six Thinking Hats\n| image            = Six Thinking Hats.jpg<!-- include the file, px and alt: [[File:Example.jpg|200px|Cover]] -->\n| caption          = \n| author           = Edward de Bono \n| title_orig       = \n| translator       = \n| illustrator      = \n| cover_artist     = \n| country          = \n| language         = \n| series           = \n| subject          = Psychology\n| genre            = Self-help\n| publisher        = [[Little Brown and Company]]<ref name=\"amazon\">[https://www.amazon.com/Six-Thinking-Hats-Essential-Management/dp/0316177911/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0/178-7924583-7115323 Amazon.com listing], Hardcover edition, retrieved March 7, 2012.</ref>\n| pub_date         = 1985<ref name=\"amazon\"/>\n| english_pub_date = \n| media_type       = \n| pages            = 207 \n| isbn             = 0-316-17791-1\n| oclc             = \n| dewey            = \n| congress         = \n| preceded_by      = Masterthinker's Handbook (1985)\n| followed_by      = I Am Right, You Are Wrong (1991)\n}}\n'''''Six Thinking Hats''''' was written by Dr. [[Edward de Bono]]. \"Six Thinking Hats\" and the associated idea [[parallel thinking]] provide a means for groups to plan thinking processes in a detailed and cohesive way, and in doing so to think together more effectively.<ref>de Bono, Edward (1985).

These are sequences of hats which encompass and structure the [[thought|thinking process]] toward a distinct goal. A number of these are included in the materials provided to support the franchised training of the six hats method; however it is often necessary to adapt them to suit an individual purpose. Also, programs are often \"emergent\", which is to say that the group might plan the first few hats then the facilitator will see what seems to be the right way to go.\n\nSequences always begin and end with a blue hat; the group agrees together how they will think, then they do the thinking, then they evaluate the outcomes of that thinking and what they should do next.\nSequences (and indeed hats) may be used by individuals working alone or in groups. Example programs are shown below, each hat is typically used for approximately 2 minutes at a time \u2013 although at the start of a process an extended white hat session is common to get everyone onto the same page, and the red hat is recommended to be used for a very short period to get a visceral gut reaction \u2013 about 30 seconds, and in practice often takes the form of [[dot-voting]].<ref>Six Thinking Hats; Official training materials, DeBono Thinking Systems</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightgrey;| '''ACTIVITY'''\n| style=\"background:lightgrey;\"| '''HAT SEQUENCE'''\n|-\n| '''Initial Ideas'''\n| Blue, White, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Choosing between alternatives'''\n| Blue, White, (Green), Yellow, Black, Red, Blue\n|-\n| '''Identifying Solutions'''\n| Blue, White, Black, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Quick Feedback'''\n| Blue, Black, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Strategic Planning'''\n| Blue, Yellow, Black, White, Blue, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Process Improvement'''\n| Blue, White, White (Other People's Views), Yellow, Black, Green, Red, Blue\n|-\n| '''Solving Problems'''\n| Blue, White, Green, Red, Yellow, Black, Green, Blue\n|-\n| '''Performance Review'''\n| Blue, Red, White, Yellow, Black, Green, Blue\n|}\n\n== Use ==\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}}\nSpeedo researchers are said to have tried the six thinking hats in the creation of swimsuits. \"They tried the \"Six Thinking Hats\" method of [[brainstorming]], a green hat for creative ways to attack a problem, a black one to look at the feasibility of those ideas.\"<ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Spanx-on-Steroids-How-Speedo-Created-the-New-Record-Breaking-Swimsuit-160581545.html?c=y&story=fullstor ''Spanx on Steroids: How Speedo Created the New Record-Breaking Swimsuit'']</ref>\n\n<p>Typically, a project will begin with an extended white hat action, as facts are assembled. Thereafter each hat is used for a few minutes at a time only, except the red hat which is limited to a very short 30 seconds or so to ensure that it is an instinctive [[gut reaction]], rather than a form of judgement. This pace is believed to have a positive impact on the thinking process, in accordance with [[Malcolm Gladwell]]'s theories on \"[[Blink (book)|blink]]\" thinking.</P>\n\n<p>De Bono believed<ref>{{cite book | title=De zes denkende hoofddeksels | publisher=Uitgeverij | author=De Bono, E | year=2005 | location=Amsterdam | trans-title=Six Thinking Hats | edition=16th}}</ref> that the key to a successful use of the Six Thinking Hats methodology was the deliberate focusing of the discussion on a particular approach as needed during the meeting or collaboration session.  For instance, a meeting may be called to review a particular problem and to develop a solution for the problem.  The Six Thinking Hats method could then be used in a sequence to first explore the problem, then develop a set of solutions, and to finally choose a solution through critical examination of the solution set.</p>\n\n<p>The meeting may start with everyone assuming the '''Blue''' hat to discuss how the meeting will be conducted and to develop the goals and objectives.  The discussion may then move to '''Red''' hat thinking in order to collect opinions and reactions to the problem.  This phase may also be used to develop constraints for the actual solution such as who will be affected by the problem and/or solutions.  Next the discussion may move to the ('''Yellow''' then) '''Green''' hat in order to generate ideas and possible solutions.  Next the discussion may move between '''White''' hat thinking as part of developing information and '''Black''' hat thinking to develop criticisms of the solution set.</p>\n\n<p>Because everyone is focused on a particular approach at any one time, the group tends to be more collaborative than if one person is reacting emotionally (Red hat) while another person is trying to be objective (White hat) and still another person is being critical of the points which emerge from the discussion (Black hat). The hats aid individuals in addressing problems from a variety of angles, and focus individuals on deficiencies in the way that they approach problem solving.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ujhKRrrd9dwC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58|title=InnovationNet: the Art of Creating and Benefiting from Innovation Networks|date=23 December 2017|publisher=Uitgeverij Van Gorcum|via=Google Books|page=58|isbn=9789023243656}}</ref></p>\n\n\n\n==Publication data==\n* Edward de Bono.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Coloured hat]]\n* [[Educational psychology]]\n* [[Intelligence]]\n* [[Lateral thinking]]\n* [[Team Role Inventories]]\n* [[Wiktionary:thinking cap]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Books about creativity]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology]]\n[[Category:1985 non-fiction books]]\n[[Category:Self-help books]]\n", "name_user": "ManuRoquette", "label": "safe", "comment": "abusive redirection", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats"}

Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the title of which reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], Stratford.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=29}}\n\nThe original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} Wilcock's friend, [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]\nIron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert. Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with [[Doug Sampson]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=50}} As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\nHarris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=54}} Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=64}}\n\n===Record contract and early releases (1978\u20131981)===\n{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104\u2013105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004|p=102}} all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=104-105}}\n\nIn December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=163\u2013164}} Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" and \"Wrathchild\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012}}\n\n[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their British Steel Tour, 1980]]\nIron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=143}} In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the [[first music videos aired on MTV]]),{{sfn|Roland|2013}} the album includes other early favourites such as \"[[Running Free]]\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting [[Judas Priest]] on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with [[UFO (band)|UFO]] headlining. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by [[Adrian Smith]] in October 1980.\n\nIn 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=181}} who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|The Aladdin Casino]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=251}}\n\n===Success (1981\u20131985)===\n{{main|The Number of the Beast (album)|Piece of Mind|Powerslave|Live After Death}}\n\nBy 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} about which Di'Anno comments, \"it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day&nbsp;... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=194}} With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} at which point the band had already selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}\n\nAfter a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], previously of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}  The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.{{sfn|Dome|2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', which gave the band their first UK Albums Chart No.&nbsp;1 record{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=227}} and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \"moral contribution\" to \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"[[Run to the Hills]]\".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=82}} For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed [[The Beast on the Road]], during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; in 2010 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Pfanner|2010}}\n\nThe Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} to the point where a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.{{sfn|Young(1)}} In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as \"silliness\",{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} and that the demonstrations in fact gave them \"loads of publicity\".{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\n[[File:Nicko McBrain 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicko McBrain]] has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982]]\nIn December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] was fired from the band and replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], who previously played for [[Trust (French band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=233}} Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=232\u2013233}} Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.{{sfn|Marlow|2011}} Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=246}} In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the No.&nbsp;3 spot in the UK,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=247}} and was the band's debut in the North American charts, reaching No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} ''Piece of Mind'' includes the successful singles, \"[[The Trooper]]\" and \"[[Flight of Icarus]]\", the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=245}}\n\nSoon after the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its [[World Piece Tour|supporting tour]], the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'', on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles \"[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]\", \"[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]\", as well as \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\", based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem of the same name]], and running over 13 minutes in length.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}}\n\nThe tour, following the album, dubbed the [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date, and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=102}} Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts. Their first live album, ''[[Live After Death]]'', was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}} Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock in Rio]] festival to an estimated 300,000 in attendance.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=255}}\n\n===Experimentation (1986\u20131989)===\n{{main|Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son}}\n\nReturning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', featuring, for the first time in the band's history, [[synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.{{sfn|Huey(3)}} The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \"[[Wasted Years]]\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \"left to [his] own devices\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", and \"[[Stranger in a Strange Land (Iron Maiden song)|Stranger in a Strange Land]]\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=261}} the last of which would be the album's second single.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}}\n\nThe experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, entitled ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]], based on the 1987 novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]],{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} would be the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith,{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} as opposed to [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar synthesisers]] on the previous release.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} After his contributions were not used for ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=263}} although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.{{sfn|RIAA}}\n\nDuring the following [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} Also included on the bill were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Megadeth]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[Helloween]].{{sfn|UK Rock Festivals}} The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=272}} Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=266|2a1=Johnson|2y=1988}} Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Gennet|2010}}\n\n===Upheaval (1989\u20131994)===\n{{main|No Prayer for the Dying|Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nDuring another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], entitled ''[[Silver and Gold (ASAP album)|Silver and Gold]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}} and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]], releasing ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'' in 1990,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=281}} followed by a tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, ''[[The First Ten Years (boxed set)|The First Ten Years]]'', a series of ten CDs and double [[12-inch single]]s. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.\n\nSoon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} The album, ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', was released in October 1990,{{sfn|Prato}} and contained \"[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]\", the band's first (and to date, only) [[UK Singles Chart]] No.&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}} The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.\n\nAfter another [[No Prayer on the Road|tour]] and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', which was released in 1992 and included the stand-out [[Fear of the Dark (song)|title track]], which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No.&nbsp;1 in the UK albums chart,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} the disc also featured the No.&nbsp;2 single \"[[Be Quick or Be Dead]]\" and the No.&nbsp;21 single \"[[From Here to Eternity (Iron Maiden song)|From Here to Eternity]]\". The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The [[Fear of the Dark Tour|extensive worldwide tour that followed]] included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the [[Monsters of Rock]] festivals in seven European countries. Iron Maiden's second performance at [[Donington Park]], to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} was filmed for the audio and video release, ''[[Live at Donington (Iron Maiden album)|Live at Donington]]'', and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}}\n\nIn 1993, Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=296}} Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=297}} He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]], and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (video)|Raising Hell]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=298}}\n\n===Blaze Bayley era, ''The X Factor'' and ''Virtual XI'' (1994\u20131999)===\n{{main|The X Factor (album)|Virtual XI}}\n\nIn 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=301}} Harris' preferred choice from the outset,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=302}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(b)}}\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus (as well as a three-year hiatus from studio releases \u2013 a record for the band at the time), Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing their next studio album, ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'', the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No.&nbsp;8),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=313}} although it would go on to win ''Album of the Year'' awards in France and Germany.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}}  The record included the 11-minute epic \"Sign of the Cross\", the band's longest song since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", as well as the singles, \"[[Man on the Edge]]\", based on the film ''[[Falling Down]]'',{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=44}} and \"[[Lord of the Flies (song)|Lord of the Flies]]\", based on the [[Lord of the Flies|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Popoff|2005(b)}} The release is notable for its \"dark\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} [[The X Factour|The band toured]] for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=314}} and ending in the [[Americas]]. After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, \"[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]\", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=316}}\n\nIn 1998, Iron Maiden released ''[[Virtual XI]]'', whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(a)}}{{sfn|Sverigetopplistan}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;16 in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|1998}}  At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).{{sfn|Saulnier|2010}}\n\nBayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=324}} The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=321}} although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2010}}\n\n===Return of Dickinson and Smith, ''Brave New World'' (1999\u20132002)===\n{{main|Ed Hunter|Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)}}\n[[File:Iron Maiden en Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three guitar line-up.]]\n\nWhile the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=328}} Although Harris admitted that he \"wasn't really into it\" at first, he then thought, \"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?'

I'd heard [[Jimi Hendrix]] using legato when I was growing up, and I liked that style of playing.\"{{sfn|McIver|2010(a)}} Stating that he \"was inspired by [[blues rock]] rather than metal,\" Adrian Smith was influenced by [[Johnny Winter]] and [[Pat Travers]], leading to him becoming a \"melodic player.\"{{sfn|McIver|2010(c)}} Janick Gers, on the other hand, prefers a more improvised style, largely inspired by [[Ritchie Blackmore]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=277}} which he claims is in contrast to Smith's \"rhythmic\" sound.{{sfn|McIver|2010(b)}}\n\nSinger Bruce Dickinson, who typically works in collaboration with guitarist Adrian Smith,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=244}} has an operatic vocal style, inspired by [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], [[Peter Hammill]], [[Ian Anderson]] and [[Ian Gillan]],{{sfn|Dmme.net}} and is often considered to be one of the best heavy metal vocalists of all time.{{sfnm|1a1=Rosen|1y=2011|2a1=HearYa.com|2y=2006|3a1=Blabbermouth.net|3y=2009a|4a1=Blabbermouth.net|4y=2009b}} Although Nicko McBrain has only received one writing credit, on the ''Dance of Death'' album,{{sfn|Ling|2005b}} Harris often relies on him while developing songs. Adrian Smith commented, \"Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=241}}\n\nThroughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesisers on 1986's ''Somewhere in Time'',{{sfn|Prato}} keyboards on 1988's ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} and an attempt to return to the \"stripped down\" production of their earlier material on {{notatypo|1990's}} ''No Prayer for the Dying''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} In recent years, however, the band have begun using more [[progressive rock|progressive]] elements in their songs,{{sfnm|1a1=Dome|1y=2006a|2a1=Dome|2y=2006b}} which Steve Harris describes as not progressive \"in the modern sense, but like [[Dream Theater]], more in a 70s way\".{{sfn|Dome|2006b}} According to Harris, ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'' was the band's first album which was \"more progressive\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=264}} while they would only return to this style from 1995's ''The X Factor'', which he states is \"like an extension of ''Seventh Son''..., in the sense of the progressive element to it\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} The development contrasts with the band's raw-sounding earlier material,{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} which [[AllMusic]] states was \"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock\",{{sfn|Huey(1)}} although Harris firmly denies this.{{sfn|VH1|2011}}\n\n==Band members==\n{{details|List of Iron Maiden band members}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n'''Current members'''\n* [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] \u2013 [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Backing vocalist|backing vocals]] <small>(1975\u2013present)</small>, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s <small>(1988, 1998\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]] \u2013 [[Electric guitar|guitar]]s <small>(1976\u20131977, 1978\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Adrian Smith]] \u2013 guitars, backing vocals <small>(1980\u20131990, 1999\u2013present)</small>, keyboards <small>(1988)</small>\n* [[Bruce Dickinson]] \u2013 [[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]] <small>(1981\u20131993, 1999\u2013present)</small>, [[piano]] <small>(2015)</small>\n* [[Nicko McBrain]] \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]] <small>(1982\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Janick Gers]] \u2013 guitars <small>(1990\u2013present)</small>\n\n'''Touring musicians'''\n* Michael Kenney \u2013 keyboards <small>(1988\u2013present)</small>\n\n{{col-2}}\n'''Former members'''\n* [[Doug Sampson]] \u2013 drums <small>(1977\u20131979)</small>\n* [[Paul Di'Anno]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1978\u20131981)</small>\n* [[Dennis Stratton]] \u2013 guitars, backing vocals <small>(1979\u20131980)</small>\n* [[Clive Burr]] \u2013 drums <small>(1979\u20131982)</small>\n* [[Blaze Bayley]] \u2013 lead vocals <small>(1994\u20131999)</small>\n<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THESE MEMBERS -->\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Iron Maiden discography|List of songs recorded by Iron Maiden}}\n* ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' (1982)\n* ''[[Piece of Mind]]'' (1983)\n* ''[[Powerslave]]'' (1984)\n* ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'' (1986)\n* ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'' (1992)\n* ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Virtual XI]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'' (2003)\n* ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (album)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (2006)\n* ''[[The Final Frontier]]'' (2010)\n* ''[[The Book of Souls]]'' (2015)\n\n==Concert tours==\n{{main|List of Iron Maiden concert tours}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:80%\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:105px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Duration\n! style=\"width:220px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Concert tour\n! colspan=6|Lineups\n! style=\"width:7px;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Dates\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller\"\n!Vocals\n!Bass\n! colspan=3|Guitars\n!Drums\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <small>Feb 1980</small>\n| <small>'''[[Metal for Muthas Tour]]'''</small>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"3\"| <small>'''[[Paul Di'Anno|P.

The band's [[Iron Maiden discography|discography]] has grown to 39 albums, including 16 studio albums, 12 live albums, four [[Extended play|EPs]], and seven [[compilation album|compilations]].\n\nPioneers of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US platinum and gold albums, including 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', 1983's ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', 1984's ''[[Powerslave]]'', 1985's live release ''[[Live After Death]]'', 1986's ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', and 1988's ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]''. Since the return of lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with series of new albums and tours.{{sfn|Green|2010}} Their 2010 studio offering, ''[[The Final Frontier]]'', peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in 28&nbsp;countries and received widespread critical acclaim. The sixteenth studio album, ''[[The Book of Souls]]'', was released on 4 September 2015 and debuted at number one in the album charts of 43 countries.{{sfn|Band Bio|2020}}<!--Please do not change this data, info from official band's bio.-->\n\nDespite little radio or television support,{{sfn|Smith|2009}} Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reporting in 2017 that the band have sold over 100&nbsp;million<!-- NOTE (~~~): The sales figures (70m/80m/85m/110m) have gone through extensive discussion on the article's talk page.

For 40&nbsp;years the band have been supported by their famous mascot, \"[[Eddie (Iron Maiden)|Eddie]]\", who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1975\u20131978)===\n[[File:Cartandhorses.jpg|thumb|right|The Cart and Horses Pub, located in Maryland Point, Stratford, was where Iron Maiden played some of their first shows in 1976.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=29|2a1=Bushell|2a2=Halfin|2y=1985|2p=9}}]]\n\nIron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day, 25 December 1975 by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributed the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], the title of which reminded him of the [[iron maiden|iron maiden torture device]].{{sfn|Barton|1979}} After months of rehearsal, Iron Maiden made their debut at St. Nicks Hall in Poplar on 1 May 1976,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} before taking up a semi-residency at the Cart and Horses Pub in [[Maryland, London|Maryland]], Stratford.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=29}}\n\nThe original line-up was short-lived, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as, according to Harris, he lacked \"energy or charisma on stage\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} Wilcock's friend, [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]], was invited to join, much to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disband Iron Maiden in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Harris and Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.\n\n[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|left|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]\nIron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band on stage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.{{sfn|EMI|2004}} A new line-up was put together, including future [[Cutting Crew]] member [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]] (better known today as Thunderstick). A poor performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} in November 1977 was the line-up's first and only concert. Afterwards, Iron Maiden fired Purkis and replaced him with [[Doug Sampson]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} A few months later, Dennis Wilcock decided to leave Iron Maiden to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=50}} As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return, and was also dismissed.{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\nHarris, Murray, and Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=54}} Steve Harris stated, \"There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=53}} At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, \"Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=64}}\n\n===Record contract and early releases (1978\u20131981)===\n{{main|The Soundhouse Tapes|Iron Maiden (album)|Killers (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} Hoping that the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called \"Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse\", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, \"Prowler\", eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104\u2013105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they released the demo on their own record label as ''[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]'', named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=103}} Featuring only three tracks (one song, \"Strange World\", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004|p=102}} all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=104-105}}\n\nIn December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend, [[Adrian Smith]] of [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=163\u2013164}} Due to his commitment to Urchin, Smith declined and [[Dennis Stratton]] was hired instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues, and was replaced by ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December 1979.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" and \"Wrathchild\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[new wave of British heavy metal]].{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=139|2a1=Saulnier|2y=2012}}\n\n[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting [[Judas Priest]] on their British Steel Tour, 1980]]\nIron Maiden released their [[Iron Maiden (album)|self-titled album]] in 1980, which debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=143}} In addition to the title track (a live version of which would be one of the [[first music videos aired on MTV]]),{{sfn|Roland|2013}} the album includes other early favourites such as \"[[Running Free]]\", \"Transylvania\", \"Phantom of the Opera\", and \"[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]\" \u2013 which was not on the original UK release, but appeared on the US version and subsequent remasters. The band embarked on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting [[Judas Priest]] on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. Iron Maiden also appeared, to much acclaim, at the Reading Festival 1980. They were second to top of the bill on the Saturday, with [[UFO (band)|UFO]] headlining. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,{{sfn|Hinchcliffe|1999}} and was replaced by [[Adrian Smith]] in October 1980.\n\nIn 1981, Iron Maiden released their second studio album, ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Murders in the Rue Morgue\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=183}} (the latter's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).{{sfn|Brannigan}} Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=181}} who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|The Aladdin Casino]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=251}}\n\n===Success (1981\u20131985)===\n{{main|The Number of the Beast (album)|Piece of Mind|Powerslave|Live After Death}}\n\nBy 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly due to his drug usage,{{sfn|EMI|2004}} about which Di'Anno comments, \"it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day&nbsp;... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much.\"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=194}} With his performances waning, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} at which point the band had already selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}\n\nAfter a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], previously of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}  The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} For the last show, and in anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played \"Children of the Damned\" and \"22 Acacia Avenue\", introducing fans to the sound towards which they were progressing.{{sfn|Dome|2014}}\n\nIn 1982, Iron Maiden released their third studio album, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', which gave the band their first UK Albums Chart No.&nbsp;1 record{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=227}} and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} At the time, Dickinson was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management, and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a \"moral contribution\" to \"Children of the Damned\", \"The Prisoner\" and \"[[Run to the Hills]]\".{{sfn|Shooman|2007|p=82}} For the second time the band embarked on a world tour, dubbed [[The Beast on the Road]], during which they visited North America, Japan, Australia, and Europe, including a headline appearance at the Reading Festival. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; in 2010 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the album had sold over 14 million copies worldwide.{{sfn|Pfanner|2010}}\n\nThe Beast on the Road's US leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed that Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} to the point where a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.{{sfn|Young(1)}} In recent years, Dickinson stated that the band treated this as \"silliness\",{{sfn|Eagle Vision|2001}} and that the demonstrations in fact gave them \"loads of publicity\".{{sfn|EMI|2004}}\n\n[[File:Nicko McBrain 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nicko McBrain]] has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982]]\nIn December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] was fired from the band and replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], who previously played for [[Trust (French band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=233}} Although Harris stated that his dismissal took place because his live performances were affected by offstage activities,{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=232\u2013233}} Burr objected to this, and claimed that he was unfairly ousted from the band.{{sfn|Marlow|2011}} Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to The Bahamas to record the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=246}} In 1983, they released their fourth studio album, ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the No.&nbsp;3 spot in the UK,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=247}} and was the band's debut in the North American charts, reaching No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].{{sfn|Billboard}} ''Piece of Mind'' includes the successful singles, \"[[The Trooper]]\" and \"[[Flight of Icarus]]\", the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the US.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=245}}\n\nSoon after the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its [[World Piece Tour|supporting tour]], the band released their fifth studio album, ''[[Powerslave]]'', on 9 September 1984. The album features the singles \"[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]\", \"[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]\", as well as \"Rime of The Ancient Mariner\", based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem of the same name]], and running over 13 minutes in length.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}}\n\nThe tour, following the album, dubbed the [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date, and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=102}} Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts. Their first live album, ''[[Live After Death]]'', was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}} Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock in Rio]] festival to an estimated 300,000 in attendance.{{sfn|EMI|2008}} The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the group's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,{{sfn|Stenning|2006|p=104}} with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=255}}\n\n===Experimentation (1986\u20131989)===\n{{main|Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son}}\n\nReturning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', featuring, for the first time in the band's history, [[synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.{{sfn|Huey(3)}} The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single \"[[Wasted Years]]\", but notably included no writing credits from Dickinson, whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}} While Dickinson was focused on his own music, guitarist Adrian Smith, who typically collaborated with the vocalist, was \"left to [his] own devices\" and began writing songs on his own, coming up with \"Wasted Years\", \"Sea of Madness\", and \"[[Stranger in a Strange Land (Iron Maiden song)|Stranger in a Strange Land]]\",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=261}} the last of which would be the album's second single.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}}\n\nThe experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, entitled ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]], based on the 1987 novel ''[[Seventh Son (novel)|Seventh Son]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]],{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} would be the band's first record to include keyboards, performed by Harris and Smith,{{sfn|Popoff|2005(d)}} as opposed to [[Guitar synthesizer|guitar synthesisers]] on the previous release.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} After his contributions were not used for ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=263}} although it only achieved a Gold certification in the US, in contrast to its four predecessors.{{sfn|RIAA}}\n\nDuring the following [[Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history, with an estimated 107,000 in attendance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} Also included on the bill were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Megadeth]], [[Guns N' Roses]], and [[Helloween]].{{sfn|UK Rock Festivals}} The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], Birmingham recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=272}} Throughout the tour, Harris' bass technician, Michael Kenney, provided live keyboards.{{sfnm|1a1=Wall|1y=2004|1p=266|2a1=Johnson|2y=1988}} Kenney has acted as the band's live keyboard player ever since, also performing on the band's four following albums before Harris took over as the group's sole studio keyboardist from 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Gennet|2010}}\n\n===Upheaval (1989\u20131994)===\n{{main|No Prayer for the Dying|Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)}}\n\nDuring another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], entitled ''[[Silver and Gold (ASAP album)|Silver and Gold]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}} and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]], releasing ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'' in 1990,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=281}} followed by a tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} At the same time, to mark the band's ten-year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released a compilation collection, ''[[The First Ten Years (boxed set)|The First Ten Years]]'', a series of ten CDs and double [[12-inch single]]s. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.\n\nSoon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris, regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the \"stripped down\" style that they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith, and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} The album, ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', was released in October 1990,{{sfn|Prato}} and contained \"[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]\", the band's first (and to date, only) [[UK Singles Chart]] No.&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson's solo outfit for the soundtrack to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}} The song was banned by the BBC and only a 90-second live clip on Top of the Pops was shown.\n\nAfter another [[No Prayer on the Road|tour]] and some more time off, the band recorded their next studio album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]'', which was released in 1992 and included the stand-out [[Fear of the Dark (song)|title track]], which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No.&nbsp;1 in the UK albums chart,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} the disc also featured the No.&nbsp;2 single \"[[Be Quick or Be Dead]]\" and the No.&nbsp;21 single \"[[From Here to Eternity (Iron Maiden song)|From Here to Eternity]]\". The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The [[Fear of the Dark Tour|extensive worldwide tour that followed]] included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and headlining the [[Monsters of Rock]] festivals in seven European countries. Iron Maiden's second performance at [[Donington Park]], to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} was filmed for the audio and video release, ''[[Live at Donington (Iron Maiden album)|Live at Donington]]'', and featured a guest appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform \"Running Free\".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}}\n\nIn 1993, Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows, and that at several concerts, he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=296}} Dickinson denied that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to \"make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right\", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=297}} He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]], and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (video)|Raising Hell]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=298}}\n\n===Blaze Bayley era, ''The X Factor'' and ''Virtual XI'' (1994\u20131999)===\n{{main|The X Factor (album)|Virtual XI}}\n\nIn 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]], who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=301}} Harris' preferred choice from the outset,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=302}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(b)}}\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus (as well as a three-year hiatus from studio releases \u2013 a record for the band at the time), Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing their next studio album, ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'', the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No.&nbsp;8),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=313}} although it would go on to win ''Album of the Year'' awards in France and Germany.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}}  The record included the 11-minute epic \"Sign of the Cross\", the band's longest song since \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", as well as the singles, \"[[Man on the Edge]]\", based on the film ''[[Falling Down]]'',{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=44}} and \"[[Lord of the Flies (song)|Lord of the Flies]]\", based on the [[Lord of the Flies|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Popoff|2005(b)}} The release is notable for its \"dark\" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} [[The X Factour|The band toured]] for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in Israel and South Africa,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=314}} and ending in the [[Americas]]. After the tour, Iron Maiden released a compilation album, ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, \"[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]\", in which the lyrics attack the critics, who had recently written off the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=316}}\n\nIn 1998, Iron Maiden released ''[[Virtual XI]]'', whose chart scores were the band's lowest to date, failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in the band's history.{{sfn|Stagno|2006(a)}}{{sfn|Sverigetopplistan}} The album peaked at No.&nbsp;16 in the UK; the band's lowest for a new studio record.{{sfn|Official Charts Company|1998}}  At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).{{sfn|Saulnier|2010}}\n\nBayley's tenure in Iron Maiden ended in January 1999 when he was asked to leave during a band meeting.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=324}} The dismissal took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=321}} although Janick Gers stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs pitched outside the natural range of his voice.{{sfn|Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles|2010}}\n\n===Return of Dickinson and Smith, ''Brave New World'' (1999\u20132002)===\n{{main|Ed Hunter|Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)}}\n[[File:Iron Maiden en Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|Adrian Smith (left) re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, resulting in a three guitar line-up.]]\n\nWhile the group were considering a replacement for Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=328}} Although Harris admitted that he \"wasn't really into it\" at first, he then thought, \"'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?'

So you combine all that with the heavy riffs and the speed, and you've got it.\"{{sfn|Bienstock|2011}} In 2004, Harris explained that the band's \"heaviness\" was inspired by \"Black Sabbath and Deep Purple with a bit of Zeppelin thrown in.\"{{sfn|Blabbermouth.net|2004c}} On top of this, Harris developed his own playing style, which guitarist Janick Gers describes as \"more like a rhythm guitar,\"{{sfn|Popoff|2005(c)}} cited as responsible for the band's galloping style,{{sfn|Fender}} heard in such songs as \"[[The Trooper]]\"{{sfn|Huey(2)}} and \"Run to the Hills.\"{{sfn|Lawson}}\n\nThe band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith, and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style.

At times Randalls was known as \"Buchanan's Island\" and \"Great Barn Island\", both of which were likely corruptions of Great Barent Island.\n\nCaptain [[John Montresor]], an [[Military engineering|engineer]] with the [[British army]], purchased Randalls Island in 1772. He renamed it Montresor's Island and lived on it with his wife until the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] forced him to deploy. During the Revolutionary War, both islands hosted military posts for the British military. The British used his island to launch amphibious attacks on Manhattan, and Montresor's house there was burned in 1777. He resigned his commission and returned to England in 1778, but retained ownership of the island until the British evacuated the city in 1783 and it was confiscated.\n\nBoth islands gained their current names from new owners after the war.

The wooden drawbridge connected the island with Manhattan at 114th Street, and was paid for by Bartholomew Ward and Philip Milledolar. The bridge lasted until 1821, when it was destroyed in a storm. After the destruction of the bridge, Wards island was largely abandoned until 1840. Jonathan Randel's heirs sold Randalls to the city in 1835 for $60,000.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, both Randalls and Wards Islands, like nearby [[Roosevelt Island|Blackwell's Island]], became home to a variety of social facilities. Randalls housed an [[orphanage]], [[poor house]], [[burial ground]] for the poor, \"idiot\" asylum, [[homeopathic]] [[hospital]] and [[rest home]] for [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[veteran]]s, and was also site of the [[New York House of Refuge]], a [[reform school]] completed in 1854 for [[juvenile delinquent]]s or juveniles adjudicated as [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrants]].

Randalls Island Park is operated by the Randall's Island Park Alliance (RIPA), a public-private partnership founded in 1992 as the Island Sports Foundation.\n\nRandalls Island Park Alliance works with the City and local communities to provide sports venues, cultural events and environmental exploration. RIPA runs free youth programs at the Park, bringing thousands of children to the Park annually for a range of sports and environmental-education activities. Youth programs include public school field trips to the park\u2019s urban farm and saltmarsh, environmental and garden tours and workshops, and various outdoor arts and crafts programs. In addition, RIPA hosts Randalls Island Kids camp, a free six-week-long summer camp for children from community organizations in East Harlem and the South Bronx. Programming for the general public includes movies nights in the park, historical and environmental tours, outdoor yoga, and large festivals, including the Cherry Blossom and music festivals.<ref>https://randallsisland.org/things-to-see-do/</ref> \n\nRandalls Island Park contains over 8 miles of pedestrian and bike pathways, the majority of which run along the scenic waterfront perimeter of the island.<ref>https://randallsisland.org/visit/pathways/</ref> With connections to all three boroughs, the island acts as a non-vehicular route for traveling between Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. Connection to the [[South Bronx Greenway]] is planned, with additional waterfront pathway sections, a naturalized \"living shoreline,\" and further environmental restoration.<ref>[http://www.nycedc.com/press-release/nycedc-announces-launch-construction-randalls-island-connector-project NYCEDC Announces Launch of Construction of Randall's Island Connector Project], [[New York City Economic Development Corporation]], December 18, 2013.</ref> Greenway segments are part of the [[East Coast Greenway]], a 3,000 mile long trail system connecting Maine to Florida.\n\nA renovated golf center opened in 2008.

Then, a tennis center opened in Randalls Island Park in July 2009. It features 20 courts, 10 har-tru and 10 rubberized hard (5 indoor), along with a cafe, pro shop, fitness facilities and locker rooms. From May\u2013October, 10 courts are reserved for NYC Parks Tennis Permit holders during the daylight hours. In the winter, all 15 outdoor courts are bubbled for use by club members.\n\n[[File:Little Hell Gate jeh.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Looking west along Little Hell Gate Inlet towards the footbridge in 2008]]\n\nThe center is also the home to the [[John McEnroe Tennis Academy]] and was home to the [[New York Sportimes]] of [[World TeamTennis]] until the team relocated to [[San Diego]] in 2014. Finally, in May 2010, RIPA and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] completed the construction of over 60 athletic fields to support a greater variety of sports, including football, lacrosse, field hockey, and rugby among the sports already played at the Park, soccer, baseball and softball. Randalls Island Park has the most athletic fields of any single New York City park.\n\nThree natural environments, two saltmarsh and a freshwater wetland, have been established on the island. Through the process of excavating over {{convert|20000|cuyd|m3}} of debris, installing clean sand, and planting native marsh grasses, {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of [[saltmarsh]] has been created surrounding the Little Hell Gate Inlet on the western edge of the Island.

In addition, the restoration projects play a crucial role in an park-wide filtration system that collects storm water from the adjacent sports fields, pathways and paved areas and channels it through the Wetlands, where the new plants naturally filter pollutants before reaching the East River.<ref name=\"Great Ecology\"/>\n\nThe New York City Department of Parks and Recreation approved a $1 million contract with [[Natural Currents Energy Services]] to generate renewable energy in the park. The project was expected to produce {{nowrap|200 kW}} of solar, wind, and tidal energy to power the island's facilities. The project was planned to include a solar-powered marine research and information kiosk that would have been open to visitors of the island, and was hoped to have been completed in September 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Colvin|first=Jill|title=Solar, Wind and Tidal Energy to Power Randall's Island|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120326/upper-east-side/solar-wind-tidal-energy-power-randalls-island|accessdate=October 24, 2013|newspaper=DNAinfo|date=March 26, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220145/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120326/upper-east-side/solar-wind-tidal-energy-power-randalls-island|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|East_River_Fields.jpg|800px|East River Fields, 2008}}\n\n==Little Hell Gate==\n[[File:Lilhellgate.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Looking east from the footbridge at the mouth of the waterway toward the Triborough Bridge viaduct, 2008]]\n\nLittle Hell Gate was originally a natural waterway separating Randalls Island and Wards Island.

Randalls Island Park is operated by the Randall's Island Park Alliance (RIPA), a public-private partnership founded in 1992 as the Island Sports Foundation.\n\nRandalls Island Park Alliance works with the City and local communities to provide sports venues, cultural events and environmental exploration. RIPA runs free youth programs at the Park, bringing thousands of children to the Park annually for a range of sports and environmental-education activities. Youth programs include public school field trips to the park\u2019s urban farm and saltmarsh, environmental and garden tours and workshops, and various outdoor arts and crafts programs. In addition, RIPA hosts Randalls Island Kids camp, a free six-week-long summer camp for children from community organizations in East Harlem and the South Bronx. Programming for the general public includes movies nights in the park, historical and environmental tours, outdoor yoga, and large festivals, including the Cherry Blossom and music festivals.<ref>https://randallsisland.org/things-to-see-do/</ref> \n\nRandalls Island Park contains over 8 miles of pedestrian and bike pathways, the majority of which run along the scenic waterfront perimeter of the island.<ref>https://randallsisland.org/visit/pathways/</ref> With connections to all three boroughs, the island acts as a non-vehicular route for traveling between Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens. Connection to the [[South Bronx Greenway]] is planned, with additional waterfront pathway sections, a naturalized \"living shoreline,\" and further environmental restoration.<ref>[http://www.nycedc.com/press-release/nycedc-announces-launch-construction-randalls-island-connector-project NYCEDC Announces Launch of Construction of Randall's Island Connector Project], [[New York City Economic Development Corporation]], December 18, 2013.</ref> Greenway segments are part of the [[East Coast Greenway]], a 3,000 mile long trail system connecting Maine to Florida.\n\nA renovated golf center opened in 2008.

Then, a tennis center opened in Randalls Island Park in July 2009. It features 20 courts, 10 har-tru and 10 rubberized hard (5 indoor), along with a cafe, pro shop, fitness facilities and locker rooms. From May\u2013October, 10 courts are reserved for NYC Parks Tennis Permit holders during the daylight hours. In the winter, all 15 outdoor courts are bubbled for use by club members.\n\n[[File:Little Hell Gate jeh.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Looking west along Little Hell Gate Inlet towards the footbridge in 2008]]\n\nThe center is also the home to the [[John McEnroe Tennis Academy]] and was home to the [[New York Sportimes]] of [[World TeamTennis]] until the team relocated to [[San Diego]] in 2014. Finally, in May 2010, RIPA and the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] completed the construction of over 60 athletic fields to support a greater variety of sports, including football, lacrosse, field hockey, and rugby among the sports already played at the Park, soccer, baseball and softball. Randalls Island Park has the most athletic fields of any single New York City park.\n\nThree natural environments, two saltmarsh and a freshwater wetland, have been established on the island. Through the process of excavating over {{convert|20000|cuyd|m3}} of debris, installing clean sand, and planting native marsh grasses, {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of [[saltmarsh]] has been created surrounding the Little Hell Gate Inlet on the western edge of the Island.

In addition, the restoration projects play a crucial role in an park-wide filtration system that collects storm water from the adjacent sports fields, pathways and paved areas and channels it through the Wetlands, where the new plants naturally filter pollutants before reaching the East River.<ref name=\"Great Ecology\"/>\n\nThe New York City Department of Parks and Recreation approved a $1 million contract with [[Natural Currents Energy Services]] to generate renewable energy in the park. The project was expected to produce {{nowrap|200 kW}} of solar, wind, and tidal energy to power the island's facilities. The project was planned to include a solar-powered marine research and information kiosk that would have been open to visitors of the island, and was hoped to have been completed in September 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Colvin|first=Jill|title=Solar, Wind and Tidal Energy to Power Randall's Island|url=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120326/upper-east-side/solar-wind-tidal-energy-power-randalls-island|accessdate=October 24, 2013|newspaper=DNAinfo|date=March 26, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029220145/http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20120326/upper-east-side/solar-wind-tidal-energy-power-randalls-island|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Wide image|East_River_Fields.jpg|800px|East River Fields, 2008}}\n\n==Little Hell Gate==\n[[File:Lilhellgate.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Looking east from the footbridge at the mouth of the waterway toward the Triborough Bridge viaduct, 2008]]\n\nLittle Hell Gate was originally a natural waterway separating Randalls Island and Wards Island.

The lights came from the old stadium, which was being torn down.[24]Downing Stadium was demolished in 2002, and replaced by the Icahn Stadium, which opened in April, 2005.[25] It was designed by architect Ricardo Zurita, who was also involved with the master planning of the park development.[26] On May 31, 2008, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt broke the world record for the men's 100-meter dash at the Fourth Annual Reebok Grand Prix with a \"lightning\" speed time of 9.72 seconds.[27]\n* '''Sports Fields:''' Randalls Island Park has 60+ fields, making up approximately 40% of all athletic fields in Manhattan.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\nHatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt, commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Lower Egypt]]. Arguably, her buildings were grander and more numerous than those of any of her [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] predecessors'. Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs.\nShe employed the great architect [[Ineni]], who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward [[Senemut]]. During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum with Ancient Egyptian artifacts in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in [[New York City]]'s Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces.\n\nFollowing the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]]. She also restored the original [[Precinct of Mut]], the [[Mut|ancient great goddess of Egypt]], at Karnak that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the [[Hyksos]] occupation. It later was ravaged by other pharaohs, who took one part after another to use in their own pet projects. The precinct awaits restoration. She had twin [[obelisk]]s, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. [[Lateran Obelisk|One still stands]], as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth; the other has broken in two and toppled. The official in charge of those obelisks was the high steward [[Amenhotep (high steward)|Amenhotep]].<ref>JJ Shirley: ''The Power of the Elite: The Officials of Hatshepsut's Regency and Coregency'', in: J.

It was lined with carved stones that depicted significant events in Hatshepsut's life.\n\nLater, she ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her 16th year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction and a third was therefore constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in [[Aswan]], where it still remains. Known as [[Unfinished obelisk|the Unfinished Obelisk]], it provides evidence of how obelisks were quarried.<ref>Peter Tyson, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990316.html ''The Unfinished Obelisk''], NOVA online adventure, 16 March 1999.</ref>\n\n[[File:Il tempio di Hatshepsut.JPG|thumb|Colonnaded design of Hatshepsut temple]]\nThe Temple of [[Pakhet]] was built by Hatshepsut at [[Beni Hasan]] in the [[Minya Governorate#Ancient Egyptian period|Minya Governorate]] south of [[Minya, Egypt|Al Minya]]. The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that occurred by combining [[Bastet|Bast]] and [[Sekhmet]], who were similar [[lion]]ess war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the [[Nile]], was admired and called the [[Speos Artemidos]] by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]]. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess, Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the [[Hyksos]] that has been translated by James P. Allen.<ref>James P. Allen, [http://www.ancientneareast.net/texts/egyptian/speos_artemidos.html \"The Speos Artemidos Inscription of Hatshepsut\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403234933/http://www.ancientneareast.net/texts/egyptian/speos_artemidos.html |date=3 April 2007 }}, Bulletin of the Egyptological Seminar 16 (2002), pp. 1\u201317, pls.1+2.</ref> The Hyksos occupied Egypt and cast it into a cultural decline that persisted until a revival brought about by her policies and innovations. This temple was altered later and some of its inside decorations were usurped by [[Seti I]] of the [[nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], in an attempt to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.\n\nFollowing the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was a [[mortuary temple]]. She built hers in [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|a complex]] at [[Deir el-Bahri]]. It was designed and implemented by Senenmut at a site on the [[Thebes, Egypt|West Bank]] of the [[Nile River]] near the entrance to what now is called the [[Valley of the Kings]] because of all the pharaohs who later chose to associate their complexes with the grandeur of hers. Her buildings were the first grand ones planned for that location.\n\nThe focal point of the complex was the [[Djeser-Djeseru]] or \"the Sublime of Sublimes\", a [[colonnade]]d structure of perfect harmony built nearly one thousand years before the [[Parthenon]]. Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] that once were graced with lush [[garden]]s. Djeser-Djeseru is built into a [[cliff]] face that rises sharply above it.

As a [[regent]], Hatshepsut was preceded by [[Merneith]] of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], who was buried with the full honors of a pharaoh and may have ruled in her own right. [[Nimaathap]] of the [[Third Dynasty of Egypt|Third Dynasty]] may have been the [[dowager]] of [[Khasekhemwy]], but certainly acted as regent for her son, [[Djoser]], and may have reigned as pharaoh in her own right.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower000.htm |title=Women in Power: BC 4500-1000 |website=Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership |accessdate=25 August 2007 |last=Christensen |first=Martin, K.

Her name is found in the [[Histories of Herodotus]] and writings of [[Manetho]], but her historicity is uncertain. Queen [[Sobekneferu]] of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] is known to have assumed formal power as ruler of \"Upper and Lower Egypt\" three centuries earlier than Hatshepsut. [[Ahhotep I]], lauded as a warrior queen, may have been a regent between the reigns of two of her sons, [[Kamose]] and [[Ahmose I]], at the end of the Seventeenth Dynasty and the beginning of Hatshepsut's own Eighteenth Dynasty. [[Amenhotep I]], also preceding Hatshepsut in the Eighteenth Dynasty, probably came to power while a young child and his mother, [[Ahmose-Nefertari]], is thought to have been a regent for him.<ref name=\"Shaw 28\">Shaw and Nicholson, p. 28.</ref> Other women whose possible reigns as pharaohs are under study include [[Akhenaten]]'s possible [[Smenkhkare|female co-regent/successor]] (usually identified as either Nefertiti or Meritaten) and [[Twosret]]. Among the later, non-indigenous Egyptian dynasties, the most notable example of another woman who became pharaoh was [[Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator|Cleopatra VII]], the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Perhaps in an effort to ease anxiety over the prospect of a female [[pharaoh]], Hatshepsut claimed a divine right to rule based on the authority of the god [[Amun]].<ref>John Ray, ''Reflections of Osiris: Lives from Ancient Egypt'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 47.</ref>\n\nIn comparison with other female pharaohs, Hatshepsut's reign was much longer and more prosperous. She was successful in warfare early in her reign, but generally is considered to be a pharaoh who inaugurated a long peaceful era. She re-established international [[trade|trading relationships]] lost during foreign occupation by the Hyksos and brought great wealth to Egypt. That wealth enabled Hatshepsut to initiate building projects that raised the calibre of Ancient Egyptian architecture to a standard, comparable to classical architecture, that would not be rivaled by any other culture for a thousand years. She managed to rule for about 20 years. One of the most famous things that she did was build Hatshepsut's temple (see above).\n\n===Official lauding===\n{{See also|Depiction of Hatshepsut's birth and coronation}}\n[[Hyperbole]] is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut has been called the most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments.<ref name=\"pbslink\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/hatshepsut.html|title=Hatshepsut|website=pbs.org}}</ref> This may have resulted from the extensive building executed during her time as pharaoh, in comparison with many others. It afforded her many opportunities to laud herself, but it also reflected the wealth that her policies and administration brought to Egypt, enabling her to finance such projects. Aggrandizement of their achievements was traditional when pharaohs built temples and their tombs.\n\n[[File:Hatshepsut-CollosalGraniteSphinx02 MetropolitanMuseum.png|right|thumb|Large [[granite]] [[sphinx]] bearing the likeness of the pharaoh Hatshepsut, depicted with the traditional false beard, a symbol of her pharaonic power\u2014''Metropolitan Museum of Art'']]\n\nWomen had a relatively high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own, inherit, or will property. A woman becoming pharaoh was rare, however; only [[Sobekneferu]], [[Khentkaus I]] and possibly [[Nitocris]] preceded her.<ref>Nevine El-Aref, [http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/40/352/Search.aspx?Text=%20Wet%20Nurse%20Sittre \"Back in the limelight\"], ''Al-Ahram Weekly''.</ref> The existence of this last ruler is disputed and is probably a mis-translation of a male king. [[Neferneferuaten|Nefernferuaten]] and [[Twosret]] may have been the only women to succeed her among the indigenous rulers. In Egyptian history, there was no word for a \"queen regnant\" as in contemporary history, \"king\" being the ancient Egyptian title regardless of gender, and by the time of her reign, ''pharaoh'' had become the name for the ruler. Hatshepsut is not unique, however, in taking the title of king. Sobekneferu, ruling six dynasties prior to Hatshepsut, also did so when she ruled Egypt. Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh. During her father's reign she held the powerful office of ''[[God's Wife]]''. She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh. There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and, until her death, her co-regent remained in a secondary role, quite amicably heading her powerful army\u2014which would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place, if that had been the case.\n\nHatshepsut assumed all of the [[regalia]] and symbols of the pharaonic office in official representations: the [[Khat (apparel)|Khat]] head cloth, topped with the [[uraeus]], the traditional [[Beard#Ancient and classical world|false beard]], and [[shendyt]] kilt.<ref name=\"pbslink\"/> Many existing statues alternatively show her in typically feminine attire as well as those that depict her in the royal ceremonial attire. Statues portraying Sobekneferu also combine elements of traditional male and female [[iconography]] and, by tradition, may have served as inspiration for these works commissioned by Hatshepsut.<ref>Callender/Shaw, p. 170.</ref> After this period of transition ended, however, most formal depictions of Hatshepsut as pharaoh showed her in the royal attire, with all of the pharaonic regalia.\n\nAt her mortuary temple, in Osirian statues that regaled the transportation of the pharaoh to the world of the dead, the symbols of the pharaoh as the deity [[Osiris]] were the reason for the attire and they were much more important to be displayed traditionally; her breasts are obscured behind her crossed arms holding the royal [[Staff of office|staffs]] of the two kingdoms she ruled. This became a pointed concern among writers who sought reasons for the generic style of the shrouded statues and led to misinterpretations. Understanding of the religious symbolism was required to interpret the statues correctly. Interpretations by these early scholars varied and often, were baseless conjectures of their own contemporary values. The possible reasons for her breasts not being emphasized in the most formal statues were debated among some early Egyptologists, who failed to understand the ritual religious symbolism, to take into account the fact that many women and goddesses portrayed in ancient Egyptian art often lack delineation of breasts, and that the physical aspect of the gender of pharaohs was never stressed in the art. With few exceptions, subjects were idealized.\n\n[[File:S F-E-CAMERON 2006-10-EGYPT-WESTBANK-0153.JPG|thumb|left|[[Osiris|Osirian statues]] of Hatshepsut at her tomb, one stood at each pillar of the extensive structure, note the mummification shroud enclosing the lower body and legs as well as the [[crook and flail]] associated with Osiris\u2014''Deir el-Bahri'']]\nModern scholars, however, have theorized that by assuming the typical symbols of pharaonic power, Hatshepsut was asserting her claim to be the sovereign rather than a \"King's Great Wife\" or queen consort. The gender of pharaohs was never stressed in official depictions; even the men were depicted with the highly stylized false beard associated with their position in the society.\n\nMoreover, the Osirian statues of Hatshepsut \u2014 as with other pharaohs \u2014 depict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity. All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition. The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris. Since many statues of Hatshepsut depicted in this fashion have been put on display in museums and those images have been widely published, viewers who lack an understanding of the religious significance of these depictions have been misled. Aside from the face depicting Hatshepsut, these statues closely resemble those of other kings as Osiris, following religious traditions.\n\nMost of the official statues commissioned of Hatshepsut show her less symbolically and more naturally, as a woman in typical dresses of the nobility of her day. Notably, even after assuming the formal regalia, Hatshepsut still described herself as a beautiful woman, often as the most beautiful of women, and although she assumed almost all of her father's titles, she declined to take the title \"The Strong Bull\" (the full title being, ''The Strong Bull of his Mother''), which tied the pharaoh to the goddesses [[Isis]], the throne, and [[Hathor]], (the cow who gave birth to and protected the pharaohs) \u2014 by being her son sitting on '''her''' throne \u2014 an unnecessary title for her, since Hatshepsut became allied with the goddesses, herself, which no male pharaoh could. Rather than the strong bull, Hatshepsut, having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh, associated herself with the lioness image of [[Sekhmet]], the major [[list of war deities|war deity]] in the [[Egyptian pantheon]].\n\nReligious concepts were tied into all of these symbols and titles. By the time of Hatshepsut's reign, the merger of some aspects of these two goddesses provided that they would both have given birth to, and were the protectors of, the pharaohs. They became interchangeable at times. Hatshepsut also traced her lineage to [[Mut]], a primal mother goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, which gave her another ancestor who was a deity as well as her father and grandfathers, pharaohs who would have become deified upon death.\n\nWhile Hatshepsut was depicted in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, such as the false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, just as it is unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the [[nemes]] crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eternalegypt.org/EternalEgyptWebsiteWeb/HomeServlet?ee_website_action_key=action.display.topic.details&language_id=1&trait_item_id=10000224|title=Eternal Egypt|website=eternalegypt.org|access-date=8 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810011709/http://www.eternalegypt.org/EternalEgyptWebsiteWeb/HomeServlet?ee_website_action_key=action.display.topic.details&language_id=1&trait_item_id=10000224|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs a notable exception, only one male pharaoh abandoned the rigid symbolic depiction that had become the style of the most official artwork representing the ruler, Pharaoh [[Amenhotep IV]] (later Akhenaten) of the same eighteenth dynasty, whose wife, [[Nefertiti]], also may have ruled in her own right following the death of her husband.\n\n[[File:S F-E-CAMERON Hatshepsut Hawk.JPG|thumb|The Hawk of the Pharaoh, Hatshepsut\u2014''Temple at Luxor'']]\nOne of the most famous examples of the legends about Hatshepsut is a myth about her birth. In this myth, [[Amun]] goes to [[Queen Ahmose|Ahmose]] in the form of Thutmose I and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ''[[ankh]]'', a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. [[Khnum]], the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body and [[Ka (Egyptian soul)|''ka'']], or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. [[Heket]], the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along to a [[lion]]ess' bed where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary temple.\n\nThe [[oracle|Oracle of Amun]] proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments\n\n{{quote|Welcome my sweet daughter, my favorite, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Hatshepsut. Thou art the Pharaoh, taking possession of the Two Lands.<ref>Breasted, James Henry, ''Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest'', The University of Chicago Press, 1906, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>}}\n\nHatshepsut claimed that she was her father's intended heir and that he made her the heir apparent of Egypt. Almost all scholars today view this as historical [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]] or [[Flashforward|prolepsis]] on Hatshepsut's part, since it was [[Thutmose II]] \u2014 a son of Thutmose I by [[Mutnofret]] \u2014 who was her father's heir. Moreover, Thutmose I could not have foreseen that his daughter Hatshepsut would outlive his son within his own lifetime. Thutmose II soon married Hatshepsut and the latter became both his senior royal wife and the most powerful woman at court. Biographer [[Evelyn Wells]], however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim that she was her father's intended successor. Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father's designated successor with inscriptions on the walls of her mortuary temple:\n\n{{quote|Then his majesty said to them: \"This daughter of mine, Khnumetamun Hatshepsut\u2014may she live!\u2014I have appointed as my successor upon my throne... she shall direct the people in every sphere of the palace; it is she indeed who shall lead you.

For this, [[KV20]], originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]], was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished the burial of her father and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. It is likely, therefore, that when she died (no later than the twenty-second year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father.<ref>Dennis C. Forbes, ''Maatkare Hatshepset: The Female Pharaoh'', KMT, Fall 2005, pp. 26\u201342.</ref> During the reign of Thutmose III, however, a new tomb, ([[KV38]]), together with new burial equipment was provided for Thutmose I, who then was removed from his original tomb and re-interred elsewhere. At the same time Hatshepsut's mummy might have been moved into the tomb of her nurse, [[Sitre In]], in [[KV60]]. It is possible that [[Amenhotep II]], son to Thutmose III by a secondary wife, was the one motivating these actions in an attempt to assure his own uncertain right to succession. Besides what was recovered from KV20 during [[Howard Carter]]'s clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness \"throne\" (bedstead is a better description), a [[senet]] game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial [[shabti]] figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at [[DB320]], a wooden canopic box with an ivory knob was found that was inscribed with the name of Hatshepsut and contained a mummified liver or spleen as well as a molar tooth. There was a royal lady of the twenty-first dynasty of the same name, however, and for a while it was thought possible that it could have belonged to her instead.<ref>Bickerstaffe, Dylan, \"The Discovery of Hatshepsut's 'Throne'\", KMT, Spring 2002, pp. 71\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Howard Carter had discovered a tomb ([[KV60]]) in the Valley of the Kings that contained two female mummies, one identified as Hatshepsut's wetnurse, and the other unidentified. In the spring of 2007, the unidentified body was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. [[Zahi Hawass]] and brought to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 \"canopic box\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/photogalleries/queen-mummy/|title=Photo Gallery: Mummy of Egypt's ''Lost Queen'' Found|website=nationalgeographic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/27/egypt.science|title=Tooth solves Hatshepsut mummy mystery|author=Ed Pilkington and Mark Tran|date=27 June 2007|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Her death has since been attributed to a [[carcinogen]]ic skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]].

This elimination was carried out in the most literal way possible. Her cartouches and images were chiseled off some stone walls, leaving very obvious Hatshepsut-shaped gaps in the artwork.\n\nAt the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's numerous statues were torn down and in many cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, there even was an attempt to wall up her obelisks. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps saving money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III and instead, using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.\n\n[[Amenhotep II]], the son of Thutmose III, who became a co-regent toward the end of his father's reign, is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh. He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. He is documented, further, as having usurped many of Hatshepsut's accomplishments during his own reign. His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well, not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women, such as God's Wife of Amun.<ref>Gardiner, Alan, ''Egypt of the Pharaohs'', Oxford University Press, 1964, p. 198.</ref>\n\nFor many years, presuming that it was Thutmose III acting out of resentment once he became pharaoh, early modern Egyptologists presumed that the erasures were similar to the Roman ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. This appeared to make sense when thinking that Thutmose might have been an unwilling co-regent for years. This assessment of the situation probably is too simplistic, however. It is highly unlikely that the determined and focused Thutmose\u2014not only Egypt's most successful general, but an acclaimed athlete, author, historian, botanist, and architect\u2014would have brooded for two decades of his own reign before attempting to avenge himself on his stepmother and aunt. According to renowned Egyptologist [[Donald Redford]]:\n\n{{quote|Here and there, in the dark recesses of a shrine or tomb where no plebeian eye could see, the queen's cartouche and figure were left intact ... which never vulgar eye would again behold, still conveyed for the king the warmth and awe of a divine presence.<ref>Redford, p. 87.</ref>}}\n\nThe erasures were sporadic and haphazard, with only the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished and it may be that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign, and her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.\n\n===Tyldesley hypothesis===\n[[Joyce Tyldesley]] hypothesized that it is possible that Thutmose III, lacking any sinister motivation, may have decided toward the end of his life to relegate Hatshepsut to her expected place as the regent\u2014which was the traditional role of powerful women in Egypt's court as the example of Queen [[Ahhotep II|Ahhotep]] attests\u2014rather than pharaoh. Tyldesley fashions her concept as, that by eliminating the more obvious traces of Hatshepsut's monuments as pharaoh and reducing her status to that of his co-regent, Thutmose III could claim that the royal succession ran directly from Thutmose II to Thutmose III without any interference from his aunt.\n\nThe deliberate erasures or mutilations of the numerous public celebrations of her accomplishments, but not the rarely seen ones, would be all that was necessary to obscure Hatshepsut's accomplishments. Moreover, by the latter half of Thutmose III's reign, the more prominent high officials who had served Hatshepsut would have died, thereby eliminating the powerful religious and bureaucratic resistance to a change in direction in a highly stratified culture. Hatshepsut's highest official and closest supporter, Senenmut, seems either to have retired abruptly or died around Years 16 and 20 of Hatshepsut's reign, and was never interred in either of his carefully prepared tombs.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 206.</ref> According to Tyldesley, the enigma of Senenmut's sudden disappearance \"teased Egyptologists for decades\" given \"the lack of solid archaeological or textual evidence\" and permitted \"the vivid imagination of Senenmut-scholars to run wild\" resulting in a variety of strongly held solutions \"some of which would do credit to any fictional murder/mystery plot.\"<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 207, Tyldesley notes on p. 252 that a detailed discussion of Senenmut's disappearance and a useful list of other publications on this topic is given in A. R.

Hatshepsut's crime need not be anything more than the fact that she was a woman.\"<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 225.</ref> Tyldesley conjectured<!-- a pure guess --> that Thutmose III may have considered the possibility that the example of a successful female king in Egyptian history could demonstrate that a woman was as capable at governing Egypt as a traditional male king, which could persuade \"future generations of potentially strong female kings\" to not \"remain content with their traditional lot as wife, sister and eventual mother of a king\" and assume the crown.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', pp. 225\u2013226.</ref> Dismissing relatively recent history known to Thutmose III of another woman who was king, [[Sobekneferu]] of Egypt's Middle Kingdom, she conjectured further that he might have thought that while she had enjoyed a short, approximately four-year reign, she ruled \"at the very end of a fading [12th dynasty] Dynasty, and from the very start of her reign the odds had been stacked against her. She was, therefore, acceptable to conservative Egyptians as a patriotic 'Warrior Queen' who had failed\" to rejuvenate Egypt's fortunes.<ref name=\"Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 226\">Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 226.</ref> In contrast, Hatshepsut's glorious reign was a completely different case: she demonstrated that women were as capable as men of ruling the two lands since she successfully presided over a prosperous Egypt for more than two decades.<ref name=\"Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 226\"/> If Thutmose III's intent was to forestall the possibility of a woman assuming the throne, as proposed by Tyldesley, it was a failure since Twosret and Neferneferuaten (possibly), a female co-regent or successor of Akhenaten, assumed the throne for short reigns as pharaoh later in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]].\n\n===\"Hatshepsut Problem\"===\nThe erasure of Hatshepsut's name\u2014whatever the reason or the person ordering it\u2014almost caused her to disappear from Egypt's archaeological and written records. When nineteenth-century Egyptologists started to interpret the texts on the Deir el-Bahri temple walls (which were illustrated with two seemingly male kings) their translations made no sense.

Arguably, her buildings were grander and more numerous than those of any of her [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] predecessors'. Later pharaohs attempted to claim some of her projects as theirs.\nShe employed the great architect [[Ineni]], who also had worked for her father, her husband, and for the royal steward [[Senemut]]. During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum with Ancient Egyptian artifacts in the world has Hatshepsut statuary among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in [[New York City]]'s Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces.\n\nFollowing the tradition of most pharaohs, Hatshepsut had monuments constructed at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]]. She also restored the original [[Precinct of Mut]], the [[Mut|ancient great goddess of Egypt]], at Karnak that had been ravaged by the foreign rulers during the [[Hyksos]] occupation. It later was ravaged by other pharaohs, who took one part after another to use in their own pet projects. The precinct awaits restoration. She had twin [[obelisk]]s, at the time the tallest in the world, erected at the entrance to the temple. [[Lateran Obelisk|One still stands]], as the tallest surviving ancient obelisk on Earth; the other has broken in two and toppled. The official in charge of those obelisks was the high steward [[Amenhotep (high steward)|Amenhotep]].<ref>JJ Shirley: ''The Power of the Elite: The Officials of Hatshepsut's Regency and Coregency'', in: J.

It was lined with carved stones that depicted significant events in Hatshepsut's life.\n\nLater, she ordered the construction of two more obelisks to celebrate her 16th year as pharaoh; one of the obelisks broke during construction and a third was therefore constructed to replace it. The broken obelisk was left at its quarrying site in [[Aswan]], where it still remains.

The name, Pakhet, was a synthesis that occurred by combining [[Bastet|Bast]] and [[Sekhmet]], who were similar [[lion]]ess war goddesses, in an area that bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on the eastern side of the [[Nile]], was admired and called the [[Speos Artemidos]] by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]]. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess, Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient ones that have not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the [[Hyksos]] that has been translated by James P. Allen.<ref>James P. Allen, [http://www.ancientneareast.net/texts/egyptian/speos_artemidos.html \"The Speos Artemidos Inscription of Hatshepsut\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403234933/http://www.ancientneareast.net/texts/egyptian/speos_artemidos.html |date=3 April 2007 }}, Bulletin of the Egyptological Seminar 16 (2002), pp. 1\u201317, pls.1+2.</ref> The Hyksos occupied Egypt and cast it into a cultural decline that persisted until a revival brought about by her policies and innovations. This temple was altered later and some of its inside decorations were usurped by [[Seti I]] of the [[nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]], in an attempt to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.\n\nFollowing the tradition of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was a [[mortuary temple]]. She built hers in [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|a complex]] at [[Deir el-Bahri]]. It was designed and implemented by Senenmut at a site on the [[Thebes, Egypt|West Bank]] of the [[Nile River]] near the entrance to what now is called the [[Valley of the Kings]] because of all the pharaohs who later chose to associate their complexes with the grandeur of hers. Her buildings were the first grand ones planned for that location.\n\nThe focal point of the complex was the [[Djeser-Djeseru]] or \"the Sublime of Sublimes\", a [[colonnade]]d structure of perfect harmony built nearly one thousand years before the [[Parthenon]]. Djeser-Djeseru sits atop a series of [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] that once were graced with lush [[garden]]s. Djeser-Djeseru is built into a [[cliff]] face that rises sharply above it. Djeser-Djeseru and the other buildings of Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri complex are considered to be significant advances in architecture. Another one of her great accomplishments is the Hatshepsut needle<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gray|first1=Martin|title=Obelisk of Queen Hapshetsut, Karnak|url=https://sacredsites.com/africa/egypt/obelisk_of_queen_hapshetsut_karnak.html|website=Places of Peace and Power|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref> (also known as the [[granite]] obelisks).\n\n==Comparison with other female rulers==\n[[File:Head of Hatshepsut wearing the royal headdress. 18th Dynasty, c. 1460 BC.

Her name is found in the [[Histories of Herodotus]] and writings of [[Manetho]], but her historicity is uncertain. Queen [[Sobekneferu]] of the [[Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]] is known to have assumed formal power as ruler of \"Upper and Lower Egypt\" three centuries earlier than Hatshepsut. [[Ahhotep I]], lauded as a warrior queen, may have been a regent between the reigns of two of her sons, [[Kamose]] and [[Ahmose I]], at the end of the Seventeenth Dynasty and the beginning of Hatshepsut's own Eighteenth Dynasty. [[Amenhotep I]], also preceding Hatshepsut in the Eighteenth Dynasty, probably came to power while a young child and his mother, [[Ahmose-Nefertari]], is thought to have been a regent for him.<ref name=\"Shaw 28\">Shaw and Nicholson, p. 28.</ref> Other women whose possible reigns as pharaohs are under study include [[Akhenaten]]'s possible [[Smenkhkare|female co-regent/successor]] (usually identified as either Nefertiti or Meritaten) and [[Twosret]]. Among the later, non-indigenous Egyptian dynasties, the most notable example of another woman who became pharaoh was [[Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator|Cleopatra VII]], the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Perhaps in an effort to ease anxiety over the prospect of a female [[pharaoh]], Hatshepsut claimed a divine right to rule based on the authority of the god [[Amun]].<ref>John Ray, ''Reflections of Osiris: Lives from Ancient Egypt'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 47.</ref>\n\nIn comparison with other female pharaohs, Hatshepsut's reign was much longer and more prosperous. She was successful in warfare early in her reign, but generally is considered to be a pharaoh who inaugurated a long peaceful era. She re-established international [[trade|trading relationships]] lost during foreign occupation by the Hyksos and brought great wealth to Egypt. That wealth enabled Hatshepsut to initiate building projects that raised the calibre of Ancient Egyptian architecture to a standard, comparable to classical architecture, that would not be rivaled by any other culture for a thousand years. She managed to rule for about 20 years. One of the most famous things that she did was build Hatshepsut's temple (see above).\n\n===Official lauding===\n{{See also|Depiction of Hatshepsut's birth and coronation}}\n[[Hyperbole]] is common to virtually all royal inscriptions of Egyptian history. While all ancient leaders used it to laud their achievements, Hatshepsut has been called the most accomplished pharaoh at promoting her accomplishments.<ref name=\"pbslink\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/hatshepsut.html|title=Hatshepsut|website=pbs.org}}</ref> This may have resulted from the extensive building executed during her time as pharaoh, in comparison with many others. It afforded her many opportunities to laud herself, but it also reflected the wealth that her policies and administration brought to Egypt, enabling her to finance such projects. Aggrandizement of their achievements was traditional when pharaohs built temples and their tombs.\n\n[[File:Hatshepsut-CollosalGraniteSphinx02 MetropolitanMuseum.png|right|thumb|Large [[granite]] [[sphinx]] bearing the likeness of the pharaoh Hatshepsut, depicted with the traditional false beard, a symbol of her pharaonic power\u2014''Metropolitan Museum of Art'']]\n\nWomen had a relatively high status in ancient Egypt and enjoyed the legal right to own, inherit, or will property. A woman becoming pharaoh was rare, however; only [[Sobekneferu]], [[Khentkaus I]] and possibly [[Nitocris]] preceded her.<ref>Nevine El-Aref, [http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/40/352/Search.aspx?Text=%20Wet%20Nurse%20Sittre \"Back in the limelight\"], ''Al-Ahram Weekly''.</ref> The existence of this last ruler is disputed and is probably a mis-translation of a male king. [[Neferneferuaten|Nefernferuaten]] and [[Twosret]] may have been the only women to succeed her among the indigenous rulers. In Egyptian history, there was no word for a \"queen regnant\" as in contemporary history, \"king\" being the ancient Egyptian title regardless of gender, and by the time of her reign, ''pharaoh'' had become the name for the ruler. Hatshepsut is not unique, however, in taking the title of king. Sobekneferu, ruling six dynasties prior to Hatshepsut, also did so when she ruled Egypt. Hatshepsut had been well trained in her duties as the daughter of the pharaoh. During her father's reign she held the powerful office of ''[[God's Wife]]''. She had taken a strong role as queen to her husband and was well experienced in the administration of her kingdom by the time she became pharaoh. There is no indication of challenges to her leadership and, until her death, her co-regent remained in a secondary role, quite amicably heading her powerful army\u2014which would have given him the power necessary to overthrow a usurper of his rightful place, if that had been the case.\n\nHatshepsut assumed all of the [[regalia]] and symbols of the pharaonic office in official representations: the [[Khat (apparel)|Khat]] head cloth, topped with the [[uraeus]], the traditional [[Beard#Ancient and classical world|false beard]], and [[shendyt]] kilt.<ref name=\"pbslink\"/> Many existing statues alternatively show her in typically feminine attire as well as those that depict her in the royal ceremonial attire. Statues portraying Sobekneferu also combine elements of traditional male and female [[iconography]] and, by tradition, may have served as inspiration for these works commissioned by Hatshepsut.<ref>Callender/Shaw, p. 170.</ref> After this period of transition ended, however, most formal depictions of Hatshepsut as pharaoh showed her in the royal attire, with all of the pharaonic regalia.\n\nAt her mortuary temple, in Osirian statues that regaled the transportation of the pharaoh to the world of the dead, the symbols of the pharaoh as the deity [[Osiris]] were the reason for the attire and they were much more important to be displayed traditionally; her breasts are obscured behind her crossed arms holding the royal [[Staff of office|staffs]] of the two kingdoms she ruled. This became a pointed concern among writers who sought reasons for the generic style of the shrouded statues and led to misinterpretations. Understanding of the religious symbolism was required to interpret the statues correctly. Interpretations by these early scholars varied and often, were baseless conjectures of their own contemporary values. The possible reasons for her breasts not being emphasized in the most formal statues were debated among some early Egyptologists, who failed to understand the ritual religious symbolism, to take into account the fact that many women and goddesses portrayed in ancient Egyptian art often lack delineation of breasts, and that the physical aspect of the gender of pharaohs was never stressed in the art. With few exceptions, subjects were idealized.\n\n[[File:S F-E-CAMERON 2006-10-EGYPT-WESTBANK-0153.JPG|thumb|left|[[Osiris|Osirian statues]] of Hatshepsut at her tomb, one stood at each pillar of the extensive structure, note the mummification shroud enclosing the lower body and legs as well as the [[crook and flail]] associated with Osiris\u2014''Deir el-Bahri'']]\nModern scholars, however, have theorized that by assuming the typical symbols of pharaonic power, Hatshepsut was asserting her claim to be the sovereign rather than a \"King's Great Wife\" or queen consort. The gender of pharaohs was never stressed in official depictions; even the men were depicted with the highly stylized false beard associated with their position in the society.\n\nMoreover, the Osirian statues of Hatshepsut \u2014 as with other pharaohs \u2014 depict the dead pharaoh as Osiris, with the body and regalia of that deity. All of the statues of Hatshepsut at her tomb follow that tradition. The promise of resurrection after death was a tenet of the cult of Osiris. Since many statues of Hatshepsut depicted in this fashion have been put on display in museums and those images have been widely published, viewers who lack an understanding of the religious significance of these depictions have been misled. Aside from the face depicting Hatshepsut, these statues closely resemble those of other kings as Osiris, following religious traditions.\n\nMost of the official statues commissioned of Hatshepsut show her less symbolically and more naturally, as a woman in typical dresses of the nobility of her day. Notably, even after assuming the formal regalia, Hatshepsut still described herself as a beautiful woman, often as the most beautiful of women, and although she assumed almost all of her father's titles, she declined to take the title \"The Strong Bull\" (the full title being, ''The Strong Bull of his Mother''), which tied the pharaoh to the goddesses [[Isis]], the throne, and [[Hathor]], (the cow who gave birth to and protected the pharaohs) \u2014 by being her son sitting on '''her''' throne \u2014 an unnecessary title for her, since Hatshepsut became allied with the goddesses, herself, which no male pharaoh could. Rather than the strong bull, Hatshepsut, having served as a very successful warrior during the early portion of her reign as pharaoh, associated herself with the lioness image of [[Sekhmet]], the major [[list of war deities|war deity]] in the [[Egyptian pantheon]].\n\nReligious concepts were tied into all of these symbols and titles. By the time of Hatshepsut's reign, the merger of some aspects of these two goddesses provided that they would both have given birth to, and were the protectors of, the pharaohs. They became interchangeable at times. Hatshepsut also traced her lineage to [[Mut]], a primal mother goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, which gave her another ancestor who was a deity as well as her father and grandfathers, pharaohs who would have become deified upon death.\n\nWhile Hatshepsut was depicted in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, such as the false beard that male pharaohs also wore, it is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, just as it is unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the [[nemes]] crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eternalegypt.org/EternalEgyptWebsiteWeb/HomeServlet?ee_website_action_key=action.display.topic.details&language_id=1&trait_item_id=10000224|title=Eternal Egypt|website=eternalegypt.org|access-date=8 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810011709/http://www.eternalegypt.org/EternalEgyptWebsiteWeb/HomeServlet?ee_website_action_key=action.display.topic.details&language_id=1&trait_item_id=10000224|archive-date=10 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs a notable exception, only one male pharaoh abandoned the rigid symbolic depiction that had become the style of the most official artwork representing the ruler, Pharaoh [[Amenhotep IV]] (later Akhenaten) of the same eighteenth dynasty, whose wife, [[Nefertiti]], also may have ruled in her own right following the death of her husband.\n\n[[File:S F-E-CAMERON Hatshepsut Hawk.JPG|thumb|The Hawk of the Pharaoh, Hatshepsut\u2014''Temple at Luxor'']]\nOne of the most famous examples of the legends about Hatshepsut is a myth about her birth. In this myth, [[Amun]] goes to [[Queen Ahmose|Ahmose]] in the form of Thutmose I and awakens her with pleasant odors. At this point Amun places the ''[[ankh]]'', a symbol of life, to Ahmose's nose, and Hatshepsut is conceived by Ahmose. [[Khnum]], the god who forms the bodies of human children, is then instructed to create a body and [[Ka (Egyptian soul)|''ka'']], or corporal presence/life force, for Hatshepsut. [[Heket]], the goddess of life and fertility, and Khnum then lead Ahmose along to a [[lion]]ess' bed where she gives birth to Hatshepsut. Reliefs depicting each step in these events are at Karnak and in her mortuary temple.\n\nThe [[oracle|Oracle of Amun]] proclaimed that it was the will of Amun that Hatshepsut be pharaoh, further strengthening her position. She reiterated Amun's support by having these proclamations by the god Amun carved on her monuments\n\n{{quote|Welcome my sweet daughter, my favorite, the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare, Hatshepsut. Thou art the Pharaoh, taking possession of the Two Lands.<ref>Breasted, James Henry, ''Ancient Records of Egypt: Historical Documents from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest'', The University of Chicago Press, 1906, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>}}\n\nHatshepsut claimed that she was her father's intended heir and that he made her the heir apparent of Egypt. Almost all scholars today view this as historical [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]] or [[Flashforward|prolepsis]] on Hatshepsut's part, since it was [[Thutmose II]] \u2014 a son of Thutmose I by [[Mutnofret]] \u2014 who was her father's heir. Moreover, Thutmose I could not have foreseen that his daughter Hatshepsut would outlive his son within his own lifetime. Thutmose II soon married Hatshepsut and the latter became both his senior royal wife and the most powerful woman at court. Biographer [[Evelyn Wells]], however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim that she was her father's intended successor. Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she was her father's designated successor with inscriptions on the walls of her mortuary temple:\n\n{{quote|Then his majesty said to them: \"This daughter of mine, Khnumetamun Hatshepsut\u2014may she live!\u2014I have appointed as my successor upon my throne... she shall direct the people in every sphere of the palace; it is she indeed who shall lead you.

For this, [[KV20]], originally quarried for her father, Thutmose I, and probably the first royal tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]], was extended with a new burial chamber. Hatshepsut also refurbished the burial of her father and prepared for a double interment of both Thutmose I and her within KV20. It is likely, therefore, that when she died (no later than the twenty-second year of her reign), she was interred in this tomb along with her father.<ref>Dennis C. Forbes, ''Maatkare Hatshepset: The Female Pharaoh'', KMT, Fall 2005, pp. 26\u201342.</ref> During the reign of Thutmose III, however, a new tomb, ([[KV38]]), together with new burial equipment was provided for Thutmose I, who then was removed from his original tomb and re-interred elsewhere. At the same time Hatshepsut's mummy might have been moved into the tomb of her nurse, [[Sitre In]], in [[KV60]]. It is possible that [[Amenhotep II]], son to Thutmose III by a secondary wife, was the one motivating these actions in an attempt to assure his own uncertain right to succession. Besides what was recovered from KV20 during [[Howard Carter]]'s clearance of the tomb in 1903, other funerary furniture belonging to Hatshepsut has been found elsewhere, including a lioness \"throne\" (bedstead is a better description), a [[senet]] game board with carved lioness-headed, red-jasper game pieces bearing her pharaonic title, a signet ring, and a partial [[shabti]] figurine bearing her name. In the Royal Mummy Cache at [[DB320]], a wooden canopic box with an ivory knob was found that was inscribed with the name of Hatshepsut and contained a mummified liver or spleen as well as a molar tooth. There was a royal lady of the twenty-first dynasty of the same name, however, and for a while it was thought possible that it could have belonged to her instead.<ref>Bickerstaffe, Dylan, \"The Discovery of Hatshepsut's 'Throne'\", KMT, Spring 2002, pp. 71\u201377.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Howard Carter had discovered a tomb ([[KV60]]) in the Valley of the Kings that contained two female mummies, one identified as Hatshepsut's wetnurse, and the other unidentified. In the spring of 2007, the unidentified body was finally removed from the tomb by Dr. [[Zahi Hawass]] and brought to Cairo's Egyptian Museum for testing. This mummy was missing a tooth, and the space in the jaw perfectly matched Hatshepsut's existing molar, found in the DB320 \"canopic box\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/photogalleries/queen-mummy/|title=Photo Gallery: Mummy of Egypt's ''Lost Queen'' Found|website=nationalgeographic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/27/egypt.science|title=Tooth solves Hatshepsut mummy mystery|author=Ed Pilkington and Mark Tran|date=27 June 2007|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Her death has since been attributed to a [[Carcinogen|carcinogenic]] skin lotion found in possession of the Pharaoh, which led to her having [[Bone tumor|bone cancer]].

This elimination was carried out in the most literal way possible. Her cartouches and images were chiseled off some stone walls, leaving very obvious Hatshepsut-shaped gaps in the artwork.\n\nAt the Deir el-Bahari temple, Hatshepsut's numerous statues were torn down and in many cases, smashed or disfigured before being buried in a pit. At Karnak, there even was an attempt to wall up her obelisks. While it is clear that much of this rewriting of Hatshepsut's history occurred only during the close of Thutmose III's reign, it is not clear why it happened, other than the typical pattern of self-promotion that existed among the pharaohs and their administrators, or perhaps saving money by not building new monuments for the burial of Thutmose III and instead, using the grand structures built by Hatshepsut.\n\n[[Amenhotep II]], the son of Thutmose III, who became a co-regent toward the end of his father's reign, is suspected by some as being the defacer during the end of the reign of a very old pharaoh. He would have had a motive because his position in the royal lineage was not so strong as to assure his elevation to pharaoh. He is documented, further, as having usurped many of Hatshepsut's accomplishments during his own reign. His reign is marked with attempts to break the royal lineage as well, not recording the names of his queens and eliminating the powerful titles and official roles of royal women, such as God's Wife of Amun.<ref>Gardiner, Alan, ''Egypt of the Pharaohs'', Oxford University Press, 1964, p. 198.</ref>\n\nFor many years, presuming that it was Thutmose III acting out of resentment once he became pharaoh, early modern Egyptologists presumed that the erasures were similar to the Roman ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. This appeared to make sense when thinking that Thutmose might have been an unwilling co-regent for years. This assessment of the situation probably is too simplistic, however. It is highly unlikely that the determined and focused Thutmose\u2014not only Egypt's most successful general, but an acclaimed athlete, author, historian, botanist, and architect\u2014would have brooded for two decades of his own reign before attempting to avenge himself on his stepmother and aunt. According to renowned Egyptologist [[Donald Redford]]:\n\n{{quote|Here and there, in the dark recesses of a shrine or tomb where no plebeian eye could see, the queen's cartouche and figure were left intact ... which never vulgar eye would again behold, still conveyed for the king the warmth and awe of a divine presence.<ref>Redford, p. 87.</ref>}}\n\nThe erasures were sporadic and haphazard, with only the more visible and accessible images of Hatshepsut being removed; had it been more complete, we would not now have so many images of Hatshepsut. Thutmose III may have died before these changes were finished and it may be that he never intended a total obliteration of her memory. In fact, we have no evidence to support the assumption that Thutmose hated or resented Hatshepsut during her lifetime. Had that been true, as head of the army, in a position given to him by Hatshepsut (who was clearly not worried about her co-regent's loyalty), he surely could have led a successful coup, but he made no attempt to challenge her authority during her reign, and her accomplishments and images remained featured on all of the public buildings she built for twenty years after her death.\n\n===Tyldesley hypothesis===\n[[Joyce Tyldesley]] hypothesized that it is possible that Thutmose III, lacking any sinister motivation, may have decided toward the end of his life to relegate Hatshepsut to her expected place as the regent\u2014which was the traditional role of powerful women in Egypt's court as the example of Queen [[Ahhotep II|Ahhotep]] attests\u2014rather than pharaoh. Tyldesley fashions her concept as, that by eliminating the more obvious traces of Hatshepsut's monuments as pharaoh and reducing her status to that of his co-regent, Thutmose III could claim that the royal succession ran directly from Thutmose II to Thutmose III without any interference from his aunt.\n\nThe deliberate erasures or mutilations of the numerous public celebrations of her accomplishments, but not the rarely seen ones, would be all that was necessary to obscure Hatshepsut's accomplishments. Moreover, by the latter half of Thutmose III's reign, the more prominent high officials who had served Hatshepsut would have died, thereby eliminating the powerful religious and bureaucratic resistance to a change in direction in a highly stratified culture. Hatshepsut's highest official and closest supporter, Senenmut, seems either to have retired abruptly or died around Years 16 and 20 of Hatshepsut's reign, and was never interred in either of his carefully prepared tombs.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 206.</ref> According to Tyldesley, the enigma of Senenmut's sudden disappearance \"teased Egyptologists for decades\" given \"the lack of solid archaeological or textual evidence\" and permitted \"the vivid imagination of Senenmut-scholars to run wild\" resulting in a variety of strongly held solutions \"some of which would do credit to any fictional murder/mystery plot.\"<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 207, Tyldesley notes on p. 252 that a detailed discussion of Senenmut's disappearance and a useful list of other publications on this topic is given in A. R. Schulman's 1969\u201370 paper \"Some Remarks on the Alleged 'Fall' of Senmut,\" JARCE 8, pp. 29\u201348.</ref> In such a scenario, newer court officials, appointed by Thutmose III, also would have had an interest in promoting the many achievements of their master in order to assure the continued success of their own families.\n\nPresuming that it was Thutmose III (rather than his co-regent son), Tyldesley also put forth a [[hypothesis]] about Thutmose suggesting that his erasures and defacement of Hatshepsut's monuments could have been a cold, but rational attempt on his part to extinguish the memory of an \"unconventional female king whose reign might possibly be interpreted by future generations as a grave offence against [[Ma'at]], and whose unorthodox coregency\" could \"cast serious doubt upon the legitimacy of his own right to rule. Hatshepsut's crime need not be anything more than the fact that she was a woman.\"<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 225.</ref> Tyldesley conjectured<!-- a pure guess --> that Thutmose III may have considered the possibility that the example of a successful female king in Egyptian history could demonstrate that a woman was as capable at governing Egypt as a traditional male king, which could persuade \"future generations of potentially strong female kings\" to not \"remain content with their traditional lot as wife, sister and eventual mother of a king\" and assume the crown.<ref>Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', pp. 225\u2013226.</ref> Dismissing relatively recent history known to Thutmose III of another woman who was king, [[Sobekneferu]] of Egypt's Middle Kingdom, she conjectured further that he might have thought that while she had enjoyed a short, approximately four-year reign, she ruled \"at the very end of a fading [12th dynasty] Dynasty, and from the very start of her reign the odds had been stacked against her. She was, therefore, acceptable to conservative Egyptians as a patriotic 'Warrior Queen' who had failed\" to rejuvenate Egypt's fortunes.<ref name=\"Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 226\">Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 226.</ref> In contrast, Hatshepsut's glorious reign was a completely different case: she demonstrated that women were as capable as men of ruling the two lands since she successfully presided over a prosperous Egypt for more than two decades.<ref name=\"Tyldesley, ''Hatchepsut'', p. 226\"/> If Thutmose III's intent was to forestall the possibility of a woman assuming the throne, as proposed by Tyldesley, it was a failure since Twosret and Neferneferuaten (possibly), a female co-regent or successor of Akhenaten, assumed the throne for short reigns as pharaoh later in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]].\n\n===\"Hatshepsut Problem\"===\nThe erasure of Hatshepsut's name\u2014whatever the reason or the person ordering it\u2014almost caused her to disappear from Egypt's archaeological and written records. When nineteenth-century Egyptologists started to interpret the texts on the Deir el-Bahri temple walls (which were illustrated with two seemingly male kings) their translations made no sense. [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion]], the French decoder of [[hieroglyph]]s, was not alone in feeling confused by the obvious conflict between words and pictures:\n\n{{quote|If I felt somewhat surprised at seeing here, as elsewhere throughout the temple, the renowned Moeris [Thutmose III], adorned with all the insignia of royalty, giving place to this Amenenthe [Hatshepsut], for whose name we may search the royal lists in vain, still more astonished was I to find upon reading the inscriptions that wherever they referred to this bearded king in the usual dress of the Pharaohs, nouns and verbs were in the feminine, as though a queen were in question.
