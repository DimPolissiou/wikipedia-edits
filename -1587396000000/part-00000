Triple H then executed a Pedigree to retain the title.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe event received mixed reviews. Jason Powell of ''Pro Wrestling Dot Net'' commented, \"Overall, Roadblock is what most of us thought it would be. They weren't going to shake up the WrestleMania lineup three weeks away. I know some fans convinced themselves it was possible, but it just never struck me as being realistic regardless of whether it would have made for a better WrestleMania lineup\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=3/12 Powell's WWE Roadblock live review|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2016/03/12/312|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nJames Caldwell of ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' wrote that Roadblock was a \"glorified [[house show]] for the most part, but the toned-down, less-corporate production value was refreshing for a WWE broadcast\". Regarding the main event, Caldwell said that the \"false finish for Dean was interesting in that WWE is lacking goodwill heading into Mania and going that far with a false finish straddled the line of being more of a turn-off than heat-generator\".<ref name=\"Roadblock\">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=3/12 WWE Roadblock Results \u2013 CALDWELL\u2019S Complete Live Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/03/12/march12roadblockresults/|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJohn Powell of ''[[Canoe.ca]]'' summed up that there were \"no surprises at a solid Roadblock... Although the overall show was far better than any of the WWE's recent pay-per-views, Roadblock did nothing at all to fuel any kind of excitement for WrestleMania or its feuds\". For the main event, Powell wrote, \"In the match of his career, Ambrose proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he is main event material, perhaps soon to be following in the legendary but demented footsteps of another unorthodox superstar, one Mick Foley\". Powell also praised Canadians \"Natalya, Chris Jericho and Sami Zayn all putting in exceptional performances\", as well as the four NXT wrestlers who proved \"why NXT is still the show to watch each and every week\". However, commentator JBL was criticized after he \"literally loses his mind and starts yelling\". His grade went to Triple H vs. Dean Ambrose with 8 and a half out of 10 while Brock Lesnar vs. Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper got the worst with a 5 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=John|title=No surprises at a solid Roadblock|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2016/03/13/22612922.html|website=Canoe.ca|publisher=Slam!

During the match, Ambrose executed ''Dirty Deeds'' on Triple H for a three count, but the referee voided the count as Ambrose's foot was underneath the bottom rope. In the climax of the match, Ambrose executed a Diving Elbow Drop on Triple H, who was standing outside the ring. Ambrose attempted an Elbow Drop off the barricade on Triple H, who was draped on the announce table, but Triple H rolled off and Ambrose fell through the announce table. Triple H then executed a Pedigree to retain the title.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe event received mixed reviews. Jason Powell of ''Pro Wrestling Dot Net'' commented, \"Overall, Roadblock is what most of us thought it would be. They weren't going to shake up the WrestleMania lineup three weeks away. I know some fans convinced themselves it was possible, but it just never struck me as being realistic regardless of whether it would have made for a better WrestleMania lineup\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=3/12 Powell's WWE Roadblock live review|url=http://prowrestling.net/site/2016/03/12/312|website=prowrestling.net|accessdate=13 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nJames Caldwell of ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' wrote that Roadblock was a \"glorified [[house show]] for the most part, but the toned-down, less-corporate production value was refreshing for a WWE broadcast\". Regarding the main event, Caldwell said that the \"false finish for Dean was interesting in that WWE is lacking goodwill heading into Mania and going that far with a false finish straddled the line of being more of a turn-off than heat-generator\".<ref name=\"Roadblock\">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=3/12 WWE Roadblock Results \u2013 CALDWELL\u2019S Complete Live Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/03/12/march12roadblockresults/|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJohn Powell of ''[[Canoe.ca]]'' summed up that there were \"no surprises at a solid Roadblock... Although the overall show was far better than any of the WWE's recent pay-per-views, Roadblock did nothing at all to fuel any kind of excitement for WrestleMania or its feuds\". For the main event, Powell wrote, \"In the match of his career, Ambrose proved beyond a shadow of a doubt he is main event material, perhaps soon to be following in the legendary but demented footsteps of another unorthodox superstar, one Mick Foley\". Powell also praised Canadians \"Natalya, Chris Jericho and Sami Zayn all putting in exceptional performances\", as well as the four NXT wrestlers who proved \"why NXT is still the show to watch each and every week\". However, commentator JBL was criticized after he \"literally loses his mind and starts yelling\". His grade went to Triple H vs. Dean Ambrose with 8 and a half out of 10 while Brock Lesnar vs. Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper got the worst with a 5 out of 10.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=John|title=No surprises at a solid Roadblock|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2016/03/13/22612922.html|website=Canoe.ca|publisher=Slam!

It was built on the same frame as the [[Ruger Blackhawk]], but rather than having a rotating cylinder like a standard [[revolver]], it featured a swiveling [[breechblock]] which allowed an individual round to be loaded and sealed into the frame.\n\nThe Ruger Hawkeye pistol was not a commercial success, and was discontinued after only 3,100 (approximately) were produced.

[[Union Army|Union]] [[cavalry]] under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Philip Sheridan]] was detached from [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]]\u2019s [[Army of the Potomac]] to conduct a raid on [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond, Virginia]], and challenge [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] cavalry commander Maj. Gen. [[J.E.B. Stuart]]. The Confederates were outnumbered, and Stuart was mortally wounded. However, Sheridan\u2019s 'sideshow' did not achieve any of its other objectives, and had meanwhile deprived Grant\u2019s army of key cavalry functions at [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Overland Campaign was [[Union Army|Union]] [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant|Ulysses S. Grant's]] 1864 offensive against [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The two had fought an inconclusive [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and were engaged in heavy fighting at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]]. Up to this point, Union cavalry commander [[Philip Sheridan|Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan]] was dissatisfied with his role in the campaign. His Cavalry Corps was assigned to the [[Army of the Potomac]], under [[George G. Meade|Maj. Gen. George G. Meade]], who reported to Grant. Meade had employed Sheridan's forces primarily in the traditional role of screening and reconnaissance, whereas Sheridan saw the value of wielding the Cavalry Corps as an independently operating offensive weapon for wide-ranging raids into the rear areas of the enemy. On May 8, 1864, Sheridan went over Meade's head and told Grant that if his Cavalry Corps were let loose to operate as an independent unit, he could defeat \"Jeb\" Stuart, long a nemesis to the Union army. Grant was intrigued and convinced Meade of the value of Sheridan's request.\n\nOn May 9, the most powerful cavalry force ever seen in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]]&mdash;over 10,000 troopers with 32 artillery pieces&mdash;rode to the southeast to move behind Lee's army. They had three goals: first, and most important, defeat Stuart, which Sheridan did; second, disrupt Lee's supply lines by destroying railroad tracks and supplies; third, threaten the Confederate capital in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], which would distract Lee.\n\nThe Union cavalry column, which at times stretched for over {{convert|13|mi|km}}, reached the Confederate forward supply base at Beaver Dam Station that evening. The Confederate troops had been able to destroy many of the critical military supplies before the Union arrived, so Sheridan's men destroyed numerous railroad cars and six locomotives of the [[Virginia Central Railroad]], destroyed telegraph wires, and rescued almost 400 Union soldiers who had been captured in the Battle of the Wilderness.<ref>Longacre, p. 265; Eicher, p. 674.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nStuart moved his 4,500 troopers to get between Sheridan and Richmond. The two forces met at noon on May 11 at Yellow Tavern, an abandoned inn located {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of Richmond (Present day location is at the intersection of Mountain Rd, Brook Rd, and Telegraph Rd. 37.640111, -77.459593).<ref name=NPS/><ref name=EV/> Not only did the Union outnumber the Confederates by three [[division (military)|divisions]] to two [[brigade]]s, it had superior firepower&mdash;all were armed with rapid-firing [[Spencer carbine]]s. The Confederate troopers tenaciously resisted from the low ridgeline bordering the road to Richmond, fighting for over three hours. A countercharge by the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] pushed the advancing Union troopers back from the hilltop as Stuart, mounted on horseback, shouted encouragement. As the [[5th Michigan Cavalry]] streamed in retreat past Stuart, a dismounted Union private, 44-year-old John A. Huff, a former sharpshooter, turned and shot Stuart with his .44-caliber revolver, from a distance of 10\u201330 yards.<ref>Smith, p. 242; Salmon, p. 283; Starr, p. 107; Thomas, p. 292; Edward G. Longacre, writing in a June 2004 [http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/american_civil_war/3027331.html?page=3&c=y ''Civil War Times'' article], claims that Huff's shot was from {{convert|400|yd}} away, an arguably impressive feat with a revolver; in his book, ''Lincoln's Cavalrymen'' (p. 268), Longacre states that Huff was able to advance \"close enough\" to Stuart to shoot him in the abdomen, although he was not aware at the time that his victim was Stuart.</ref> Stuart died in Richmond the following day.<ref>Rhea, pp. 209, 390</ref> Huff was killed at the [[Battle of Haw's Shop]] a few weeks later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records/067/0819|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies; Series I, Vol. XXXVI, Part 1|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting kept up for an hour after Stuart was wounded with [[Fitzhugh Lee|Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee]] taking temporary command.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=In the larger picture, Sheridan's raid proved to be a costly mistake. Chasing Stuart was another side show for the campaign, which would be decided by what the armies did at Spotsylvania. By abandoning the main theater of conflict to pursue his whimsical raid south, Sheridan deprived Grant of an important resource. His victory at Yellow Tavern offered scant solace to the blue-clad soldiers hunkering in trenches above the courthouse town. Sheridan's absence hurt Grant at Spotsylvania in much the same way that Stuart's absence from [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] had handicapped Lee.\n|source=Gordon C. Rhea<ref>Rhea, p. 212.</ref>\n}}\nThe Union cavalrymen suffered 625 casualties, but they captured 300 Confederate prisoners and recovered almost 400 Union prisoners. Sheridan disengaged his men and headed south toward Richmond. Although tempted to burst through the modest defenses to the north of the city, they continued south across the [[Chickahominy River]] to link up with [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler's]] force on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. After resupplying with Butler, Sheridan's men returned to join Grant at Chesterfield Station on May 24. Sheridan's raid achieved a victory against a numerically inferior opponent at Yellow Tavern, but accomplished little overall. Their most significant achievement was killing Jeb Stuart, which deprived Robert E. Lee of his most experienced cavalry commander, but this came at the expense of a two-week period in which the Army of the Potomac had no direct cavalry coverage for screening or reconnaissance.<ref>Eicher, p. 674; Salmon, p. 283.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=cwsac>[http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Winchester%20II%20to%20Yorktown.pdf CWSAC Report Update]</ref>\n<ref name=\"EV\">{{cite web|last1=Herrmann|first1=Allison|title=Battle of Yellow Tavern|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Yellow_Tavern_Battle_of|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web|title=Battle Summary|url=https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/va052.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n*[[David J.

Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s 1864 offensive against [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The two had fought an inconclusive battle at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]] and were engaged in heavy fighting at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]]. Up to this point, Union cavalry commander Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]] was dissatisfied with his role in the campaign. His Cavalry Corps was assigned to the [[Army of the Potomac]], under Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], who reported to Grant. Meade had employed Sheridan's forces primarily in the traditional role of screening and reconnaissance, whereas Sheridan saw the value of wielding the Cavalry Corps as an independently operating offensive weapon for wide-ranging raids into the rear areas of the enemy. On May 8, 1864, Sheridan went over Meade's head and told Grant that if his Cavalry Corps were let loose to operate as an independent unit, he could defeat \"Jeb\" Stuart, long a nemesis to the Union army. Grant was intrigued and convinced Meade of the value of Sheridan's request.\n\nOn May 9, the most powerful cavalry force ever seen in the Eastern Theater&mdash;over 10,000 troopers with 32 artillery pieces&mdash;rode to the southeast to move behind Lee's army. They had three goals: first, and most important, defeat Stuart, which Sheridan did; second, disrupt Lee's supply lines by destroying railroad tracks and supplies; third, threaten the Confederate capital in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], which would distract Lee.\n\nThe Union cavalry column, which at times stretched for over {{convert|13|mi|km}}, reached the Confederate forward supply base at Beaver Dam Station that evening. The Confederate troops had been able to destroy many of the critical military supplies before the Union arrived, so Sheridan's men destroyed numerous railroad cars and six locomotives of the [[Virginia Central Railroad]], destroyed telegraph wires, and rescued almost 400 Union soldiers who had been captured in the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]].<ref>Longacre, p. 265; Eicher, p. 674.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nStuart moved his 4,500 troopers to get between Sheridan and Richmond. The two forces met at noon on May 11 at Yellow Tavern, an abandoned inn located {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of Richmond (Present day location is at the intersection of Mountain Rd, Brook Rd, and Telegraph Rd. 37.640111, -77.459593).<ref name=NPS/><ref name=EV/> Not only did the Union outnumber the Confederates by three [[division (military)|divisions]] to two [[brigade]]s, it had superior firepower&mdash;all were armed with rapid-firing [[Spencer carbine]]s. The Confederate troopers tenaciously resisted from the low ridgeline bordering the road to Richmond, fighting for over three hours. A countercharge by the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] pushed the advancing Union troopers back from the hilltop as Stuart, mounted on horseback, shouted encouragement. As the [[5th Michigan Cavalry]] streamed in retreat past Stuart, a dismounted Union private, 44-year-old John A. Huff, a former sharpshooter, turned and shot Stuart with his .44-caliber revolver, from a distance of 10\u201330 yards.<ref>Smith, p. 242; Salmon, p. 283; Starr, p. 107; Thomas, p. 292; Edward G. Longacre, writing in a June 2004 [http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/american_civil_war/3027331.html?page=3&c=y ''Civil War Times'' article], claims that Huff's shot was from {{convert|400|yd}} away, an arguably impressive feat with a revolver; in his book, ''Lincoln's Cavalrymen'' (p. 268), Longacre states that Huff was able to advance \"close enough\" to Stuart to shoot him in the abdomen, although he was not aware at the time that his victim was Stuart.</ref> Stuart died in Richmond the following day.<ref>Rhea, pp. 209, 390</ref> Huff was killed at the [[Battle of Haw's Shop]] a few weeks later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ehistory.osu.edu/books/official-records/067/0819|title=The war of the rebellion: a compilation of the official records of the Union and Confederate armies; Series I, Vol. XXXVI, Part 1|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting kept up for an hour after Stuart was wounded, Maj. Gen. [[Fitzhugh Lee]] taking temporary command.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=In the larger picture, Sheridan's raid proved to be a costly mistake. Chasing Stuart was another side show for the campaign, which would be decided by what the armies did at Spotsylvania. By abandoning the main theater of conflict to pursue his whimsical raid south, Sheridan deprived Grant of an important resource. His victory at Yellow Tavern offered scant solace to the blue-clad soldiers hunkering in trenches above the courthouse town. Sheridan's absence hurt Grant at Spotsylvania in much the same way that Stuart's absence from [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] had handicapped Lee.\n|source=Gordon C. Rhea<ref>Rhea, p. 212.</ref>\n}}\nThe Union cavalrymen suffered 625 casualties, but they captured 300 Confederate prisoners and recovered almost 400 Union prisoners. Sheridan disengaged his men and headed south toward Richmond. Although tempted to burst through the modest defenses to the north of the city, they continued south across the [[Chickahominy River]] to link up with Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler's]] force on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. After resupplying with Butler, Sheridan's men returned to join Grant at Chesterfield Station on May 24. Sheridan's raid achieved a victory against a numerically inferior opponent at Yellow Tavern, but accomplished little overall. Their most significant achievement was killing Jeb Stuart, which deprived Robert E. Lee of his most experienced cavalry commander, but this came at the expense of a two-week period in which the Army of the Potomac had no direct cavalry coverage for screening or reconnaissance.<ref>Eicher, p. 674; Salmon, p. 283.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=cwsac>[http://www.nps.gov/hps/abpp/CWSII/VirginiaBattlefieldProfiles/Winchester%20II%20to%20Yorktown.pdf CWSAC Report Update]</ref>\n<ref name=\"EV\">{{cite web|last1=Herrmann|first1=Allison|title=Battle of Yellow Tavern|url=http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Yellow_Tavern_Battle_of|publisher=Encyclopedia Virginia|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web|title=Battle Summary|url=https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/va052.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=11 May 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n*[[David J.
