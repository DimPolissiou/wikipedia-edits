{"title_page": "Partimento", "text_new": "[[File:Fenaroli Partimento No 1 Book 1 Gj1301.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A simple partimenti with figures to teach beginners. (Fenaroli Partimento No. 1, Book 1, Gj1301)]]\n[[File:Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418.jpg|thumb|right|500px| A partimenti fugue for more advanced students. As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} ''Partimenti'', or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century. Because learning the Italian style of music was a priority for almost any eighteenth-century musician, many well-known non-Italian composers, including Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, also studied or taught partimenti.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples.  At the time of the American Revolution, Naples was the center of the musical world. For more than a century the Neapolitan School of Music dominated the entire musical scene of Europe. When Thomas Jefferson made a catalog of his personal music collection in 1783, it featured names like Piccinni, Hasse and Pergolesi, all important composers trained at the famous music conservatories of Naples.Although the Neapolitan Masters laid the foundation of classical music and produced some of the most beautiful music ever written, only a fraction of their masterpieces are known and performed today. The principal goal of Neapolitan Music Society is to enlarge communities of study, research and a reevaluation of these musical works, forgotten or lost for over two centuries. \ufeff \n\nProf. Robert Gjerdingen, Professor, Music Theory and Cognition, Northwestern University, put it this way: \"Suppose in 50 years, someone is writing the history of rock-n-roll and they conclude: \"The French rock scene was where it all began...they were the best and developed the whole genre.\" Obviously, that would be completely absurd, but it's the sort of distortion that has marginalized the Neapolitans. The Neapolitan Masters were the most famous classical musicians of the 17th and 18th centuries. They were hired and traded, Gjerdingen says, \"like star baseball players between the competing royal courts in Europe.\"\n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence in Germany ===\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance === \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Essential Foundations of the Key  ==\n\nThe ''Essential Foundations of the Key''{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}} or ''Rule of the Scale Steps''{{sfn|Furno|1817|p=2}} tell the student how to distribute chords over scale degrees, separate from the Rule of the Octave.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=117}}\n\nOne can give an 8ve to all the degrees of the key, as well as to their consonances, provided that one does not create parallel 8ves, seeing that two 5ths or 8ves, whether above or below, by step or by skip, the one after the other, are prohibited because they make bad harmony.\n\n\u2460 takes a 3rd, 5th.\n\n\u2461 takes a minor 3rd, 4th and major 6th. {{sfn|Furno|1817|p=3}}\n\n\u2462 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2462 is major. If, on the other hand, the said \u2462 is minor, then it takes the major 3rd and major 6th, and this comes about naturally.\n\n\u2463 takes a 3rd and 5th. Whenever the \u2463 ascends to the \u2464, it [\u2463] can take the 6th in addition to the 3rd and 5th. And if \u2463 descends from \u2464, then stay with the same consonances as for the said \u2464, which become in turn a 2nd, major [=augmented] 4th, and 6th.\n\n\u2464 takes a major 3rd and 5th. Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464. That is, the \u2460 takes the 3rd and 5th, and the \u2464 takes the major 3rd and 5th.\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento'''  (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} ''Partimenti'', or instructional basses, were central to the training of European court musicians from the late 1600s until the early 1800s. They had their greatest influence first in Italian conservatories, especially at Naples, and then later at the Paris Conservatory, where the principles of the \"Italian school\" continued to be taught far into the twentieth century. Because learning the Italian style of music was a priority for almost any eighteenth-century musician, many well-known non-Italian composers, including Bach, Handel, Haydn, and Mozart, also studied or taught partimenti.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence in Germany ===\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\nThe Paris Conservatory was greatly influenced by the [[music conservatories of Naples||music conservatories of Naples]]. As the Neapolitans did not have a class but called much of it \"Harmony.\" There was \"practical harmony\" improvised from partimenti played at the piano, and there was \"harmony\" as a written subject where a given bass or given soprano was \"realized\" by providing three additional voices. The resulting four-voice counterpoint on four staves (notated in soprano, alto, tenor, and bass clefs) was called a realization (''r\u00e9alisation''). A student would begin by playing elementary material as a ten- or eleven-year-old but would eventually develop the skill to write complicated four-voice counterpoint full of remote modulations and chromatic embellishments.{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2019|p=[http://partimenti.org/harmony/about_harmo/overview.html]}} [[Fran\u00e7ois Bazin (composer)|Fran\u00e7ois Bazin]] was a teacher of harmony at the Paris conservatory and many of his lessons were still titled \"partimenti\".{{sfn|Gjerdingen|2020|p=296}}\n\n=== Partimento in the 19th century ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance === \n\n=== Revival in the 21st century  ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Nurturing musical creativity beyond mere partimento realizations.  Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Partimenti gained increased recognition due to being part of [[Alma Deutscher]]'s early musical training, with her studies with Tobias Cramm and [[Robert Gjerdingen]].{{efn|Her father, Israeli linguist Guy Deutscher, said, \u201cThe greatest moment was when we realized that she was playing her own melodies.\u201d He decided to take Alma\u2019s musical soul seriously, and began searching for methods of teaching classical music composition to children\u2014and for a teacher.He discovered a book, Music in the Galant Style, by Robert Gjerdingen, professor of music at North-western University\u2019s School of Music. Gjerdingen reveals the results of his exhaustive search through the libraries of Naples and other Italian cities to and the original sources, the pedagogical workbooks, known as partimenti (or singular, partimento, using the word to mean the method itself) of 18th-century music masters.}}{{sfn|Rasmussen|2017|p=25}}.\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony and Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition unlike today. \n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat.

Give a minor seventh to a \u2464 that returns to the \u2460. This seventh cannot rise, but must resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n\u2465 takes a 3rd, and 6th. When \u2465 is major and descends to \u2464, then it is better to use a major 6th in the accompaniment, because it makes better harmony. And one can add to \u2465, as if it were \u2461, by giving it a 3rd, a 4th, and a major 6th. But if the \u2465 neither ascends to \u2466 or descends to \u2460, then give it a 3rd and 5th.\n\n\u2466 takes a 3rd and 6th. Both of them should be minor if the said \u2466 is major. If, on the other hand, the \u2466 is minor, then the 3rd and the 6th in the accompaniment should both be major, and this comes about naturally. Give a diminished fifth to a \u2466 rising to the \u2460, in addition to the 3rd and 6th. This diminished fifth cannot rise, but must also resolve by falling to the third of the \u2460.\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464.

Players with nine rebounds in a game have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot late in the game in order to recover the rebound; a few have even gone so far as shooting off their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined not to be a legitimate scoring attempt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1781342 |title=Sura's third straight triple-double off books |date=April 13, 2004 |work=ESPN.com |accessdate=November 14, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329215051/http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1781342 |archivedate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, [[Oscar Robertson]] leads the all-time NBA list for career triple-doubles with 181 and is, along with [[Russell Westbrook]], one of only two players ever to average a triple-double for a season.

There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian [[Livy]] and Greco-Roman historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].\n\nThe incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] intervention. The rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.\n\nOne of the first two [[consul]]s of the Roman Republic, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]] was Lucretia's husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia's story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretia's story is not considered a [[myth]] by most historians, but rather a historical [[legend]] about an early history that was already a major part of Roman [[folklore]] before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.\n\nAs the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the ''[[fasti]]''. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year \"at the beginning of the sixty-eighth [[Olympiad]] ... [[Isagoras]] being the annual [[archon]] at [[Athens]]\";<ref>D.H. V.1.</ref> that is, 508/507&nbsp;BC (the ancient calendars split years over modern ones). According to this source Lucretia therefore died in 508&nbsp;BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy J |last=Cornell |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000\u2013264&nbsp;BC) |series=The Routledge History of the Ancient World |chapter=9.

Prior to the rape, while her husband was an man of excellent social standing, he had no political power or standing in Rome. He lacked both the power and the wealth of his Tarquinius relatives. Her marriage was depicted as being the ideal Roman marriage as both Lucretia and Lucius were faithfully devoted to one another. She was described as beautiful and virtuous by Roman writer Livy. While her husband was away at battle, Lucretia would stay at home and pray for his safe return. Similar to Livy, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' depiction of Lucretia, separates her from the rest of Roman women in a story about the men returning home from a battle. The narrative begins with a bet between the sons of Tarquinius and their kinsmen, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus|Collantinus]]. The men fight over which of their wives best exemplified [[sophrosyne]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mallan|first=C|date=2014|title=THE RAPE OF LUCRETIA IN CASSIUS DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY|url=|journal=The Classical Quarterly|edition=2|volume=64|pages=758-771|via=}}</ref> The men return home to find the women socializing with each other, presumably drinking and in conversation. In contrast, they find Lucretia home alone working with her wool in silence.

The most common type of depiction.]]\n[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], sent his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]], on a military errand to [[Collatia]]. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], son of the king's nephew, [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns Tarquinius]], former governor of Collatia and first of the [[Tarquinius|Tarquinii Collatini]]. Collatinus' wife, Lucretia, daughter of [[Spurius Lucretius]], prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction,\"<ref name=DHIV64>D.H. IV.64.</ref> made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story,<ref>T.L. I.57.</ref> Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see [[sexuality in ancient Rome]] for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\n==Consequences==\nTarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present [[keening]] and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"<ref>D.H. IV.66.</ref>\n\nIn the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] from Rome and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance\u2014\"Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.\"\u2014<ref name=TLI58>T.L. I.58.</ref> and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.\n\nIn another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother's side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his father's side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.<ref>D.H. IV.68.</ref>\n\n[[File:N03Brutus-u-Lucretia.jpg|thumb|left|The less common subject of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] holding the dead Lucretia and swearing the oath]]\nCollatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger,<ref>D.H. IV.70.</ref> he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.\n\nHe passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livy's version is:<ref name=TLI59>T.L. I.59.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>By this blood\u2014most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son\u2014I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.</blockquote>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:7031 Lucrecia romana.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Lucretia'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] ]]\n[[File:Gentileschi-Lucrezia-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|The rape, by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]]]\n{{Main article|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nThe newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse of Lucretia to the [[Roman Forum]] '''w'''here it remained on display as a reminder of the dishonor committed. At the form, the committee heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army to abolish the monarchy. Brutus \"urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.\"<ref name=TLI59/> The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.\n\nBrutus was the Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, which as a [[Magistrates' court|magistracy]] gave him the theoretical power to summon the [[curiae]], an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to address them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.\n\nHe began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the [[plebeians]] in the ditches and sewers of Rome. In his speech, he pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of [[Servius Tullius]], his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" He suggested that as the king's wife, [[Tullia (daughter of Servius Tullius)|Tullia]], was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.<ref name=TLI59/>\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an [[interrex]] to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.\n\nA final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began:<ref>D.H. IV.78.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In as much as Tarquinius neither obtained the sovereignty in accordance with our ancestral customs and laws, nor, since he obtained it\u2014in whatever manner he got it\u2014has he been exercising it in an honourable or kingly manner, but has surpassed in insolence and lawlessness all the tyrants the world ever saw, we patricians met together and resolved to deprive him of his power, a thing we ought to have done long ago, but are doing now when a favourable opportunity has offered. And we have called you together, plebeians, in order to declare our own decision and then ask for your assistance in achieving liberty for our country ....}}\n\nA general election was held and the vote won in favor of the republic. This ended the monarchy, and during these proceedings Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nThe constitutional consequences of this event were, prevented Rome from having another hereditary \"king,\" [[Roman Empire|later emperors]] were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian Augustus]] from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several [[Roman Republic|republican offices]] onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their [[Roman emperor|successors]] both in [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]] and in [[Byzantine Emperor|Constantinople]] adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and the office of German [[Holy Roman Emperor]] remained elective rather than hereditary\u2014up to its abolition in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], over 2300 years later.[[File:Sandro Botticelli 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'' ({{circa|1500\u201301}}), by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

In his account her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] made use of the figure of Lucretia in ''[[The City of God]]'' (published 426 AD) to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.\n\nThe story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages.  Lucretia appears to [[Dante]] in the section of Limbo reserved to the nobles of Rome and other \"virtuous pagans\" in Canto IV of the [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']]. [[Christine de Pizan]] used Lucretia just as St. Augustine of Hippo did in her ''City of Ladies'', defending a woman's sanctity.\n\nThe myth is recounted in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and it follows a similar story line to Livy's. Lucretia calls for her father and husband, but Chaucer's tale also has her call for her mother and attendants as well, whereas Livy's has both her father and husband bring an friend as witness. The tale also deviated from Livy's account as it begins with her husband coming home to surprise her, rather than the men placing an bet on the virtue of their wives. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/GoodWomen.php#anchor_Toc186791816|title=The Legend of Good Women|last=Chaucer|first=Geoffery|date=2008|website=Poetry in Translation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (Book VII), and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Fall of Princes]]''.

Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's comedy [[The Mandrake|''La Mandragola'']] is loosely based on the Lucretia story.\n\nShe is also mentioned in the poem \"[[Appius and Virginia]]\" by [[John Webster]] and [[Thomas Heywood]], which includes the following lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Two fair, but ladies most infortunate,\nHave in their ruins rais'd declining Rome,\nLucretia and [[Verginia|Virginia]], both renown'd\nFor chastity.<ref>John Webster ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w_5ADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT171&lpg=PT171&dq=%22ladies+most+infortunate%22&source=bl&ots=b14T7Zh4hk&sig=TNFhQWg5Lte4Lr8O-yyNjfsBRy0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmi87Zu4zaAhUHmrQKHYJzDvQQ6AEIMTAC Appius and Virginia]'' 5.3.224</ref></poem>}}\n\n[[Thomas Heywood]]'s play ''The Rape of Lucretia'' dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century; [[Andr\u00e9 Obey]]'s 1931 play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce|fr}}'' was adapted by librettist [[Ronald Duncan]] for ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', a 1946 opera by [[Benjamin Britten]] which premiered at Glyndebourne. [[Ernst Krenek]] set [[Emmet Lavery]]'s [[libretto]] ''[[Tarquin (opera)|Tarquin]]'' (1940), a version in a contemporary setting.\n\n[[Jacques Gallot]] (died {{circa|1690}}) composed the allemandes \"[[Lucr\u00e8ce]]\" and \"[[Tarquin (Gallot)|Tarquin]]\" for baroque lute.\n\nIn [[Samuel Richardson]]'s 1740 novel ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', Mr. B. cites the story of Lucretia as a reason why Pamela ought not fear for her reputation, should he rape her. Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] also mentions Lucrecia in her poem \"Redondillas,\" a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.\n\nIn 1769, doctor [[Joan Ramis]] wrote a tragedy in [[Menorca]] entitled ''Lucrecia''. The play is written in the [[Catalan language]] using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.\n\nIn 1932, the play ''Lucrece'' was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the title part. It was mostly performed in [[pantomime]].\n\nIn [[Donna Leon]]'s 2009 Venetian novel, ''About Face'', Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in [[Ovid]]'s '' Fasti '' (Book II, for February 24, \"Regifugium\") to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.\n\n==Subject in art==\nSince the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], [[Johannes Moreelse]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Dami\u00e0 Campeny]], [[Eduardo Rosales]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.\n\nThe subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], and [[Verginia]].<ref>Russell, Nos 1\u201314</ref> These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the [[Power of Women]], showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art. The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.<ref>Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16</ref>\n\nThe subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], which also includes a banquet.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=1853,0312.230 British Museum], ''Story of Lucretia''.</ref>\n\n;Examples with articles\n\n*[[Tarquin and Lucretia]]\u2014 life-size image of the rape by [[Titian]]\n*[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)]]\u2014three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide\n*[[The Suicide of Lucretia (D\u00fcrer)]]\u2014single figure painting\n*[[Lucretia and her Husband]]\u2014distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.

There are no contemporary sources; information regarding Lucretia, her rape and suicide, and the consequence of this being the start of the Roman Republic, come from the later accounts of Roman historian [[Livy]] and Greco-Roman historian [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].\n\nThe incident kindled the flames of dissatisfaction over the tyrannical methods of the last king of Rome, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]]. As a result, the prominent families instituted a republic, drove the extensive royal family of Tarquin from Rome, and successfully defended the republic against attempted [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] intervention. The rape itself became a major theme in European art and literature.\n\nOne of the first two [[consul]]s of the Roman Republic, [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]] was Lucretia's husband. All the numerous sources on the establishment of the republic reiterate the basic events of Lucretia's story, though accounts vary slightly. Lucretia's story is not considered a [[myth]] by most historians, but rather a historical [[legend]] about an early history that was already a major part of Roman [[folklore]] before it was first written about. The evidence points to the historical existence of a woman named Lucretia and a historical incident that played a critical part in the real downfall of a real monarchy. Many of the specific details, though, are debatable, and vary depending on the writer. Post-Roman uses of the legend typically became mythical in portrayal, being of artistic rather than historical merit.\n\nAs the events of the story move rapidly, the date of the incident is probably the same year as the first of the ''[[fasti]]''. Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a major source, sets this year \"at the beginning of the sixty-eighth [[Olympiad]] ... [[Isagoras]] being the annual [[archon]] at [[Athens]]\";<ref>D.H. V.1.</ref> that is, 508/507&nbsp;BC (the ancient calendars split years over modern ones). According to this source Lucretia therefore died in 508&nbsp;BC. The other historical sources tend to support this date, but the year is debatable within a range of about five years.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy J |last=Cornell |title=The Beginnings of Rome: Italy and Rome from the Bronze Age to the Punic Wars (c. 1000\u2013264&nbsp;BC) |series=The Routledge History of the Ancient World |chapter=9.

Prior to the rape, while her husband was an man of excellent social standing, he had no political power or standing in Rome. He lacked both the power and the wealth of his Tarquinius relatives. Her marriage was depicted as being the ideal Roman marriage as both Lucretia and Lucius were faithfully devoted to one another. She was described as beautiful and virtuous by Roman writer Livy. While her husband was away at battle, Lucretia would stay at home and pray for his safe return. Similar to Livy, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]]' depiction of Lucretia, separates her from the rest of Roman women in a story about the men returning home from a battle. The narrative begins with a bet between the sons of Tarquinius and their kinsmen, [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus|Collantinus]]. The men fight over which of their wives best exemplified [[sophrosyne]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mallan|first=C|date=2014|title=THE RAPE OF LUCRETIA IN CASSIUS DIO'S ROMAN HISTORY|url=|journal=The Classical Quarterly|edition=2|volume=64|pages=758-771|via=}}</ref> The men return home to find the women socializing with each other, presumably drinking and in conversation. In contrast, they find Lucretia home alone working with her wool in silence.

The most common type of depiction.]]\n[[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], last king of Rome, being engaged in the siege of [[Ardea (RM)|Ardea]], sent his son, [[Sextus Tarquinius|Tarquin]], on a military errand to [[Collatia]]. Tarquin was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], son of the king's nephew, [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns Tarquinius]], former governor of Collatia and first of the [[Tarquinius|Tarquinii Collatini]]. Collatinus' wife, Lucretia, daughter of [[Spurius Lucretius]], prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction,\"<ref name=DHIV64>D.H. IV.64.</ref> made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story,<ref>T.L. I.57.</ref> Tarquin and Collatinus, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Collatinus volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Collatinus invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night, Tarquin entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened. He identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see [[sexuality in ancient Rome]] for Roman attitudes toward sex). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\n==Consequences==\nTarquin returned to camp. The next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the supplicant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself, she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating the proper course of action, she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present [[keening]] and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"<ref>D.H. IV.66.</ref>\n\nIn the alternative version, she did not go to Rome, but sent for her father and her husband asking them to bring one friend each. Those selected were [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] from Rome and [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] from the camp at Ardea. They found Lucretia in her room. She explained what had happened and after exacting an oath of vengeance\u2014\"Pledge me your solemn word that the adulterer shall not go unpunished.\"\u2014<ref name=TLI58>T.L. I.58.</ref> and while they were discussing the matter, drew the poignard and stabbed herself in her heart.\n\nIn another version Collatinus and Brutus were encountered returning to Rome unaware, were briefed, and were brought to the death scene. Brutus happened to be a politically motivated participant. By kinship he was a Tarquin on his mother's side, the son of Tarquinia, daughter of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the third king before last. He was a candidate for the throne if anything should happen to Superbus. By law, however, as he was a Junius on his father's side, he was not a Tarquin and therefore could later propose the exile of the Tarquins without fear for himself. Superbus had taken his inheritance and left him a pittance, keeping him at court for entertainment.<ref>D.H. IV.68.</ref>\n\n[[File:N03Brutus-u-Lucretia.jpg|thumb|left|The less common subject of [[Lucius Junius Brutus|Brutus]] holding the dead Lucretia and swearing the oath]]\nCollatinus, seeing his wife dead, became distraught. He held her, kissed her, called her name and spoke to her. Seeing the hand of Destiny in these events, his friend Brutus called the grieving party to order, explained that his simplicity had been a sham, and proposed that they drive the Tarquins from Rome. Grasping the bloody dagger,<ref>D.H. IV.70.</ref> he swore by Mars and all the other gods that he would do everything in his power to overthrow the dominion of the Tarquinii and that he would neither be reconciled to the tyrants himself nor tolerate any who should be reconciled to them, but would look upon every man who thought otherwise as an enemy and till his death would pursue with unrelenting hatred both the tyranny and its abettors; and if he should violate his oath, he prayed that he and his children might meet with the same end as Lucretia.\n\nHe passed the dagger around and each mourner swore the same oath by it. The two stories agree on this point: Livy's version is:<ref name=TLI59>T.L. I.59.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>By this blood\u2014most pure before the outrage wrought by the king's son\u2014I swear, and you, O gods, I call to witness that I will drive hence Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, together with his cursed wife and his whole blood, with fire and sword and every means in my power, and I will not suffer them or anyone else to reign in Rome.</blockquote>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:7031 Lucrecia romana.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Lucretia'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] ]]\n[[File:Gentileschi-Lucrezia-Potsdam.jpg|thumb|The rape, by [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]]]\n{{Main article|Overthrow of the Roman monarchy}}\nThe newly sworn revolutionary committee paraded the bloody corpse of Lucretia to the [[Roman Forum]] '''w'''here it remained on display as a reminder of the dishonor committed. At the form, the committee heard grievances against the Tarquins and began to enlist an army to abolish the monarchy. Brutus \"urged them to act as men and Romans and take up arms against their insolent foes.\"<ref name=TLI59/> The gates of Rome were blockaded by the new revolutionary soldiers and more were sent to guard Collatia. By now a crowd had gathered in the forum; the presence of the magistrates among the revolutionaries kept them in good order.\n\nBrutus was the Tribune of the Celeres, a minor office of some religious duties, which as a [[Magistrates' court|magistracy]] gave him the theoretical power to summon the [[curiae]], an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king. Summoning them on the spot he transformed the crowd into an authoritative legislative assembly and began to address them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome.\n\nHe began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He levelled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the [[plebeians]] in the ditches and sewers of Rome. In his speech, he pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of [[Servius Tullius]], his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" He suggested that as the king's wife, [[Tullia (daughter of Servius Tullius)|Tullia]], was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.<ref name=TLI59/>\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have, a debate at which many [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] spoke. In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an [[interrex]] to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies.\n\nA final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex; he was prefect of the city already. He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole, they paraded Lucretia through the streets summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a constitutional speech by Brutus not unlike many speeches and documents of western civilization subsequently. It began:<ref>D.H. IV.78.</ref>\n\n{{quote|In as much as Tarquinius neither obtained the sovereignty in accordance with our ancestral customs and laws, nor, since he obtained it\u2014in whatever manner he got it\u2014has he been exercising it in an honourable or kingly manner, but has surpassed in insolence and lawlessness all the tyrants the world ever saw, we patricians met together and resolved to deprive him of his power, a thing we ought to have done long ago, but are doing now when a favourable opportunity has offered. And we have called you together, plebeians, in order to declare our own decision and then ask for your assistance in achieving liberty for our country ....}}\n\nA general election was held and the vote won in favor of the republic. This ended the monarchy, and during these proceedings Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nThe constitutional consequences of this event were, prevented Rome from having another hereditary \"king,\" [[Roman Empire|later emperors]] were absolute rulers in all but name. This constitutional tradition prevented both [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Octavian Augustus]] from accepting a crown; instead they had to devise a confluence of several [[Roman Republic|republican offices]] onto their persons in order to secure absolute power. Their [[Roman emperor|successors]] both in [[Western Roman Empire|Rome]] and in [[Byzantine Emperor|Constantinople]] adhered to this tradition in form if not in essence, and the office of German [[Holy Roman Emperor]] remained elective rather than hereditary\u2014up to its abolition in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], over 2300 years later.[[File:Sandro Botticelli 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)|The Story of Lucretia]]'' ({{circa|1500\u201301}}), by [[Sandro Botticelli]].

In his account her husband has boasted of the virtue of his wife to Tarquin and others. Livy contrasts the virtue of the Roman Lucretia, who remained in her room weaving, with the Etruscan ladies who feasted with friends. Ovid recounts the story of Lucretia in Book II of his ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', published in 8 AD, concentrating on the bold over-reaching character of Tarquin. Later, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] made use of the figure of Lucretia in ''[[The City of God]]'' (published 426 AD) to defend the honour of Christian women who had been raped in the sack of Rome and had not committed suicide.\n\nThe story of Lucretia was a popular moral tale in the later Middle Ages.  Lucretia appears to [[Dante]] in the section of Limbo reserved to the nobles of Rome and other \"virtuous pagans\" in Canto IV of the [[Inferno (Dante)|''Inferno'']]. [[Christine de Pizan]] used Lucretia just as St. Augustine of Hippo did in her ''City of Ladies'', defending a woman's sanctity.\n\n'''The myth is''' recounted in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', '''and it follows a similar story line to Livy's. Lucretia calls for her father and husband, but Chaucer's tale also has her call for her mother and attendants as well, whereas Livy's has both her father and husband bring an friend as witness. The tale also deviated from Livy's account as it begins with her husband coming home to surprise her, rather than the men placing an bet on the virtue of their wives.''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/English/GoodWomen.php#anchor_Toc186791816|title=The Legend of Good Women|last=Chaucer|first=Geoffery|date=2008|website=Poetry in Translation|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[John Gower]]'s ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (Book VII), and [[John Lydgate]]'s ''[[Fall of Princes]]''.

Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's comedy [[The Mandrake|''La Mandragola'']] is loosely based on the Lucretia story.\n\nShe is also mentioned in the poem \"[[Appius and Virginia]]\" by [[John Webster]] and [[Thomas Heywood]], which includes the following lines:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Two fair, but ladies most infortunate,\nHave in their ruins rais'd declining Rome,\nLucretia and [[Verginia|Virginia]], both renown'd\nFor chastity.<ref>John Webster ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w_5ADgAAQBAJ&pg=PT171&lpg=PT171&dq=%22ladies+most+infortunate%22&source=bl&ots=b14T7Zh4hk&sig=TNFhQWg5Lte4Lr8O-yyNjfsBRy0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmi87Zu4zaAhUHmrQKHYJzDvQQ6AEIMTAC Appius and Virginia]'' 5.3.224</ref></poem>}}\n\n[[Thomas Heywood]]'s play ''The Rape of Lucretia'' dates from 1607. The subject also enjoyed a revival in the mid twentieth century; [[Andr\u00e9 Obey]]'s 1931 play ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Le Viol de Lucr\u00e8ce|fr}}'' was adapted by librettist [[Ronald Duncan]] for ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', a 1946 opera by [[Benjamin Britten]] which premiered at Glyndebourne.

Pamela quickly sets him straight with a better reading of the story. Colonial Mexican poet [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] also mentions Lucrecia in her poem \"Redondillas,\" a commentary on prostitution and who is to blame.\n\nIn 1769, doctor [[Joan Ramis]] wrote a tragedy in [[Menorca]] entitled ''Lucrecia''. The play is written in the [[Catalan language]] using a neoclassical style and is the most important work of the eighteenth century written in this language.\n\nIn 1932, the play ''Lucrece'' was produced on Broadway starring legendary actress [[Katharine Cornell]] in the title part. It was mostly performed in [[pantomime]].\n\nIn [[Donna Leon]]'s 2009 Venetian novel, ''About Face'', Franca Marinello refers to the tale of Tarquin and Lucrezia, as recounted in [[Ovid]]'s '' Fasti '' (Book II, for February 24, \"Regifugium\") to explain her actions to Commissario Brunetti.\n\n==Subject in art==\nSince the Renaissance, the suicide of Lucretia has been an enduring subject for visual artists, including [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]], [[Raphael]], [[Botticelli]], [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], [[Johannes Moreelse]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Dami\u00e0 Campeny]], [[Eduardo Rosales]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and others. Most commonly, either the moment of the rape is shown or Lucretia is shown alone at the moment of her suicide. In either situation, her clothing is loosened or absent, while Tarquin is normally clothed.\n\nThe subject was one of a group showing women from legend or the Bible who were either powerless or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], and [[Verginia]].<ref>Russell, Nos 1\u201314</ref> These formed a counterpoint to, or sub-group of, the set of subjects known as the [[Power of Women]], showing female violence against, or domination of, men. These were often depicted by the same artists, and especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art. The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.<ref>Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16</ref>\n\nThe subject of Lucretia spinning, with her ladies, is sometimes depicted, as in a series of four engravings of her story by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], which also includes a banquet.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=1853,0312.230 British Museum], ''Story of Lucretia''.</ref>\n\n;Examples with articles\n\n*[[Tarquin and Lucretia]]\u2014 life-size image of the rape by [[Titian]]\n*[[The Story of Lucretia (Botticelli)]]\u2014three scenes, of the rape, Brutus arousing the people, and the suicide\n*[[The Suicide of Lucretia (D\u00fcrer)]]\u2014single figure painting\n*[[Lucretia and her Husband]]\u2014distinctive depiction of Lucretia with a knife, and a shadowy male figure just behind.

The first thing the app displays is who the character's parents are, and their occupation, as well as your birthday, [[star sign]], how you were conceived and if you have any siblings or children . In some cases, your character may have been put up for adoption at birth. To add one year to your character's life, you press the \"Age\" button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/bitlife-life-simulator|title=BitLife - Life Simulator - App Review|date=2018-12q14|website=Common Sense Media|language=en|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n== Stages of a life ==\n==== Childhood ====\nBetween ages 0 and 5, you are considered an \"infant.\" Between ages 5 and 8, depending on the country you are playing in, you begin elementary or [[primary school]]. You then advance to the next level of schooling between ages 11 and 14, either \"[[middle school]]\" or \"[[secondary school]]\" depending on the country, and then (in some countries) to a final level of basic schooling by age 16. In middle school or secondary school, the option to join a school club becomes available, as well as the option to join a clique. All-female characters will also have their [[menarche]] randomly between ages 10 and 15. At age 10, it becomes possible to find a date or be asked out on one. Upon reaching age 12, activities to raise the character's four bars (happiness, health, smarts, and looks) start becoming available. Then by age 14, the option to get part-time or freelance jobs becomes available.\n\nDuring childhood, you are largely limited in activities to do. You may be able to ask your parents for money, depending on how generous or rich your parents are as shown by their \"generosity\" or \"money\" bar. Various pop-up scenarios may also appear depending on what age you are at. In your \"infancy\" for example, you may encounter scenarios involving your first words or being taken to get [[vaccine|vaccinated]]. Once you reach school age, scenarios involving activities with friends, your \"first kiss,\" school dances, or other events may appear.\n\n==== Adulthood ====\nBetween ages 15 and 19, depending on the country, you can take your [[driving test]], which is simply a test asking what a road sign means, contrary to real life. If you pass, you may receive a car from your parents depending on their generosity. After you graduate from secondary school, you can decide whether to continue your education, take time off, acquire a full-time occupation, or enlist in the military.\n\nAt age 18, the option to buy a house becomes available, as do all remaining activities such as clubbing, vacationing, [[emigration]], various crime options such as [[burglary]], and gambling. As you age through adulthood, random pop up scenarios will appear as you age requiring decisions that can have major effects on your life. Such scenarios generally involve your career, your health, your spouse and/or children (if you have any), your friends, as well as potential random encounters such as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] person asking for money, being a witness to a crime, having to decide whether to risk your life to save another, among others.\n\nAfter working for a certain number of years, the option to retire becomes available (the exact age of which varies by country). Many occupations will force you into [[retirement]] after a certain point, though in most full time occupations you will receive a [[pension]] after retiring.\n\n==== Death ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife app death and gravestone.jpg|thumb|right|A gravestone with a ribbon on its upper left corner in BitLife]] -->\nIf you live your life without many harming consequences, you will die of natural causes. Generally, if you keep your health bar close to or at 100%, you will most likely live beyond [[Centenarian|100 years]], contrary to real life where few people live for that long. At the end of each life you are assigned a ribbon, based on how you lived your life. For example, \"Fertile\" ribbons are assigned for having lots of children. Some ribbons are easy to get while others are far more difficult to obtain. Currently, there are a total of 30 ribbons.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-ribbons-list-guide/|title=BitLife Ribbons List Guide|date=2019-06-13|website=progameguides.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> All previous lives you lived are viewable via a \"[[cemetery]]\". Many players believe that 124 is the maximum age in Bitlife, but it is possible to live much longer. \n\nAfter you die, you have the option of starting a new life (either customized or random), replaying the same character again with the option to make different choices, or continuing a \"legacy\" as your character's child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/03/27/bitlife-fame-live-on-as-your-child-and-everything-else-to-expect/|title=BitLife Update|date=2019-03-27|website=gamebozo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Character stats ===\nAt the bottom of the screen when playing are four bars showing the happiness, health, smarts, and looks of one's character between 0 and 100%. Each bar will randomly fluctuate each time the \"age\" button is pressed. Various activities can be performed to either raise or lower each of the bars, such as going to the gym to raise looks. The levels of a player's bars have major impacts on the lives of their characters. High smarts can allow one's character to receive a [[scholarship]] to university for example, while by contrast, low smarts can result in one's application to university being rejected altogether.\n\nCertain occupations in the game (such as an acting job) can make one become \"famous,\" at which point a fifth bar showing your level of \"fame\" is shown. If you fail to keep the fame bar above 0%, then the bar disappears and you are no longer \"famous.\" There is also another major bar concerning the character's \"[[karma]],\" which fluctuates depending on the nature of actions you take for good or bad. While the bar is never seen as one of the main bars at the bottom of the screen during gameplay, it can still have an effect on your character's life, and it is shown on your character's gravestone after death.\n\n=== Relationships ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife App relationships tab.jpeg|thumb|left|An example of the relationships tab in BitLife, showing a character's wife and siblings]] -->\nA core component of the game is \"relationships\" with [[NPCs]]. These include your parents, siblings, nieces/nephews, children, grandchildren, lovers, and friends you make. With every one of these characters, your character has a \"relationship bar\" that fluctuates randomly as you \"age\" and can be raised (or lowered) by interacting with them. If a relationship bar drops too low, then the family member or friend in question may refuse to interact with you.\n\nYour most important relationship is the one with your lover, with whom you may get married and/or have children. You may encounter potential lovers randomly as you play, in the \"love\" tab, at school, or in your workplace. In some cases, your parents may arrange for you to be married, especially if they have a high \"religiousness\" stat bar. After you date a lover for the first time, even if you break things off with them they will remain in your character's \"ex\" tab, allowing for the ability to get back together.\n\nAny [[pet]]s you have also have a relationship bar with you and are listed alongside other family members and friends of yours with unique interactions, tailored specifically to the type of animal the pet is.\n\n=== Occupations ===\nThere are several types of job occupations that a player may take up within the game. Most full-time jobs require a certain level of education, with some requiring you to attend a specialized school, such as a veterinary school for a [[veterinarian]] occupation. Other jobs may simply require a certain character stat to be at a high level, such as high looks to be a [[Model (person)|model]]. All full-time jobs also require an \"interview\" before you are hired, which is simply a random question you must answer. Alongside full-time jobs, there are also [[Part-time contract|part-time]] jobs which a player may take up alongside a full-time occupation such as school, as well as \"[[freelancer|freelance]]\" jobs that can be taken up at random for quick cash, like [[babysitting]] and [[lawn mowing]].\n\nEach job comes with a certain number of \"hours\" of work. The hours your character works can vary widely, depending on the country and whether the job is full or part-time. In total, it is possible to have a \"schedule\" of up to 70 hours a week in the game, though a high number of hours puts the player's character at risk of contracting [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and ultimately a [[heart attack]].\n\n=== Countries ===\n[[File: Countries in BitLife detailed.png|thumb|right|A world map showing all the playable countries in BitLife]]\nThe game has dozens of different countries for a player to play a life in. Depending on the country, certain activities such as gambling, same-sex marriage, or abortion may be legal or illegal. Cost of living, incomes, and life expectancy vary by country as well, as do tax rates, with some countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] having no taxes at all in-game. Playing in certain countries such as [[Afghanistan]] is also made more dangerous by a small chance that each time you hit the \"age\" button, you can be randomly killed in a sort of \"terrorist\" attack. Another notable difference is that when playing in [[South America]]n countries, llamas will replace horses in the pet store.\n\n[[Puerto Rico]], despite being a territory of the [[United States]], stands as its own independent \"country\" in the game due to differences in common names.\n\nEvery country also comes with a handful of cities one can select to play in, such as [[Warsaw, Poland]]. In two cities ([[Miami]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the United States) in the game, which in real life are host to the headquarters of BitLife's developers, it is possible for your character to get a job working for Candywriter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/01/10/bitlife-life-simulator-how-to-get-the-teammate-ribbon/|title=BitLife Life Simulator: How to Get the Teammate Ribbon|date=2019-01-10|website=Gamebozo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Minigames ===\nWithin the game, there are various [[minigames]] you may encounter when performing certain actions. In the casino, for example, there is a [[blackjack]] minigame you can bet money on. Another example involves the option to solve a puzzle that involves maneuvering around a guard to escape from prison, which changes in difficulty depending upon the security level of the prison the player's character is in. There is also a minigame based on [[Snake (video game genre)|the 1978 game Snake]] which one may play while in prison to start a [[Prison riot|riot]]. When serving in the military, you can occasionally be sent to a random country on \"deployment,\" in which case you must solve a [[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]-type minigame (regardless of the branch) without detonating a [[land mine]].\n\n=== Heirlooms ===\nSince August 2019, the game has featured collectible \"[[heirloom]]\" items, with the ability for a player to collect a new one once per day. Upon receiving an heirloom, it appears alongside a character's \"assets,\" and you may have the options to refurbish it, play with it, sell or donate it. If you continue as a character's child after death, the heirloom is passed down to the child. Over time as you \"age,\" the value of the heirloom will rise exponentially. A list of all heirlooms the player has collected is found in the main menu. It is possible to collect the same heirloom more than once.\n\nCertain heirlooms are rarer than others, with the rarest ones being called \"super rare.\" Notable rare heirlooms include the [[Holy Grail]], a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] gas pump, and [[Donald Trump]]'s golden toilet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-heirlooms-list-guide/|title=BitLife Heirlooms List Guide|date=2019-08-22|website=progameguides.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Generally the rarer an heirloom is, the more monetary value it has, though this is not always the case.\n\n=== Temporary features ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BitLife Santa job occupation.jpg|thumb|left|A \"Santa Claus\" job occupation available during the Christmas season in BitLife]] -->\nThe game has periodically included various temporary features in recognition of certain events. On certain holidays for example, the game has made available temporary job occupations, such as an \"[[elf]]\" occupation in recognition of [[Christmas]],<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eexhtp/so_this_is_bitlife/|title=So this is BitLife...|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> a \"pilgrim\" occupation in recognition of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] where you were employed by the [[Plymouth Colony]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/e30vfh/you_can_be_a_pilgrim_now_screenshot_taken/|title=You can be a pilgrim now!|date=2019-11-28|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> and a \"[[leprechaun]]\" occupation in recognition of [[St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1107672493605699587?s=20|title=Who was feeling lucky yesterday?|date=2019-03-18|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Besides temporary job occupations, the game has also seen the addition of other features for holidays such as various pop-up scenarios, one notable example being the ability to attempt to \"kiss\" your cousin under the [[mistletoe]], which was added during the 2019 Christmas season and required you to hit a confirm button multiple times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eetf8u/so_i_wanted_to_see_what_would_happen_if_i_kissed/|title=So I wanted to see what would happen if I kissed my cousin and it literally asked me 10 times if I was sure|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nAlongside temporary holiday-themed features, since July 2019, the game has also featured pop up scenarios relating to \"current\" events. Notable ones have included an option for your character to pick a side in the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1147963494886567936?s=20|title=Congratulations #USWNT|date=2019-07-07|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> and an option to decide whether or not to join in on the Facebook event to [[Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us|storm Area 51]].\n\n=== Bitizenship ===\nAlthough the game is free to download on both the [[App Store]] and [[Google Play]], in order to access certain features and remove [[advertisements]], the game has the option to purchase \"Bitizenship\" for real world money. Upon doing so, you become a \"Bitizen,\" a title displayed by a badge in the upper right corner of the screen when playing. This is currently a one-time purchase worldwide, although the developers of the game have experimented in select countries with making it a subscription-based purchase in the past. Such experiments were indefinitely terminated after it became widely known to players online that they were taking place at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1179817779970445312?s=21|title=Bitizens! There has been a lot of discussion about the subscription we have been testing in BitLife|date=2019-10-03|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\n== Development and updates ==\nThe game was originally released in September 2018 for iOS only, later being released on Android the following February. Since inception, the game has been updated many times to include large swaths of new features including siblings, pets, rekindling of broken relationships, more available countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Vietnam]], new ribbons, and the option to continue on as a character's children after your character dies, among hordes of other smaller features.\n\nUpdates adding new content are typically released every couple of weeks. Often, much of the new content added is suggested to the developers by users online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitlifeapp.com/|title=BitLife - Life Simulator|date=2019-06-25|website=candywriter.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> The game is owned and developed by Candywriter, LLC, which is based in Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"linked\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadirkhancandywriter|title=Nadir Khan|website=linkedin.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== iOS vs Android versions ===\nAs the [[iOS]] version of the game was released months prior the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version and the developers of the game are native to iOS when it comes to programming,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1138659063615541249?s=21|title=And now for a special message from us to all Android Bitizens|date=2019-06-11|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> the Android version currently lacks numerous features of iOS, such as the ability to make friends or to save multiple lives at the same time in separate game slots. Despite the differences, iOS and Android typically receive updates at the same frequency, and as a result most new features are typically added to iOS first, and then Android later on, though some features have not been added to Android in the same order as they were for iOS.\n\n===Notable iOS updates===\n====Character emoji updates====\nWhen the game was originally released, it lacked any visual representation of your character, showing only the flag of the country you lived in where it now displays your character's emoji. The original version of character emojis added was modeled off of the real [[emoji]] skin colours set, which resulted in \"yellow\" skinned models being controversially used to represent players' characters of [[East Asian]] background. Another update concerning character icons was released later on in May 2019 for iOS (September on Android), which added red-haired characters and [[hijabs]] for female characters in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], while also removing the \"yellow\" skinned models.\n\n====Fame update====\nA major update adding in the ability to become \"famous\" from certain careers along with various fame activities was released for iOS on April 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1121922113382670336|title=Don't let the fame go to your head!|date=2019-04-26|website=Twitter.com|access-date=2019-09-27|language=en}}</ref> Having been released in the wake of the [[2019 college admissions bribery scandal|college admissions scandal]] that had become widely publicized in the previous month, one notable new feature was the ability for your character (when \"famous\") to bribe college admissions officers to get your child into university. The update also dramatically raised the cap on money your character could earn, which had previously been limited to only $2,147,483,647 by the [[2,147,483,647#In computing|32-bit integer limit]]. By upgrading to a 64-bit limit, which has a maximum value of over 9 quintillions, the update effectively removed the limit on the amount of money your character could realistically make.\n\n====Prison life update====\nOn August 8, 2019, a major update that completely overhauled and expanded the [[prison]] aspect of the game was released to iOS users, adding the ability to join a [[prison gang]], take on a prison job, among other features, such as the addition of \"minimum\" and \"[[Supermax prison|maximum]]\" security prisons in place of previously having all prisons be the same security level. [[Capital punishment]] as well as [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]] were also added, ending a previous running gag of players simply being able to rake up an endless number of years in a sentence that could last well beyond an actual lifetime. While the update was generally well-received, sharp criticism ensued over a feature that allowed players to \"[[Prison rape|have their way]]\" with fellow inmates in the game. The feature was later removed in a patch released days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cpwg2v/where_is_have_your_way/|title=Where is have your way?|date=2019-08-13|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAs each fellow inmate in the game (who were viewable via the new \"prison yard\" feature) when you went to prison each displayed what they were \"in for\" on their profile, a lighthearted joke was added by the developers of the update where some inmates were in for \"complaining about BitLife Android,\" which drew some criticism from Android players who saw [[screenshot]]s of the feature online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cnqqcj/this_is_in_a_max_security_prison/|title=This is in a max security prison|date=2019-08-08|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> This feature was also later removed.\n\n====School life update====\nOn September 29, 2019, in celebration of the game's one year anniversary since launch, a major update adding in a host of new activities relating to school was released for iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_D_fzssD2o&t=29s|title=Bitlife School iOS Update|website=Bitlifeapp.online|date=2019-10-18|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1178717262758330368?s=21|title=The school update is out but we are not fully announcing it yet|website=Twitter.com|date=2019-09-30|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> New content included the ability to interact with classmates and teachers, join clubs and sports, a popularity meter and various \"cliques,\" [[fraternities and sororities]] at universities, a revamp of the different levels of schooling with respect to country, among many other features. The update also included new [[Professor|college professor]] and college dean occupations, and (notably) a new feature allowing your character (when a university student) to \"seduce\" and possibly \"[[One-night stand|hook up]]\" with college professors and the dean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1177032850115219456?s=21|title=emoji|date=2019-09-25|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe update was generally received well by players. One major bug that was reported within hours of launch involved a player's character being permanently stuck in \"middle school\" once enrolled, which also allowed for one to date classmates as young as age 10 despite being an adult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dbvku8/middle_school_fo_life_i_dont_know_how_or_why_that/|title=middle school fo life|date=2019-10-01|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> A patch was released several days after the initial update to correct this.\n\n====Office update====\nOn November 18, 2019, another major update adding in a host of new activities relating to jobs was released for iOS. New content included the ability to interact with co-workers and supervisors in a job, such as pranking, starting rumors and hooking up/seducing them. You can also report a co-worker to HR if they misbehave (in case of the military, you can file a grievance). Also you can beg their supervisor to stay if you get fired. (However, this is not available for military because these jobs are much stricter and will be rejected if they attempt to rejoin).\n\n====Friends update====\nOn December 19, 2019, another update was released for iOS.  This update added the ability to make friends and interact with them. Friends can be befriended from classmates, teachers, co-workers or supervisors. The player can also make best friends and enemies. By age 10, the player's character may ask them out. (Due to legal reasons, if the friend is 18 and you are under 18 or vice versa you cannot ask them out). After the character turns 12 years old, the player can go to a concert with their friend. The player can also prank or start a rumor with their friend. On December 25, 2019 in celebration of Christmas, a \"Santa Claus\" career was added exclusively for that day.\n\n====Crime update====\nOn January 17, 2020, a crime-related update was released for iOS. This update added 6 new crimes (bank robbery, behaving delinquently, paying a hitman, stealing a neighbor's mail, shoplifting, and train robbery), bringing the total to 10 from the previous 4. Also, it added the ability to commit a crime as a juvenile (starting at age 8) and go to juvenile detention. Also, escaping from juvenile detention may sometimes cause your parents to send you back.\n\n====Mind & Body Update====\nOn February 8, 2020, another major update was released for iOS. This update included a redesign of some of the game's elements, such as scenarios and people, and also added a \"Surprise me!\" feature, and a new disease system with symptoms. This update also added more mind & body activities, such as reading a book, going on a diet, going on a walk, and practicing martial arts.\n\n===Notable Android updates===\n====\"Ketchup\" updates====\nA series of three updates dubbed \"ketchup\" updates by the developers began to be released in late September 2019 for the Android version of the game, following the hire of a new Android engineer in order to speed up the process of bringing iOS content over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1168585932464742402?s=21|title=Android Bitizens!

A patch was later released on January 8, 2020 as a means to fix this.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1214752453188472833?s=21|title=Special thanks to our Android team who worked tirelessly through the holidays on addressing some seriously frustrating issues including players losing saved games & data.|date=2020-01-07|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>\n\n====\"Prison\" update====\nOn February 12, 2020 the \"Prison\" update for Android users was rolled out.

The Riot mini game was also added. \n\n====\"Criminal\" update====\nOn February 22, 2020 the \"Criminal\" update for Android users was rolled out. Bringing the following features to the Commit a Crime tab: Bank Robbery, Delinquent, Hit Man, Porch Pirate, Shoplifting and Train Robery. The Burglary mini game was also added.\n\n===Other notable updates===\n====2019 Halloween update====\nDuring the week of [[Halloween]] in 2019, a major update was released adding in numerous seasonally themed items, such as \"haunted\" houses containing various supernatural beings like \"[[ghost]]s\" and \"[[demon]]s,\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1187769323890212864?s=20|date=2019-10-25|title=Jeepers!

Other features included a large number of pop-up scenarios, including random encounters with supernatural beings who could induce various health problems or outright death for your character. On the day of Halloween itself, job occupations as a \"[[zombie]],\" a \"[[Witchcraft|witch]],\" and a \"[[vampire]]\" were available for 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1190288301586079744?s=20|title=It's my life mom, I'll be a zombie if I want to gosh!|date=2019-11-01|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dq03ya/jobs_as_vampires_witches_and_zombies_are/|title=Jobs as Vampires, Witches, and Zombies are available tonight!|website=reddit.com|date=2019-10-31|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\nUnlike prior major updates, this update was the first to be released for Android prior to iOS <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1188672885100990465?s=20|title=Android Bitizens!

This was also the first major update to be specifically centered on a holiday. Alongside the Halloween themed features, the update also added eight new playable countries to the iOS version, including [[Hong Kong]];<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1186859997314945024?s=20|title=Monaco is a tax-free principality nestled between the south of France and the next BitLife update|date=2019-10-22|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> while for the Android version it added the \"time machine\" feature,<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.candywriter.bitlife&hl=en_US|title=BitLife - Life Simulator|date=2019-10-31|website=Google Play|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref> which allows players to de-age a character by anywhere from 1 to 20 years for a flat fee of $0.99.\n\nThe developers of the game have stated that the \"haunted\" houses are a permanent addition, as are all non-Halloween themed items from the update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1189213485772742656?s=20|title=After halloween, only the haunted houses will remain (out of the \"spooky\" stuff)|date=2019-10-29|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Purchase of InstLife ===\nOn June 17, 2019, it was announced by the developers of the game <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1140739735121358849?s=21|title=we're happy to announce that InstLife will be merged into BitLife over the coming months|date=2019-06-17|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> that BitLife had acquired another life simulator game named [[InstLife]] by [[InstCoffee]] (its main competitor at the time), and that content from the latter was to be merged into the former over the following months. The acquisition provoked polarizing reactions online, with many praising the merger and the new content it would ultimately bring to BitLife, while others (especially longtime InstLife users) sharply criticized it and accused Candywriter of trying to \"eliminate competition.\"\n\n== Online community ==\nSince the release of the game, the developers of BitLife have operated accounts on a handful of [[social media]] platforms, namely Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. In the game, each account is linked to players via the \"BitLife Community...\" tab. The developers frequently engage with players of the game on their various accounts, often taking and implementing suggestions from users in comments of their posts into the game.\n\n=== Android \"Beta-zin\" program ===\nSince the release of the Android version of the game, the developers of the game have run a [[Google Group]] called BitLife Beta,<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/bitlifebeta|title=BitLife Beta|website=groups.google.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> where registered members of the group can receive updates for the Android version ahead of their full release to all players. The group is used by the developers as a means of testing updates for bugs, with the expectation that members who receive and play the not yet released updates report any bugs they encounter to the developers so they can be eliminated prior to being released to everyone. Members of the group are referred to by the developers as \"Beta-zins,\" and can receive \"Bitizenship\" for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1213661683614273537?s=21|title=Android Beta-zins: a new update (v1.19) awaits you!|date=2020-01-04|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Reddit ===\nAs of January 2020, the r/BitLifeApp community on [[Reddit]] has more than 60,000 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/|title=r/BitLifeApp|date=2020-01-12|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nOverall, the game has received positive ratings.

The first thing the app displays is who the character's parents are, and their occupation, as well as your birthday, [[star sign]], how you were conceived and if you have any siblings or pets. In some cases, your character may have been put up for adoption at birth. To add one year to your character's life, you press the \"Age\" button.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/app-reviews/bitlife-life-simulator|title=BitLife - Life Simulator - App Review|date=2018-12-14|website=Common Sense Media|language=en|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Stages of a life ===\n==== Childhood ====\nBetween ages 0 and 5, you are considered an \"infant.\" Between ages 5 and 8, depending on the country you are playing in, you begin elementary or [[primary school]]. You then advance to the next level of schooling between ages 11 and 14, either \"[[middle school]]\" or \"[[secondary school]]\" depending on the country, and then (in some countries) to a final level of basic schooling by age 16. In middle school or secondary school, the option to join a school club becomes available, as well as the option to join a clique. All-female characters will also have their [[menarche]] randomly between ages 10 and 15. At age 10, it becomes possible to find a date or be asked out on one. Upon reaching age 12, activities to raise the character's four bars (happiness, health, smarts, and looks) start becoming available. Then by age 14, the option to get part-time or freelance jobs becomes available.\n\nDuring childhood, you are largely limited in activities to do. You may be able to ask your parents for money, depending on how generous or rich your parents are as shown by their \"generosity\" or \"money\" bar. Various pop-up scenarios may also appear depending on what age you are at. In your \"infancy\" for example, you may encounter scenarios involving your first words or being taken to get [[vaccine|vaccinated]]. Once you reach school age, scenarios involving activities with friends, your \"first kiss,\" school dances, or other events may appear.\n\n==== Adulthood ====\nBetween ages 15 and 19, depending on the country, you can take your [[driving test]], which is simply a test asking what a road sign means, contrary to real life. If you pass, you may receive a car from your parents depending on their generosity. After you graduate from secondary school, you can decide whether to continue your education, take time off, acquire a full-time occupation, or enlist in the military.\n\nAt age 18, the option to buy a house becomes available, as do all remaining activities such as clubbing, vacationing, [[emigration]], various crime options such as [[burglary]], and gambling. As you age through adulthood, random pop up scenarios will appear as you age requiring decisions that can have major effects on your life. Such scenarios generally involve your career, your health, your spouse and/or children (if you have any), your friends, as well as potential random encounters such as a [[Homelessness|homeless]] person asking for money, being a witness to a crime, having to decide whether to risk your life to save another, among others.\n\nAfter working for a certain number of years, the option to retire becomes available (the exact age of which varies by country). Many occupations will force you into [[retirement]] after a certain point, though in most full time occupations you will receive a [[pension]] after retiring.\n\n==== Death ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife app death and gravestone.jpg|thumb|right|A gravestone with a ribbon on its upper left corner in BitLife]] -->\nIf you live your life without many harming consequences, you will die of natural causes. Generally, if you keep your health bar close to or at 100%, you will most likely live beyond [[Centenarian|100 years]], contrary to real life where few people live for that long. At the end of each life you are assigned a ribbon, based on how you lived your life. For example, \"Fertile\" ribbons are assigned for having lots of children. Some ribbons are easy to get while others are far more difficult to obtain. Currently, there are a total of 30 ribbons.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-ribbons-list-guide/|title=BitLife Ribbons List Guide|date=2019-06-13|website=progameguides.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> All previous lives you lived are viewable via a \"[[cemetery]]\". Many players believe that 124 is the maximum age in Bitlife, but it is possible to live much longer. \n\nAfter you die, you have the option of starting a new life (either customized or random), replaying the same character again with the option to make different choices, or continuing a \"legacy\" as your character's child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/03/27/bitlife-fame-live-on-as-your-child-and-everything-else-to-expect/|title=BitLife Update|date=2019-03-27|website=gamebozo.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Character stats ===\nAt the bottom of the screen when playing are four bars showing the happiness, health, smarts, and looks of one's character between 0 and 100%. Each bar will randomly fluctuate each time the \"age\" button is pressed. Various activities can be performed to either raise or lower each of the bars, such as going to the gym to raise looks. The levels of a player's bars have major impacts on the lives of their characters. High smarts can allow one's character to receive a [[scholarship]] to university for example, while by contrast, low smarts can result in one's application to university being rejected altogether.\n\nCertain occupations in the game (such as an acting job) can make one become \"famous,\" at which point a fifth bar showing your level of \"fame\" is shown. If you fail to keep the fame bar above 0%, then the bar disappears and you are no longer \"famous.\" There is also another major bar concerning the character's \"[[karma]],\" which fluctuates depending on the nature of actions you take for good or bad. While the bar is never seen as one of the main bars at the bottom of the screen during gameplay, it can still have an effect on your character's life, and it is shown on your character's gravestone after death.\n\n=== Relationships ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File: BitLife App relationships tab.jpeg|thumb|left|An example of the relationships tab in BitLife, showing a character's wife and siblings]] -->\nA core component of the game is \"relationships\" with [[NPCs]]. These include your parents, siblings, nieces/nephews, children, grandchildren, lovers, and friends you make. With every one of these characters, your character has a \"relationship bar\" that fluctuates randomly as you \"age\" and can be raised (or lowered) by interacting with them. If a relationship bar drops too low, then the family member or friend in question may refuse to interact with you.\n\nYour most important relationship is the one with your lover, with whom you may get married and/or have children. You may encounter potential lovers randomly as you play, in the \"love\" tab, at school, or in your workplace. In some cases, your parents may arrange for you to be married, especially if they have a high \"religiousness\" stat bar. After you date a lover for the first time, even if you break things off with them they will remain in your character's \"ex\" tab, allowing for the ability to get back together.\n\nAny [[pet]]s you have also have a relationship bar with you and are listed alongside other family members and friends of yours with unique interactions, tailored specifically to the type of animal the pet is.\n\n=== Occupations ===\nThere are several types of job occupations that a player may take up within the game. Most full-time jobs require a certain level of education, with some requiring you to attend a specialized school, such as a veterinary school for a [[veterinarian]] occupation. Other jobs may simply require a certain character stat to be at a high level, such as high looks to be a [[Model (person)|model]]. All full-time jobs also require an \"interview\" before you are hired, which is simply a random question you must answer. Alongside full-time jobs, there are also [[Part-time contract|part-time]] jobs which a player may take up alongside a full-time occupation such as school, as well as \"[[freelancer|freelance]]\" jobs that can be taken up at random for quick cash, like [[babysitting]] and [[lawn mowing]].\n\nEach job comes with a certain number of \"hours\" of work. The hours your character works can vary widely, depending on the country and whether the job is full or part-time. In total, it is possible to have a \"schedule\" of up to 70 hours a week in the game, though a high number of hours puts the player's character at risk of contracting [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and ultimately a [[heart attack]].\n\n=== Countries ===\n[[File: Countries in BitLife detailed.png|thumb|right|A world map showing all the playable countries in BitLife]]\nThe game has dozens of different countries for a player to play a life in. Depending on the country, certain activities such as gambling, same-sex marriage, or abortion may be legal or illegal. Cost of living, incomes, and life expectancy vary by country as well, as do tax rates, with some countries like [[Saudi Arabia]] having no taxes at all in-game. Playing in certain countries such as [[Afghanistan]] is also made more dangerous by a small chance that each time you hit the \"age\" button, you can be randomly killed in a sort of \"terrorist\" attack. Another notable difference is that when playing in [[South America]]n countries, llamas will replace horses in the pet store.\n\n[[Puerto Rico]], despite being a territory of the [[United States]], stands as its own independent \"country\" in the game due to differences in common names.\n\nEvery country also comes with a handful of cities one can select to play in, such as [[Warsaw, Poland]]. In two cities ([[Miami]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the United States) in the game, which in real life are host to the headquarters of BitLife's developers, it is possible for your character to get a job working for Candywriter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamezebo.com/2019/01/10/bitlife-life-simulator-how-to-get-the-teammate-ribbon/|title=BitLife Life Simulator: How to Get the Teammate Ribbon|date=2019-01-10|website=Gamebozo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Minigames ===\nWithin the game, there are various [[minigames]] you may encounter when performing certain actions. In the casino, for example, there is a [[blackjack]] minigame you can bet money on. Another example involves the option to solve a puzzle that involves maneuvering around a guard to escape from prison, which changes in difficulty depending upon the security level of the prison the player's character is in. There is also a minigame based on [[Snake (video game genre)|the 1978 game Snake]] which one may play while in prison to start a [[Prison riot|riot]]. When serving in the military, you can occasionally be sent to a random country on \"deployment,\" in which case you must solve a [[Minesweeper (video game)|Minesweeper]]-type minigame (regardless of the branch) without detonating a [[land mine]].\n\n=== Heirlooms ===\nSince August 2019, the game has featured collectible \"[[heirloom]]\" items, with the ability for a player to collect a new one once per day. Upon receiving an heirloom, it appears alongside a character's \"assets,\" and you may have the options to refurbish it, play with it, sell or donate it. If you continue as a character's child after death, the heirloom is passed down to the child. Over time as you \"age,\" the value of the heirloom will rise exponentially. A list of all heirlooms the player has collected is found in the main menu. It is possible to collect the same heirloom more than once.\n\nCertain heirlooms are rarer than others, with the rarest ones being called \"super rare.\" Notable rare heirlooms include the [[Holy Grail]], a [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] gas pump, and [[Donald Trump]]'s golden toilet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progameguides.com/mobile/bitlife-heirlooms-list-guide/|title=BitLife Heirlooms List Guide|date=2019-08-22|website=progameguides.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Generally the rarer an heirloom is, the more monetary value it has, though this is not always the case.\n\n=== Temporary features ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BitLife Santa job occupation.jpg|thumb|left|A \"Santa Claus\" job occupation available during the Christmas season in BitLife]] -->\nThe game has periodically included various temporary features in recognition of certain events. On certain holidays for example, the game has made available temporary job occupations, such as an \"[[elf]]\" occupation in recognition of [[Christmas]],<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eexhtp/so_this_is_bitlife/|title=So this is BitLife...|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref> a \"pilgrim\" occupation in recognition of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] where you were employed by the [[Plymouth Colony]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/e30vfh/you_can_be_a_pilgrim_now_screenshot_taken/|title=You can be a pilgrim now!|date=2019-11-28|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> and a \"[[leprechaun]]\" occupation in recognition of [[St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1107672493605699587?s=20|title=Who was feeling lucky yesterday?|date=2019-03-18|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> Besides temporary job occupations, the game has also seen the addition of other features for holidays such as various pop-up scenarios, one notable example being the ability to attempt to \"kiss\" your cousin under the [[mistletoe]], which was added during the 2019 Christmas season and required you to hit a confirm button multiple times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/eetf8u/so_i_wanted_to_see_what_would_happen_if_i_kissed/|title=So I wanted to see what would happen if I kissed my cousin and it literally asked me 10 times if I was sure|date=2019-12-23|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23}}</ref>\n\nAlongside temporary holiday-themed features, since July 2019, the game has also featured pop up scenarios relating to \"current\" events. Notable ones have included an option for your character to pick a side in the [[2019 FIFA Women's World Cup]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1147963494886567936?s=20|title=Congratulations #USWNT|date=2019-07-07|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref> and an option to decide whether or not to join in on the Facebook event to [[Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us|storm Area 51]].\n\n=== Bitizenship ===\nAlthough the game is free to download on both the [[App Store]] and [[Google Play]], in order to access certain features and remove [[advertisements]], the game has the option to purchase \"Bitizenship\" for real world money. Upon doing so, you become a \"Bitizen,\" a title displayed by a badge in the upper right corner of the screen when playing. This is currently a one-time purchase worldwide, although the developers of the game have experimented in select countries with making it a subscription-based purchase in the past. Such experiments were indefinitely terminated after it became widely known to players online that they were taking place at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1179817779970445312?s=21|title=Bitizens! There has been a lot of discussion about the subscription we have been testing in BitLife|date=2019-10-03|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-03}}</ref>\n\n== Development and updates ==\nThe game was originally released in September 2018 for iOS only, later being released on Android the following February. Since inception, the game has been updated many times to include large swaths of new features including siblings, pets, rekindling of broken relationships, more available countries such as [[Switzerland]] and [[Vietnam]], new ribbons, and the option to continue on as a character's children after your character dies, among hordes of other smaller features.\n\nUpdates adding new content are typically released every couple of weeks. Often, much of the new content added is suggested to the developers by users online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitlifeapp.com/|title=BitLife - Life Simulator|date=2019-06-25|website=candywriter.net|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> The game is owned and developed by Candywriter, LLC, which is based in Miami, Florida.<ref name=\"linked\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadirkhancandywriter|title=Nadir Khan|website=linkedin.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-23|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n=== iOS vs Android versions ===\nAs the [[iOS]] version of the game was released months prior the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version and the developers of the game are native to iOS when it comes to programming,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1138659063615541249?s=21|title=And now for a special message from us to all Android Bitizens|date=2019-06-11|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> the Android version currently lacks numerous features of iOS, such as the ability to make friends or to save multiple lives at the same time in separate game slots. Despite the differences, iOS and Android typically receive updates at the same frequency, and as a result most new features are typically added to iOS first, and then Android later on, though some features have not been added to Android in the same order as they were for iOS.\n\n===Notable iOS updates===\n====Character emoji updates====\nWhen the game was originally released, it lacked any visual representation of your character, showing only the flag of the country you lived in where it now displays your character's emoji. The original version of character emojis added was modeled off of the real [[emoji]] skin colours set, which resulted in \"yellow\" skinned models being controversially used to represent players' characters of [[East Asian]] background. Another update concerning character icons was released later on in May 2019 for iOS (September on Android), which added red-haired characters and [[hijabs]] for female characters in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], while also removing the \"yellow\" skinned models.\n\n====Fame update====\nA major update adding in the ability to become \"famous\" from certain careers along with various fame activities was released for iOS on April 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1121922113382670336|title=Don't let the fame go to your head!|date=2019-04-26|website=Twitter.com|access-date=2019-09-27|language=en}}</ref> Having been released in the wake of the [[2019 college admissions bribery scandal|college admissions scandal]] that had become widely publicized in the previous month, one notable new feature was the ability for your character (when \"famous\") to bribe college admissions officers to get your child into university. The update also dramatically raised the cap on money your character could earn, which had previously been limited to only $2,147,483,647 by the [[2,147,483,647#In computing|32-bit integer limit]]. By upgrading to a 64-bit limit, which has a maximum value of over 9 quintillions, the update effectively removed the limit on the amount of money your character could realistically make.\n\n====Prison life update====\nOn August 8, 2019, a major update that completely overhauled and expanded the [[prison]] aspect of the game was released to iOS users, adding the ability to join a [[prison gang]], take on a prison job, among other features, such as the addition of \"minimum\" and \"[[Supermax prison|maximum]]\" security prisons in place of previously having all prisons be the same security level. [[Capital punishment]] as well as [[Life imprisonment|life sentences]] were also added, ending a previous running gag of players simply being able to rake up an endless number of years in a sentence that could last well beyond an actual lifetime. While the update was generally well-received, sharp criticism ensued over a feature that allowed players to \"[[Prison rape|have their way]]\" with fellow inmates in the game. The feature was later removed in a patch released days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cpwg2v/where_is_have_your_way/|title=Where is have your way?|date=2019-08-13|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAs each fellow inmate in the game (who were viewable via the new \"prison yard\" feature) when you went to prison each displayed what they were \"in for\" on their profile, a lighthearted joke was added by the developers of the update where some inmates were in for \"complaining about BitLife Android,\" which drew some criticism from Android players who saw [[screenshot]]s of the feature online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/cnqqcj/this_is_in_a_max_security_prison/|title=This is in a max security prison|date=2019-08-08|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-13}}</ref> This feature was also later removed.\n\n====School life update====\nOn September 29, 2019, in celebration of the game's one year anniversary since launch, a major update adding in a host of new activities relating to school was released for iOS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_D_fzssD2o&t=29s|title=Bitlife School iOS Update|website=Bitlifeapp.online|date=2019-10-18|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1178717262758330368?s=21|title=The school update is out but we are not fully announcing it yet|website=Twitter.com|date=2019-09-30|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> New content included the ability to interact with classmates and teachers, join clubs and sports, a popularity meter and various \"cliques,\" [[fraternities and sororities]] at universities, a revamp of the different levels of schooling with respect to country, among many other features. The update also included new [[Professor|college professor]] and college dean occupations, and (notably) a new feature allowing your character (when a university student) to \"seduce\" and possibly \"[[One-night stand|hook up]]\" with college professors and the dean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1177032850115219456?s=21|title=emoji|date=2019-09-25|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe update was generally received well by players. One major bug that was reported within hours of launch involved a player's character being permanently stuck in \"middle school\" once enrolled, which also allowed for one to date classmates as young as age 10 despite being an adult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dbvku8/middle_school_fo_life_i_dont_know_how_or_why_that/|title=middle school fo life|date=2019-10-01|website=reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> A patch was released several days after the initial update to correct this.\n\n====Office update====\nOn November 18, 2019, another major update adding in a host of new activities relating to jobs was released for iOS. New content included the ability to interact with co-workers and supervisors in a job, such as pranking, starting rumors and hooking up/seducing them. You can also report a co-worker to HR if they misbehave (in case of the military, you can file a grievance). Also you can beg their supervisor to stay if you get fired. (However, this is not available for military because these jobs are much stricter and will be rejected if they attempt to rejoin).\n\n====Friends update====\nOn December 19, 2019, another update was released for iOS.  This update added the ability to make friends and interact with them. Friends can be befriended from classmates, teachers, co-workers or supervisors. The player can also make best friends and enemies. By age 10, the player's character may ask them out. (Due to legal reasons, if the friend is 18 and you are under 18 or vice versa you cannot ask them out). After the character turns 12 years old, the player can go to a concert with their friend. The player can also prank or start a rumor with their friend. On December 25, 2019 in celebration of Christmas, a \"Santa Claus\" career was added exclusively for that day.\n\n====Crime update====\nOn January 17, 2020, a crime-related update was released for iOS. This update added 6 new crimes (bank robbery, behaving delinquently, paying a hitman, stealing a neighbor's mail, shoplifting, and train robbery), bringing the total to 10 from the previous 4. Also, it added the ability to commit a crime as a juvenile (starting at age 8) and go to juvenile detention. Also, escaping from juvenile detention may sometimes cause your parents to send you back.\n\n====Mind & Body Update====\nOn February 8, 2020, another major update was released for iOS. This update included a redesign of some of the game's elements, such as scenarios and people, and also added a \"Surprise me!\" feature, and a new disease system with symptoms. This update also added more mind & body activities, such as reading a book, going on a diet, going on a walk, and practicing martial arts.\n\n===Notable Android updates===\n====\"Ketchup\" updates====\nA series of three updates dubbed \"ketchup\" updates by the developers began to be released in late September 2019 for the Android version of the game, following the hire of a new Android engineer in order to speed up the process of bringing iOS content over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1168585932464742402?s=21|title=Android Bitizens!

The Riot mini game was also added. \n\n====\"Criminal\" update====\nOn February 22, 2020 the \"Criminal\" update for Android users was rolled out. Bringing the following features to the Commit a Crime tab: Bank Robbery, Delinquent, Hit Man, Porch Pirate, Shoplifting and Train Robery. The Burglary mini game was also added.\n\n===Other notable updates===\n====2019 Halloween update====\nDuring the week of [[Halloween]] in 2019, a major update was released adding in numerous seasonally themed items, such as \"haunted\" houses containing various supernatural beings like \"[[ghost]]s\" and \"[[demon]]s,\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1187769323890212864?s=20|date=2019-10-25|title=Jeepers!

Other features included a large number of pop-up scenarios, including random encounters with supernatural beings who could induce various health problems or outright death for your character. On the day of Halloween itself, job occupations as a \"[[zombie]],\" a \"[[Witchcraft|witch]],\" and a \"[[vampire]]\" were available for 24 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1190288301586079744?s=20|title=It's my life mom, I'll be a zombie if I want to gosh!|date=2019-11-01|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/comments/dq03ya/jobs_as_vampires_witches_and_zombies_are/|title=Jobs as Vampires, Witches, and Zombies are available tonight!|website=reddit.com|date=2019-10-31|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\nUnlike prior major updates, this update was the first to be released for Android prior to iOS <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BitLifeApp/status/1188672885100990465?s=20|title=Android Bitizens!

The acquisition provoked polarizing reactions online, with many praising the merger and the new content it would ultimately bring to BitLife, while others (especially longtime InstLife users) sharply criticized it and accused Candywriter of trying to \"eliminate competition.\"\n\n== Online community ==\nSince the release of the game, the developers of BitLife have operated accounts on a handful of [[social media]] platforms, namely Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit. In the game, each account is linked to players via the \"BitLife Community...\" tab. The developers frequently engage with players of the game on their various accounts, often taking and implementing suggestions from users in comments of their posts into the game.\n\n=== Android \"Beta-zin\" program ===\nSince the release of the Android version of the game, the developers of the game have run a [[Google Group]] called BitLife Beta,<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!forum/bitlifebeta|title=BitLife Beta|website=groups.google.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> where registered members of the group can receive updates for the Android version ahead of their full release to all players. The group is used by the developers as a means of testing updates for bugs, with the expectation that members who receive and play the not yet released updates report any bugs they encounter to the developers so they can be eliminated prior to being released to everyone. Members of the group are referred to by the developers as \"Beta-zins,\" and can receive \"Bitizenship\" for free.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bitlifeapp/status/1213661683614273537?s=21|title=Android Beta-zins: a new update (v1.19) awaits you!|date=2020-01-04|website=Twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Reddit ===\nAs of January 2020, the r/BitLifeApp community on [[Reddit]] has more than 60,000 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/BitLifeApp/|title=r/BitLifeApp|date=2020-01-12|website=Reddit.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nOverall, the game has received positive ratings.

He was executive editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' from 2001 until he left in 2003 in the wake of the scandal related to reporting by [[Jayson Blair]]. In 2008, Raines became a contributing editor for ''[[Cond\u00e9 Nast Portfolio]]'', writing the magazine's media column.<ref>{{cite web |title=Howell Raines |work=Encyclopedia of Alabama |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1891}}</ref> After beginning his journalism career working for southern newspapers, he joined the Times in 1978, as a national correspondent based in Atlanta. His positions included political correspondent and bureau chief in Atlanta and Washington, DC, before joining the New York City staff in 1993.\n\nRaines has also published a novel, two memoirs, and an oral history of the civil rights movement.\n\n==Early life and career==\nRaines was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He earned a bachelor's degree from [[Birmingham-Southern College]] in 1964 and a master's degree in English from the [[University of Alabama]] in 1973. In September 1964, Raines began his newspaper career as a reporter for the ''Birmingham Post-Herald'' in Alabama. He also reported for WBRC-TV in Birmingham.\n\nAfter a year as a reporter at the ''Birmingham News'', in 1971 Raines was selected as political editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]''. In 1976 he left that post to become political editor at the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reporting scandal drives out ''New York Times'' editors |first=Eric |last=Deggans |work=St. Petersburg Times |date=June 6, 2003 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/06/06/Worldandnation/Reporting_scandal_dri.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==''The New York Times''==\nRaines joined ''The New York Times'' in 1978, as a national correspondent based in [[Atlanta]]. By 1979, Raines was promoted to Atlanta's bureau chief, a position he held until 1981, when he became a national political correspondent.\n\nBy the next year, Raines had advanced to become a [[White House]] correspondent for ''The Times''. He progressed to management in 1985, becoming deputy Washington editor. In 1987, Raines transferred to [[London]] and worked as the newspaper's London bureau chief. The next year, he returned to [[Washington D.C.]] to become the city's bureau chief.\n\nIn 1992, Raines published an essay, \"Grady's Gift\", about his childhood in Alabama. He fondly described the family's black housekeeper.<ref>{{cite news|date=December 1, 1991|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/01/magazine/grady-s-gift.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Grady's Gift |first=Howell |last=Raines |work=The New York Times}}</ref> His memoir was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Thousand Acres' Wins Fiction as 21 Pulitzer Prizes Are Given |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/04/05/specials/smiley-pulitzer.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993 Raines moved to New York City as the ''Times'' editorial page editor, a position he held for eight years. The aggressive, colloquial style of his editorials, especially those critical of President [[Bill Clinton]] and his administration, drew widespread notice and a share of criticism. His work marked a departure from the measured tone for which ''Times'' editorials had been known.<ref>{{cite web |title=Howlin' Howell |first=Edwin |last=Diamond |work=New York |date=August 30, 1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Howell Raines Question |first=Peter J. |last=Boyer |work=The New Yorker |date=August 22, 1994}}</ref>\n\nRaines was appointed Executive Editor of ''The Times'' in September 2001, serving until May 2003. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1891|title=Howell Raines|website=Encyclopedia of Alabama|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> At that time, controversy generated by the reporting scandal related to [[Jayson Blair]] led to his dismissal. A ''Times'' internal investigation revealed that 36 of the 73 national stories Blair filed with the paper over a six-month period were marred by errors, false datelines or evidence of plagiarism. Raines was faulted for continuing to publish Blair months after the paper's metro editor, Jonathan Landman, sent him a memo urging him \"to stop Jayson from writing for ''The Times''.

Raines stood by his account and implied that Sulzberger was retreating from the position which he said he and the owner shared at the time of his promotion.\n\n<blockquote>In the only interview I have given on the Jayson Blair affair, I spoke on the Charlie Rose show of the resistance I had encountered as a 'change agent' who was handpicked by the publisher to confront the newsroom's lethargy and complacency.
