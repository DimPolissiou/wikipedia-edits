The club is based at McCarthy Homes Oval, 41 Chelmer st, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]],<ref name=\"fullpointsfooty.net\">http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/western_magpies.htm Sherwood Magpies</ref> at the same grounds as the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]] and fields a team in the [[AFLQ]] senior, reserve, under 18 and women's grade competitions. The Western Magpies AFC provides a focal point for talented players from all of the junior clubs that lie within [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane's]] western suburbs (Collingwood Park, Ferny Grove, Forest Lake, Kenmore, Jindalee, Moorooka, Sherwood, Southern Redbacks, Springfield Lakes, Wests Juniors, Yeronga). The club aims to provide a pathway into the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] for players from these junior clubs, develop the network of surrounding senior and junior [[Australian rules football]] clubs, and provide a fun, friendly, family oriented hub for local football in the western suburbs.<ref>http://www.sherwoodafc.com/inside.htm A Brief History of the Black & White</ref> The '''Sherwood Magpies Australian Football Club''' and [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]] are sponsored by Tradelink (major sponsor), [[Hog's Breath Cafe]] and Cleanway (secondary sponsors).<ref>http://www.sherwoodafc.com/sponsors.htm Magpie Sponsors</ref>\n\nThere have been a number of senior clubs ([[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa]], [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]], [[Sherwood Australian Football Club|Sherwood]], and [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club|West Brisbane]]) based within the western suburbs of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]] that have competed in the highest division of local football. These clubs were all forced out of existence over time, and the Sherwood Magpies AFC resembles a culmination of the area's historical and continuing football presence and strength. The current club has been playing in Division Two of the [[AFL Queensland State League]] since 2004, but is being promoted into Division One from the commencement of the 2009 season under the guidance of President Brian Knight, Senior Coach Paul Grentell and Club Development Manager Anthony McDonald.<ref>http://www.sportingpulse.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-109-34766-0-0&sID=56344&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=6786642 Anthony McDonald Joins Magpies</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Sherwood Magpies Australian Football Club was formed as the State League representative of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs, incorporating the history of the previous clubs to compete in the [[AFL Queensland State League]].\n\n===Taringa AFC===\nA '''Taringa Football Club''' competed in the QFL (an early form of the [[AFL Queensland State League]]) in the 1920 season. The club only appeared in the State competition for that single season, but resurfaced by entering the newly titled [[QANFL]] in 1931. The club's emblem was the [[bulldog]], and the club colours were maroon and white. Despite making it to five grand finals '''Taringa''' was unable to secure a premiership, but it produced two [[De Little Medal]]ists in C.Vigden (1939) and Doug Pittard (1940). '''Taringa''' changed its name to the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club]] in 1946.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/western_districts.htm Western Districts</ref>\n\n===Western Districts AFC===\nThe '''Western Districts Australian Football Club''' came into existence in 1946 when the [[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa Football Club]] changed its name to incorporate the whole of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs. '''Western Districts''' kept the emblem (the [[bulldog]]) and colours (maroon and white) of [[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa]] and were originally based at Oakman Park, [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]] but moved to Chelmer Oval, Queenscroft st, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] in 1971. The club continued to grow steadily, finishing in third place in 1951, and losing to [[Mayne Australian Football Club|Mayne]] by merely one point in the 1952 grand final. The club learned from their narrow loss, defeating Windsor and Sandgate respectively in the 1953 and 1954 grand finals to secure their first and second premierships. '''Western Districts''' were unable to qualify for the finals between the years of 1956 and 1962, before suffering consecutive grand final losses at the hands of [[Mayne Australian Football Club|Mayne]] in 1966 and 1967. The club's next, and last ever, grand final appearances came consecutively in 1977, 1978 and 1979. The '''Bulldogs''' narrowly won premierships by 5 points against Wilston Grange in 1977, and by 4 points against [[Zillmere Eagles Australian Football Club|Windsor/Zillmere]] in 1978, before losing what would be their last grand final appearance to [[Sandgate Australian Football Club|Sandgate]] in 1979. '''Western Districts''' eventually merged with [[Sherwood Australian Football Club|Sherwood]] in 1991 to form the [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club]]. The '''Western Districts Australian Football Club''' had a number of very successful players in their midst throughout their existence. Doug Pittard won two [[Grogan Medal]]s during his time at the club to go with his [[De Little Medal]] he won with [[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa]], and played a handful of games for the [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]] reserves. Owen Backwell was also a dual [[Grogan Medal]]ist for the '''Bulldogs''', who topped the league goal kicking in 1977, played over 300 games for the club, including the 1977 and 1978 premierships, and had a short stint with the [[Fitzroy Football Club]]. Ray Hughson topped the league goal kicking while playing for [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]] a remarkable six times (1958, 1959, 1962\u201365), while [[Gavin Crosisca]] (over 250 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] games for [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]), Ray Smith (over 100 [[Australian Football League|VFL]] games for [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]), and Gary Shaw ([[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and the [[Brisbane Bears]], and still coaches at the Western Magpies) all went on to play in the [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>http://www.footypedia.com/00000517.htm Western Districts Football Club</ref>\n\n===Sherwood AFC===\nThe '''Sherwood Australian Football Club''' developed out of the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]], which was formed in 1956. As the junior club grew in size, there was a desire to have a direct senior team for the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club|Sherwood JAFC]], which saw the '''Sherwood AFC''' formed to compete in the Metropolitan Division of the [[AFL Queensland State League|QAFL]]. The club was based at Chelmer Oval, 41 Chelmer st, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]], directly next to the Queenscroft st ground of the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]], which is the current home of the Western Magpies. The club took on the black and white stripes of their junior club as well as the emblem of the [[magpie]], both of which are still thoroughly attached to the club to the current day thanks to the winning of a coin toss with [[Southport Australian Football Club|Southport]] (who had previously had the same colours and emblem) upon the entry of both clubs to the [[AFL Queensland State League|QAFL]] in 1983. This occurred after '''Sherwood''' managed to work their way up through the divisions, after winning eight first division flags in a row they earned their 1983 promotion into the [[AFL Queensland State League|QAFL]]. In 1991 '''Sherwood AFC''' merged with the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]] to form the [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club]], which could be a single footballing force in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs. Players of particular note for the '''Sherwood AFC''' include [[John Rantall]], the 336 game [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]], [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] [[Australian Football League|VFL]] veteran who coached '''Sherwood''' in their debut season in the [[QAFL]], and 1983 [[Grogan Medal]] winner, Bill Pierce, whom the Western Magpies best and fairest is named after.<ref name=\"sherwoodafc.com\">http://www.sherwoodafc.com/inside.htm A Brief History Of The Black & White</ref>\n\n===West Brisbane AFC===\nA merger between the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts AFC]] and the [[Sherwood Australian Football Club|Sherwood AFC]] in 1991 saw a single senior force in the western suburbs formed in the form of the '''West Brisbane Australian Football Club'''. The merged club adopted the maroon and white colours of [Western Districts Australian Football Club] with the jersey design of the Port Adelaide Magpies football club, played out of Chelmer Oval, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] and were nicknamed The '''Warriors'''. The club was successful in winning a premiership in the 1996 season, comfortably defeating [[Mt Gravatt Australian Football Club|Mt Gravatt]] 17.10 (112) to 8.10 (58), with Corey Lambert claiming that year's [[Grogan Medal]]. Unfortunately, due to financial reasons '''West Brisbane''' were unable to compete in the following year's competition and had a few seasons out of the State competition before returning as the re-branded Western Magpies Australian Football Club in 2001.<ref name=\"fullpointsfooty.net\" /><ref>http://www.footypedia.com/00000512.htm West Brisbane Football Club</ref>\n\n===The Current Club===\n\nThe [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club]] that disbanded at the end of 1997 reformed in 1999 under the name of the Western Magpies Australian Football Club and in 2001 re-entered the [[QAFL]]<ref name=\"fullpointsfooty.net\" /> which had merged with its [[Gold Coast, Australia|Gold Coast]] equivalent to become the [[AFL Queensland State League]]. After four years of mediocre on-field performances and financial struggles, when the [[AFL Queensland|AFLQ]] decided to undertake a major re-shuffling of the leagues in 2004 to create a two tier [[AFL Queensland|State League]] competition the Western Magpies were relegated to the newly created Division Two. Paul Grentell was appointed the club's senior coach, and the '''Magpies''' set about strengthening every aspect of the football club in the hopes of returning to Division One. The senior team narrowly missed out on a place in the 2005 Division Two grand final, but were successful in reaching the grand final in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Western Magpies defeated the [[Noosa Australian Football Club|Noosa Tigers]] in the 2006 decider, before losing to the [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach Currumbin Lions]] in the final game of 2007. Despite losing the 2007 grand final, it was announced at the end of that year that the Western Magpies would be returning to Division One of the [[AFL Queensland State League|State League]] in 2009. The Magpies rebounded from their 2007 loss to [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach]] to end the Lions 38-game winning streak at their [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] home ground during the 2008 home and away season, and followed this up by defeating the Lions again in a thrilling grand final.<ref name=\"sportingpulse.com\">http://www.sportingpulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=1-109-34766-0-0&sID=56344&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=6798374&sectionID=56344 Western Magpies Win 2008 Div 2 Premiership</ref> This capped the club's time in Division Two off nicely, leaving them with two premierships (2006 & 2008) and three grand final appearances (2006\u20132008) from their four years in lower division. During this four-year period, the reserves team played in the Division Two grand final (each year 2005\u20132008), winning premierships in 2005, 2006 and 2007, while the under 18 and women's teams both continued to participate in Division One of their competitions.\n\nAs of the beginning of Season 2020 in the Queensland Australian Football League\n\n==Links To Other Local Clubs==\nThe Western Magpies enjoy close relationships with all of the junior and senior clubs within [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs in their role as the focal point for football ball in the area. All junior clubs within the area are encouraged to promote the Western Magpies as the pathway into the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] for young players in the western suburbs. In a similar way, the club also relates closely with the surrounding senior clubs, as they also provide a pathway for players to play at a standard of football that best suits their ability.<ref name=\"sherwoodafc.com\" /> In particular, the Western Magpies work closely with the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]] and the [[Kenmore Australian Football Club]].

The two clubs are both affiliated with the Sherwood Football social club, and Sherwood Junior AFC acts as one of the many local feeder clubs to the Western Magpies, with many juniors moving up from the Sherwood juniors into the senior club. The '''Sherwood Junior AFC''''s aim is to produce quality players to graduate into football with the Western Magpies, and eventually to the [[Australian Football League|AFL]].<ref name=\"sherwoodafc.com\" /> The official website of the '''Sherwood Junior AFC''' is located at [http://www.sherwoodafc.com/ www.sherwoodafc.com].\n\n===Kenmore AFC===\nThe [[Kenmore Australian Football Club]] are a separate club who play in the [http://www.aflq.com.au/index.php?id=911 QFA South competition].[[Kenmore Australian Football Club|The Kenmore Bears]] and the Western Magpies enjoy a close relationship that sees players transfer between the two clubs in order to play the best possible level of football.

In 2008 these grounds were closed for redevelopment, and [[Kenmore Australian Football Club|Kenmore]] played their all of their home games for that season on the Western Magpies field.<ref>http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-4711-0-0-0&sID=56333&articleID=5033895&news_task=DETAIL New Alliance Ensures Bright Future</ref> The official website of the [[Kenmore Australian Football Club|Kenmore Bears]] is located at [http://www.sportingpulse.com/club_info.cgi?sportid=4&client=1-109-37543-0-0 www.kenmore.aflq.com.au].\n\n==2008 season==\nThe Western Magpies Australian Football Club competed in the Pineapple Hotel Cup in 2008, the Division Two competition of the [[AFL Queensland State League]]. The president for 2008 was Matthew Vowles, who entered the position in 2007, and the captain Chris Mihalopolous, a junior of the '''Sherwood Junior AFC'''. Paul Grentell, who took over the position as senior coach in 2004, was to coach the senior team in 2008, assisted by Peter McClennan (reserves coach), Hadyn Dowley, Quentin Johnson and Brian Millar. After being defeated by the [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club]] in the 2007 grand final, the Western Magpies went through the 2008 home and away season with fifteen wins out of eighteen games to sit second on the ladder to the [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach Currumbin Lions]] before the commencement of the finals series.<ref>http://www.sportingpulse.com/team_info.cgi?c=1-109-34766-65372-6259025&a=ROUND Pineapple Hotel Cup Seniors Results 2008</ref> The Magpies's only losses were against [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach Currumbin]] (Round 1), [[Coolangatta Tweed Heads Football Club|Coolangatta Tweed Head]] (Round 2) and [[Burleigh Football Club|Burleigh]] (Round 16), and one of the most memorable victories came in Round 14, when the Magpies defeated the [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach Currumbin Lions]] 18.8 (116) to 5.16 (46) to end the Lions's 34-game winning streak.<ref>http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=1-4711-0-0-0&sID=56333&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=5911606 Magpies Make A Statement</ref> The Western Magpies and the [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach Currumbin Lions]] both made it through the finals series into the 2008 [[AFL Queensland State League]] grand final for a rematch of the previous year's grand final.

The club is based at McCarthy Homes Oval, 41 Chelmer st, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]],<ref name=\"fullpointsfooty.net\">http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/western_magpies.htm Sherwood Magpies</ref> at the same grounds as the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]] and fields a team in the [[AFLQ]] senior, reserve, under 18 and women's grade competitions. The Western Magpies AFC provides a focal point for talented players from all of the junior clubs that lie within [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane's]] western suburbs (Collingwood Park, Ferny Grove, Forest Lake, Kenmore, Jindalee, Moorooka, Sherwood, Southern Redbacks, Springfield Lakes, Wests Juniors, Yeronga). The club aims to provide a pathway into the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] for players from these junior clubs, develop the network of surrounding senior and junior [[Australian rules football]] clubs, and provide a fun, friendly, family oriented hub for local football in the western suburbs.<ref>http://www.sherwoodafc.com/inside.htm A Brief History of the Black & White</ref> The '''Sherwood Magpies Australian Football Club''' and [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]] are sponsored by Tradelink (major sponsor), [[Hog's Breath Cafe]] and Cleanway (secondary sponsors).<ref>http://www.sherwoodafc.com/sponsors.htm Magpie Sponsors</ref>\n\nThere have been a number of senior clubs ([[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa]], [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]], [[Sherwood Australian Football Club|Sherwood]], and [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club|West Brisbane]]) based within the western suburbs of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]] that have competed in the highest division of local football. These clubs were all forced out of existence over time, and the Sherwood Magpies AFC resembles a culmination of the area's historical and continuing football presence and strength. The current club has been playing in Division Two of the [[AFL Queensland State League]] since 2004, but is being promoted into Division One from the commencement of the 2009 season under the guidance of President Brian Knight, Senior Coach Paul Grentell and Club Development Manager Anthony McDonald.<ref>http://www.sportingpulse.com/club_info.cgi?c=1-109-34766-0-0&sID=56344&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=6786642 Anthony McDonald Joins Magpies</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Sherwood Magpies Australian Football Club was formed as the State League representative of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs, incorporating the history of the previous clubs to compete in the [[AFL Queensland State League]].\n\n===Taringa AFC===\nA '''Taringa Football Club''' competed in the QFL (an early form of the [[AFL Queensland State League]]) in the 1920 season. The club only appeared in the State competition for that single season, but resurfaced by entering the newly titled [[QANFL]] in 1931. The club's emblem was the [[bulldog]], and the club colours were maroon and white. Despite making it to five grand finals '''Taringa''' was unable to secure a premiership, but it produced two [[De Little Medal]]ists in C.Vigden (1939) and Doug Pittard (1940). '''Taringa''' changed its name to the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club]] in 1946.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/western_districts.htm Western Districts</ref>\n\n===Western Districts AFC===\nThe '''Western Districts Australian Football Club''' came into existence in 1946 when the [[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa Football Club]] changed its name to incorporate the whole of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs. '''Western Districts''' kept the emblem (the [[bulldog]]) and colours (maroon and white) of [[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa]] and were originally based at Oakman Park, [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]] but moved to Chelmer Oval, Queenscroft st, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] in 1971. The club continued to grow steadily, finishing in third place in 1951, and losing to [[Mayne Australian Football Club|Mayne]] by merely one point in the 1952 grand final. The club learned from their narrow loss, defeating Windsor and Sandgate respectively in the 1953 and 1954 grand finals to secure their first and second premierships. '''Western Districts''' were unable to qualify for the finals between the years of 1956 and 1962, before suffering consecutive grand final losses at the hands of [[Mayne Australian Football Club|Mayne]] in 1966 and 1967. The club's next, and last ever, grand final appearances came consecutively in 1977, 1978 and 1979. The '''Bulldogs''' narrowly won premierships by 5 points against Wilston Grange in 1977, and by 4 points against [[Zillmere Eagles Australian Football Club|Windsor/Zillmere]] in 1978, before losing what would be their last grand final appearance to [[Sandgate Australian Football Club|Sandgate]] in 1979. '''Western Districts''' eventually merged with [[Sherwood Australian Football Club|Sherwood]] in 1991 to form the [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club]]. The '''Western Districts Australian Football Club''' had a number of very successful players in their midst throughout their existence. Doug Pittard won two [[Grogan Medal]]s during his time at the club to go with his [[De Little Medal]] he won with [[Taringa Australian Football Club|Taringa]], and played a handful of games for the [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]] reserves. Owen Backwell was also a dual [[Grogan Medal]]ist for the '''Bulldogs''', who topped the league goal kicking in 1977, played over 300 games for the club, including the 1977 and 1978 premierships, and had a short stint with the [[Fitzroy Football Club]]. Ray Hughson topped the league goal kicking while playing for [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]] a remarkable six times (1958, 1959, 1962\u201365), while [[Gavin Crosisca]] (over 250 [[Australian Football League|AFL]] games for [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]]), Ray Smith (over 100 [[Australian Football League|VFL]] games for [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] and [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]), and Gary Shaw ([[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and the [[Brisbane Bears]], and still coaches at the Western Magpies) all went on to play in the [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>http://www.footypedia.com/00000517.htm Western Districts Football Club</ref>\n\n===Sherwood AFC===\nThe '''Sherwood Australian Football Club''' developed out of the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]], which was formed in 1956. As the junior club grew in size, there was a desire to have a direct senior team for the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club|Sherwood JAFC]], which saw the '''Sherwood AFC''' formed to compete in the Metropolitan Division of the [[AFL Queensland State League|QAFL]]. The club was based at Chelmer Oval, 41 Chelmer st, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]], directly next to the Queenscroft st ground of the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]], which is the current home of the Western Magpies. The club took on the black and white stripes of their junior club as well as the emblem of the [[magpie]], both of which are still thoroughly attached to the club to the current day thanks to the winning of a coin toss with [[Southport Australian Football Club|Southport]] (who had previously had the same colours and emblem) upon the entry of both clubs to the [[AFL Queensland State League|QAFL]] in 1983. This occurred after '''Sherwood''' managed to work their way up through the divisions, after winning eight first division flags in a row they earned their 1983 promotion into the [[AFL Queensland State League|QAFL]]. In 1991 '''Sherwood AFC''' merged with the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts]] to form the [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club]], which could be a single footballing force in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs. Players of particular note for the '''Sherwood AFC''' include [[John Rantall]], the 336 game [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]], [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]] [[Australian Football League|VFL]] veteran who coached '''Sherwood''' in their debut season in the [[QAFL]], and 1983 [[Grogan Medal]] winner, Bill Pierce, whom the Western Magpies best and fairest is named after.<ref name=\"sherwoodafc.com\">http://www.sherwoodafc.com/inside.htm A Brief History Of The Black & White</ref>\n\n===West Brisbane AFC===\nA merger between the [[Western Districts Australian Football Club|Western Districts AFC]] and the [[Sherwood Australian Football Club|Sherwood AFC]] in 1991 saw a single senior force in the western suburbs formed in the form of the '''West Brisbane Australian Football Club'''. The merged club adopted the maroon and white colours of [Western Districts Australian Football Club] with the jersey design of the Port Adelaide Magpies football club, played out of Chelmer Oval, [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] and were nicknamed The '''Warriors'''. The club was successful in winning a premiership in the 1996 season, comfortably defeating [[Mt Gravatt Australian Football Club|Mt Gravatt]] 17.10 (112) to 8.10 (58), with Corey Lambert claiming that year's [[Grogan Medal]]. Unfortunately, due to financial reasons '''West Brisbane''' were unable to compete in the following year's competition and had a few seasons out of the State competition before returning as the re-branded Western Magpies Australian Football Club in 2001.<ref name=\"fullpointsfooty.net\" /><ref>http://www.footypedia.com/00000512.htm West Brisbane Football Club</ref>\n\n===The Current Club===\n\nThe [[West Brisbane Australian Football Club]] that disbanded at the end of 1997 reformed in 1999 under the name of the Western Magpies Australian Football Club and in 2001 re-entered the [[QAFL]]<ref name=\"fullpointsfooty.net\" /> which had merged with its [[Gold Coast, Australia|Gold Coast]] equivalent to become the [[AFL Queensland State League]]. After four years of mediocre on-field performances and financial struggles, when the [[AFL Queensland|AFLQ]] decided to undertake a major re-shuffling of the leagues in 2004 to create a two tier [[AFL Queensland|State League]] competition the Western Magpies were relegated to the newly created Division Two. Paul Grentell was appointed the club's senior coach, and the '''Magpies''' set about strengthening every aspect of the football club in the hopes of returning to Division One. The senior team narrowly missed out on a place in the 2005 Division Two grand final, but were successful in reaching the grand final in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Western Magpies defeated the [[Noosa Australian Football Club|Noosa Tigers]] in the 2006 decider, before losing to the [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach Currumbin Lions]] in the final game of 2007. Despite losing the 2007 grand final, it was announced at the end of that year that the Western Magpies would be returning to Division One of the [[AFL Queensland State League|State League]] in 2009. The Magpies rebounded from their 2007 loss to [[Palm Beach Currumbin Australian Football Club|Palm Beach]] to end the Lions 38-game winning streak at their [[Chelmer, Queensland|Chelmer]] home ground during the 2008 home and away season, and followed this up by defeating the Lions again in a thrilling grand final.<ref name=\"sportingpulse.com\">http://www.sportingpulse.com/club_info.cgi?client=1-109-34766-0-0&sID=56344&news_task=DETAIL&articleID=6798374&sectionID=56344 Western Magpies Win 2008 Div 2 Premiership</ref> This capped the club's time in Division Two off nicely, leaving them with two premierships (2006 & 2008) and three grand final appearances (2006\u20132008) from their four years in lower division. During this four-year period, the reserves team played in the Division Two grand final (each year 2005\u20132008), winning premierships in 2005, 2006 and 2007, while the under 18 and women's teams both continued to participate in Division One of their competitions.\n\nAs of the beginning of Season 2020 in the Queensland Australian Football League \n\n==Links To Other Local Clubs==\nThe Western Magpies enjoy close relationships with all of the junior and senior clubs within [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]]'s western suburbs in their role as the focal point for football ball in the area. All junior clubs within the area are encouraged to promote the Western Magpies as the pathway into the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] for young players in the western suburbs. In a similar way, the club also relates closely with the surrounding senior clubs, as they also provide a pathway for players to play at a standard of football that best suits their ability.<ref name=\"sherwoodafc.com\" /> In particular, the Western Magpies work closely with the [[Sherwood Junior Australian Football Club]] and the [[Kenmore Australian Football Club]].

It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India.\n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumeet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion.

It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair skinned in India.\n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her own daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part at Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that matches, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya is in need of money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. \n\n\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Purnima's step-mother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet as Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "name_user": "Shameera1234", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartik_Purnima_(TV_Show)"}

Born to a family of low status in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] commander of the Emperor [[Carus]]'s army. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus's surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]].\n\nDiocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian reigned in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]], and [[Maximian]] reigned in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]]. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors, under himself and Maximian respectively. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or \"rule of four\", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favourable peace.\n\nDiocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Sirmium]], and [[Trier|Trevorum]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.\n\nNot all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|tetrarchic system collapsed]] after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303\u2013312), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official [[persecution of Christianity]], failed to eliminate Christianity in the empire; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Despite these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]\n\nDiocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.<ref name=BIRTH/> His parents gave him the Greek name Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.<ref>Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.</ref> The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate.

On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign ({{lang|lat|vicennalia}}), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls \"licentious familiarity\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92.</ref> The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,<ref name=\"tkuqen\">Potter, 341.</ref> Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24\u201325.</ref> There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius's account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.</ref>\n\nFrom Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius's company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.<ref name=tkuqen/> He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November 304, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304\u20135 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumours alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, it appeared that he had finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it recovered after public declarations that Diocletian was still alive. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref>\n\nGalerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1\u20137; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref> On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201327; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60; Odahl, 69\u201372; Potter, 341\u201342.</ref>\n\nMost in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of reigning emperors, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had travelled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201326.</ref> In Lactantius's account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2\u20136; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were declared caesars. Maximinus appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.<ref>Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60\u201361; Odahl, 72\u201374; Southern, 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and death ===\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|left|Modern depiction of Diocletian in retirement]]\n\nDiocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].\n\nMaximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref> Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be Augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius's usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>\n\nHe lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 311.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318.

These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect \u2013 although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general<ref>Williams, 107/108.</ref> \u2013 but the office retained much civil authority.

The [[Devil's Dykes]], for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most that can be said about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] along the [[Lake Constance]]-[[Basel]] and the Rhine\u2013[[Iller]]\u2013Danube line),<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 166</ref> on the Danube- where a new line of forts on the far side of the river, the ''Ripa Sarmatica'', was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses<ref>Edward Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire''.

The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235\u2013285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') \u2013 with one iugerum equal to approximately 0.65 acres \u2013 and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20>Treadgold, 20.</ref> The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.<ref name=SSC159/> Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20/>{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'').

Landowners of senatorial rank were able to commute the tax with a payment in gold (the ''aurum tironicum'').<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.

The government's response was to issue a price freeze.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 176\u201377.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Edict on Maximum Prices]]'' (''Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium'') was issued two to three months after the coinage edict,<ref name=SSC160/> somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301.<ref name=POTBAY33435/> The best-preserved Latin inscription surviving from the [[Greek East]],<ref>Potter, 336.</ref> the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone.<ref>Southern, 160, 339.</ref> In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177\u201378; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.</ref>\n\nIn the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was \"an act of economic lunacy\".<ref>Potter, 335.</ref> The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics \u2013 perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\", 42 and 44</ref>\n\nThere is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\",44</ref> Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178.</ref> The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177.</ref> widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.<ref>Potter, 336; Southern, 161.</ref> Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6\u20137, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.</ref> and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.<ref>Potter, 336; Williams, 131\u201332.</ref>\n\n==== Social and professional mobility====\nPartly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.<ref>\"Late Antinquity\" by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.</ref> Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.<ref>Christol & Nony, 241.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that \"It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.\"<ref>Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.</ref> Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.<ref>Williams, 228\u201329.</ref> Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.<ref>Williams, 196\u201398.</ref> Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:<ref>Williams, 204.</ref> the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.<ref>Williams, 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nConstantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.<ref>Williams, 207\u20138.</ref> Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.<ref>Williams, 208.</ref> The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Williams, 218\u201319.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.\n\nThe ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: ''anno Diocletiani''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.\n\n''[[Dukljan]]'', a major villain in [[Serbian mythology]] who is presented as the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |title=\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043be\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u045b\u0430 |author=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2007-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172046/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead |author-link=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 }}</ref> is considered to be a mythological reflection of the historical Diocletian.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| Car | | | | | | | | | | Dio |Car=''previous''<br>[[Carus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-283|Dio=[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|20px]]<br>Diocletian<br>Roman Emperor<br>284-305<br><small>\u221e [[Prisca]]}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| Can | | sis | | Gal |~| GVa | | Man |~|~|~| Eut |~|~|~| Afr |Can=[[Carinus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-284|GVa=[[Galeria Valeria]]|Gal=[[Galerius]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>305-311|sis=sister|Man=''next''<br>[[Maximian]]<br>co-emperor 285-286<br>Emperor of the West 286-305|Eut=[[Eutropia]]|Afr=[[Afranius Hannibalianus]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| | | | | Ma2 | | Val |~| Mus | | |!| | | Hel |~| CCh |~| FMT |Val=[[Valeria Maximilla]]|Ma2=[[Maximinus II]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>310-313|FMT=(?)

Born to a family of low status in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], Diocletian rose through the ranks of the military to become a [[Roman cavalry|cavalry]] commander of the Emperor [[Carus]]'s army. After the deaths of Carus and his son [[Numerian]] on campaign in Persia, Diocletian was proclaimed emperor. The title was also claimed by Carus's surviving son, [[Carinus]], but Diocletian defeated him in the [[Battle of the Margus]].\n\nDiocletian's reign stabilized the empire and marks the end of the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. He appointed fellow officer [[Maximian]] as [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]], co-emperor, in 286. Diocletian reigned in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Empire]], and [[Maximian]] reigned in the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]]. Diocletian delegated further on 1 March 293, appointing [[Galerius]] and [[Constantius Chlorus|Constantius]] as [[Caesar (title)|Caesars]], junior co-emperors, under himself and Maximian respectively. Under this '[[tetrarchy]]', or \"rule of four\", each emperor would rule over a quarter-division of the empire. Diocletian secured the empire's borders and purged it of all threats to his power. He defeated the [[Sarmatia]]ns and [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]] during several campaigns between 285 and 299, the [[Alamanni]] in 288, and usurpers in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]] between 297 and 298. Galerius, aided by Diocletian, campaigned successfully against [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], the empire's traditional enemy. In 299 he sacked their capital, [[Ctesiphon]]. Diocletian led the subsequent negotiations and achieved a lasting and favourable peace.\n\nDiocletian separated and enlarged the empire's civil and military services and reorganized the empire's provincial divisions, establishing the largest and most [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] government in the history of the empire. He established new administrative centres in [[Nicomedia]], [[Mediolanum]], [[Sirmium]], and [[Trier|Trevorum]], closer to the empire's frontiers than the traditional capital at Rome. Building on third-century trends towards [[Autocracy|absolutism]], he styled himself an autocrat, elevating himself above the empire's masses with imposing forms of court ceremonies and architecture. Bureaucratic and military growth, constant campaigning, and construction projects increased the state's expenditures and necessitated a comprehensive tax reform. From at least 297 on, imperial taxation was standardized, made more equitable, and levied at generally higher rates.\n\nNot all of Diocletian's plans were successful: the [[Edict on Maximum Prices]] (301), his attempt to curb [[inflation]] via [[price controls]], was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's [[Civil wars of the Tetrarchy|tetrarchic system collapsed]] after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of [[Maxentius]] and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The [[Diocletianic Persecution]] (303\u2013312), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official [[persecution of Christianity]], failed to eliminate Christianity in the empire; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Despite these failures and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire economically and militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, and became the first Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in [[Diocletian's Palace|his palace on the Dalmatian coast]], tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in [[Croatia]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Salona - amphitheatre - panorama.jpg|thumb|500px|Panorama of amphitheatre in [[Salona]]]]\n\nDiocletian was born near [[Salona]] in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] ([[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] in modern [[Croatia]]), some time around 244.<ref name=BIRTH/> His parents gave him the Greek name Diocles, or possibly Diocles Valerius.<ref>Aurelius Victor 39.1; Potter, 648.</ref> The modern historian [[Timothy Barnes]] takes his official birthday, 22 December, as his actual birthdate.

It was all good publicity for Diocletian, and it aided in his portrayal of Carinus as a cruel and oppressive tyrant.<ref>Southern, 134\u20135; Williams, 38.</ref> Julianus's forces were weak, however, and were handily dispersed when Carinus's armies moved from Britain to northern Italy. As leader of the united East, Diocletian was clearly the greater threat.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 5; Bowman, \"Diocletian and the First Tetrarchy\" (CAH), 69; Leadbetter, \"Carinus.\"</ref> Over the winter of 284\u201385, Diocletian advanced west across the [[Balkans]].

Diocletian was in a less comfortable position than most of his predecessors, as he had a daughter, Valeria, but no sons.

On 20 November, he celebrated, with Maximian, the twentieth anniversary of his reign ({{lang|lat|vicennalia}}), the tenth anniversary of the tetrarchy (''[[decennalia]]''), and a triumph for the war with Persia. Diocletian soon grew impatient with the city, as the Romans acted towards him with what [[Edward Gibbon]], following [[Lactantius]], calls \"licentious familiarity\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall'', I, 153 and 712, note 92.</ref> The Roman people did not give enough deference to his supreme authority; it expected him to act the part of an aristocratic ruler, not a monarchic one. On 20 December 303,<ref name=\"tkuqen\">Potter, 341.</ref> Diocletian cut short his stay in Rome and left for the north. He did not even perform the ceremonies investing him with his ninth consulate; he did them in [[Ravenna]] on 1 January 304 instead.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 24\u201325.</ref> There are suggestions in the ''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' and Lactantius's account that Diocletian arranged plans for his and Maximian's future retirement of power in Rome. Maximian, according to these accounts, swore to uphold Diocletian's plan in a ceremony in the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Temple of Jupiter]].<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 7(6)15.16; Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 20.4; Southern, 152, 336.</ref>\n\nFrom Ravenna, Diocletian left for the Danube. There, possibly in Galerius's company, he took part in a campaign against the Carpi.<ref name=tkuqen/> He contracted a minor illness while on campaign, but his condition quickly worsened and he chose to travel in a [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]]. In the late summer he left for Nicomedia. On 20 November 304, he appeared in public to dedicate the opening of the circus beside his palace. He collapsed soon after the ceremonies. Over the winter of 304\u20135 he kept within his palace at all times. Rumours alleging that Diocletian's death was merely being kept secret until Galerius could come to assume power spread through the city. On 13 December, it appeared that he had finally died. The city was sent into a mourning from which it recovered after public declarations that Diocletian was still alive. When Diocletian reappeared in public on 1 March 305, he was emaciated and barely recognizable.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref>\n\nGalerius arrived in the city later in March. According to Lactantius, he came armed with plans to reconstitute the tetrarchy, force Diocletian to step down, and fill the Imperial office with men compliant to his will. Through coercion and threats, he eventually convinced Diocletian to comply with his plan. Lactantius also claims that he had done the same to Maximian at Sirmium.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 18.1\u20137; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25; Southern, 152.</ref> On 1 May 305, Diocletian called an assembly of his generals, traditional companion troops, and representatives from distant legions. They met at the same hill, {{convert|5|km|mi}} out of Nicomedia, where Diocletian had been proclaimed emperor. In front of a statue of Jupiter, his patron deity, Diocletian addressed the crowd. With tears in his eyes, he told them of his weakness, his need for rest, and his will to resign. He declared that he needed to pass the duty of empire on to someone stronger. He thus became the first Roman emperor to voluntarily abdicate his title.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201327; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60; Odahl, 69\u201372; Potter, 341\u201342.</ref>\n\nMost in the crowd believed they knew what would follow; [[Constantine I|Constantine]] and Maxentius, the only adult sons of reigning emperors, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had travelled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and was present at the palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 25\u201326.</ref> In Lactantius's account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 19.2\u20136; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 26; Potter, 342.</ref> It was not to be: [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] and [[Maximinus II|Maximinus]] were declared caesars. Maximinus appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not bode well for the future security of the tetrarchic system.<ref>Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine,\" 60\u201361; Odahl, 72\u201374; Southern, 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n=== Retirement and death ===\n[[File:Young Folks' History of Rome illus342.png|thumb|left|Modern depiction of Diocletian in retirement]]\n\nDiocletian retired to his homeland, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. He moved into the expansive [[Diocletian's Palace]], a heavily fortified compound located by the small town of Spalatum on the shores of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and near the large provincial administrative center of [[Salona]]. The palace is preserved in great part to this day and forms the historic core of [[Split, Croatia|Split]], the second-largest city of modern [[Croatia]].\n\nMaximian retired to villas in [[Campania]] or [[Lucania]].<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 27; Southern, 152.</ref> Their homes were distant from political life, but Diocletian and Maximian were close enough to remain in regular contact with each other.<ref>Southern, 152.</ref> Galerius assumed the consular ''fasces'' in 308 with Diocletian as his colleague. In the autumn of 308, Galerius again conferred with Diocletian at [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]], [[Austria]]). Diocletian and Maximian were both present on 11 November 308, to see Galerius appoint [[Licinius]] to be Augustus in place of Severus, who had died at the hands of Maxentius. He ordered Maximian, who had attempted to return to power after his retirement, to step down permanently. At Carnuntum people begged Diocletian to return to the throne, to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through Constantine's rise to power and Maxentius's usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian's reply: \"If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.\"<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>\n\nHe lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his own palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 311.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius's \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius's defeat in October 312.

These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian prefect, the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards to the level of a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the prefect \u2013 although a prefect like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general<ref>Williams, 107/108.</ref> \u2013 but the office retained much civil authority. The prefect kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian prefect was often second only to the emperor himself.<ref>Williams, 110.</ref>\n\nAltogether, Diocletian effected a large increase in the number of bureaucrats at the government's command; Lactantius was to claim that there were now more men using tax money than there were paying it.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.3, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.</ref> The historian Warren Treadgold estimates that under Diocletian the number of men in the [[civil service]] doubled from 15,000 to 30,000.<ref name=\"civil\">Treadgold, ''A History of the Byzantine State and Society'', 19.</ref> The classicist [[Roger S.

(By comparison, the ratio in 12th-century [[Song dynasty]] China was one bureaucrat for every 15,000 people.) Jones estimated 30,000 bureaucrats for an empire of 50\u201365 million inhabitants, which works out to approximately 1,667 or 2,167 inhabitants per imperial official as averages empire-wide. The actual numbers of officials and ratios per inhabitant varied, of course, per [[Roman diocese|diocese]] depending on the number of provinces and population within a diocese. Provincial and diocesan paid officials (there were unpaid supernumeraries) numbered about 13\u201315,000 based on their staff establishments as set by law. The other 50% were with the emperor(s) in his or their ''comitatus'', with the praetorian prefects, or with the grain supply officials in the capital (later, the capitals, Rome and Constantinople), Alexandria, and Carthage and officials from the central offices located in the provinces.<ref>Roger S.

The [[Devil's Dykes]], for example, the Danubian earthworks traditionally attributed to Diocletian, cannot even be securely dated to a particular century. The most that can be said about built structures under Diocletian's reign is that he rebuilt and strengthened forts at the Upper Rhine frontier (where he followed the works built under [[Marcus Aurelius Probus|Probus]] along the [[Lake Constance]]-[[Basel]] and the Rhine\u2013[[Iller]]\u2013Danube line),<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 166</ref> on the Danube- where a new line of forts on the far side of the river, the ''Ripa Sarmatica'', was added to older, rehabilitated fortresses<ref>Edward Luttwak, ''The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire''.

The ''[[Strata Diocletiana]]'', built after the Persian Wars, which ran from the Euphrates North of Palmyra and South towards northeast Arabia in the general vicinity of [[Bostra]], is the classic Diocletianic frontier system, consisting of an outer road followed by tightly spaced forts \u2013 defensible hard-points manned by small garrisons \u2013 followed by further fortifications in the rear.<ref>Luttwak, 167; Campbell, \"The Army\" (CAH), 124\u201326; Southern, 154\u201355.

The coinage was stable. Requisition, forced purchase, was used to supply armies on the march. During the third century crisis (235\u2013285), the government resorted to requisition rather than payment in debased coinage, since it could never be sure of the value of money. Requisition was nothing more or less than seizure. Diocletian made requisition into tax. He introduced an extensive new tax system based on heads (''capita'') and land (''iugera'') \u2013 with one iugerum equal to approximately 0.65 acres \u2013 and tied to a new, regular census of the empire's population and wealth. Census officials traveled throughout the empire, assessed the value of labor and land for each landowner, and joined the landowners' totals together to make citywide totals of ''capita'' and ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20>Treadgold, 20.</ref> The ''iugum'' was not a consistent measure of land, but varied according to the type of land and crop, and the amount of labor necessary for sustenance. The ''caput'' was not consistent either: women, for instance, were often valued at half a ''caput'', and sometimes at other values.<ref name=SSC159/> Cities provided animals, money, and manpower in proportion to its ''capita'', and grain in proportion to its ''iuga''.<ref name=TBSS20/>{{refn|The army recruitment tax was called the ''praebitio tironum'', and conscripted a part of each landowner's tenant farmers (''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'').

Landowners of senatorial rank were able to commute the tax with a payment in gold (the ''aurum tironicum'').<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 173.

The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are laid out for various pricing transgressions.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177\u201378; Potter, 335; Southern, 161.</ref>\n\nIn the most basic terms, the edict was ignorant of the law of [[supply and demand]]: it ignored the fact that prices might vary from region to region according to product availability, and it ignored the impact of transportation costs in the retail price of goods. In the judgment of the historian David Potter, the edict was \"an act of economic lunacy\".<ref>Potter, 335.</ref> The fact that the edict began with a long rhetorical preamble betrays at the same time a moralizing stance as well as a weak grasp of economics \u2013 perhaps simply the wishful thinking that criminalizing a practice was enough to stop it.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\", 42 and 44</ref>\n\nThere is no consensus about how effectively the edict was enforced.<ref>Rees, \"Diocletian and the Tetrarchy\",44</ref> Supposedly, inflation, speculation, and monetary instability continued, and a black market arose to trade in goods forced out of official markets.<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178.</ref> The edict's penalties were applied unevenly across the empire (some scholars believe they were applied only in Diocletian's domains),<ref>Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 177.</ref> widely resisted, and eventually dropped, perhaps within a year of the edict's issue.<ref>Potter, 336; Southern, 161.</ref> Lactantius has written of the perverse accompaniments to the edict; of goods withdrawn from the market, of brawls over minute variations in price, of the deaths that came when its provisions were enforced. His account may be true, but it seems to modern historians exaggerated and hyperbolic,<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 7.6\u20137, cited in Cascio, \"The New State of Diocletian and Constantine\" (CAH), 178, and Southern, 161.</ref> and the impact of the law is recorded in no other ancient source.<ref>Potter, 336; Williams, 131\u201332.</ref>\n\n==== Social and professional mobility====\nPartly in response to economic pressures and in order to protect the vital functions of the state, Diocletian restricted social and professional mobility. Peasants became tied to the land in a way that presaged later systems of land tenure and workers such as bakers, armourers, public entertainers and workers in the mint had their occupations made hereditary.<ref>\"Late Antinquity\" by Richard Lim in ''The Edinburgh Companion to Ancient Greece and Rome''. Edinburgh: [[Edinburgh University Press]], 2010, p. 115.</ref> Soldiers' children were also forcibly enrolled, something that followed spontaneous tendencies among the rank-and-file, but also expressed increasing difficulties in recruitment.<ref>Christol & Nony, 241.</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe historian [[A.H.M. Jones]] observed that \"It is perhaps Diocletian's greatest achievement that he reigned twenty-one years and then abdicated voluntarily, and spent the remaining years of his life in peaceful retirement.\"<ref>Jones, ''Later Roman Empire'', 40.</ref> Diocletian was one of the few emperors of the third and fourth centuries to die naturally, and the first in the history of the empire to retire voluntarily.<ref>Williams, 228\u201329.</ref> Once he retired, however, his tetrarchic system collapsed. Without the guiding hand of Diocletian, the empire fell into civil wars. Stability emerged after the defeat of Licinius by Constantine in 324.<ref>Williams, 196\u201398.</ref> Under the Christian Constantine, Diocletian was maligned. Constantine's rule, however, validated Diocletian's achievements and the autocratic principle he represented:<ref>Williams, 204.</ref> the borders remained secure, in spite of Constantine's large expenditure of forces during his civil wars; the bureaucratic transformation of Roman government was completed; and Constantine took Diocletian's court ceremonies and made them even more extravagant.<ref>Williams, 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nConstantine ignored those parts of Diocletian's rule that did not suit him. Diocletian's policy of preserving a stable silver coinage was abandoned, and the gold ''[[Solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' became the empire's primary currency instead.<ref>Williams, 207\u20138.</ref> Diocletian's [[persecution of Christians]] was repudiated and changed to a policy of toleration and then favoritism. Christianity eventually became the official religion in 380. Most importantly, Diocletian's tax system and administrative reforms lasted, with some modifications, until the advent of the Muslims in the 630s.<ref>Williams, 208.</ref> The combination of state autocracy and state religion was instilled in much of Europe, particularly in the lands which adopted Orthodox Christianity.<ref>Williams, 218\u201319.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his administrative and legal impact on history, the Emperor Diocletian is considered to be the founder of the city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in modern-day [[Croatia]]. The city itself grew around the heavily fortified [[Diocletian's Palace]] the emperor had built in anticipation of his retirement.\n\nThe ''[[Era of Martyrs]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''anno martyrum'' or AM), also known as the ''Diocletian era'' (Latin: ''anno Diocletiani''), is a method of numbering years used by the [[Church of Alexandria]] beginning in the 4th century ''anno Domini'' and by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] from the 5th century to the present. In this system of counting, the beginning of Diocletian's reign in 284 was used as the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], making Diocletian's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar. Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it; [[Dionysius Exiguus]] replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his [[anno Domini]] era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.<ref>Blackburn & Holford-Strevens 2003, 767.</ref> The anno Domini era became dominant in the Latin West but was not used in the Greek East until modern times.\n\n''[[Dukljan]]'', a major villain in [[Serbian mythology]] who is presented as the [[devil|adversary]] of [[God]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |title=\u041e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0443 \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043be\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u041d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u045a\u0438\u045b\u0430 |author=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 |accessdate=2008-08-16 |date=2007-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303172046/http://www.rastko.org.rs/rastko/delo/11001 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead |author-link=\u0110or\u0111e Jankovi\u0107 }}</ref> is considered to be a mythological reflection of the historical Diocletian.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| Car | | | | | | | | | | Dio |Car=''previous''<br>[[Carus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-283|Dio=[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|20px]]<br>Diocletian<br>Roman Emperor<br>284-305<br><small>\u221e [[Prisca]]}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| Can | | sis | | Gal |~| GVa | | Man |~|~|~| Eut |~|~|~| Afr |Can=[[Carinus]]<br>Roman Emperor<br>282-284|GVa=[[Galeria Valeria]]|Gal=[[Galerius]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>305-311|sis=sister|Man=''next''<br>[[Maximian]]<br>co-emperor 285-286<br>Emperor of the West 286-305|Eut=[[Eutropia]]|Afr=[[Afranius Hannibalianus]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|(| | | | | | | | | | | |!| }}\n{{familytree| | | | | Ma2 | | Val |~| Mus | | |!| | | Hel |~| CCh |~| FMT |Val=[[Valeria Maximilla]]|Ma2=[[Maximinus II]]<br>Emperor of the East<br>310-313|FMT=(?)
