The right to adequate housing is about security of tenure, affordability, access to services and cultural adequacy. It is about protection from forced eviction and displacement, fighting homelessness, poverty and exclusion.<ref name=\":6\" /> [[India]] defines 'homeless' as those who do not live in [[Census]] houses, but rather stay on pavements, roadsides, railway platforms, staircases, temples, streets, in pipes, or other open spaces.<ref name=\":02\"/> There are 0.77 million homeless people in India, or 0.15% of the country's total population, according to the 2011 census consisting of single men, women, mothers, the elderly, and the disabled.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/1-77-million-people-live-without-shelter-albeit-the-number-decline-over-a-decade-113120600835_1.html|title=1.77 million people live without shelter, albeit the number decline over a decade|last1=Jha|first1=Somesh|newspaper=Business Standard|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> However, it is argued that the numbers are far greater than accounted by the point in time method.

Furthermore, children live on the streets as a result of [[urbanization]], poverty, unemployment, alcoholic families, death of parents, bad relationships with new parents, and drug use.<ref name=\":52\" /> Street children often have bad performance and behavior issues in school and may eventually drop out, leading to low literacy.<ref name=\":52\" /> They are stripped of their right to education and recreation.<ref name=\"slumdogs\"/>  This ties into a cycle perpetuating poverty and homelessness.\n\nStreet children have more physical and [[mental health]] issues than non-street children.<ref name=\":32\"/> Assuming children will ask for bribes, hospitals abstain services, increase prices, or refuse them proper care.<ref name=\":32\"/> These issues can cause street children to become depressed or antisocial with negative approaches to life.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nStreet children suffer from multiple forms of abuse.<ref name=\":52\" /> Most experience [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[psychological abuse]], some experience general abuse and [[neglect]], fewer suffer from health abuse, and a small number from [[Physical abuse|physical]] (including [[Sexual abuse|sexual]]) abuse.<ref name=\":52\" /> Data shows that high levels of one type of abuse are correlated with high levels of another, with amount of abuse increasing with age and income.<ref name=\":52\" /> Often, abuse comes from police or manipulative employers and occupations.<ref name=\":52\" /> Additionally, studies show that boys are more abused than girls on the streets.<ref name=\":52\" /> Finally, abuse can stem from children with hierarchy on the streets.<ref name=\":52\" /> Members of a group help protect each other to survive. However, older member often abuse the younger children.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nHomelessness and poverty are the main causes of child labor in India. Census 2011 reported that there nearly 43.5 lakh children aged 5\u201314 years work to support themselves and their families. According to UNICEF, nearly 12% of all of India's children are laborers. In many cases, poor parents have no choice but to send their children to work in unsafe and hazardous conditions.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Challenges faced by the homeless ==\nOne challenge the homeless face is the inaccessibility to shelters. Although shelters are available for the homeless in certain cities, many homeless people choose to not utilize them and live on the streets instead due to various different reasons. One reason is that homeless individuals who are affected by mobility issues cannot access them and are unsure about how shelters function. Another is that sometimes shelters are located in unreachable areas and have \u201ccamouflaged architecture and poor layouts of the interiors\u201d. Shelters often lack funding and resources to make them more attractive for the homeless population. Shelters also demand a small fee per night, immediately rendering them inaccessible for many homeless. The homeless may view shelters as crowded spaces with poor sanitation where drug addicts and thieves may also take refuge. Sometimes shelters do not allow individuals to bring personal belongings with them which is another factor that discourages homeless individuals from using the shelters. Furthermore, shelter officials, managers, and caretakers are not incentivized to keep the shelters clean and welcoming. Temporary shelters also run the risk of being demolished and often force the homeless to change location of stay.<ref name=\":5\">Vikas, Ram Manohar. \u201cChapter 4 - Shelter for Homeless: Ethnography of Invisibility and Self-Exclusio.\u201d Alternative Organisations in India - Undoing Boundaries, Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp. 95\u2013124, www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/998FBFE8BA331618D3BCD08A9343281C/9781108381000c4_p95-124_CBO.pdf/shelter_for_homeless_ethnography_of_invisibility_and_selfexclusion.pdf.</ref>\n\nAnother challenge faced by the homeless is exposure to extreme weather in summer and winter. A study found that between January 2005 and December 2009, seven homeless individuals passed away every day in Delhi. Their deaths were not recorded by the police and they also did not receive a funeral.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHomeless people also suffer from bad health and extremely limited access to medical facilities. Some of the reasons include: lack of proper identity documents required by medical facilities, cost, and inclination of health care providers to outright reject them. In 2010, the UNDP India conducted a survey that found that only about 3% of the homeless people possessed a voter ID or ration card.<ref name=\":6\">Zufferey, Carole, and Nilan Yu. \u201cFaces of Homelessness in the Asia Pacific.\u201d Taylor & Francis, Routledge , 20 July 2017, www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315475257.</ref>\n\n== Efforts to assist ==\n\n=== Non-governmental services ===\nIndian NGOs have increased dramatically over the years for a number of reasons. A few of these reasons include: programs developed by governmental organizations often lack \"sufficient financial means for implementation\", lack of discourse around urban issues at Indian universities, and the gap between social classes in urban areas.<ref name=\":8\">Dewit, Michael. Schenk, Hans. (1989). Shelter for the poor in india : issues in low cost housing. Manohar. OCLC 989634201.</ref>\n\n[[Drop-in center|Drop in centers]] have shown to help street children.<ref name=\":32\" /> In capitals and large cities, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] are involved with these centers.<ref name=\":62\" /> One such organization known as [[Salaam Baalak Trust|Salam Baalak Trust]] (SBT) has been operating in [[Delhi]] since 1989.<ref name=\":62\" /> SBT runs four homeless shelters open 24 hours a day for around 220 children at a time. This organization has helped 3,500 street children.<ref name=\":62\" /> SBT shelters offer free clothing, food, education, health and mental health services.<ref name=\":62\" /> Thus, children can play without worrying about adult responsibilities such as acquiring food.<ref name=\":32\" /> Furthermore, SBT shelters are safe and secure for children.<ref name=\":62\" /> Centers provide support systems with non-judgmental staff and supervisors as well as opportunities for growth. As many children often do not get support from their parents, families or others on the streets, children seek trust in the staff and consider them to be family.<ref name=\":32\" /> They learn good morals and habits, including reduced drug use and hygiene.<ref name=\":32\" /> Additionally, they are taught how to utilize their skills to create a business.<ref name=\":62\" /> Children at drop in centers believe they have more opportunities for success in the future.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nHowever, some children do not realize that they will have to adapt to non-street life in drop in centers. They get accustomed to the freedom on the streets, including drug use and playing with friends at their leisure.<ref name=\":32\" /> If their families live on the streets, the streets become a normal home for them.<ref name=\":32\" /> Some children also do not like the rules of the shelter. Thus, they chose against living in drop in centers.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nMany NGOs working in housing sector utilize \u201cself-help techniques\u201d that can be viewed in two perspectives; one is that NGOs can work to \u201covercome the lack of funds and still be able to do something\u201d; and the other is that NGOs can work to spread awareness about issues related to homelessness and help make people more \u201cconscious\u201d. Some advantages that NGOs have are: \u201cflexibility and possibility to experiment; high sensitivity to local problems; a good rapport with the people involved in the project; opportunities to make use of mutual help; aid of international organizations (expertise); inspiring enthusiasm; possibilities to tackle controversial issues\u201d. However, NGOs that implement shelter projects are limited to what they can do because the location of the project always impacts the quality of the shelter, something that is out of the NGO's control.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Governmental services ===\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the nation created its own set of Five-Year Plans for economic development. The state did not develop any programs for dealing with the poor and the homeless until the Eighth-Five Year plan (1992\u201397). In this plan, the Footpath Dwellers Night Shelter Scheme (NSS) was created and funds of INR 2.27 crores were allocated for two years. The 10th plan (2002-2007) asked NGOs to creates homes for the homeless and also recognized that the homeless were not being addressed by the government to an extent that they should have been. The 11th plan (2007\u201312) declared access to roof over one's head as a \u201cfundamental right\u201d. The 12th plan (2012\u201317) promoted the creation and development of night shelters for beggars and the aged; it also gave city planners the responsibility to build and provide spaces for the homeless.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe [[Housing and Urban Development Corporation]] (HUDCO) had a policy for the homeless known as Night Shelters for Urban Shelterless, applicable to urban areas in 1988 to 1989.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|title=Shelters for the urban homeless : a handbook for administrators and policymakers|others=Commissioners of the Supreme Court in the Case of Writ Petition (Civil) 196 of 2001|isbn=978-8192690711|edition= First|location=Bangalore, Karnataka, India|oclc=897871638}}</ref> It gave 20,000 [[rupee]]s a year to [[homeless shelter]]s, 50% paid by the government, 50% paid by loans from HUDCO or sponsors. In 1992, the [[Ministry of Urban Development (India)|Ministry of Urban Development]] renamed it to Shelter and Sanitation Facilities for Footpath Dwellers in Urban Areas.<ref name=\":19\" /> The department decided to maintain these shelters as dorm-like refuge for nights and social areas in the day. However, in 2005 it was discontinued as states lacked funding.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nThe [[Government of India]] has formed new policies for [[affordable housing]] and shelters in urban areas in the past few decades. However, shelters provide a temporary solution as they are not permanent and do not replace the right to housing.<ref name=\":02\"/> According to the [[Commissioner]]s of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], a shelter is a covered space where homeless people can feel safe and secure, and is accessible by anyone.<ref name=\":19\" /> It should provide protection from the environment, safety and security, a place to keep belongings, and a place to drink water and use sanitary bathrooms.<ref name=\":19\" /> The government states that homeless shelters ideally be in localities where there are a lot of homeless people.<ref name=\":19\" /> To improve infrastructures in slums, the Supreme court mandated a new mission known as the [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]].<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/worldfitforchildren/files/India_WFFC5_Report.pdf|title=National Report on 'A World Fit for Children'|date=January 2007|website=Unicef|publisher=Ministry of Women and Child Development Government of India}}</ref> This stated that for cities of over 5 [[lakh]]s in population size, shelters must contain good water, toilets, baths, cooling, heating, ventilation, lights, emergency lights, fire safety, recreation spaces, TVs, first aid, shelter from mosquitoes and rodents, beds, kitchens and utensils, counseling, childcare facilities, and transport for emergencies.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|title=Tenth Report of the Commissioners of the Supreme Court.

According to the court, these shelters are barely an improvement from the streets.<ref name=\":02\" /> The homeless population eligible cannot enjoy the shelters at night as that is their time of employment, thus defeating the purpose of the shelter.<ref name=\":02\" /> Furthermore, the data collected from survey analysis of homeless shelters showed the following: the shelters are majority male consisting of wage workers, taxi and [[rickshaw]] drivers, and tourists. The lack of women in shelters suggests that either women don't find shelters helpful or that there is low tendency for families to seek shelters.<ref name=\":02\" /> The shelters have inadequate bedding, water, bathrooms, tools, gas for cooking, [[rodent]] control, activity space and non-functional first aid. Additionally, there is bad lighting, ventilation, and fire safety. Women and children do not have their own shelters.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thus, the bare minimum of government demands are not being met.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn response to this report, the Supreme Court mandated there be one shelter to house 100 people in a population.<ref name=\":02\" /> They declared that shelters must be run all day, every day of the year and consist of beds, bathrooms, water, healthcare and first aid services.<ref name=\":02\" /> 62 cities participated in this.<ref name=\":02\" /> Finally, in 2013 the Indian government started the National Urban Livelihood Mission program which mandated guidelines for states on how to create and utilize shelters.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\nThe Public Distribution System (PDS) is one of the major services offered by the government to people living below the poverty line (BPL) in India. This system provides food and grains for low income families at a cheaper rate. However, it requires identity documents to determine eligibility, which many homeless people lack. Although programs like the Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan and NGOs like Pehchan in Mumbai work with the homeless in obtaining documentation of identity, only about 3% of the homeless people in India have identity proof, meaning that most are excluded from becoming beneficiaries of the BPL.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Homelessness and informal housing: the case of Mumbai ==\nMumbai, located in one of the most populous states, Maharashtra, is home to 12.47 million people, as per the 2011 Census. The city has an extremely high population density of 20,692 people per km<sup>2</sup>, and a total area of about 603 km<sup>2</sup>. It contributes to nearly 40 per cent of the state's gross domestic product and 5 per cent of the national GDP. Much of Mumbai's economy today falls under the informal sector where the average income of a worker is about Rs. 6,000 per month (equaling to about 120 US dollars).<ref name=\":0\">Bhagat, Ram B, and Gavin W Jones. \u201cPopulation Change and Migration in Mumbai Metropolitan Region: Implications for Planning and Governance.\u201d ser. 201. 201, www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Bhagat/publication/236896613_Population_Change_and_Migration_in_Mumbai_Metropolitan_Region_Implications_for_Planning_and_Governance/links/00b7d51a0df52840df000000/Population-Change-and-Migration-in-Mumbai-Metropolitan-Region-Implications-for-Planning-and-Governance.pdf.</ref>\n\nThe population of Mumbai dramatically increased from 1.69 million in 1930 to 8 million in 1970 due to people moving from rural areas.<ref name=\":0\" /> Migrants move to the city when working in a rural area does not supply enough income to support their families. In the city, employers are more attracted to migrants than local workers because migrant workers supply labor at a cheaper cost and are more willing to work in unsafe conditions.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Prashad | first1 = Lokender | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = An Enquiry into Migration and Homelessness - A Developmental Discourse: Evidence from Mumbai City.' | url = | journal = International Journal of Innovative Knowledge Concepts | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, an income of less than Rs. 6,000 leaves many migrant workers without access to clean drinking water and basic amenities. Many are not able to pay for rent and thus are forced to live in pavements, streets, parks, and other open public spaces. One study showed that nearly 60 percent of the homeless of Mumbai are from migrants from other states, and most in this category moved from rural areas.<ref name=\":2\" /> Most of them work in the informal sector as laborers and live without a permanent home. Many of these migrants do not have any sort of identity documents and thus are not registered for social welfare benefits such as the Public Distribution System. These migrants originally worked on agricultural lands that they did not own themselves; they moved to Mumbai in search of a better livelihood - better roads, better access to clean drinking water, better roads, better sustenance. Many left their villages to escape \u201ccaste-based violence\u201d that destroyed their ability to make a living.<ref>Shah, Svati Pragna. Street Corner Secrets: Sex, Work, and Migration in the City of Mumbai. Duke University Press, 2014.</ref>\n\nA smaller portion of migrant laborers are able to afford to live in slums. Today, more than half of Mumbai's population, nearly 5.5 million people, lives in slums which make up only 8% of the land. Slums suffer from overcrowding, tight spaces, poor lighting, lack of electricity, scarcity of clean water, and unhygienic conditions. Slum inhabitants also suffer from housing insecurities resulting from pressure from their landlords to pay rent on time.<ref name=\":3\">Desai, Renu B.

The Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance, and Redevelopment) Act (MSAA) in 1971 was established to \u201cimprove environmental conditions\u201d in slums by providing a range of services; it gave the government power to declare a geographical space as a \u201cslum area\u201d and then take action to improve it as deemed appropriate.

However, older member often abuse the younger children.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nHomelessness and poverty are the main causes of child labor in India. Census 2011 reported that there nearly 43.5 lakh children aged 5\u201314 years work to support themselves and their families. According to UNICEF, nearly 12% of all of India's children are laborers. In many cases, poor parents have no choice but to send their children to work in unsafe and hazardous conditions.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Challenges faced by the homeless ==\nOne challenge the homeless face is the inaccessibility to shelters. Although shelters are available for the homeless in certain cities, many homeless people choose to not utilize them and live on the streets instead due to various different reasons. One reason is that homeless individuals who are affected by mobility issues cannot access them and are unsure about how shelters function. Another is that sometimes shelters are located in unreachable areas and have \u201ccamouflaged architecture and poor layouts of the interiors\u201d. Shelters often lack funding and resources to make them more attractive for the homeless population. Shelters also demand a small fee per night, immediately rendering them inaccessible for many homeless. The homeless may view shelters as crowded spaces with poor sanitation where drug addicts and thieves may also take refuge. Sometimes shelters do not allow individuals to bring personal belongings with them which is another factor that discourages homeless individuals from using the shelters. Furthermore, shelter officials, managers, and caretakers are not incentivized to keep the shelters clean and welcoming. Temporary shelters also run the risk of being demolished and often force the homeless to change location of stay.<ref name=\":5\">Vikas, Ram Manohar. \u201cChapter 4 - Shelter for Homeless: Ethnography of Invisibility and Self-Exclusio.\u201d Alternative Organisations in India - Undoing Boundaries, Cambridge University Press, 2018, pp. 95\u2013124, www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/998FBFE8BA331618D3BCD08A9343281C/9781108381000c4_p95-124_CBO.pdf/shelter_for_homeless_ethnography_of_invisibility_and_selfexclusion.pdf.</ref>\n\nAnother challenge faced by the homeless is exposure to extreme weather in summer and winter. A study found that between January 2005 and December 2009, seven homeless individuals passed away every day in Delhi. Their deaths were not recorded by the police and they also did not receive a funeral.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nHomeless people also suffer from bad health and extremely limited access to medical facilities. Some of the reasons include: lack of proper identity documents required by medical facilities, cost, and inclination of health care providers to outright reject them. In 2010, the UNDP India conducted a survey that found that only about 3% of the homeless people possessed a voter ID or ration card.<ref name=\":6\">Zufferey, Carole, and Nilan Yu. \u201cFaces of Homelessness in the Asia Pacific.\u201d Taylor & Francis, Routledge , 20 July 2017, www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315475257.</ref>\n\n== Efforts to assist ==\n\n=== Non-governmental services ===\nIndian NGOs have increased dramatically over the years for a number of reasons. A few of these reasons include: programs developed by governmental organizations often lack \"sufficient financial means for implementation\", lack of discourse around urban issues at Indian universities, and the gap between social classes in urban areas.<ref name=\":8\">Dewit, Michael.

This organization has helped 3,500 street children.<ref name=\":62\" /> SBT shelters offer free clothing, food, education, health and mental health services.<ref name=\":62\" /> Thus, children can play without worrying about adult responsibilities such as acquiring food.<ref name=\":32\" /> Furthermore, SBT shelters are safe and secure for children.<ref name=\":62\" /> Centers provide support systems with non-judgmental staff and supervisors as well as opportunities for growth. As many children often do not get support from their parents, families or others on the streets, children seek trust in the staff and consider them to be family.<ref name=\":32\" /> They learn good morals and habits, including reduced drug use and hygiene.<ref name=\":32\" /> Additionally, they are taught how to utilize their skills to create a business.<ref name=\":62\" /> Children at drop in centers believe they have more opportunities for success in the future.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nHowever, some children do not realize that they will have to adapt to non-street life in drop in centers. They get accustomed to the freedom on the streets, including drug use and playing with friends at their leisure.<ref name=\":32\" /> If their families live on the streets, the streets become a normal home for them.<ref name=\":32\" /> Some children also do not like the rules of the shelter. Thus, they chose against living in drop in centers.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\nMany NGOs working in housing sector utilize \u201cself-help techniques\u201d that can be viewed in two perspectives; one is that NGOs can work to \u201covercome the lack of funds and still be able to do something\u201d; and the other is that NGOs can work to spread awareness about issues related to homelessness and help make people more \u201cconscious\u201d. Some advantages that NGOs have are: \u201cflexibility and possibility to experiment; high sensitivity to local problems; a good rapport with the people involved in the project; opportunities to make use of mutual help; aid of international organizations (expertise); inspiring enthusiasm; possibilities to tackle controversial issues\u201d. However, NGOs that implement shelter projects are limited to what they can do because the location of the project always impacts the quality of the shelter, something that is out of the NGO's control.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n=== Governmental services ===\nAfter India gained independence in 1947, the nation created its own set of Five-Year Plans for economic development. The state did not develop any programs for dealing with the poor and the homeless until the Eighth-Five Year plan (1992\u201397). In this plan, the Footpath Dwellers Night Shelter Scheme (NSS) was created and funds of INR 2.27 crores were allocated for two years. The 10th plan (2002-2007) asked NGOs to creates homes for the homeless and also recognized that the homeless were not being addressed by the government to an extent that they should have been. The 11th plan (2007\u201312) declared access to roof over one's head as a \u201cfundamental right\u201d. The 12th plan (2012\u201317) promoted the creation and development of night shelters for beggars and the aged; it also gave city planners the responsibility to build and provide spaces for the homeless.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe [[Housing and Urban Development Corporation]] (HUDCO) had a policy for the homeless known as Night Shelters for Urban Shelterless, applicable to urban areas in 1988 to 1989.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|title=Shelters for the urban homeless : a handbook for administrators and policymakers|others=Commissioners of the Supreme Court in the Case of Writ Petition (Civil) 196 of 2001|isbn=978-8192690711|edition= First|location=Bangalore, Karnataka, India|oclc=897871638}}</ref> It gave 20,000 [[rupee]]s a year to [[homeless shelter]]s, 50% paid by the government, 50% paid by loans from HUDCO or sponsors. In 1992, the [[Ministry of Urban Development (India)|Ministry of Urban Development]] renamed it to Shelter and Sanitation Facilities for Footpath Dwellers in Urban Areas.<ref name=\":19\" /> The department decided to maintain these shelters as dorm-like refuge for nights and social areas in the day. However, in 2005 it was discontinued as states lacked funding.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\nThe [[Government of India]] has formed new policies for [[affordable housing]] and shelters in urban areas in the past few decades. However, shelters provide a temporary solution as they are not permanent and do not replace the right to housing.<ref name=\":02\"/> According to the [[Commissioner]]s of the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]], a shelter is a covered space where homeless people can feel safe and secure, and is accessible by anyone.<ref name=\":19\" /> It should provide protection from the environment, safety and security, a place to keep belongings, and a place to drink water and use sanitary bathrooms.<ref name=\":19\" /> The government states that homeless shelters ideally be in localities where there are a lot of homeless people.<ref name=\":19\" /> To improve infrastructures in slums, the Supreme court mandated a new mission known as the [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission]].<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/worldfitforchildren/files/India_WFFC5_Report.pdf|title=National Report on 'A World Fit for Children'|date=January 2007|website=Unicef|publisher=Ministry of Women and Child Development Government of India}}</ref> This stated that for cities of over 5 [[lakh]]s in population size, shelters must contain good water, toilets, baths, cooling, heating, ventilation, lights, emergency lights, fire safety, recreation spaces, TVs, first aid, shelter from mosquitoes and rodents, beds, kitchens and utensils, counseling, childcare facilities, and transport for emergencies.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|title=Tenth Report of the Commissioners of the Supreme Court.

According to the court, these shelters are barely an improvement from the streets.<ref name=\":02\" /> The homeless population eligible cannot enjoy the shelters at night as that is their time of employment, thus defeating the purpose of the shelter.<ref name=\":02\" /> Furthermore, the data collected from survey analysis of homeless shelters showed the following: the shelters are majority male consisting of wage workers, taxi and [[rickshaw]] drivers, and tourists. The lack of women in shelters suggests that either women don't find shelters helpful or that there is low tendency for families to seek shelters.<ref name=\":02\" /> The shelters have inadequate bedding, water, bathrooms, tools, gas for cooking, [[rodent]] control, activity space and non-functional first aid. Additionally, there is bad lighting, ventilation, and fire safety. Women and children do not have their own shelters.<ref name=\":02\" /> Thus, the bare minimum of government demands are not being met.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn response to this report, the Supreme Court mandated there be one shelter to house 100 people in a population.<ref name=\":02\" /> They declared that shelters must be run all day, every day of the year and consist of beds, bathrooms, water, healthcare and first aid services.<ref name=\":02\" /> 62 cities participated in this.<ref name=\":02\" /> Finally, in 2013 the Indian government started the National Urban Livelihood Mission program which mandated guidelines for states on how to create and utilize shelters.<ref name=\":20\" />\n\nThe Public Distribution System (PDS) is one of the major services offered by the government to people living below the poverty line (BPL) in India. This system provides food and grains for low income families at a cheaper rate. However, it requires identity documents to determine eligibility, which many homeless people lack. Although programs like the Aashray Adhikar Abhiyan and NGOs like Pehchan in Mumbai work with the homeless in obtaining documentation of identity, only about 3% of the homeless people in India have identity proof, meaning that most are excluded from becoming beneficiaries of the BPL.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n== Homelessness and informal housing: the case of Mumbai ==\nMumbai, located in one of the most populous states, Maharashtra, is home to 12.47 million people, as per the 2011 Census. The city has an extremely high population density of 20,692 people per km<sup>2</sup>, and a total area of about 603 km<sup>2</sup>. It contributes to nearly 40 per cent of the state's gross domestic product and 5 per cent of the national GDP. Much of Mumbai's economy today falls under the informal sector where the average income of a worker is about Rs. 6,000 per month (equaling to about 120 US dollars).<ref name=\":0\">Bhagat, Ram B, and Gavin W Jones. \u201cPopulation Change and Migration in Mumbai Metropolitan Region: Implications for Planning and Governance.\u201d ser. 201. 201, www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Bhagat/publication/236896613_Population_Change_and_Migration_in_Mumbai_Metropolitan_Region_Implications_for_Planning_and_Governance/links/00b7d51a0df52840df000000/Population-Change-and-Migration-in-Mumbai-Metropolitan-Region-Implications-for-Planning-and-Governance.pdf.</ref>\n\nThe population of Mumbai dramatically increased from 1.69 million in 1930 to 8 million in 1970 due to people moving from rural areas.<ref name=\":0\" /> Migrants move to the city when working in a rural area does not supply enough income to support their families. In the city, employers are more attracted to migrants than local workers because migrant workers supply labor at a cheaper cost and are more willing to work in unsafe conditions.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Prashad | first1 = Lokender | display-authors = etal | year = 2016 | title = An Enquiry into Migration and Homelessness - A Developmental Discourse: Evidence from Mumbai City.' | url = | journal = International Journal of Innovative Knowledge Concepts | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, an income of less than Rs. 6,000 leaves many migrant workers without access to clean drinking water and basic amenities. Many are not able to pay for rent and thus are forced to live in pavements, streets, parks, and other open public spaces. One study showed that nearly 60 percent of the homeless of Mumbai are from migrants from other states, and most in this category moved from rural areas.<ref name=\":2\" /> Most of them work in the informal sector as laborers and live without a permanent home. Many of these migrants do not have any sort of identity documents and thus are not registered for social welfare benefits such as the Public Distribution System. These migrants originally worked on agricultural lands that they did not own themselves; they moved to Mumbai in search of a better livelihood - better roads, better access to clean drinking water, better roads, better sustenance. Many left their villages to escape \u201ccaste-based violence\u201d that destroyed their ability to make a living.<ref>Shah, Svati Pragna. Street Corner Secrets: Sex, Work, and Migration in the City of Mumbai. Duke University Press, 2014.</ref>\n\nA smaller portion of migrant laborers are able to afford to live in slums. Today, more than half of Mumbai's population, nearly 5.5 million people, lives in slums which make up only 8% of the land. Slums suffer from overcrowding, tight spaces, poor lighting, lack of electricity, scarcity of clean water, and unhygienic conditions. Slum inhabitants also suffer from housing insecurities resulting from pressure from their landlords to pay rent on time.<ref name=\":3\">Desai, Renu B.

University of California, Berkeley, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn Maharashtra, several programs and policies were enacted by the government to address inadequate housing issues, especially related to slums. The Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance, and Redevelopment) Act (MSAA) in 1971 was established to \u201cimprove environmental conditions\u201d in slums by providing a range of services; it gave the government power to declare a geographical space as a \u201cslum area\u201d and then take action to improve it as deemed appropriate. It could ask the inhabitants of a slum to move to another space without offering alternative spaces of living.<ref name=\":4\">Kothari, Miloon, and Nasreen Contractor.
