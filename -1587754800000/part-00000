Created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], the character made his first appearance in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #109 (February 1978) which was co-plotted by Byrne and his long-time collaborator [[Chris Claremont]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=159}}</ref>\n\nThe character is a founding member and leader of [[Alpha Flight]].

When he learns that his work will be used for American military purposes, Hudson raids his workplace, steals the prototype suit and destroys the plans. He leaves the suit to be recovered (albeit without the vital control helmet, which he built before coming to the company) and fully expects to be sued and arrested for his actions.\n\nHowever, Hudson's girlfriend, [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather MacNeil]], uses political connections in the [[Canadian government]] to persuade Am-Can to waive the charges against him. As a result, [[Department H]] is formed, a secret branch of the Canadian Department of National Defence, and Hudson is named as head of operations. Inspired by the debut of the [[Fantastic Four]], James Hudson planned to create a superhero team for Canada.<ref name=\"X-Men #109\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #109</ref> He started out with a prototype superhero team called [[The Flight]] which had [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as one of its members.<ref>''Alpha Flight Special'' vol. 2 #1 (1992)</ref>\n\nFollowing his prototype team the Flight, Hudson forms [[Alpha Flight]] as a superhero team for the Canadian government and develops his exoskeleton into a battle suit. As Weapon Alpha, Hudson sought to capture Wolverine, who had left Canada and joined the [[X-Men]]. He accidentally injured [[Moira MacTaggert]] in the process.<ref name=\"X-Men #109\"/> He then led Alpha Flight in battle against the X-Men to capture Wolverine.<ref>''X-Men'' #120-121</ref> After that mission failed, he made no further attempts to forcibly return Wolverine to Canada.\n\nWith the cancellation of Department H and its funding, Alpha Flight is temporarily disbanded. Hudson laments this for a time, but then is called to action by the arrival of the [[Great Beasts|Great Beast]] [[Tundra (Marvel Comics)|Tundra]]. He sets out alone, but Heather takes it upon herself to summon the rest of Alpha Flight, plus two recently \"gold-striped\" members. The team defeats Tundra, and then summarily decides to reform, albeit without direct Government support.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #1</ref>\n\nHudson and Alpha Flight retain their security clearances and status as RCMP Auxiliaries. They have a series of adventures, both as a team and as individuals. Early on, Hudson expresses a lack of confidence in himself, but he slowly gains some over time. For example, his initial reaction to the imposing creature the [[Wendigo (comics)|Wendigo]] has him expressing fear. Nevertheless, he confronts the creature \"like a super-hero borne\"<ref>''X-Men'' #140</ref>.\n\nThough Hudson and his wife initially struggle as any Canadian middle-class couple do, he is soon offered a plum job with the large corporation Roxxon in New York City. Relocated to New York, Hudson is almost immediately trapped and set upon by an evil incarnation of [[Omega Flight]] and an old foe: his old boss from Am-Can, [[Jerry Jaxon]]. The battle is soon joined by the rest of Alpha Flight, though it does not end well for Hudson. Although seemingly killed when his battle suit explodes due to the strain of energizing a multiple teleportation matrix system (thanks to Jaxon), he is in fact transported to Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. There he meets an alien race known as the Q`wrrlln. In their attempts to heal Hudson, the Q`wrrlln integrate his battle suit into his body, fusing it to his biological and nervous systems.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #25</ref> (This is originally posed as a ruse by [[Delphine Courtney]] to confuse and deceive Heather Hudson and the surviving members of Alpha Flight.<ref>''Alpha Flight'' #26</ref>)\n\nHudson eventually returns to Earth and takes the name Vindicator, leaving the title of \"Guardian\" (and position of leadership) with his wife, Heather. Again, Hudson's time with the team is cut short when the Q'wrrlln summon him (and a select group of heroes) to protect their planet against [[Galactus]]. As before, Hudson seemingly perishes when his suit detonates while transporting the heroes back home. However, during the explosion Hudson is transported to an alternate dimension. After some time, he eventually returns to Earth.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nWhile again working for Department H, Hudson becomes caught up in the plans of its new director, General Jeremy Clarke. Scientists working for Clarke clone Hudson, steal his memories, and attempt to shoot his body into outer space. The plan does not succeed, though, as Hudson crash lands in [[Antarctica]].{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nA seemingly de-aged Hudson reappears to the members of Alpha Flight. This is in fact the clone created by Department H. The original Hudson is eventually found by [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]] in Antarctica. After his return he once again becomes team leader while the clone becomes leader of [[Beta Flight]]. Later, both Hudsons are captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], and the clone is killed in the escape.<ref>''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #143</ref>\n\nAlong with several other members of Alpha Flight, Hudson attempts to return a clutch of [[Plodex]] eggs to their homeworld. However, an accident brings temporal copies of most of the original Alpha Flight from a time before Hudson's first \"death\" to the present. This group, including James Hudson, takes up the role of Alpha Flight while the original ones are helping to rebuild the Plodex homeworld.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nAlpha Flight (Sasquatch, [[Major Mapleleaf|Major Mapleleaf II]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck Jr.]], Guardian, [[Vindicator (comics)|Vindicator]], [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Puck (comics)|Puck]]) is brutally attacked by [[Xorn|The Collective]],<ref>''[[Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #16</ref> resulting in the deaths of Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Puck. Their bodies are left in the [[Yukon Territory]] as the Collective continues on to the United States.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe Guardian suit was worn by [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] during his run in [[Omega Flight]] before joining [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s [[Dark X-Men]] as Weapon Omega.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Guardian (alongside Vindicator, [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], and [[Marrina Smallwood]]) are among the heroes that return from the dead following what happened to the death realms. He reunites Alpha Flight to fight the Great Beasts.<ref>''Chaos War: Alpha Flight''</ref> James Hudson remains among the living after the defeat of the Chaos King.<ref>''Chaos War #5''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nFormerly, Guardian used a skin-tight technological \"battle suit\" composed of steel mesh which served as an exoskeleton; it allowed him to fly, fire energy blasts and had a personal force field for defense. The suit design stems from a geological/oil-exploration exo-suit designed by Hudson during his early career. The original suit was clunky, over-large and awkward, though it did have an energy beam \"weapon\" system, ostensibly used for drilling/tunneling. The skin-tight suit is considered to be a later, possibly 2nd or 3rd generation, evolution of the original design. The battle suit is cybernetically controlled and contains a high resolution navigation system. The battle suit permits flight by directing beams of force towards the ground, propelling the wearer forward at up to Mach 1.\n\nGuardian could cause the battle suit computers to trigger and release gravitons, canceling the Earth's rotation relative to himself, propelling himself forward at up to about 1000 miles per hour (at the equator). This effect would suspend his positioning relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field while the planet rotated, allowing him to travel West at high speed depending on his [[latitude]] positioning.\n\nWhen he returned from space, the technology of the suit that formerly existed as a separate part of him was incorporated into his body. The alien Q`wrrlln converted James Hudson into a cyborg incorporating much of his battle suit; some of his mechanical parts were visible on the surface of his body. As a result, his powers were greatly enhanced. Hudson's cyborg brain was half-organic (portions of his original brain) and half-mechanical. Hudson could control his mechanical systems by mental command, though he was vulnerable to being controlled by the Q`wrrlln through the mechanical portion of his brain. With great effort the human portion of his brain could override this control.\n\nGuardian's power suit allows for:\n*increased strength and durability;\n*[[cybernetic]] link-up and hacking abilities;\n*advanced weapons systems, including (but not limited to) [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] pulse projectors, beams of concussive energy from the gauntlets, bolts of plasma, [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] beams, and a graviton beam;\n*increased intelligence due to the fusion of his battle suit to his neural network;\n*increased speed, reaching [[Mach number|Mach]] 1;\n*ability to create and travel through a wormhole.\n* the ability to lock himself relative to the Earth's electromagnetic field. Essentially, he cancels out the effects of the Earth's rotation upon himself. This allowed him to apparently \"vanish\", while actually being whisked westward at the speed of the planet's rotation.\n*the creation of a protective force field that dampens inertia and absorbs energy;\n*force shields that also deflect outside pressure, such as in the ocean depths;\n\nHudson has earned a Ph.D. in engineering. He is a brilliant engineer, inventor, and a good battle strategist and leader.\n\n==Other versions==\n*On [[Marvel Zombies (series)|Earth-2149]], a zombified Guardian can be seen attacking the X-Men alongside zombified versions of Alpha Flight. He is killed when [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] scalps him with a metal blade. His body can later be seen being examined by [[Reed Richards]] on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]].\n*On Earth-3240, where the Cold War never ended, Guardian was Heather Hudson's second husband. (Her previous husband was [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], whom she had killed while under the control of Weapon X.) This Guardian has much the same powers as the [[Earth-616]] Guardian.\n* On [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth 1610]], the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Hudson is a non-powered Gulf war veteran and sheriff of Port St. Lucie, Florida, and was acquainted with [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], who also introduced him to his wife Heather. Wolverine entrusted him with raising his son from Magda a.k.a. \"The Witch of [[Wundagore]]\". Hudson named him ''James Hudson'' (which later became James Howlett, after James discovered his true father). James eventually manifested a healing factor and claws in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X]]''.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Hudson appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series under the code name Vindicator, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]]. He conspired with the head of Alpha Flight to force Wolverine's return to Canada so they can conduct experiments on how he was able to survive the [[adamantium]] bonding process and, if possible, extract the adamantium from his skeleton, regardless of the possibility of killing Wolverine. He felt heavily betrayed by Wolverine leaving Alpha Flight and used that as justification for his actions. He also deceived his team into believing he was bringing Wolverine back to the team. Throughout his battle with Logan, he was able to use his force field to protect himself from Wolverine's claws. However, when it failed, he was at Logan's mercy. Wolverine told him that the only reason he was still breathing after the battle is that he loved Vindicator's wife Heather. He also threatened that, if he or Alpha Flight came after him again, all bets were off.\n\n===Video games===\n* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. He and Vindicator are encountered in an abandoned Weapon X facility. He has special dialogue with Wolverine.\n* Guardian appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n*In 2008, Hasbro released an action figure of Guardian in its Marvel Legends line which was exclusive to Walmart.\n*In 2019, Hasbro released another Marvel Legends figure which came with a Build-A-Figure piece of another Canadian character, [[Wendigo (comics)|the Wendigo]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://alphaflight.net/showwiki/Guardian_I AlphaFlight.Net Alphanex Entry on - Guardian]\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Guardian_%28James_Hudson%29 Guardian] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guardian Guardian (Marvel Comics)}}\n[[Category:Canadian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Canadian-themed superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Ontario]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Powered exoskeletons in fiction]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=[[File:Alpha flight 89 guardian.jpg|250px|]]\n|caption=Guardian in a cover detail to<br>''[[Alpha Flight]]'' #89.<br>Art by [[Jim Lee]].\n|character_name=Guardian\n|real_name=James MacDonald Hudson\n|species=Human Cyborg\n|homeworld=[[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] ([[Earth-616]])\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=[[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #109 (February, 1978)\n|creators=[[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]\n|alliances=[[Alpha Flight]]<br>[[Beta Flight]]<br>[[Department H]]<br>[[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]\n|aliases=Weapon Alpha, Vindicator, Jamie, Jimmy, Mac, Jimmy Hudson, Dr. Hudson, Antiguard, Major Maple-Leaf\n|powers=\n*Physical attributes enhanced to peak of human potential\n*Flight\n*Personal force field\n*Ability to fire energy blasts\n|cat=super\n|subcat=Marvel Comics\n|hero=y\n|sortkey=Guardian\n}}\n'''Guardian''' ('''James Hudson'''; [[colloquial]]: '''\"Weapon Alpha\"''' or '''\"Vindicator\"'''), is a [[fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

(Her previous husband was [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], whom she had killed while under the control of Weapon X.) This Guardian has much the same powers as the [[Earth-616]] Guardian.\n* On [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth 1610]], the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]] version of Hudson is a non-powered Gulf war veteran and sheriff of Port St. Lucie, Florida, and was acquainted with [[Ultimate Wolverine|Wolverine]], who also introduced him to his wife Heather. Wolverine entrusted him with raising his son from Magda a.k.a. \"The Witch of [[Wundagore]]\". Hudson named him ''James Hudson'' (which later became James Howlett, after James discovered his true father). James eventually manifested a healing factor and claws in ''[[Ultimate Comics: X]]''.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Hudson appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series under the code name Vindicator, voiced by [[Barry Flatman]]. He conspired with the head of Alpha Flight to force Wolverine's return to Canada so they can conduct experiments on how he was able to survive the [[adamantium]] bonding process and, if possible, extract the adamantium from his skeleton, regardless of the possibility of killing Wolverine. He felt heavily betrayed by Wolverine leaving Alpha Flight and used that as justification for his actions. He also deceived his team into believing he was bringing Wolverine back to the team. Throughout his battle with Logan, he was able to use his force field to protect himself from Wolverine's claws. However, when it failed, he was at Logan's mercy. Wolverine told him that the only reason he was still breathing after the battle is that he loved Vindicator's wife Heather. He also threatened that, if he or Alpha Flight came after him again, all bets were off.\n\n===Video games===\n* Guardian also appears as an NPC in ''[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. He and Vindicator are encountered in an abandoned Weapon X facility. He has special dialogue with Wolverine.\n* Guardian appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n*In 2008, Hasbro released an action figure of Guardian in its Marvel Legends line which was exclusive to Walmart.\n*In 2019, Hasbro released another Marvel Legends figure which came with a Build-A-Figure piece of another Canadian character, [[Wendigo (comics)|the Wendigo]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://alphaflight.net/showwiki/Guardian_I AlphaFlight.Net Alphanex Entry on - Guardian]\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Guardian_%28James_Hudson%29 Guardian] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Flight Program}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guardian Guardian (Marvel Comics)}}\n[[Category:Canadian superheroes]]\n[[Category:Canadian-themed superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Ontario]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Powered exoskeletons in fiction]]\n[[Category:X-Men supporting characters]]\n", "name_user": "TCB297", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_(Marvel_Comics)"}

Building restrictions required all homes to cost a minimum of $2,000, Wide streets were paved throughout the area as part of the initial subdivision. Advertisements described Angelus Vista as part of an up-and-coming section of the city with excellent views of the mountains to the north.  Nearby amenities mentioned in early advertisements included the Los Angeles Country Club to the north and Harvard Military College, a private boys' school to the east. Historically, the Angelus Vista area was serviced by two streetcar lines: the 16th Street Santa Monica Electric Car along what is now Venice Blvd and the Pico Streetcar line. <ref name=report>{{cite web |title=Los Angeles Department of City Planning RECOMMENDATION REPORT |url=http://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinedocs/2018/18-0330_rpt_CHC_07-12-2018.pdf |website=LA City Planning |accessdate=7 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, the [[Los Angeles Times]] ran a story boasting that many of the dwellings in new housing tracts were fine specimens of architectural work. An Angelus Vista home, located on St. Andrews Street was featured. The house was heated by hot air, lighted by gas and electricity, and estimated to have cost $8,500. <ref>{{cite news |title=Doings of Buildings and Architects |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=November 8, 1903}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, a neighborhood property located at 1848 South Gramercy Place was nominated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument.

The commision determined that even though the subject property does date from the early period of theneighborhood\u2019s development, it no longer retains sufficient integrity to individually convey its significance.  The application was denied. <ref name=report></ref>\n\n==Angelus Vista Historic District==\n\nWithin Angelus Vista is the Angeles Vista Historic District.

The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively, and both reached the top 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. To promote the album, Lipa is scheduled to embark on the [[List of Dua Lipa concert tours#Future Nostalgia Tour (2021)|Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.

It is sometimes referred to as '''queer culture''' (indicating people who are [[queer]]), while the term '''gay culture''' may be used to mean \"LGBT culture\" or to refer specifically to homosexual culture.\n\nLGBT culture varies widely by geography and the identity of the participants.

Such LGBT communities organize special events in addition to pride parades celebrating their culture such as the [[Gay Games]] and [[Southern Decadence]].\n\n== Gay male culture ==\n{{main category|Male homosexuality}}\nAccording to Herdt, \"[[homosexuality]]\" was the main term used until the late 1950s and early 1960s; after that, a new \"gay\" culture emerged. \"This new gay culture increasingly marks a full spectrum of social life: not only same-sex desires but gay selves, gay neighbors, and gay social practices that are distinctive of our affluent, postindustrial society\".<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Gilbert|editor-last=Herdt|title=Gay Culture in America: Essays from the Field|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=1992|isbn=978-0807079157|url=https://archive.org/details/gaycultureinamer00bost}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, gay culture was largely underground or coded, relying on in-group symbols and codes woven into ostensibly [[heterosexuality|straight]] appearances. Gay influence in early America was more often visible in [[high culture]], where it was nominally safer to be out. The association of gay men with [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[haute couture|couture]], fine [[cuisine]], [[musical theater]], the Golden Age of [[Hollywood]] and [[interior design]] began with wealthy homosexual men using the straight themes of these media to send their own signals. In the [[heterocentric]] [[Marilyn Monroe]] film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', a musical number features [[Jane Russell]] singing \"Anyone Here for Love\" in a gym while muscled men dance around her. The men's costumes were designed by a man, the dance was choreographed by a man and the dancers (as gay screenwriter [[Paul Rudnick]] points out) \"seem more interested in each other than in Russell\"; however, her presence gets the sequence past the [[censors]] and works it into an overall [[heterocentric]] theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202085421/http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |archivedate=2010-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1969 [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall uprising]] in [[LGBT culture in New York City|New York City]] was covered on the mainstream news channels, showing images of gay men rioting in the streets, gay male culture among the working classes, people of color, street people, radical political activists and hippies became more visible to mainstream America. Groups such as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] formed in New York City, and the [[Mattachine Society]], which had been in existence and doing media since 1950, gained more visibility as they addressed the crowds and media in the wake of the uprisings in [[Greenwich Village]]. On June 28, 1970 the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day]] was held, marking the beginning of annual [[Gay Pride]] marches. \n\nIn 1980 a group of seven gay men formed [[The Violet Quill]] in New York City, a literary club focused on writing about the gay experience as a normal plotline instead of a \"naughty\" sideline in a mostly straight story. An example is the novel ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]'' by [[Edmund White]]. In this first volume of a trilogy, White writes as a young [[homophilic]] narrator growing up with a corrupt and remote father. The young man learns bad habits from his straight father, applying them to his gay existence.\n\nFemale celebrities such as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Bette Midler]] spent a significant amount of their social time with urban gay men (who were now popularly viewed as sophisticated and stylish by the [[jet set]]), and more male celebrities (such as [[Andy Warhol]]) were open about their relationships. Such openness was still limited to the largest and most progressive urban areas (such as New York City, [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New Orleans]]), however, until AIDS forced several popular celebrities out of the closet due to their illness with what was known at first as the \"gay cancer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebody.com//www.thebodypro.com/article/timeline-25-milestones-time-aids|title=Timeline: 25 Milestones in Our Time With AIDS &#124; TheBody|website=www.thebody.com}}</ref>\n\nElements identified more closely with gay men than with other groups include:\n*Pop-culture [[gay icon]]s who have had a traditionally gay-male following (for example, [[disco]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Cher]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Diana Ross]])\n*Familiarity with aspects of romantic, sexual and social life common among gay men (for example, [[Polari]], [[poppers]], [[camp (style)|camp]], [[fag hag]]s and\u2014in [[South Asia]]n [[LGBTQ+]] culture\u2014\"evening people\")<ref>Ratti, Rakesh (Ed.)

There are also subcultures with an historically large gay-male population, such as [[leather subculture|leather]] and [[sadomasochism|SM]]. Gay critic Michael Musto opined, \"I am a harsh critic of the gay community because I feel that when I first came out I thought I would be entering a world of nonconformity and individuality and, ''au contraire'', it turned out to be a world of clones in a certain way.

His characters have recently been updated and moved to the Web. Although primarily humorous, the comic sometimes addressed issues such as [[gay-bashing]], [[HIV]], and [[spousal abuse]].\n\nAn Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 discovered how some gay men felt like they were expected to be hyper-sexual. Participants reported how other gay men would automatically assume that any interaction had sexual motivations. Furthermore, if it was then clarified that this is not the case then these gay men would suddenly feel excluded and ignored by the other gay men with which they had been interacting with. They felt that they could not obtain purely platonic friendships with other gay men. One participant reported feeling alienated and disregarded as a person if they were not deemed by other gay men as sexually attractive. This presumption and attitude of hypersexuality is damaging, for it enforces preconceived ideals upon people, who are then ostracised if they do not meet these ideals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=James Roffee & Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190\u2013201 | year=2016 | last1 = Roffee | first1 = James A.}}</ref>\n\n=== Online culture and communities ===\nA number of online social websites for gay men have been established.

Members held public demonstrations, spoke to the media, and published a newsletter. \n\nPrimarily associated with lesbians in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, lesbian culture has often involved large, predominantly lesbian \"women's\" events such as the [[Michigan Womyn's Music Festival]]<ref>Lo, Malinda [http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/2005/4/michigan.html Behind the Scenes at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813004815/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/Music/2005/4/michigan.html |date=2008-08-13 }} April 20, 2005 [[AfterEllen]]</ref> (closed after 2015) and the [[Club Skirts Dinah Shore Weekend]].<ref>[http://palmsprings.gaycities.com/events/17945-dinah-shore-weekend-2011-the-official-club-skirts-event#org_desc] Ficera, Kim [http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2006/2/quote-dinah.html Don't Quote Me: Dinah Shore Weekend] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326191505/http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2006/2/quote-dinah.html|date=2008-03-26}} February 22, 2006 [[AfterEllen]]</ref><ref>Downs, Maggie [http://www.mydesert.com/article/20100328/EVENTS23/3280342/Dinah%20Shore%20events%20began%20with%20a%20round%20of%20golf Dinah Shore events part of celebration that began with a round of golf] March 28, 2010 The Desert Sun</ref> Lesbian culture has its own icons, such as [[Melissa Etheridge]], [[k.d. lang]] ([[Butch and femme|butch]]), [[Ellen DeGeneres]] ([[androgynous]]) and [[Portia de Rossi]] (femme).

Identity-based sports teams have also been associated with lesbian culture, particularly with the rise of lesbian softball teams and leagues in the 1980s and 1990s.

Many of the transgender youth that are placed in homeless shelters do not get the type of help they need and often experience discrimination and systemic barriers that include sex-segregated programs in institutional practices that refuse to understand their gender. Many transgender youths have problems acquiring shelters because of certain policies like binary gender rules, dress codes, and room assignments (Thaler et al., 2009). Problems with classification happen when the procedures or policies of a shelter require the youth to be segregated based on their assigned sex rather than what they classify themselves as. As a result, many of the LGBT youth end up on the street instead of shelters which are meant to protect them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shelton|first=Jama|date=December 2015|title=Transgender youth homelessness: Understanding programmatic barriers through the lens of cisgenderism|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|volume=59|pages=10\u201318|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.10.006}}</ref>\n\nLGBT youth also have a higher suicide rate in the U.S. Those who identify with the LGBT community are four times as likely to attempt suicide than those who do not.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Dustin T.|last2=Hatzenbuehler|first2=Mark L.|date=February 2014|title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Hate Crimes and Suicidality Among a Population-Based Sample of Sexual-Minority Adolescents in Boston|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=104|issue=2|pages=272\u2013278|doi=10.2105/ajph.2013.301424|pmid=24328619|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3935714}}</ref> There was a study that was done to look into the difference of rates between gay high school students and their straight peers.

The two largest are [[Atlanta Black Pride]] and [[D.C. Black Pride]]. \n\n'''Movements and politics''' {{Main|LGBT social movements|LGBT conservatism}}\nLGBT social movements are [[social movements]] that advocate for LGBT people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. \n\n[[LGBT conservatism]] is a socio-political movement which embraces and promotes the ideology of [[conservatism]] within an [[LGBT]] context. \n\n=={{anchor|Criticism and dissent}}Criticism==\nCriticism of LGBTQ+ culture comes from a variety of sources. Some, like [[Michael Musto]], view the culture as conforming to caricatures or stereotypes that alienate \"fringe\" members of the community. [[Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore]] and movements like [[Gay Shame]] have argued that LGBT culture has been depoliticized by a tiny minority of relatively privileged queer people, who participate in \"institutions of oppression\" at the expense of the vast majority of LGBT people.<ref name=\"bernstein-sycamore\">{{Cite web|url=https://truthout.org/articles/transgender-troops-should-be-an-oxymoron/|title=\"Transgender Troops\" Should Be an Oxymoron|first=Mattilda Bernstein|last=Sycamore|website=Truthout}}</ref> Some consider the very notion of \"separatism\", or a group lifestyle, alienating (including of LGBTQ+ members in the broader society).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAnother problem is that [[bisexual]] and [[transsexual]]/[[transgender]] individuals experience social pressure to identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]], and may face ostracism and discrimination from the mainstream LGBTQ+ culture. For bisexuals, this pressure is known as [[bisexual erasure]]. [[New York University School of Law]] professor [[Kenji Yoshino]] has written, \"Gays de-legitimatize bisexuals...the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'\".<ref>Yoshino, Kenji (2000).

In particular, labels that LGBTQ+ members use to describe themselves vary widely; some simply prefer to identify as loving a particular gender. Some believe that the LGBTQ+-community concept is alienating; the term itself implies estrangement from straight people as a separate group. Further, including three groups involved with ''sexuality'' and one group exploring transsexual/transgender ''identity'' (a broader phenomenon) is artificial.<ref>Prosser, J (1998) Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality. New York: Columbia University Press p. 59</ref>\n\nMattilda Berstein Sycamore argues that the single-issue focus of LGBT politics, which ignores all [[intersectionality|intra-group differences]], has naturally led to a movement and culture focused on the needs of white, middle-class gay cisgender men, which alienates anyone who does not fit that description.<ref name=\"bernstein-sycamore\"/>\n\n=== Cultural focus on promiscuity ===\n{{See also|slut shaming|homonormativity|respectability politics}}\nSome gay male commentators who are in [[monogamy|monogamous relationships]] argue that mainstream gay culture's disdain of monogamy and its promotion of [[promiscuity]] has harmed efforts to legalize [[same-sex marriage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaypatriot.net/2008/06/20/gay-groups-ignore-monogamy-when-discussing-marriage/|title=Gay Groups Ignore Monogamy when Promoting Marriage|date=June 20, 2008}}</ref> Yuvraj Joshi argues that efforts to legalize same-sex marriage have emphasized the sameness of gay people to heterosexuals, while privatizing their queer differences.<ref>{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/43.2/Joshi.pdf\n |title       = Respectable Queerness\n |first       = Yuvraj\n |last        = Joshi\n |date        = May 2012\n |publisher   = Columbia Human Rights Law Review\n |volume      = 43\n |issue       = 2\n |pages       = 415\u2013467\n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120523070719/http://www3.law.columbia.edu/hrlr/hrlr_journal/43.2/Joshi.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-05-23\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\n=== Racism ===\n{{Main|Racism in the LGBT community}}\n\nBritish journalist [[Mark Simpson (journalist)|Mark Simpson's]] 1996 book, ''Anti-Gay'', describes forms of intolerance by the mainstream gay community towards subgroups.

Such LGBT communities organize special events in addition to pride parades celebrating their culture such as the [[Gay Games]] and [[Southern Decadence]].\n\n== Gay male culture ==\n{{main category|Male homosexuality}}\nAccording to Herdt, \"[[homosexuality]]\" was the main term used until the late 1950s and early 1960s; after that, a new \"gay\" culture emerged. \"This new gay culture increasingly marks a full spectrum of social life: not only same-sex desires but gay selves, gay neighbors, and gay social practices that are distinctive of our affluent, postindustrial society\".<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Gilbert|editor-last=Herdt|title=Gay Culture in America: Essays from the Field|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=1992|isbn=978-0807079157|url=https://archive.org/details/gaycultureinamer00bost}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, gay culture was largely underground or coded, relying on in-group symbols and codes woven into ostensibly [[heterosexuality|straight]] appearances. Gay influence in early America was more often visible in [[high culture]], where it was nominally safer to be out. The association of gay men with [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[haute couture|couture]], fine [[cuisine]], [[musical theater]], the Golden Age of [[Hollywood]] and [[interior design]] began with wealthy homosexual men using the straight themes of these media to send their own signals. In the [[heterocentric]] [[Marilyn Monroe]] film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', a musical number features [[Jane Russell]] singing \"Anyone Here for Love\" in a gym while muscled men dance around her. The men's costumes were designed by a man, the dance was choreographed by a man and the dancers (as gay screenwriter [[Paul Rudnick]] points out) \"seem more interested in each other than in Russell\"; however, her presence gets the sequence past the [[censors]] and works it into an overall [[heterocentric]] theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202085421/http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/celluloid/misc/history.html |archivedate=2010-02-02 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1969 [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall uprising]] in [[LGBT culture in New York City|New York City]] was covered on the mainstream news channels, showing images of gay men rioting in the streets, gay male culture among the working classes, people of color, street people, radical political activists and hippies became more visible to mainstream America. Groups such as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] formed in New York City, and the [[Mattachine Society]], which had been in existence and doing media since 1950, gained more visibility as they addressed the crowds and media in the wake of the uprisings in [[Greenwich Village]]. On June 28, 1970 the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day]] was held, marking the beginning of annual [[Gay Pride]] marches. \n\nIn 1980 a group of seven gay men formed [[The Violet Quill]] in New York City, a literary club focused on writing about the gay experience as a normal plotline instead of a \"naughty\" sideline in a mostly straight story. An example is the novel ''[[A Boy's Own Story]]'' by [[Edmund White]]. In this first volume of a trilogy, White writes as a young [[homophilic]] narrator growing up with a corrupt and remote father. The young man learns bad habits from his straight father, applying them to his gay existence.\n\nFemale celebrities such as [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jane Fonda]], and [[Bette Midler]] spent a significant amount of their social time with urban gay men (who were now popularly viewed as sophisticated and stylish by the [[jet set]]), and more male celebrities (such as [[Andy Warhol]]) were open about their relationships. Such openness was still limited to the largest and most progressive urban areas (such as New York City, [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Seattle]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], [[Houston]], [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[New Orleans]]), however, until AIDS forced several popular celebrities out of the closet due to their illness with what was known at first as the \"gay cancer\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebody.com//www.thebodypro.com/article/timeline-25-milestones-time-aids|title=Timeline: 25 Milestones in Our Time With AIDS &#124; TheBody|website=www.thebody.com}}</ref>\n\nElements identified more closely with gay men than with other groups include:\n*Pop-culture [[gay icon]]s who have had a traditionally gay-male following (for example, [[disco]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Cher]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Kesha]], [[Kylie Minogue]], and [[Diana Ross]])\n*Familiarity with aspects of romantic, sexual and social life common among gay men (for example, [[Polari]], [[poppers]], [[camp (style)|camp]], [[fag hag]]s and\u2014in [[South Asia]]n [[LGBTQ+]] culture\u2014\"evening people\")<ref>Ratti, Rakesh (Ed.)

There are also subcultures with an historically large gay-male population, such as [[leather subculture|leather]] and [[sadomasochism|SM]]. Gay critic Michael Musto opined, \"I am a harsh critic of the gay community because I feel that when I first came out I thought I would be entering a world of nonconformity and individuality and, ''au contraire'', it turned out to be a world of clones in a certain way.

His characters have recently been updated and moved to the Web. Although primarily humorous, the comic sometimes addressed issues such as [[gay-bashing]], [[HIV]], and [[spousal abuse]].\n\nAn Australian study conducted by Roffee and Waling in 2016 discovered how some gay men felt like they were expected to be hyper-sexual. Participants reported how other gay men would automatically assume that any interaction had sexual motivations. Furthermore, if it was then clarified that this is not the case then these gay men would suddenly feel excluded and ignored by the other gay men with which they had been interacting with. They felt that they could not obtain purely platonic friendships with other gay men. One participant reported feeling alienated and disregarded as a person if they were not deemed by other gay men as sexually attractive. This presumption and attitude of hypersexuality is damaging, for it enforces preconceived ideals upon people, who are then ostracised if they do not meet these ideals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=James Roffee & Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190\u2013201 | year=2016 | last1 = Roffee | first1 = James A.}}</ref>\n\n=== Online culture and communities ===\nA number of online social websites for gay men have been established.

Identity-based sports teams have also been associated with lesbian culture, particularly with the rise of lesbian softball teams and leagues in the 1980s and 1990s.

In the 1970s, [[androgyny]], political lesbianism, and lesbian separatism became more common, along with the creation of women's land communities.

Many transgender youths have problems acquiring shelters because of certain policies like binary gender rules, dress codes, and room assignments (Thaler et al., 2009). Problems with classification happen when the procedures or policies of a shelter require the youth to be segregated based on their assigned sex rather than what they classify themselves as.

The two largest are [[Atlanta Black Pride]] and [[D.C. Black Pride]]. \n\n'''Movements and politics''' {{Main|LGBT social movements|LGBT conservatism}}\nLGBT social movements are [[social movements]] that advocate for LGBT people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. \n\n[[LGBT conservatism]] is a socio-political movement which embraces and promotes the ideology of [[conservatism]] within an [[LGBT]] context. \n\n=={{anchor|Criticism and dissent}}Criticism==\nCriticism of LGBTQ+ culture comes from a variety of sources. Some, like [[Michael Musto]], view the culture as conforming to caricatures or stereotypes that alienate \"fringe\" members of the community. [[Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore]] and movements like [[Gay Shame]] have argued that LGBT culture has been depoliticized by a tiny minority of relatively privileged queer people, who participate in \"institutions of oppression\" at the expense of the vast majority of LGBT people.<ref name=\"bernstein-sycamore\">{{Cite web|url=https://truthout.org/articles/transgender-troops-should-be-an-oxymoron/|title=\"Transgender Troops\" Should Be an Oxymoron|first=Mattilda Bernstein|last=Sycamore|website=Truthout}}</ref> Some consider the very notion of \"separatism\", or a group lifestyle, alienating (including of LGBTQ+ members in the broader society).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAnother problem is that [[bisexual]] and [[transsexual]]/[[transgender]] individuals experience social pressure to identify as [[gay]] or [[lesbian]], and may face ostracism and discrimination from the mainstream LGBTQ+ culture. For bisexuals, this pressure is known as [[bisexual erasure]]. [[New York University School of Law]] professor [[Kenji Yoshino]] has written, \"Gays de-legitimatize bisexuals...the lesbian and gay community abounds with negative images of bisexuals as fence-sitters, traitors, cop-outs, closet cases, people whose primary goal in life is to retain 'heterosexual privilege'\".<ref>Yoshino, Kenji (2000).

In particular, labels that LGBTQ+ members use to describe themselves vary widely; some simply prefer to identify as loving a particular gender. Some believe that the LGBTQ+-community concept is alienating; the term itself implies estrangement from straight people as a separate group. Further, including three groups involved with ''sexuality'' and one group exploring transsexual/transgender ''identity'' (a broader phenomenon) is artificial.<ref>Prosser, J (1998) Second Skins: The Body Narratives of Transsexuality.
