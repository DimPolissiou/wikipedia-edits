It is situated in the central part of [[North Zealand]] (the northeastern region of [[Zealand]]), straddling the boundaries of the municipalities [[Hiller\u00f8d Municipality|Hiller\u00f8d]], [[Fredensborg Municipality|Fredensborg]], [[Helsing\u00f8r Municipality|Helsing\u00f8r]] and [[Gribskov Municipality|Gribskov]], some 40 kilometres north of [[Copenhagen]].\n\nThe lake covers 17&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, Its length from north to south is 8.4&nbsp;km and its maximum depth is 22 m. Its principal drainage is [[Esrum \u00c5]], a 10-km stream which passes [[Esrum Watermill]] and the remains of [[Esrum Abbey]] on its way to the [[Kattegat]] at [[Dronningm\u00f8lle]]. The western shore of the lake is dominated by [[Gribskov]], one of Denmark's largest forests, and the small town of [[N\u00f8debo]]. [[Fredensborg Palace]], one of the official residences of the Danish Royal Family, with its extensive gardens, is situated on the southeast shore. Boat trips operate on the lake from S\u00f8rup, a village just south of the palace gardens.\n\n==History==\n\n===Commercial fishing===\nLike many of the surrounding forests, Lake Esrum was originally a royal domain. It was first administrated by ''Tentekammeret'' and later by ''Frederiksborg Amtsstue'' on behalf of the Danish government. Fishing in the lake was entrusted with a fishing master (Danish: ''fiskemester'') who resided at Fiskerg\u00e5rden, located next to Slotsm\u00f8llen at Slotss\u00f8en in Hiller\u00f8d. From 1864, fishing was carried out by private citizens and from 1907, fishing rights were sold at auction. Commercial fishing continued until 1989.\n\n===Esrum canal===\n[[File:V\u00e6ltningen 1820.jpg|thumb|200px|V\u00e6ltningen as seen on a watercolour byO.J. Rawert from 1820]]\n[[File:Esrum S\u00f8 - towpath.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Transportation of firewood along the western shore of Lake Esrum in about 1830]]\nFrom the beginning of the 19th century, Lake Esrum played a role in the transport of firewood from Grib Forest to Copenhagen. From 1802 to 1805, a canal was constructed between the north end of the lake and [[Dronningm\u00f8lle]]. Here firewood was loaded onto large cargo ships and sailed to Copenhagen. The canal was 9&nbsp;km long, 9 m wide and 1.5 m deep. The work was led by [[Adolph von der Recke]] and carried out by local peasants, soldiers and forced labour workers. A [[towpath]] ran on the banks of the canal and on the western shores of lake Esrum. The timber had to pass a 4-metre crater-like ramp called ''V\u00e6ltningen'', which connected the upper section of the canal to its lower part. The upper part of the canal passed two ponds. One of them, Storedam (Great Pond), was the site of a watermill which was first used as backup for the gunpowder mill in [[Frederiksv\u00e6rk]] during the [[English Wars (Scandinavia)|English Wars]] and later for the manufacturing of textiles for the army. Transportation of firewood on the canal continued until 1874 and it was later used for leisure trips. It has now dried out and been covered by forest, but V\u00e6ltningen and other elements are still visible in the landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.munkerup.net/Historie/Pramfart.htm|title=Pramfarten p\u00e5 Esrum \u00c5|language=Danish|publisher=Folk og minder i Nordsj\u00e6lland|accessdate=2014-12-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170746/http://www.munkerup.net/Historie/Pramfart.htm|archivedate=2014-02-22}}</ref>\n\n[[File:S\u00f8rup 1876 (Hans Ole Brasen).jpg|thumb|200px|S\u00f8rup in 1876, painting by [[Hans Ole Brasen]] ]]\n\n===S\u00f8rup's washhouses===\nFrom the middle of the 19th century, the small village of S\u00f8rup on the southeastern shores of the lake was home to numerous laundries.

In the period 1911\u20131913, together with [[Henry Norris Russell]], he developed the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]].\n\nIn 1913 he determined the distances to several [[Cepheid]] variable stars by [[parallax]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hertzsprung |first1=E. |title=\u00dcber die r\u00e4umliche Verteilung der Ver\u00e4nderlichen vom \u03b4 Cephei-Typus |journal=Astronomische Nachrichten |date=1913 |volume=196 |issue=4692 |pages=201\u2013208 |trans-title=On the spatial distribution of variable [stars] of the \u03b4 Cephei type |language=German|bibcode=1913AN....196..201H }}</ref> and was thus able to calibrate the relationship, discovered by [[Henrietta Leavitt]], between Cepheid period and [[luminosity]]. In this determination he made a mistake, possibly a slip of the pen, putting the stars 10 times too close. He used this relationship to estimate the distance to the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. From 1919 to 1946, Hertzsprung worked at [[Leiden Observatory]] in the Netherlands, from 1937 as director. Among his graduate students at Leiden was [[Gerard Kuiper]].\n\nPerhaps his greatest contribution to astronomy was the development of a classification system for stars to divide them by spectral type, stage in their development, and luminosity.

In the period 1911\u20131913, together with [[Henry Norris Russell]], he developed the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]].\n\nIn 1913 he determined the distances to several [[Cepheid]] variable stars by [[parallax]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hertzsprung |first1=E. |title=\u00dcber die r\u00e4umliche Verteilung der Ver\u00e4nderlichen vom \u03b4 Cephei-Typus |journal=Astronomische Nachrichten |date=1913 |volume=196 |issue=4692 |pages=201\u2013208 |trans-title=On the spatial distribution of variable [stars] of the \u03b4 Cephei type |language=German|bibcode=1913AN....196..201H }}</ref> and was thus able to calibrate the relationship, discovered by [[Henrietta Leavitt]], between Cepheid period and [[luminosity]]. In this determination he made a mistake, possibly a slip of the pen, putting the stars 10 times too close. He used this relationship to estimate the distance to the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]]. From 1919 to 1946, Hertzsprung worked at [[Leiden Observatory]] in the Netherlands, from 1937 as director. Among his graduate students at Leiden was [[Gerard Kuiper]].\n\nPerhaps his greatest contribution to astronomy was the development of a classification system for stars to divide them by spectral type, stage in their development, and luminosity. He used the earlier classification system developed by [[Antonia Maury]] in his work.<ref>Hoffleit, D. \"Reminiscences on Antonia Maury and the c-Characteristic.\" ''The MK Process at 50 Years: A Powerful Tool for Astrophysical Insight''.

{"title_page": "Magical creatures in Harry Potter", "text_new": "{{use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magical creatures in ''Harry Potter''}}\n'''Magical creatures''' are an aspect of the [[Harry Potter universe|fictional wizarding world]] contained in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' series, both by British author [[J. K. Rowling]]. Throughout the seven books of the series, [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry]] and his friends come across many of these creatures on their adventures, as well as in their [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lessons at [[Hogwarts]]. Rowling has also written ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', a guide to the magical beasts found in the series. Many of these are derived from [[folklore]], primarily [[Greek mythology]], but also [[English folklore|British]] and [[Scandinavian folklore]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Many of the legends surrounding mythical creatures are also incorporated in the books. \"Children ... know that I didn't invent [[unicorn]]s, but I've had to explain frequently that I didn't actually invent [[hippogriff]]s,\" Rowling told [[Stephen Fry]] in an interview for [[BBC Radio 4]]. \"When I do use a creature that I know is a [[myth]]ological entity, I like to find out as much as I can about it. I might not use it, but to make it as consistent as I feel is good for my plot.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Living with Harry Potter |work=Accio Quote! |year=2005 |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/1205-bbc-fry.html |accessdate=13 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602092002/http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/1205-bbc-fry.html |archivedate=2 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nSome creatures in the series are ordinary animals but may be imbued with magical properties or possess certain magical abilities. [[Owl]]s, for example, deliver mail and have the ability to find the recipient regardless of their location.  Other animals such as cats, frogs and rats do not necessarily have magical abilities.<!-- Mrs Norris is an example - According Rowling, there is nothing particularly magical about her, other than being \"an intelligent (and unpleasant) cat\", whereas Crookshanks is a half Kneazle. -->\n\n==Magizoology==\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' franchise, Magizoology (a [[portmanteau]] of \"magic\" and \"[[zoology]]\") is the study of magical creatures. A person who studies Magizoology is known as a magizoologist. There are magizoologists who work in the [[Ministry of Magic]], particularly in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. One notable magizoologist is [[Newt Scamander]], who in the universe of the series, is the author of ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' and the ''[[main character]]'' in the ''[[Fantastic Beasts]]'' franchise, which serves as a prequel to the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' story.\n\n==Regulation and classification==\nThe [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] of the [[Ministry of Magic]] is responsible for overseeing and regulating magical creatures. It is divided into three divisions: the Beast Division, the Being Division, and the Spirit Division.\n\nA \"being\" is generally defined, according to ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them|Fantastic Beasts]]'', as \"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws.\" This includes [[human]]s, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], [[#House-elves|house-elves]], [[#Giants|giants]], [[#Goblins|goblins]], [[hag]]s, [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#veela|veela]]s, and [[vampires]]. [[Fairy|Fairies]], [[pixie]]s, [[gnome]]s, and most other creatures are classified as \"beasts.\" Affairs related to [[#Ghosts|ghosts]] come under the [[wikt:auspice|auspices]] of the Spirit Division.\n\nThe definition is not without its problems: [[#Werewolves|Werewolves]] and [[Animagus|Animagi]] are typically in human form, but may transform into an animal. (A werewolf transforms from the human state only at the [[full moon]], but an Animagus is a human who has learned to transform into an animal at will.) Their classification is unclear, and offices responsible for werewolves exist in both the Beast and Being Divisions. [[Banshee]]s and [[#Dementors|Dementors]] have never been officially classified. (See below.) [[#Centaurs|Centaurs]], [[leprechaun]]s and [[Piscine humanoid|merpeople]] ([[mermaid]]s and [[merman|mermen]]) have rejected \"being\" status in favour of \"beast\" status.\n\nThe fictional ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' book also assigns a threat rating to each creature, in the form of \"X\" marks. Five Xs means \"Known wizard killer/impossible to domesticate\". Four Xs means \"Dangerous/requires specialist knowledge/skilled wizard may handle\". Three means \"Competent wizard should cope\". Two means \"Harmless/may be domesticated\". One means \"boring\". Creatures that need to be treated with a sophisticated amount of respect, e.g. Centaurs, [[Unicorn]]s, [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenixes]], and merpeople, are given a XXXX rating. \u2260\n\n==List of magical creatures==\n<!--Do not add the rating or an explanation of the rating. Those are Rowling's copyright. Also, do not add a link to another part of this article. The links are for showing which monsters Rowling took from folklore and which she did not.-->\nBelow is a list of magical creatures mentioned in the ''Harry Potter'' universe. For a list of magical plants mentioned in the series, such as [[mandrake (mythology)|mandrake]]s and [[devil's snare]]s, see [[List of fictional plants in Harry Potter|List of fictional plants]].\n\n===Creatures===\n<!--NOTE: before adding another beast, please check the \"Status unknown\" list to see if it is not already there-->\n* '''{{visible anchor|Billywig}}''' \u2013 Vivid blue Australian insects which are common but rarely noticed by muggles.

Hoch's mother, who had read the first three books to Hoch during her treatment for [[neuroblastoma]], emailed Rowling to ask her when the fourth book would be released, and Rowling gifted Hoch with transatlantic phone calls in which she read her extracts from the unpublished book, including explanations of the blast-ended skrewts, which Rowling described as looking like headless [[lobster]]s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Laurence |first=Charles |date=29 December 2002 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1417303/J.-K.-Rowling-read-unfinished-book-to-dying-girl.html |title=J.

As a result, their appropriate classification is unknown. Among them are:\n\n* Blibbering Humdinger \u2013 Luna mentioned these creatures when Lavender Brown and Parvati Pitill were laughing at her earrings.\n* Crumple-Horned Snorkack \u2013 an elusive creature that is said to live in Sweden. Xenophilius Lovegood acquired an Erumpent horn that he believed was from a Snorkack. The Erumpent exploded after being hit by a stunning spell and destroyed much of his house. Luna searched the world for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack, but never found one. Luna explicitly states that the creature cannot fly.\n* Xenophilius claimed that Luna was fishing for Freshwater Plimpies when she was being held prisoner at Malfoy Manor.\n* Gulping Plimpy \u2013 a Gulping Plimpy is supposedly a breed of Plimpy that is repelled by Gurdyroots.\n* Heliopath \u2013 an alleged spirit of fire that gallops and burns anything in its path.\n* Nargle \u2013 the Nargles are said to infest mistletoes and are expert thieves. Luna Lovegood claims that her Butterbeer cork necklace and her Dirigible plum earrings keep the Nargles away and that her papers and shoes were taken by Nargles.\n* Wrackspurt \u2013 in an early scene in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' film, Luna wears a pair of \"Spectrespecs\" enabling her to see Wrackspurts\u2014which in turn reveal Harry's prone form underneath his invisibility cloak, and allow her to rescue him. During a [[Point of view shot|point of view]] scene, Wrackspurts resemble floating points of light.\n\n==Prominent creatures==\n\n===Acromantula===\n[[File:Aragog (7119116887).jpg|150px|thumb]]\nIn the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], the '''Acromantula''' is a monstrous spider capable of human speech. It originated in Borneo, where it inhabits dense jungle. Its distinctive features include the thick black hair that covers its body; its legspan, which may reach up to fifteen feet; its pincers, which produce a distinctive clicking sound when the Acromantula is excited or angry; and a venomous secretion. The Acromantula is carnivorous and prefers large prey. It spins dome-shaped webs on the ground. The female is bigger than the male and may lay up to one hundred eggs at a time. Soft and white, these are as large as beach balls. The young hatch in six to eight weeks. Acromantula eggs are defined as Class A Non-Tradeable Goods by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, meaning that severe penalties are attached to their importation or sale.\n\nThis beast is believed to be wizard-bred, possibly intended to guard wizard dwellings or treasure, as is often the case with magically bred monsters. Despite its near-human intelligence, the Acromantula is untrainable and highly dangerous to wizard and Muggle alike.<ref>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</ref> Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for possession of the Acromantula Aragog who was thought by Hogwarts teachers to be the monster in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\n===Basilisk===\nIn the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], a '''[[Basilisk]]''' is a monstrous serpentine creature. Larger than [[basilisk|counterpart from real-life legends]], this Basilisk is capable of reaching a length up to fifty feet and living up to hundreds of years. Basilisks are uncontrollable except by [[Parselmouth]]s, and the first basilisk is believed to have been created by a Greek Dark wizard and Parselmouth named [[Herpo The Foul]].{{HPF}} Herpo made this discovery by hatching a chicken egg under a toad. A male basilisk has a scarlet plume on its head.{{HPF}} A basilisk kills both with its powerful venom and its huge yellow eyes, which are immediately lethal to any creature who looks at them directly.{{HPF}} To anyone who looks at it indirectly, such as through a camera or in a reflection, it creates a profound state of petrification similar to a [[Medusa]] stare. Ghosts who either look at it directly or indirectly will only become petrified, since they could not die a second time.{{HP2}} A phoenix tear is the only known cure for the devastating effect of the basilisk's venom. Spiders flee from the basilisk, as they are mortal enemies. The basilisk itself flees only from the crowing of a rooster, which if heard by the basilisk is fatal, and the [[weasel]] whose odor will also kill a basilisk.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', a female basilisk inhabits the [[Chamber of Secrets]] below Hogwarts. When student Tom Riddle, later known as [[Voldemort]], opened the chamber, the basilisk merely petrified several students (students looked at a reflection of basilisk) and killed one student named Myrtle (later known as Moaning Myrtle) with her stare and hid in the chamber for 50 years, until Riddle's memory opened the chamber again by possessing [[Ginny Weasley]]. The basilisk attempts to kill several Muggle-borns, but due to good fortune all its victims were merely petrified. Riddle commanded Ginny Weasley to kill all the school roosters remarked upon by Hagrid. When Harry discovers the chamber, Riddle reveals his identity and sets the basilisk loose upon Harry while Ginny's life force ebbs away. [[#Fawkes|Fawkes]] helps Harry, by blinding the basilisk with his talons and carrying the [[Sorting Hat]]; Harry pulls the [[sword of Godric Gryffindor]] from the hat, and uses it to impale the basilisk in the roof of her mouth, killing her.\n\nThe basilisk's fangs and her venom absorbed by the sword of Gryffindor proved instrumental for destroying most of Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. In ''Chamber of Secrets'', while killing the basilisk at the same time, Harry Potter was stabbed in the arm by the first fang, which broke off and was used by Harry to puncture [[Tom Riddle's diary]] (one of Voldemort's Horcruxes), an act which restored Ginny's life force. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', after losing the sword of Gryffindor to Griphook, [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] return to the chamber and retrieve a fang from the dead basilisk's mouth, using it to destroy [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. This time the chamber was opened by Ron by imitating Harry's [[Parseltongue]]. Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Professor Dumbledore used the sword of Gryffindor, laced with the basilisk's venom, to destroy the locket, Nagini and Marvolo Gaunt's ring, respectively.\n\n===Boggarts===\nIn the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], a '''[[Boggart]]''' is an amortal [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifter]] non-being that takes on the form of its intended victim's worst fear. While British mythology describes boggarts as house-elves who cause trouble or malevolent beings inhabiting marshes or other lonely spots, Rowling's boggarts are more like [[Brollachan]]s, magical creatures originating from [[Scotland]]. However, there is one record of an English ([[Lancashire]]) boggart which could take the form of various animals, or indeed more fearful creatures.<ref>[[John Harland|Harland, J.]] and Wilkinson, T. T. (1857) ''Lancashire Folklore'', Warne & Co., London, p. 55.</ref> The word ''boggart'' was recorded in the [[Survey of English Dialects]] across Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire as a [[bogey man]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Upton |first1=Clive| last2=Parry| first2=David|last3=Widdowson| first3=JDA |title=Survey of English Dialects: the dictionary and the grammar |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415020298 |page=44}}</ref>\n\nBoggarts like to hide in dark, enclosed places, such as closets and cabinets. It is unknown what form a boggart chooses to take when alone. (In ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', [[Mad-Eye Moody]] determines, with his magical eye, that there is a boggart in the desk in the drawing room.)\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] teaches his students in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to approach a boggart in groups of two or more, so that the boggart will have difficulty in choosing which one to frighten. The ''Riddikulus'' charm is used to combat Boggarts, by changing their appearance into a less fearsome or even comical apparition, which weakens the creatures. When Harry Potter approaches the boggart, it takes the form of a Dementor.\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore]] gives the same lesson in ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]''.\n\n===Centaurs===\n[[File:Centaur (Harry Potter Studio Tour - July 2013).jpg|thumb]]\n'''[[Centaur]]s''' in the Harry Potter universe are wild creatures who claim to possess intelligence greater than humans. Their heads and torsos resemble those of humans but they possess the four legs, lower bodies and tail of a horse. Although sentient, they have not requested assignment as beings, preferring to remove themselves entirely from human affairs. Centaurs who decide to associate with humans, such as Firenze, who agrees to teach Divination at Hogwarts, can be seen as traitors to their kind and attacked by other centaurs. Firenze's interest in human affairs resulted in violent reprisals by other centaurs and were it not for Hagrid's intervention, Firenze could have been killed.\n\nThe Ministry of Magic's Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures has a Centaur Liaison Office, but no centaur has ever used it. Centaurs are skilled in healing and astrology, and spend much of their time scouring the stars for portents. They live in forests, and their society consists of groups called herds. They do not appear to employ or need any technology more advanced than a bow and arrow. They are proud and territorial, therefore high diplomatic skills must be employed when dealing with centaurs. Displaying lack of respect to centaurs can have violent consequences, as Dolores Umbridge learned to her cost. In ''Deathly Hallows'', the Hogwarts centaur herd, after being admonished fiercely by Hagrid, takes sides with the Order of the Phoenix, and assist in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nThe films depict the centaurs with bestial and animalistic facial features. The books do not describe them, but several female students are attracted to them.\n\nNamed Centaur characters:\n\n* '''[[#Firenze|Firenze]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/firenze |title=Firenze |access-date=15 June 2019 |work=[[Pottermore]] |publisher=[[Wizarding World]] |agency=[[Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.]]}}</ref>\n* '''Bane'''\n* '''Magorian'''\n* '''Ronan'''\n\n===Dementors===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7528107930).jpg|thumb]]\n{{redirect|Dementor}}\nThe '''dementors''' are \"soulless creatures<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/>&nbsp;... among the foulest beings on Earth\": a phantom species who, as their name suggests, gradually deprive human minds of happiness and intelligence. They are the guards of the wizard prison, [[Azkaban]], until after the return of antagonist Lord Voldemort. [[Albus Dumbledore]] harbors an intense dislike of dementors, noting he has long felt the Ministry of Magic erred in \"allying\" with such creatures, implying that dementor society in general exists apart from the general wizarding world. Dumbledore forbade dementors from entering Hogwarts but this ban was ultimately broken in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, who insisted on being accompanied by a dementor as a bodyguard.\n\nIn the books, dementors have a generally human shape, approximately 3 metres (10&nbsp;feet) in height, covered in dark, hooded cloaks that reveal only their decayed-looking hands. Beneath the cloak, dementors are eyeless, and the only feature of note is the perpetually indrawn breath, by which they consume the emotions and good memories of human beings, forcing the victim to relive its worst memories alone. According to the author, dementors grow like fungi in dark, moist places, creating a dense, chilly fog. Although they are implied to be [[Sentience|sentient]], this is left ambiguous. The presence of a dementor makes the surrounding atmosphere grow cold and dark, and the effects are cumulative with the number of dementors present. The culmination of their power is the 'Dementor's Kiss', wherein the dementor latches its mouth onto a victim's lips and consumes its soul or [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], presumably to leave the victim in a [[persistent vegetative state]], without any memories and feelings left. Dementors are invisible to Muggles, but affect them otherwise identically.\n\nDespite their attachment to human emotion, dementors seem to have difficulty distinguishing one human from another, as demonstrated by Barty Crouch Jr.'s escape from [[Azkaban]], wherein they could detect no emotional difference between the younger Crouch and his mother. Their sensitivity appears less precise in proportion to the emotion's 'complexity'; this particular weakness enabled [[Sirius Black]], an [[Animagus]], to escape Azkaban by transforming into a dog. The principal method against them is the [[Patronus Charm]], which both protects its user and repels the dementors. Dementors have the power to feed off the good feelings and memories when coming in close contact.\n\nHarry first encounters dementors during his third year of school, when they are sent to guard Hogwarts against Sirius Black, thought to be a dangerous criminal at this point in time. Being reminded by their presence of his parents' murder by Voldemort, Harry asks Remus Lupin for assistance, and thus acquires the Patronus Charm. At the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', two dementors are dispatched to Little Whinging to assassinate Harry, and nearly drain the soul from his cousin Dudley Dursley before Harry drives them off with the Patronus (It is later learned that they were sent by Minister Fudge's corrupt secretary [[Dolores Umbridge]], a possible mole for the Death Eaters). By the novel's end, the dementors of Azkaban stage a mass revolt against their employers to join Voldemort, who permits them nearly free access to victims. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'', the Ministry, under the control of Voldemort, uses dementors to punish Muggle-borns. The dementors also take Voldemort's side during the Battle of Hogwarts. After the appointment of [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] as Minister of Magic, dementors are removed from Azkaban, and the Ministry contains them by limiting their numbers.\n\nRowling, by her own account, created the dementors after a time in which she, in her own words, \"was clinically depressed\".\n\n===Ghosts===\n'''Ghosts''' play an important secondary role, mainly as advisors to the leading characters. Unlike the ghosts in a traditional [[ghost story]], these ghosts are neither frightening nor necessarily ghoulish. Ghosts in the novels appear silvery and translucent. They can fly and pass through walls, tables, and other solid objects, but nonetheless have some ability to physically affect, and be affected by, the living world. ([[Moaning Myrtle]], for instance, can splash the water in her toilet.{{HP2}}) Ghosts' banquet tables are laden with rotten food, as the decomposition increases their ability to smell and taste it.{{HP2}} Touching or walking through a ghost induces a sensation \"like walking through an icy shower.\"{{HP2}} Ghosts can be affected by magic and curses, though not to the same degree that living beings can.{{HP2}}\n\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' universe, only wizards and witches can become ghosts. As [[Nearly Headless Nick]] explained to Harry, \"Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod ... I was afraid of death. I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... Well, that is neither here nor there ... In fact, I am neither here nor there...\"{{HP5}} Despite having chosen this afterlife, many ghosts bemoan their inability to eat, and many are described as gloomy.{{HP2}} They also harbour an attraction to imagery morbid and melancholy.{{HP2}}\n\nGhosts are very sensitive about their condition: when the Ministry initially classified them as sentient creatures with full legal rights,<ref>A \"being\" is defined in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' as a creature \"worthy of legal rights and a voice in the governance of the magical world\"</ref> they claimed that the term was insensitive and received a separate \"Spirit Division\"{{HPF}}, apparently to control the activities and haunting locations of troublesome ghosts (as when Myrtle was forced to haunt the place of her death (Hogwarts) after she had disrupted the wedding of the brother of Olive Hornby, a girl who had teased her at school).{{HP2}}\n\nNamed Ghost characters:\n\n* '''[[Nearly Headless Nick]]''' \u2013 the [[Gryffindor]] house ghost who is nearly headless because he still has his head. Many students who have lost parents have talked to him about death and the possibility of their loved ones existing as ghosts. After Sirius' death, he tells Harry that he lacked the courage to continue on to the next life beyond the veil. His full name is Sir Nicholas De Mimsy-Porpington.\n* '''[[The Bloody Baron]]''' \u2013 the [[Slytherin]] house ghost. He murdered [[Helena Ravenclaw]], who became The Grey Lady. He wears chains as a reminder of his crime. He is the only character at Hogwarts who can \"control\" Peeves.\n* '''[[Helena Ravenclaw|The Grey Lady]]''' \u2013 the [[Ravenclaw]] house ghost. She is the daughter of Hogwarts founder Rowena Ravenclaw. After stealing her mother's diadem, she was killed by The Bloody Baron. Voldemort found the diadem where Helena left it and turned the diadem into a Horcrux. Helena Ravenclaw gave Harry information that helped him find the diadem during the Battle of Hogwarts. In the films, she is friends with Luna Lovegood.\n* '''[[The Fat Friar]]''' \u2013 the [[Hufflepuff]] house ghost. He's unusually cheerful for a ghost, and always helpful and kind towards students, even those who are not in his House. He's also very tolerant with Peeves' mischiefs. According to Pottermore, he was executed by his own monastic order after showing suspicious signs of magic.\n* '''[[Professor Binns]]''' \u2013 the History of Magic professor at [[Hogwarts]]. He died in his sleep one day and his ghost simply got up to teach the next day as if nothing had happened. His routine has not varied the slightest since.\n* '''[[Moaning Myrtle]]''' \u2013 the ghost of a Ravenclaw-girl, killed by a Basilisk, that inhabits the first-floor girls bathroom at Hogwarts.\n* '''Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore''' \u2013 the leader of the Headless Hunt, a club for decapitated ghosts.\n\nPeeves, the Hogwarts [[poltergeist]], is not considered a ghost, but an \"indestructible spirit of chaos\" according to Rowling.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm|year=2005|accessdate=1 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Giants===\n'''[[Giant]]s''' in the ''Harry Potter'' universe are capable of interbreeding with humans \u2013 [[Rubeus Hagrid]] is [[half-giant]], as is his love interest [[Olympe Maxime]] \u2013 but wizards as a population{{HP4}} have engaged in an active campaign to hunt giants out of civilisation.{{HP5}} The last giants in Britain were killed apparently by Ministry decree,{{HP5}} but most deaths have been due to territorial aggression among themselves, as wizards force them to live in ever more confined spaces.{{HP5}} The last few giants remaining in the world (the total number is between 70 and 80) are collected together in an isolated region east of Belarus. Giants range in height from twenty to twenty-five feet (6 to 7.5 metres), and have skin similar to [[rhinoceros]] hide, which grants them limited immunity to magical attacks.{{HP5}} Their society is loosely governed by a chief called a Gurg, who spends most of his time demanding food from his underlings.\n\nVoldemort has employed giants in his attacks, after convincing them that he can offer them a better life;{{HP4}} whereas Hagrid reveals in ''Order of the Phoenix'' that he and Madame Maxime went to try and persuade the Giants to take part in the war against Voldemort, but were thwarted when the Gurg was killed and his successor sided with their enemies. Presumably, as a result, giants took part in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the series, mostly fighting for Voldemort.{{HP7}}\n\nThe portrayal of giants as a dying breed is consistent with much of European folklore, where they are frequently described as primaeval creatures who built ruins and created strange landforms long before humans arrived.\n\n===Goblins===\n[[File:Warner Brothers studio tour (13085029254).jpg|thumb]]\n'''[[Goblin]]s''' are magical creatures chiefly involved with metalwork and the running of [[Gringotts]] bank. They are represented by the Goblin Liaison Office in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. Goblins are anthropoid, described as having long, thin fingers and feet, black eyes, and domed heads much larger than human heads in proportion to the body.{{DH|ch=24}} Goblins eat a diet of largely raw meat, roots, and fungi {{DH|ch=25}} and converse in a language known as [[Gobbledegook]].{{HP4}} They consider the true owner of an object to be its maker rather than its purchaser and resent the passage of goblin-made heirlooms through Wizarding families without further payment.{{DH|ch=25}} Wizarding law prohibits the ownership of wands by goblins, but goblins are capable of different magic of their own.\n\nRelations between goblins and wizards have been strained for centuries by misunderstandings on both sides, sometimes evoking violence. Along with house-elves, goblins seem to occupy positions as second-class citizens in the [[Wizarding world]]. The goblins remain a neutral force during the Second Wizarding War, siding with neither Voldemort nor the opposition to him. {{DH|ch=15}} In some cases, a weak friendship exists between certain wizards and goblins (particularly [[Bill Weasley]], who works as a Curse Breaker for Gringotts Bank), and there have even been some instances of goblin-wizard interbreeding ([[Professor Flitwick]] has distant goblin ancestry, which likely accounts for his small size).<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Is Flitwick a short human or is he some other type of being?

They are 2\u20133 feet tall, with spindly limbs and oversized heads and eyes. They have pointed, bat-like ears and high, squeaky voices. Their names are usually pet-like diminutives, and they do not appear to have surnames. They habitually refer to themselves in the third person. House-elves are generally obedient, [[wikt:pliant|pliant]], and [[wikt:obsequious|obsequious]]; and when enslaved, wear discarded items such as pillowcases and [[towel|tea-towels]] draped like a toga. House-elves' masters can free them by giving them an item of clothing, much like the [[Hob (folklore)|Hob]] of English Folklore. House-elves can become intoxicated by drinking [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Butterbeer|Butterbeer]].\n\nHouse-elves possess [[Magic in Harry Potter|magic]] distinct from that used by wizards and witches, which they generally use in the service of their masters. This magic can be used without the permission of their masters, or even against their orders, though such disobedience obliges them to punish themselves in various painful ways. Among other things, this magic allows house-elves to travel instantly from place to place, even at [[Hogwarts]] and other places where human [[teleportation]] is prevented; and even to thus transport humans.{{HP7}} The full extent of the elves' magic is never fully disclosed, but it seems formidable. Along with the ability to Apparate anywhere at any time, [[#Dobby|Dobby]], [[#Winky|Winky]], [[#Hokey|Hokey]], and [[#Kreacher|Kreacher]] all demonstrate that they can overpower wizards when necessary: In ''Chamber of Secrets'', Dobby forcefully repels [[Lucius Malfoy]] while protecting [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]; whereas in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', when the younger Barty Crouch is unmasked and confesses to what happened on the night of the Quiddich World Championship, he says: \"Winky used her own brand of magic to bind me to her\", and in ''Deathly Hallows'', Kreacher is ordered by Harry to capture [[Mundungus Fletcher]] and bring him to [[12 Grimmauld Place]], a task that he accomplishes within a few days;\u2013\u2013 even though, as Kreacher puts it, \"He has many hidey-holes and accomplices\". Moreover, although House-elves are not allowed to carry wands, they do not appear to need them, being capable of magical feats without them.\n\nIn ''Goblet of Fire'', it is said that a House-elf who has been freed is normally told to find a new family to serve. There is an Office of House-Elf Relocation at the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures|Ministry of Magic]]. House-elves are unendingly loyal to their human families; so much so, that Dobby, who served the [[Malfoy family]], attempts to punish himself each time he utters a negative remark about them (even after his freedom) until the final book, in which he defies [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. According to Kreacher, \"a House-elf's highest law is his master's bidding\"; however, while House-elves must obey their masters without question, they have been known to find [[loophole]]s in orders that allow for unintended interpretations to protect themselves or their friends. Because of their docile, obedient natures, some families abuse their house-elves; [[Dark arts (Harry Potter)|Dark wizard]] families in particular seem to make a habit thereof, as when the Malfoys forced Dobby to torture himself, or when the [[Black family (Harry Potter)|Black family]] customarily decapitated their house-elves as they became enfeebled by age. Nonetheless, most house-elves are horrified by freedom even from the most cruel masters. Dobby, the first introduced, is the sole exception; but this extends chiefly to voluntary service, paid labour, and choice of his own employment and costume. During her time at Hogwarts, [[Hermione Granger]] establishes S.P.E.W. (the 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare') to champion House-elves' rights; but gained little interest from her classmates or the House-elves themselves. After Hermione begins leaving elf-sized clothes around the Gryffindor common room, intending for Hogwarts' House-elves to inadvertently free themselves while cleaning, Dobby confides in Harry that the other House-elves find the idea so insulting that Dobby is the only resident elf willing to clean in Gryffindor Tower.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', Dumbledore tells Harry: \"Of House-elves (...) Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he had never grasped\". Kreacher also leads the House-elves of Hogwarts into battle against Voldemort's forces.\n\n===Obscurials/Obscurus===\n'''Obscurials''' are magical children who attempt to repress their magical abilities. If kept unchecked, this repression corrupts the user's magic, creating a dark parasite force known as an '''obscurus'''. The host obscurial keeps the form of the child, appearing normal, if emotionally distressed due to their forced hiding of their magical nature. When their power is unleashed, the child and obscurus share a form of a large shadowy ethereal cloud, usually causing destruction due to the child themselves having little to no control over the obscurus. The host and parasite may retake the form of the child later, again with almost no input from the obscurial. Due to its consuming nature, obscurials rarely live past childhood, and obscurials who do make it to adolescence are considered outstandingly powerful magic users, though they still will have no control.\n\nObscurials first came into notice when wizard-kind was persecuted by non-magical users. In an attempt to hide their true nature and blend in with society, their pain would cause their magic to manifest into an obscurus. As such, obscurials are feared even among witches and wizards, who see them as not only destructive, but a threat to the International Statute of Secrecy. Even today, the creation of obscurials persists through the persecution of magical peoples all across the world.\n\nWhen an Obscurial comes close to their emotional breaking point their eyes turn a milky white and the Obscurus can be observed writhing under its host's skin.\n\nWhen unleashed an obscurus will normally target the source of its host's misery and distress; violently mauling the victim and leaving distinct scratch like burns over the victim's face. Despite their violent nature an obscurus will spare those who have shown kindness and affection to their obscurial host.\n\nObscurus and obscurials play a crucial role in the film ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', ''Fantastic Beasts'' author Newt Scamander expressing guilt for not being able to save an obscurial girl he met in Sudan. In the film's storyline, an Obscurus manifested in 1926 New York in the body of Aurelius Dumbledore, previously known as Credence Barebone who was forced to conceal his magic from his abusive adoptive mother who has formed an organization to persecute witches. Credence was sought by Gellert Grindelwald who causes him to wreak havoc across the city before he was seemingly killed by aurors under orders from the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, Seraphina Picquery. But Credence survived as a fragment of his obscurus escapes notice and reconstitutes him, retaining it throughout the events of ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]'' while learning his true identity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shamsian|first1=Jacob|title=This character's fate at the end of 'Fantastic Beasts' may not be as clear cut as you thought|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-happened-to-credence-fantastic-beasts-2016-11|website=Business Insider|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Thestrals===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7527901842).jpg|thumb]]\n{{Redirect|Thestral|the genus|Thestral (bug){{!}}''Thestral'' (bug)}}\n\n'''Thestrals''' are an elusive, carnivorous species of winged horse, visible only to those who have witnessed and embraced a death,<ref>{{cite web|title=J.K.

They have acquired an undeserved reputation as [[omen]]s of evil.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Vander Ark |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/bestiary/thestrals.html |title=Thestrals in the ''Harry Potter Lexicon'' |website=Hp-lexicon.org }}</ref> The High Inquisitor from the ministry of magic, [[Dolores Umbridge]], asserted that Thestrals are considered \"dangerous creatures\" by the [[Ministry of Magic]], although this might be due to her prejudice against 'half-breeds', as Hagrid is half-giant and is showing thestrals in class.\n\nThestrals have fangs and possess a well-developed sense of smell, which will lead them to [[carrion]] and fresh blood. According to Hagrid, they will not attack a human-sized target without provocation. They are capable of very fast flight for several hours at a time, though they usually spend their time on the ground; and they have an excellent sense of direction. The breed is [[domestication|domesticable]], given a willing [[animal training|trainer]] (Hagrid suspects that he has the only domesticated herd in Britain), after which they may pull loads, and make a serviceable if uncomfortable mode of transportation (Harry rides to the Ministry of Magic by thestral in the fifth book with his friends, although half of the group are unable to actually see their means of transport).\n\nHogwarts has a herd in the nearby [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] and primarily uses them to pull the carriages that transport students to and from the [[Hogsmeade]] train station. They are introduced to [[Care of Magical Creatures]] students in the fifth year by Hagrid in the same year that Harry becomes able to see them after witnessing the death of [[Cedric Diggory]], some months after it occurred. Harry only sees these beasts after he sees Cedric die, yet it is stated (in both the books and the films) that he witnessed his mother die in front of him at the age of one; therefore he logically should have been able to see them throughout the entire series, or should have started seeing them at the start of the summer holidays of that year. When asked about this discrepancy, Rowling responded that when Harry saw his mother die, he was young and did not fully understand the meaning of death and what had happened. When he saw Cedric die, he fully understood what had happened, and had time to think about it before he returned to Hogwarts and saw the Thestrals for the first time.<ref>{{cite web | website = Accio Quote! | title = Archive of J.K.

At any other time, a werewolf is a normal human. However, the term werewolf is used for both the wolf-like creature and the normal human. A werewolf can be distinguished from a true wolf physically by several small distinguishing characteristics, including the eyes, claws, fangs, ears, [[snout]], and tufted tail. A person becomes a werewolf when bitten by another werewolf in wolf-form. Once this happens, the person must learn to manage the condition. The Wolfsbane Potion controls some of the effects of the condition; by allowing the sufferer to maintain their human mind in wolf form, it prevents them from harming others. The potion tastes horrible and very few are skilled enough to brew it, and according to Lupin, the addition of sugar to the potion renders it useless and inert. Nothing discovered in the wizarding world can completely cure a werewolf. Most werewolves live outside normal society and steal food to survive. They generally support Voldemort, whom they think will give them a better life, since they are shunned by the wizard community and are both feared and hated by the common witch and wizard.\n\n[[Remus Lupin]] is the only known exception to this. There are only three known werewolves in the ''Harry Potter'' series: Lupin, [[Fenrir Greyback]] and an unnamed wizard who was in the same ward as [[Arthur Weasley]] in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. [[Bill Weasley]] who is attacked by Fenrir Greyback in The Battle of the Astronomy Tower in the ''Half-Blood Prince'', is not a werewolf. Although Bill suffered a number of side-effects from the attack, including a scarred face and a new love of very rare steak, he does not become a werewolf as Greyback was in human form at the time of the bite. The condition of Lycanthropy can be hereditary, but (as seen in the case of [[Teddy Lupin]]), it is not necessarily so.\n\n==Characters==\nBelow is a list of magical creatures who have some significant role in the series.\n\n===Crookshanks===\nFrom the third book to the sixth, '''Crookshanks''' is [[Hermione Granger]]'s pet cat.

He was once owned by the [[Malfoy family]], and he first appears in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' to discourage Harry from returning to Hogwarts. Dobby later tries to keep Harry away from Hogwarts by magically sealing off the hidden entrance to [[Platform 9\u00be]], only to be foiled when the protagonists pilot Arthur's flying [[Ford Anglia]] to school. During a [[Quidditch]] match, Dobby enchants a Bludger to chase Harry, hoping to cause him enough injury to be sent home; but the Bludger only manages to break Harry's arm. Dobby discloses that when an enslaved house-elf is presented with an article of clothing by his or her master, that house-elf is subsequently set free; and when Harry (after returning from the [[Chamber of Secrets]]) discovers that Dobby's master is [[Lucius Malfoy]], he tricks Malfoy into setting Dobby free, a feat that secures him the house-elf's undying loyalty. He was now willing to save Harry Potter no matter if it would mean risking his life, because after all, \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\n\nDobby returns in ''Goblet of Fire''. Now a free elf, he obtains a paid post at Hogwarts. Dobby also quickly becomes the only house-elf who will clean the Gryffindor common room, when Hermione leaves knitted clothing half-hidden around the room in an attempt to free the elves, which they find insulting. Dobby later appears in ''Order of the Phoenix'', showing Harry the hidden [[Room of Requirement]], which Harry uses for the secret meetings of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. When [[Professor Umbridge]] finds the meetings later, Dobby enters to warn the group. In ''Half-Blood Prince'' Harry entrusts Dobby to watch his compatriot Kreacher when he orders him to work in the Hogwarts kitchens with the other house-elves; and later assigns both to follow [[Draco Malfoy]].\n\nDobby makes his last appearance in ''Deathly Hallows'' when [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] sends him to rescue the protagonists from [[Malfoy Manor]] after Harry asks for Aberforth's help while viewing his eye in Sirius' mirror, but in the process Dobby is killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. He is buried at Shell Cottage, beneath a headstone bearing the [[epitaph]] \"Here Lies Dobby, A Free Elf\".\n\nDobby's name is derived from a creature in English folklore.

Phoenix tail [[feather]]s are suitable for inclusion in some wands (both Harry and Voldemort's wands contain a feather from Fawkes' tail, the only two he ever gave) and their tears have healing powers. Fawkes can also teleport himself and others in a burst of flame.\n\nIn ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry's display of loyalty to Dumbledore results in his summoning Fawkes to his aid against [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[#Basilisk|basilisk]] in the Chamber of Secrets; whereupon Fawkes punctures the basilisk's eyes, eliminating her ability to kill with her gaze. Fawkes later uses his tears to negate the basilisk's venom; and when the basilisk is killed, conveys Harry Potter, Ron and Ginny Weasley, and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] to their guardians. In ''Goblet of Fire'', during the duel between Harry and Voldemort, the \"reverse spell effect\" ('[[Priori Incantatem]]') occurs, as both of their wands are made of Fawkes' feathers.\n\nDuring the confrontation between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Ministry of Magic at the climax of ''Order of the Phoenix'' (book only), Fawkes saves Dumbledore's life by swallowing a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]] from Voldemort; then bursts into flame and is reborn as a chick from the ashes.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's death in ''Half-Blood Prince'', Fawkes is heard singing a [[lament]], and thereafter is not seen again. In an interview, Rowling stated this was to symbolise the loss of Dumbledore. When asked why Fawkes did not return to Harry due to his loyalty to Dumbledore, Rowling stated that Fawkes was non-transferable between owners.\n\nAccording to Rowling, Fawkes is named after 17th century conspirator [[Guy Fawkes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Scholastic Online Chat Transcript|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm|website=Accio Quote!|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Firenze===\n'''Firenze''' is a [[#Centaurs|centaur]] and, after ''Order of the Phoenix'', a Divination teacher at Hogwarts.<ref name=Accio-quote>{{cite web |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html |title=J.K.

He first appears towards the end of ''Philosopher's Stone'', in which he rescues Harry from Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Having carried Harry to safety on his back, Firenze quarrels with other centaurs who object to the symbolic suggestion that centaurs are subservient to humans.\n\nThe character does not make another appearance until ''Order of the Phoenix'', in which he is appointed by Dumbledore to teach [[Magic in Harry Potter#Divination|Divination]] at Hogwarts in place of [[Sybill Trelawney]], who has been sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]]. For this, he is [[Ostracism|ostracised]] by his fellows. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', he shares teaching duties with a reinstated Trelawney.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', he is seen near the end of the book alongside the other members of the [[Hogwarts staff]], against Voldemort and his Death Eaters; it is mentioned that he was wounded on his flanks by the Death Eaters but ultimately survived the Battle. Although not mentioned in the series, Rowling revealed that after the Battle, Firenze's herd was forced to acknowledge that his pro-human leanings were not shameful, and allowed him to rejoin them.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\">{{cite news |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript |title=J.K.

In the film ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them]]'', Frank is the reason Newt went to America. After rescuing Frank from the traffickers, Newt stored Frank with his other magical creatures in his suitcase. Newt brings Frank to America in hopes of returning him to his native land of Arizona.\n\nIn the climax of the film, the existence of magic is revealed to the people of New York City, following a battle between American wizarding government MACUSA and an obscurial. Knowing the secrecy of wizard-kind has been compromised, Newt releases Frank from his suitcase and gives him a potion that has memory wiping properties. Because of the thunderbird's ability to generate storms, Newt says goodbye to Frank as Frank flies into the sky, creating a rainfall using the liquid from the potion, erasing the memories of all non-magical people of the event.\n\nRowling revealed in a tweet following the film's release that Frank did indeed make it back to Arizona following the events of the film.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=jk_rowling|author=J.K.

In ''Philosopher's Stone'', after Hagrid presents Harry's key and Dumbledore's letter to an unnamed goblin in the Gringotts lobby, Griphook is called to escort Harry and Hagrid through the underground rail-system to Harry's vault, and afterwards to Vault 713 to retrieve the ''Philosopher's Stone''. He is not heard of again until ''Deathly Hallows'', when the Snatchers holding him captive also capture Harry, Ron, and Hermione. When Hermione lies under torture to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] that the sword of Gryffindor is a fake, Bellatrix asks Griphook for confirmation, which she receives. He is saved, along with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, by Dobby and successfully escapes to [[Shell Cottage]]. Because Harry needs to take a Horcrux from Bellatrix's vault, Griphook reluctantly agrees to help them break into Gringotts, in exchange for the sword of Gryffindor; but when escaping, Griphook betrays them to the other goblins and escapes with the sword. His fate is left unknown in the book, but in the film he is shown dead during the aftermath at Gringotts, and Gryffindor's sword vanishes before Voldemort can see it. In spite of Griphook's insistence that the sword belongs to the goblins, the sword reappears when [[Neville Longbottom]] pulls it from the [[Sorting Hat]] and beheads [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Nagini|Nagini]].\n\n[[Verne Troyer]] appeared as Griphook in the film adaptation of ''Philosopher's Stone'' with [[Warwick Davis]] providing his voice and the latter fully portrayed him in the ''Deathly Hallows'' films.\n\n===Hedwig===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Hedwig).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\n'''Hedwig''' is Harry's owl, given to him in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' as an eleventh birthday present by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who purchases the owl in [[Diagon Alley]] at the [[Places in Harry Potter#Eeylops Owl Emporium|Eeylops Owl Emporium]]. Harry gives her this name after reading it in a book on the history of magic. Hedwig is used for delivering messages throughout the series, and also serves as a companion to Harry, especially when he is unable to interact with other wizards. It is implied throughout the books that Hedwig can fully understand Harry's speech. In the fifth book, ''Order of the Phoenix'',<ref>Rowling, J. K. ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. New York: Listening Library, 2003. Print.</ref> Hedwig is intercepted by [[Dolores Umbridge]] and is hurt, but is later healed by [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]]. In the seventh book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|The Deathly Hallows]]'', Hedwig is killed by a curse from a [[Death Eater]]; in the film version, she is killed defending Harry from the Death Eater. According to Rowling, Hedwig's death represents the loss of Harry's innocence.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/>\n\nAlthough the character of Hedwig is female, she is played on film by male owls (female [[snowy owl]]s have dark patches of plumage, while only the males are completely white). The [[John Williams]] composition which serves as title music for the entire film series is named \"Hedwig's Theme\".\n\n===Hokey===\n'''Hokey''' is a house-elf who works for [[Minor Harry Potter characters#Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]], an old woman deceived by Tom Riddle into showing him Slytherin's locket and Hufflepuff's cup, which he uses as two of his Horcruxes. Hokey's memory allows Harry and Dumbledore a glimpse of the visit Voldemort makes two days before Hepzibah Smith is poisoned and both treasures disappear; whereafter Riddle, who magically tampers with Hokey's memories, frames Hokey for Hepzibah's murder. She does not deny the accusation and is convicted for accidental murder.\n\n===Kreacher===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Kreacher).jpg|thumb]]\n'''Kreacher''' is a house-elf who serves the [[Black family (Harry Potter)|House of Black]] for generations and whose name is a play on the word ''[[wikt:creature|creature]]''. Kreacher first appears in ''Order of the Phoenix'' as an unwilling servant to [[Sirius Black]]. Kreacher disdains Sirius, mainly due to his devotion to his former masters ([[Regulus Black]] in particular), whose pure-blood values Sirius has rejected. Sirius also treats him harshly because the elf is a living reminder of a home to which he earlier had no intention of returning. Knowing too much of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]]'s activity, Kreacher is not allowed to leave [[Grimmauld Place]]. Kreacher has lived alone in the house for years with only the screaming portrait of Mrs. Black for company. Despite obeying Sirius, he is insolent and rude, insulting in undertones all present who he refers to as ''\"Blood traitors, Mudbloods and scum\"''.  Hermione comments on this: \"I don't think he realises we can hear him.\"  <ref>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, chapter 6.</ref>\n\nKreacher desires to leave Sirius and serve his next of kin, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and the Malfoys. He betrays Sirius and persuades Harry to go to the [[Department of Mysteries]], where a trap has been laid. Sirius is killed by Bellatrix in the ensuing combat, while trying to save Harry. Following Sirius' death, Harry inherits all of Sirius' possessions, including a highly unwilling Kreacher. Harry immediately orders him to work at Hogwarts, where he comes to blows with Dobby about his lack of loyalty to Harry.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry and his friends coax from the house-elf the current whereabouts of [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], a Black heirloom and one of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es; whereafter Harry sends Kreacher to retrieve the locket from [[Mundungus Fletcher]] and gives him its substitute as a token of remembrance (referring to Regulus Black, who alone treated Kreacher with respect). Thereafter Kreacher appears cleaner and happier, restores the house to pristine condition, and begins to treat Harry and his friends with courtesy and respect. When Grimmauld Place is infiltrated by Death Eaters, Harry decides against calling the elf back to them, fearing possible betrayal. In the Battle of Hogwarts, Kreacher rallies the Hogwarts house-elves against the [[Death Eaters]], calling Harry his \"master and defender of house elves\". It is implied that he survived the battle, as Harry wonders 'whether Kreacher will bring him a sandwich' after his battle with Voldemort.\n\nKreacher appears in the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (movie)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', voiced by [[Timothy Bateson]].<ref name=kreacher-mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1542581/10062006/story.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler|title=Elf's Absence From Next 'Harry Potter' Flick Opens Up Plot Questions|website=MTV|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=6 October 2006}}</ref> Producers admitted they had wished to cut the character from the film, but when Rowling was consulted, she advised: \"You know, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

He is capable of flight and can choose whether to be tangible; and is able to manipulate objects, a trait not generally possible with ghosts, but common among poltergeists. Peeves' existence is essentially the embodiment of disorder,<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Peeves chews gum, how can he when he is a ghost?

In appearance, he is a small man with a mischievous face and a wide mouth, dressed in vibrantly coloured clothing. He derives joy from disaster and mischievous acts, usually causing disruptions to daily activity.\n\nPeeves only listens to a select few: Dumbledore; [[the Bloody Baron]]; in the second book [[Nearly Headless Nick]]; and in the fifth book, [[Fred and George Weasley]]. Filch, who is usually left with cleaning up the mess and damage that Peeves causes, tries repeatedly to remove him; however, Rowling has stated in an interview that not even Dumbledore would be able to rid Hogwarts of Peeves forever.<ref>{{cite news | title = J.

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry uses magic to attach Peeves' tongue to the roof of his mouth, after which Peeves angrily departs.\n\nDuring [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s attempts to take control of Hogwarts in ''Order of the Phoenix'', Peeves, along with many of the non-Slytherin students, begins a concerted campaign of practical jokes and pranks at the Weasley twins' request, in order to make Umbridge's time at Hogwarts as unpleasant as possible, a task Peeves undertakes with tremendous glee. When Umbridge attempts to sneak out of Hogwarts, Peeves chases her out, whacking her with [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s cane (which she lent to him expressly for that purpose) and a sock full of chalk. Many of the other professors also resent her presence and either turn a blind eye to what is done to Umbridge at the hands of Peeves and the students, or occasionally even providing a small measure of assistance. Peeves is twice depicted at the conclusion of ''Deathly Hallows'': initially attacking Death Eaters with vicious plants and subsequently singing a victory song for Harry.\n\nIt is indicated that Peeves was still at Hogwarts at the time of the epilogue, since Harry tells his son Albus Severus not to \"mess with Peeves\".\n\n[[Rik Mayall]] was cast as Peeves for the film adaptation of ''Philosopher's Stone'', but his scenes were cut from the final film and do not even appear in the deleted scenes section of the DVD release.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/050/050980p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112013124/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/050/050980p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2008 |title=Potter Gloucester Set Report |accessdate=8 August 2007 |date=4 April 2001 |first=Brian |last=Linder |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> He had not been made aware that his scenes had been cut until the full film was officially unveiled at the premiere.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8SYswvVe-YC&printsec=frontcover |title=Bigger than Hitler \u2013 Better than Christ |first=Rik |last=Mayall |author-link=Rik Mayall |publisher=[[HarperCollins UK]] |date=10 January 2014 |pages=352 |isbn=9780007375431}}</ref> Peeves was subsequently omitted from the ''Harry Potter'' films that followed, though he can be seen in the video games.\n\n===Winky===\n'''Winky''' is a house-elf who originally served the Crouch family, described as having enormous brown eyes and a large, round, soft nose. She viewed herself as a dutiful servant and guarded the family's many secrets. When [[Barty Crouch Jr]] is rescued from [[Azkaban]] by his mother, he is supervised and nursed back to health by Winky. In ''Goblet of Fire'', she persuades [[Barty Crouch Sr]] to let his son attend the Quidditch World Cup; she attends it with the younger Crouch, who is hiding under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]], and claims the apparently empty seat beside her is being saved for Crouch Sr. During the festivities, Crouch Jr steals Harry's wand from his pocket and later uses it to conjure the [[Dark Mark]], in spite of Winky's attempts to stop him. In the resulting chaos, Harry and his friends see Winky running into the forest, appearing to struggle against the invisible Crouch Jr. Later she is caught with Harry's wand, which is magically proven to be the one used to conjure the Dark Mark; though Crouch Sr realises what happened, he agrees with the apparent conclusion that Winky conjured the mark, and fires her, both to save face and as punishment for failing to control Crouch Jr. Following her dismissal, Dobby takes the distraught Winky to work with him at Hogwarts. There the unhappy Winky, retaining her loyalty to Crouch, becomes an alcoholic until the final book, and eventually fights in the Battle of Hogwarts with the other house-elves.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/>\n\n===The Weasleys' creatures===\nMany pets and animals are associated with the Weasley family:\n\n* [[Scabbers]] \u2013 a [[brown rat]] retained for twelve years; at first by Percy, but passed to Ron. Near the end of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|third book]], Scabbers is revealed to be [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], an [[Animagus]] whose betrayal of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]] led to their deaths at the hand of [[Lord Voldemort]].\n* Pigwidgeon (nicknamed \"Pig\") \u2013 Ron's hyperactive [[scops owl]], a gift from [[Sirius Black]] upon the loss of Scabbers.\n* Hermes \u2013 a [[screech owl]] owned by Percy, which was a gift to him from his parents for becoming a Prefect in his fifth year. He is named after the [[Greek god]] [[Hermes]].\n* Errol \u2013 an aged [[great grey owl]] who serves as the family's courier. He has trouble carrying loads and is often found unconscious after collision or exhaustion. Possibly a reference to [[Errol Fuller]], who wrote a few books on extinct birds.\n* Arnold \u2013 a purple Pygmy Puff (miniature puffskein) owned by Ginny and obtained from [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] in the sixth book.\n* A puffskein belonging to Ron and killed by Fred when he used it for Bludger practice, revealed in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|first ''Harry Potter'' game]], and later confirmed in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]].''\n* A benevolent [[ghoul]] lives in the attic of [[The Burrow (Harry Potter)|The Burrow]] and causes minor disruptions by groaning and banging on the walls and pipes. In ''Deathly Hallows'', the ghoul is magically altered in appearance to resemble Ron as cover for his absence from school.  The ghoul is enthusiastic about this and seems to relish the attention it receives. In 12 Grimmauld Place there is also a ghoul in \"an upstairs bathroom\".\n* The Weasleys have [[gnome]]s all over their garden and in their shed, bushes, [[Wellington boots]], and more. They are quarrelsome and seem to know many obscenities, which they were supposedly taught by Fred and George Weasley. [[#Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] likes to chase the gnomes while visiting; the rest of the family deals with them by physically throwing them off the grounds. In ''Deathly Hallows'' one bites Luna Lovegood; whereas Fred is bitten by one in ''Half-Blood Prince'' and as a punishment stuns it, paints it gold, gives it a miniature tutu with wings and hangs it on top of the Christmas tree as an angel.\n\n===Hagrid's pets===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7527263992).jpg|150px|thumb]]\nOver the course of the series, Hagrid cares for a large number of animals, many of them dangerous, including [[Aragog]] (a giant spider or 'Acromantula'), [[Buckbeak]] ([[Hippogriff]]), [[Fang (Harry Potter)|Fang]] (boarhound), [[Fluffy (Harry Potter)|Fluffy]] ([[Cerberus|Three-Headed Dog]]), [[Norbert]] ('Norwegian Ridgeback' [[Dragon]]; later found to be female and re-named Norberta), and Tenebrus (Thestral). Hagrid's love for animals got him the teaching job for Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts. In their fourth year, Harry and his classmates take care of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts (a crustacean-like predator), one of which (grown to giant size) is placed in the hedge maze for the final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Although its exoskeleton can repel spells, Harry is able to pass it unhurt. They also have lessons on Nifflers, Unicorns, Fire salamanders and Flobberworms.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Wikipedia books|Harry Potter}}\n* [[Care of Magical Creatures]]\n* [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Harry Potter}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magical Creatures in Harry Potter}}\n[[Category:Harry Potter universe|Creatures]]\n[[Category:Fantasy creatures]]\n[[Category:Ghosts in written fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Magical creatures in ''Harry Potter''}}\n'''Magical creatures''' are an aspect of the [[Harry Potter universe|fictional wizarding world]] contained in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' series, both by British author [[J.

A person who studies Magizoology is known as a magizoologist. There are magizoologists who work in the [[Ministry of Magic]], particularly in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. One notable magizoologist is [[Newt Scamander]], who in the universe of the series, is the author of ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' and the ''[[main character]]'' in the ''[[Fantastic Beasts]]'' franchise, which serves as a prequel to the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' story.\n\n==Regulation and classification==\nThe [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] of the [[Ministry of Magic]] is responsible for overseeing and regulating magical creatures. It is divided into three divisions: the Beast Division, the Being Division, and the Spirit Division.\n\nA \"being\" is generally defined, according to ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them|Fantastic Beasts]]'', as \"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws.\" This includes [[human]]s, [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]], [[#House-elves|house-elves]], [[#Giants|giants]], [[#Goblins|goblins]], [[hag]]s, [[Magical creatures in Harry Potter#veela|veela]]s, and [[vampires]]. [[Fairy|Fairies]], [[pixie]]s, [[gnome]]s, and most other creatures are classified as \"beasts.\" Affairs related to [[#Ghosts|ghosts]] come under the [[wikt:auspice|auspices]] of the Spirit Division.\n\nThe definition is not without its problems: [[#Werewolves|Werewolves]] and [[Animagus|Animagi]] are typically in human form, but may transform into an animal. (A werewolf transforms from the human state only at the [[full moon]], but an Animagus is a human who has learned to transform into an animal at will.) Their classification is unclear, and offices responsible for werewolves exist in both the Beast and Being Divisions. [[Banshee]]s and [[#Dementors|Dementors]] have never been officially classified. (See below.) [[#Centaurs|Centaurs]], [[leprechaun]]s and [[Piscine humanoid|merpeople]] ([[mermaid]]s and [[merman|mermen]]) have rejected \"being\" status in favour of \"beast\" status.\n\nThe fictional ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' book also assigns a threat rating to each creature, in the form of \"X\" marks. Five Xs means \"Known wizard killer/impossible to domesticate\". Four Xs means \"Dangerous/requires specialist knowledge/skilled wizard may handle\". Three means \"Competent wizard should cope\". Two means \"Harmless/may be domesticated\". One means \"boring\". Creatures that need to be treated with a sophisticated amount of respect, e.g. Centaurs, [[Unicorn]]s, [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenixes]], and merpeople, are given a XXXX rating. \u2260\n\n==List of magical creatures==\n<!--Do not add the rating or an explanation of the rating. Those are Rowling's copyright. Also, do not add a link to another part of this article. The links are for showing which monsters Rowling took from folklore and which she did not.-->\nBelow is a list of magical creatures mentioned in the ''Harry Potter'' universe.

The first fan to learn of the blast-ended skrewts was Catie Hoch, an eight-year-old cancer patient from [[Albany, New York]]. Hoch's mother, who had read the first three books to Hoch during her treatment for [[neuroblastoma]], emailed Rowling to ask her when the fourth book would be released, and Rowling gifted Hoch with transatlantic phone calls in which she read her extracts from the unpublished book, including explanations of the blast-ended skrewts, which Rowling described as looking like headless [[lobster]]s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Laurence |first=Charles |date=29 December 2002 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1417303/J.-K.-Rowling-read-unfinished-book-to-dying-girl.html |title=J.

As a result, their appropriate classification is unknown. Among them are:\n\n* Blibbering Humdinger \u2013 Luna mentioned these creatures when Lavender Brown and Parvati Pitill were laughing at her earrings.\n* Crumple-Horned Snorkack \u2013 an elusive creature that is said to live in Sweden. Xenophilius Lovegood acquired an Erumpent horn that he believed was from a Snorkack. The Erumpent exploded after being hit by a stunning spell and destroyed much of his house. Luna searched the world for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack, but never found one. Luna explicitly states that the creature cannot fly.\n* Xenophilius claimed that Luna was fishing for Freshwater Plimpies when she was being held prisoner at Malfoy Manor.\n* Gulping Plimpy \u2013 a Gulping Plimpy is supposedly a breed of Plimpy that is repelled by Gurdyroots.\n* Heliopath \u2013 an alleged spirit of fire that gallops and burns anything in its path.\n* Nargle \u2013 the Nargles are said to infest mistletoes and are expert thieves. Luna Lovegood claims that her Butterbeer cork necklace and her Dirigible plum earrings keep the Nargles away and that her papers and shoes were taken by Nargles.\n* Wrackspurt \u2013 in an early scene in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' film, Luna wears a pair of \"Spectrespecs\" enabling her to see Wrackspurts\u2014which in turn reveal Harry's prone form underneath his invisibility cloak, and allow her to rescue him. During a [[Point of view shot|point of view]] scene, Wrackspurts resemble floating points of light.\n\n==Prominent creatures==\n\n===Acromantula===\n[[File:Aragog (7119116887).jpg|150px|thumb]]\nIn the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], the '''Acromantula''' is a monstrous spider capable of human speech. It originated in Borneo, where it inhabits dense jungle. Its distinctive features include the thick black hair that covers its body; its legspan, which may reach up to fifteen feet; its pincers, which produce a distinctive clicking sound when the Acromantula is excited or angry; and a venomous secretion. The Acromantula is carnivorous and prefers large prey. It spins dome-shaped webs on the ground. The female is bigger than the male and may lay up to one hundred eggs at a time. Soft and white, these are as large as beach balls. The young hatch in six to eight weeks. Acromantula eggs are defined as Class A Non-Tradeable Goods by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, meaning that severe penalties are attached to their importation or sale.\n\nThis beast is believed to be wizard-bred, possibly intended to guard wizard dwellings or treasure, as is often the case with magically bred monsters. Despite its near-human intelligence, the Acromantula is untrainable and highly dangerous to wizard and Muggle alike.<ref>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</ref> Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts in his third year for possession of the Acromantula Aragog who was thought by Hogwarts teachers to be the monster in the Chamber of Secrets.\n\n===Basilisk===\nIn the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], a '''[[Basilisk]]''' is a monstrous serpentine creature. Larger than [[basilisk|counterpart from real-life legends]], this Basilisk is capable of reaching a length up to fifty feet and living up to hundreds of years. Basilisks are uncontrollable except by [[Parselmouth]]s, and the first basilisk is believed to have been created by a Greek Dark wizard and Parselmouth named [[Herpo The Foul]].{{HPF}} Herpo made this discovery by hatching a chicken egg under a toad. A male basilisk has a scarlet plume on its head.{{HPF}} A basilisk kills both with its powerful venom and its huge yellow eyes, which are immediately lethal to any creature who looks at them directly.{{HPF}} To anyone who looks at it indirectly, such as through a camera or in a reflection, it creates a profound state of petrification similar to a [[Medusa]] stare. Ghosts who either look at it directly or indirectly will only become petrified, since they could not die a second time.{{HP2}} A phoenix tear is the only known cure for the devastating effect of the basilisk's venom. Spiders flee from the basilisk, as they are mortal enemies. The basilisk itself flees only from the crowing of a rooster, which if heard by the basilisk is fatal, and the [[weasel]] whose odor will also kill a basilisk.\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', a female basilisk inhabits the [[Chamber of Secrets]] below Hogwarts. When student Tom Riddle, later known as [[Voldemort]], opened the chamber, the basilisk merely petrified several students (students looked at a reflection of basilisk) and killed one student named Myrtle (later known as Moaning Myrtle) with her stare and hid in the chamber for 50 years, until Riddle's memory opened the chamber again by possessing [[Ginny Weasley]]. The basilisk attempts to kill several Muggle-borns, but due to good fortune all its victims were merely petrified. Riddle commanded Ginny Weasley to kill all the school roosters remarked upon by Hagrid. When Harry discovers the chamber, Riddle reveals his identity and sets the basilisk loose upon Harry while Ginny's life force ebbs away. [[#Fawkes|Fawkes]] helps Harry, by blinding the basilisk with his talons and carrying the [[Sorting Hat]]; Harry pulls the [[sword of Godric Gryffindor]] from the hat, and uses it to impale the basilisk in the roof of her mouth, killing her.\n\nThe basilisk's fangs and her venom absorbed by the sword of Gryffindor proved instrumental for destroying most of Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es. In ''Chamber of Secrets'', while killing the basilisk at the same time, Harry Potter was stabbed in the arm by the first fang, which broke off and was used by Harry to puncture [[Tom Riddle's diary]] (one of Voldemort's Horcruxes), an act which restored Ginny's life force. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', after losing the sword of Gryffindor to Griphook, [[Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] return to the chamber and retrieve a fang from the dead basilisk's mouth, using it to destroy [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. This time the chamber was opened by Ron by imitating Harry's [[Parseltongue]]. Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and Professor Dumbledore used the sword of Gryffindor, laced with the basilisk's venom, to destroy the locket, Nagini and Marvolo Gaunt's ring, respectively.\n\n===Boggarts===\nIn the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]], a '''[[Boggart]]''' is an amortal [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifter]] non-being that takes on the form of its intended victim's worst fear. While British mythology describes boggarts as house-elves who cause trouble or malevolent beings inhabiting marshes or other lonely spots, Rowling's boggarts are more like [[Brollachan]]s, magical creatures originating from [[Scotland]]. However, there is one record of an English ([[Lancashire]]) boggart which could take the form of various animals, or indeed more fearful creatures.<ref>[[John Harland|Harland, J.]] and Wilkinson, T. T. (1857) ''Lancashire Folklore'', Warne & Co., London, p. 55.</ref> The word ''boggart'' was recorded in the [[Survey of English Dialects]] across Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire as a [[bogey man]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Upton |first1=Clive| last2=Parry| first2=David|last3=Widdowson| first3=JDA |title=Survey of English Dialects: the dictionary and the grammar |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=0415020298 |page=44}}</ref>\n\nBoggarts like to hide in dark, enclosed places, such as closets and cabinets. It is unknown what form a boggart chooses to take when alone. (In ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', [[Mad-Eye Moody]] determines, with his magical eye, that there is a boggart in the desk in the drawing room.)\n\nIn ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', [[Remus Lupin]] teaches his students in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] to approach a boggart in groups of two or more, so that the boggart will have difficulty in choosing which one to frighten. The ''Riddikulus'' charm is used to combat Boggarts, by changing their appearance into a less fearsome or even comical apparition, which weakens the creatures. When Harry Potter approaches the boggart, it takes the form of a Dementor.\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore]] gives the same lesson in ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]''.\n\n===Centaurs===\n[[File:Centaur (Harry Potter Studio Tour - July 2013).jpg|thumb]]\n'''[[Centaur]]s''' in the Harry Potter universe are wild creatures who claim to possess intelligence greater than humans. Their heads and torsos resemble those of humans but they possess the four legs, lower bodies and tail of a horse. Although sentient, they have not requested assignment as beings, preferring to remove themselves entirely from human affairs. Centaurs who decide to associate with humans, such as Firenze, who agrees to teach Divination at Hogwarts, can be seen as traitors to their kind and attacked by other centaurs. Firenze's interest in human affairs resulted in violent reprisals by other centaurs and were it not for Hagrid's intervention, Firenze could have been killed.\n\nThe Ministry of Magic's Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures has a Centaur Liaison Office, but no centaur has ever used it. Centaurs are skilled in healing and astrology, and spend much of their time scouring the stars for portents. They live in forests, and their society consists of groups called herds. They do not appear to employ or need any technology more advanced than a bow and arrow. They are proud and territorial, therefore high diplomatic skills must be employed when dealing with centaurs. Displaying lack of respect to centaurs can have violent consequences, as Dolores Umbridge learned to her cost. In ''Deathly Hallows'', the Hogwarts centaur herd, after being admonished fiercely by Hagrid, takes sides with the Order of the Phoenix, and assist in the Battle of Hogwarts.\n\nThe films depict the centaurs with bestial and animalistic facial features. The books do not describe them, but several female students are attracted to them.\n\nNamed Centaur characters:\n\n* '''[[#Firenze|Firenze]]'''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/firenze |title=Firenze |access-date=15 June 2019 |work=[[Pottermore]] |publisher=[[Wizarding World]] |agency=[[Warner Bros.

They are the guards of the wizard prison, [[Azkaban]], until after the return of antagonist Lord Voldemort. [[Albus Dumbledore]] harbors an intense dislike of dementors, noting he has long felt the Ministry of Magic erred in \"allying\" with such creatures, implying that dementor society in general exists apart from the general wizarding world. Dumbledore forbade dementors from entering Hogwarts but this ban was ultimately broken in ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, who insisted on being accompanied by a dementor as a bodyguard.\n\nIn the books, dementors have a generally human shape, approximately 3 metres (10&nbsp;feet) in height, covered in dark, hooded cloaks that reveal only their decayed-looking hands. Beneath the cloak, dementors are eyeless, and the only feature of note is the perpetually indrawn breath, by which they consume the emotions and good memories of human beings, forcing the victim to relive its worst memories alone. According to the author, dementors grow like fungi in dark, moist places, creating a dense, chilly fog. Although they are implied to be [[Sentience|sentient]], this is left ambiguous. The presence of a dementor makes the surrounding atmosphere grow cold and dark, and the effects are cumulative with the number of dementors present. The culmination of their power is the 'Dementor's Kiss', wherein the dementor latches its mouth onto a victim's lips and consumes its soul or [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], presumably to leave the victim in a [[persistent vegetative state]], without any memories and feelings left. Dementors are invisible to Muggles, but affect them otherwise identically.\n\nDespite their attachment to human emotion, dementors seem to have difficulty distinguishing one human from another, as demonstrated by Barty Crouch Jr.'s escape from [[Azkaban]], wherein they could detect no emotional difference between the younger Crouch and his mother. Their sensitivity appears less precise in proportion to the emotion's 'complexity'; this particular weakness enabled [[Sirius Black]], an [[Animagus]], to escape Azkaban by transforming into a dog. The principal method against them is the [[Patronus Charm]], which both protects its user and repels the dementors. Dementors have the power to feed off the good feelings and memories when coming in close contact.\n\nHarry first encounters dementors during his third year of school, when they are sent to guard Hogwarts against Sirius Black, thought to be a dangerous criminal at this point in time. Being reminded by their presence of his parents' murder by Voldemort, Harry asks Remus Lupin for assistance, and thus acquires the Patronus Charm. At the beginning of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]'', two dementors are dispatched to Little Whinging to assassinate Harry, and nearly drain the soul from his cousin Dudley Dursley before Harry drives them off with the Patronus (It is later learned that they were sent by Minister Fudge's corrupt secretary [[Dolores Umbridge]], a possible mole for the Death Eaters). By the novel's end, the dementors of Azkaban stage a mass revolt against their employers to join Voldemort, who permits them nearly free access to victims. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'', the Ministry, under the control of Voldemort, uses dementors to punish Muggle-borns. The dementors also take Voldemort's side during the Battle of Hogwarts. After the appointment of [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] as Minister of Magic, dementors are removed from Azkaban, and the Ministry contains them by limiting their numbers.\n\nRowling, by her own account, created the dementors after a time in which she, in her own words, \"was clinically depressed\".\n\n===Ghosts===\n'''Ghosts''' play an important secondary role, mainly as advisors to the leading characters. Unlike the ghosts in a traditional [[ghost story]], these ghosts are neither frightening nor necessarily ghoulish. Ghosts in the novels appear silvery and translucent. They can fly and pass through walls, tables, and other solid objects, but nonetheless have some ability to physically affect, and be affected by, the living world. ([[Moaning Myrtle]], for instance, can splash the water in her toilet.{{HP2}}) Ghosts' banquet tables are laden with rotten food, as the decomposition increases their ability to smell and taste it.{{HP2}} Touching or walking through a ghost induces a sensation \"like walking through an icy shower.\"{{HP2}} Ghosts can be affected by magic and curses, though not to the same degree that living beings can.{{HP2}}\n\nIn the ''Harry Potter'' universe, only wizards and witches can become ghosts. As [[Nearly Headless Nick]] explained to Harry, \"Wizards can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth, to walk palely where their living selves once trod ... I was afraid of death. I chose to remain behind. I sometimes wonder whether I oughtn't to have ... Well, that is neither here nor there ... In fact, I am neither here nor there...\"{{HP5}} Despite having chosen this afterlife, many ghosts bemoan their inability to eat, and many are described as gloomy.{{HP2}} They also harbour an attraction to imagery morbid and melancholy.{{HP2}}\n\nGhosts are very sensitive about their condition: when the Ministry initially classified them as sentient creatures with full legal rights,<ref>A \"being\" is defined in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' as a creature \"worthy of legal rights and a voice in the governance of the magical world\"</ref> they claimed that the term was insensitive and received a separate \"Spirit Division\"{{HPF}}, apparently to control the activities and haunting locations of troublesome ghosts (as when Myrtle was forced to haunt the place of her death (Hogwarts) after she had disrupted the wedding of the brother of Olive Hornby, a girl who had teased her at school).{{HP2}}\n\nNamed Ghost characters:\n\n* '''[[Nearly Headless Nick]]''' \u2013 the [[Gryffindor]] house ghost who is nearly headless because he still has his head. Many students who have lost parents have talked to him about death and the possibility of their loved ones existing as ghosts. After Sirius' death, he tells Harry that he lacked the courage to continue on to the next life beyond the veil. His full name is Sir Nicholas De Mimsy-Porpington.\n* '''[[The Bloody Baron]]''' \u2013 the [[Slytherin]] house ghost. He murdered [[Helena Ravenclaw]], who became The Grey Lady. He wears chains as a reminder of his crime. He is the only character at Hogwarts who can \"control\" Peeves.\n* '''[[Helena Ravenclaw|The Grey Lady]]''' \u2013 the [[Ravenclaw]] house ghost. She is the daughter of Hogwarts founder Rowena Ravenclaw. After stealing her mother's diadem, she was killed by The Bloody Baron. Voldemort found the diadem where Helena left it and turned the diadem into a Horcrux. Helena Ravenclaw gave Harry information that helped him find the diadem during the Battle of Hogwarts. In the films, she is friends with Luna Lovegood.\n* '''[[The Fat Friar]]''' \u2013 the [[Hufflepuff]] house ghost. He's unusually cheerful for a ghost, and always helpful and kind towards students, even those who are not in his House. He's also very tolerant with Peeves' mischiefs. According to Pottermore, he was executed by his own monastic order after showing suspicious signs of magic.\n* '''[[Professor Binns]]''' \u2013 the History of Magic professor at [[Hogwarts]]. He died in his sleep one day and his ghost simply got up to teach the next day as if nothing had happened. His routine has not varied the slightest since.\n* '''[[Moaning Myrtle]]''' \u2013 the ghost of a Ravenclaw-girl, killed by a Basilisk, that inhabits the first-floor girls bathroom at Hogwarts.\n* '''Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore''' \u2013 the leader of the Headless Hunt, a club for decapitated ghosts.\n\nPeeves, the Hogwarts [[poltergeist]], is not considered a ghost, but an \"indestructible spirit of chaos\" according to Rowling.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet interview Joanne Kathleen Rowling: Part Two|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm|year=2005|accessdate=1 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Giants===\n'''[[Giant]]s''' in the ''Harry Potter'' universe are capable of interbreeding with humans \u2013 [[Rubeus Hagrid]] is [[half-giant]], as is his love interest [[Olympe Maxime]] \u2013 but wizards as a population{{HP4}} have engaged in an active campaign to hunt giants out of civilisation.{{HP5}} The last giants in Britain were killed apparently by Ministry decree,{{HP5}} but most deaths have been due to territorial aggression among themselves, as wizards force them to live in ever more confined spaces.{{HP5}} The last few giants remaining in the world (the total number is between 70 and 80) are collected together in an isolated region east of Belarus. Giants range in height from twenty to twenty-five feet (6 to 7.5 metres), and have skin similar to [[rhinoceros]] hide, which grants them limited immunity to magical attacks.{{HP5}} Their society is loosely governed by a chief called a Gurg, who spends most of his time demanding food from his underlings.\n\nVoldemort has employed giants in his attacks, after convincing them that he can offer them a better life;{{HP4}} whereas Hagrid reveals in ''Order of the Phoenix'' that he and Madame Maxime went to try and persuade the Giants to take part in the war against Voldemort, but were thwarted when the Gurg was killed and his successor sided with their enemies. Presumably, as a result, giants took part in the Battle of Hogwarts at the end of the series, mostly fighting for Voldemort.{{HP7}}\n\nThe portrayal of giants as a dying breed is consistent with much of European folklore, where they are frequently described as primaeval creatures who built ruins and created strange landforms long before humans arrived.\n\n===Goblins===\n[[File:Warner Brothers studio tour (13085029254).jpg|thumb]]\n'''[[Goblin]]s''' are magical creatures chiefly involved with metalwork and the running of [[Gringotts]] bank. They are represented by the Goblin Liaison Office in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. Goblins are anthropoid, described as having long, thin fingers and feet, black eyes, and domed heads much larger than human heads in proportion to the body.{{DH|ch=24}} Goblins eat a diet of largely raw meat, roots, and fungi {{DH|ch=25}} and converse in a language known as [[Gobbledegook]].{{HP4}} They consider the true owner of an object to be its maker rather than its purchaser and resent the passage of goblin-made heirlooms through Wizarding families without further payment.{{DH|ch=25}} Wizarding law prohibits the ownership of wands by goblins, but goblins are capable of different magic of their own.\n\nRelations between goblins and wizards have been strained for centuries by misunderstandings on both sides, sometimes evoking violence. Along with house-elves, goblins seem to occupy positions as second-class citizens in the [[Wizarding world]]. The goblins remain a neutral force during the Second Wizarding War, siding with neither Voldemort nor the opposition to him. {{DH|ch=15}} In some cases, a weak friendship exists between certain wizards and goblins (particularly [[Bill Weasley]], who works as a Curse Breaker for Gringotts Bank), and there have even been some instances of goblin-wizard interbreeding ([[Professor Flitwick]] has distant goblin ancestry, which likely accounts for his small size).<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Is Flitwick a short human or is he some other type of being?

They are 2\u20133 feet tall, with spindly limbs and oversized heads and eyes. They have pointed, bat-like ears and high, squeaky voices. Their names are usually pet-like diminutives, and they do not appear to have surnames. They habitually refer to themselves in the third person. House-elves are generally obedient, [[wikt:pliant|pliant]], and [[wikt:obsequious|obsequious]]; and when enslaved, wear discarded items such as pillowcases and [[towel|tea-towels]] draped like a toga. House-elves' masters can free them by giving them an item of clothing, much like the [[Hob (folklore)|Hob]] of English Folklore. House-elves can become intoxicated by drinking [[Fictional universe of Harry Potter#Butterbeer|Butterbeer]].\n\nHouse-elves possess [[Magic in Harry Potter|magic]] distinct from that used by wizards and witches, which they generally use in the service of their masters. This magic can be used without the permission of their masters, or even against their orders, though such disobedience obliges them to punish themselves in various painful ways. Among other things, this magic allows house-elves to travel instantly from place to place, even at [[Hogwarts]] and other places where human [[teleportation]] is prevented; and even to thus transport humans.{{HP7}} The full extent of the elves' magic is never fully disclosed, but it seems formidable. Along with the ability to Apparate anywhere at any time, [[#Dobby|Dobby]], [[#Winky|Winky]], [[#Hokey|Hokey]], and [[#Kreacher|Kreacher]] all demonstrate that they can overpower wizards when necessary: In ''Chamber of Secrets'', Dobby forcefully repels [[Lucius Malfoy]] while protecting [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]; whereas in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', when the younger Barty Crouch is unmasked and confesses to what happened on the night of the Quiddich World Championship, he says: \"Winky used her own brand of magic to bind me to her\", and in ''Deathly Hallows'', Kreacher is ordered by Harry to capture [[Mundungus Fletcher]] and bring him to [[12 Grimmauld Place]], a task that he accomplishes within a few days;\u2013\u2013 even though, as Kreacher puts it, \"He has many hidey-holes and accomplices\". Moreover, although House-elves are not allowed to carry wands, they do not appear to need them, being capable of magical feats without them.\n\nIn ''Goblet of Fire'', it is said that a House-elf who has been freed is normally told to find a new family to serve. There is an Office of House-Elf Relocation at the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures|Ministry of Magic]]. House-elves are unendingly loyal to their human families; so much so, that Dobby, who served the [[Malfoy family]], attempts to punish himself each time he utters a negative remark about them (even after his freedom) until the final book, in which he defies [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. According to Kreacher, \"a House-elf's highest law is his master's bidding\"; however, while House-elves must obey their masters without question, they have been known to find [[loophole]]s in orders that allow for unintended interpretations to protect themselves or their friends. Because of their docile, obedient natures, some families abuse their house-elves; [[Dark arts (Harry Potter)|Dark wizard]] families in particular seem to make a habit thereof, as when the Malfoys forced Dobby to torture himself, or when the [[Black family (Harry Potter)|Black family]] customarily decapitated their house-elves as they became enfeebled by age. Nonetheless, most house-elves are horrified by freedom even from the most cruel masters. Dobby, the first introduced, is the sole exception; but this extends chiefly to voluntary service, paid labour, and choice of his own employment and costume. During her time at Hogwarts, [[Hermione Granger]] establishes S.P.E.W. (the 'Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare') to champion House-elves' rights; but gained little interest from her classmates or the House-elves themselves. After Hermione begins leaving elf-sized clothes around the Gryffindor common room, intending for Hogwarts' House-elves to inadvertently free themselves while cleaning, Dobby confides in Harry that the other House-elves find the idea so insulting that Dobby is the only resident elf willing to clean in Gryffindor Tower.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', Dumbledore tells Harry: \"Of House-elves (...) Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he had never grasped\". Kreacher also leads the House-elves of Hogwarts into battle against Voldemort's forces.\n\n===Obscurials/Obscurus===\n'''Obscurials''' are magical children who attempt to repress their magical abilities. If kept unchecked, this repression corrupts the user's magic, creating a dark parasite force known as an '''obscurus'''. The host obscurial keeps the form of the child, appearing normal, if emotionally distressed due to their forced hiding of their magical nature. When their power is unleashed, the child and obscurus share a form of a large shadowy ethereal cloud, usually causing destruction due to the child themselves having little to no control over the obscurus. The host and parasite may retake the form of the child later, again with almost no input from the obscurial. Due to its consuming nature, obscurials rarely live past childhood, and obscurials who do make it to adolescence are considered outstandingly powerful magic users, though they still will have no control.\n\nObscurials first came into notice when wizard-kind was persecuted by non-magical users. In an attempt to hide their true nature and blend in with society, their pain would cause their magic to manifest into an obscurus. As such, obscurials are feared even among witches and wizards, who see them as not only destructive, but a threat to the International Statute of Secrecy. Even today, the creation of obscurials persists through the persecution of magical peoples all across the world.\n\nWhen an Obscurial comes close to their emotional breaking point their eyes turn a milky white and the Obscurus can be observed writhing under its host's skin.\n\nWhen unleashed an obscurus will normally target the source of its host's misery and distress; violently mauling the victim and leaving distinct scratch like burns over the victim's face. Despite their violent nature an obscurus will spare those who have shown kindness and affection to their obscurial host.\n\nObscurus and obscurials play a crucial role in the film ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', ''Fantastic Beasts'' author Newt Scamander expressing guilt for not being able to save an obscurial girl he met in Sudan. In the film's storyline, an Obscurus manifested in 1926 New York in the body of Aurelius Dumbledore, previously known as Credence Barebone who was forced to conceal his magic from his abusive adoptive mother who has formed an organization to persecute witches. Credence was sought by Gellert Grindelwald who causes him to wreak havoc across the city before he was seemingly killed by aurors under orders from the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America, Seraphina Picquery. But Credence survived as a fragment of his obscurus escapes notice and reconstitutes him, retaining it throughout the events of ''[[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald]]'' while learning his true identity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shamsian|first1=Jacob|title=This character's fate at the end of 'Fantastic Beasts' may not be as clear cut as you thought|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/what-happened-to-credence-fantastic-beasts-2016-11|website=Business Insider|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Thestrals===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7527901842).jpg|thumb]]\n{{Redirect|Thestral|the genus|Thestral (bug){{!}}''Thestral'' (bug)}}\n\n'''Thestrals''' are an elusive, carnivorous species of winged horse, visible only to those who have witnessed and embraced a death,<ref>{{cite web|title=J.K.

They have acquired an undeserved reputation as [[omen]]s of evil.<ref>{{cite web|first=Steve |last=Vander Ark |url=http://www.hp-lexicon.org/bestiary/thestrals.html |title=Thestrals in the ''Harry Potter Lexicon'' |website=Hp-lexicon.org }}</ref> The High Inquisitor from the ministry of magic, [[Dolores Umbridge]], asserted that Thestrals are considered \"dangerous creatures\" by the [[Ministry of Magic]], although this might be due to her prejudice against 'half-breeds', as Hagrid is half-giant and is showing thestrals in class.\n\nThestrals have fangs and possess a well-developed sense of smell, which will lead them to [[carrion]] and fresh blood. According to Hagrid, they will not attack a human-sized target without provocation. They are capable of very fast flight for several hours at a time, though they usually spend their time on the ground; and they have an excellent sense of direction. The breed is [[domestication|domesticable]], given a willing [[animal training|trainer]] (Hagrid suspects that he has the only domesticated herd in Britain), after which they may pull loads, and make a serviceable if uncomfortable mode of transportation (Harry rides to the Ministry of Magic by thestral in the fifth book with his friends, although half of the group are unable to actually see their means of transport).\n\nHogwarts has a herd in the nearby [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] and primarily uses them to pull the carriages that transport students to and from the [[Hogsmeade]] train station. They are introduced to [[Care of Magical Creatures]] students in the fifth year by Hagrid in the same year that Harry becomes able to see them after witnessing the death of [[Cedric Diggory]], some months after it occurred. Harry only sees these beasts after he sees Cedric die, yet it is stated (in both the books and the films) that he witnessed his mother die in front of him at the age of one; therefore he logically should have been able to see them throughout the entire series, or should have started seeing them at the start of the summer holidays of that year. When asked about this discrepancy, Rowling responded that when Harry saw his mother die, he was young and did not fully understand the meaning of death and what had happened. When he saw Cedric die, he fully understood what had happened, and had time to think about it before he returned to Hogwarts and saw the Thestrals for the first time.<ref>{{cite web | website = Accio Quote! | title = Archive of J.K.

At any other time, a werewolf is a normal human. However, the term werewolf is used for both the wolf-like creature and the normal human. A werewolf can be distinguished from a true wolf physically by several small distinguishing characteristics, including the eyes, claws, fangs, ears, [[snout]], and tufted tail. A person becomes a werewolf when bitten by another werewolf in wolf-form. Once this happens, the person must learn to manage the condition. The Wolfsbane Potion controls some of the effects of the condition; by allowing the sufferer to maintain their human mind in wolf form, it prevents them from harming others. The potion tastes horrible and very few are skilled enough to brew it, and according to Lupin, the addition of sugar to the potion renders it useless and inert. Nothing discovered in the wizarding world can completely cure a werewolf. Most werewolves live outside normal society and steal food to survive. They generally support Voldemort, whom they think will give them a better life, since they are shunned by the wizard community and are both feared and hated by the common witch and wizard.\n\n[[Remus Lupin]] is the only known exception to this. There are only three known werewolves in the ''Harry Potter'' series: Lupin, [[Fenrir Greyback]] and an unnamed wizard who was in the same ward as [[Arthur Weasley]] in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. [[Bill Weasley]] who is attacked by Fenrir Greyback in The Battle of the Astronomy Tower in the ''Half-Blood Prince'', is not a werewolf. Although Bill suffered a number of side-effects from the attack, including a scarred face and a new love of very rare steak, he does not become a werewolf as Greyback was in human form at the time of the bite. The condition of Lycanthropy can be hereditary, but (as seen in the case of [[Teddy Lupin]]), it is not necessarily so.\n\n==Characters==\nBelow is a list of magical creatures who have some significant role in the series.\n\n===Crookshanks===\nFrom the third book to the sixth, '''Crookshanks''' is [[Hermione Granger]]'s pet cat. Crookshanks was purchased by Hermione in a shop called Magical Menagerie in the third Harry Potter book, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''.

He was once owned by the [[Malfoy family]], and he first appears in ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' to discourage Harry from returning to Hogwarts. Dobby later tries to keep Harry away from Hogwarts by magically sealing off the hidden entrance to [[Platform 9\u00be]], only to be foiled when the protagonists pilot Arthur's flying [[Ford Anglia]] to school. During a [[Quidditch]] match, Dobby enchants a Bludger to chase Harry, hoping to cause him enough injury to be sent home; but the Bludger only manages to break Harry's arm. Dobby discloses that when an enslaved house-elf is presented with an article of clothing by his or her master, that house-elf is subsequently set free; and when Harry (after returning from the [[Chamber of Secrets]]) discovers that Dobby's master is [[Lucius Malfoy]], he tricks Malfoy into setting Dobby free, a feat that secures him the house-elf's undying loyalty. He was now willing to save Harry Potter no matter if it would mean risking his life, because after all, \"Harry Potter set Dobby free!\"\n\nDobby returns in ''Goblet of Fire''. Now a free elf, he obtains a paid post at Hogwarts. Dobby also quickly becomes the only house-elf who will clean the Gryffindor common room, when Hermione leaves knitted clothing half-hidden around the room in an attempt to free the elves, which they find insulting. Dobby later appears in ''Order of the Phoenix'', showing Harry the hidden [[Room of Requirement]], which Harry uses for the secret meetings of [[Dumbledore's Army]]. When [[Professor Umbridge]] finds the meetings later, Dobby enters to warn the group. In ''Half-Blood Prince'' Harry entrusts Dobby to watch his compatriot Kreacher when he orders him to work in the Hogwarts kitchens with the other house-elves; and later assigns both to follow [[Draco Malfoy]].\n\nDobby makes his last appearance in ''Deathly Hallows'' when [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] sends him to rescue the protagonists from [[Malfoy Manor]] after Harry asks for Aberforth's help while viewing his eye in Sirius' mirror, but in the process Dobby is killed by [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. He is buried at Shell Cottage, beneath a headstone bearing the [[epitaph]] \"Here Lies Dobby, A Free Elf\".\n\nDobby's name is derived from a creature in English folklore.

Phoenix tail [[feather]]s are suitable for inclusion in some wands (both Harry and Voldemort's wands contain a feather from Fawkes' tail, the only two he ever gave) and their tears have healing powers. Fawkes can also teleport himself and others in a burst of flame.\n\nIn ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry's display of loyalty to Dumbledore results in his summoning Fawkes to his aid against [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s [[#Basilisk|basilisk]] in the Chamber of Secrets; whereupon Fawkes punctures the basilisk's eyes, eliminating her ability to kill with her gaze. Fawkes later uses his tears to negate the basilisk's venom; and when the basilisk is killed, conveys Harry Potter, Ron and Ginny Weasley, and [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] to their guardians. In ''Goblet of Fire'', during the duel between Harry and Voldemort, the \"reverse spell effect\" ('[[Priori Incantatem]]') occurs, as both of their wands are made of Fawkes' feathers.\n\nDuring the confrontation between Voldemort and Dumbledore in the Ministry of Magic at the climax of ''Order of the Phoenix'' (book only), Fawkes saves Dumbledore's life by swallowing a [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unforgivable Curses|Killing Curse]] from Voldemort; then bursts into flame and is reborn as a chick from the ashes.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's death in ''Half-Blood Prince'', Fawkes is heard singing a [[lament]], and thereafter is not seen again. In an interview, Rowling stated this was to symbolise the loss of Dumbledore. When asked why Fawkes did not return to Harry due to his loyalty to Dumbledore, Rowling stated that Fawkes was non-transferable between owners.\n\nAccording to Rowling, Fawkes is named after 17th century conspirator [[Guy Fawkes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Scholastic Online Chat Transcript|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-scholastic-chat.htm|website=Accio Quote!|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Firenze===\n'''Firenze''' is a [[#Centaurs|centaur]] and, after ''Order of the Phoenix'', a Divination teacher at Hogwarts.<ref name=Accio-quote>{{cite web |url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html |title=J.K.

He first appears towards the end of ''Philosopher's Stone'', in which he rescues Harry from Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Having carried Harry to safety on his back, Firenze quarrels with other centaurs who object to the symbolic suggestion that centaurs are subservient to humans.\n\nThe character does not make another appearance until ''Order of the Phoenix'', in which he is appointed by Dumbledore to teach [[Magic in Harry Potter#Divination|Divination]] at Hogwarts in place of [[Sybill Trelawney]], who has been sacked by [[Dolores Umbridge]]. For this, he is [[Ostracism|ostracised]] by his fellows. In ''Half-Blood Prince'', he shares teaching duties with a reinstated Trelawney.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', he is seen near the end of the book alongside the other members of the [[Hogwarts staff]], against Voldemort and his Death Eaters; it is mentioned that he was wounded on his flanks by the Death Eaters but ultimately survived the Battle. Although not mentioned in the series, Rowling revealed that after the Battle, Firenze's herd was forced to acknowledge that his pro-human leanings were not shameful, and allowed him to rejoin them.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\">{{cite news |url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/7/30/j-k-rowling-web-chat-transcript |title=J.K.

In the film ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them]]'', Frank is the reason Newt went to America. After rescuing Frank from the traffickers, Newt stored Frank with his other magical creatures in his suitcase. Newt brings Frank to America in hopes of returning him to his native land of Arizona.\n\nIn the climax of the film, the existence of magic is revealed to the people of New York City, following a battle between American wizarding government MACUSA and an obscurial. Knowing the secrecy of wizard-kind has been compromised, Newt releases Frank from his suitcase and gives him a potion that has memory wiping properties. Because of the thunderbird's ability to generate storms, Newt says goodbye to Frank as Frank flies into the sky, creating a rainfall using the liquid from the potion, erasing the memories of all non-magical people of the event.\n\nRowling revealed in a tweet following the film's release that Frank did indeed make it back to Arizona following the events of the film.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=jk_rowling|author=J.K.

In ''Philosopher's Stone'', after Hagrid presents Harry's key and Dumbledore's letter to an unnamed goblin in the Gringotts lobby, Griphook is called to escort Harry and Hagrid through the underground rail-system to Harry's vault, and afterwards to Vault 713 to retrieve the ''Philosopher's Stone''. He is not heard of again until ''Deathly Hallows'', when the Snatchers holding him captive also capture Harry, Ron, and Hermione. When Hermione lies under torture to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] that the sword of Gryffindor is a fake, Bellatrix asks Griphook for confirmation, which she receives. He is saved, along with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, by Dobby and successfully escapes to [[Shell Cottage]]. Because Harry needs to take a Horcrux from Bellatrix's vault, Griphook reluctantly agrees to help them break into Gringotts, in exchange for the sword of Gryffindor; but when escaping, Griphook betrays them to the other goblins and escapes with the sword. His fate is left unknown in the book, but in the film he is shown dead during the aftermath at Gringotts, and Gryffindor's sword vanishes before Voldemort can see it. In spite of Griphook's insistence that the sword belongs to the goblins, the sword reappears when [[Neville Longbottom]] pulls it from the [[Sorting Hat]] and beheads [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Nagini|Nagini]].\n\n[[Verne Troyer]] appeared as Griphook in the film adaptation of ''Philosopher's Stone'' with [[Warwick Davis]] providing his voice and the latter fully portrayed him in the ''Deathly Hallows'' films.\n\n===Hedwig===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Hedwig).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|]]\n'''Hedwig''' is Harry's owl, given to him in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' as an eleventh birthday present by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], who purchases the owl in [[Diagon Alley]] at the [[Places in Harry Potter#Eeylops Owl Emporium|Eeylops Owl Emporium]]. Harry gives her this name after reading it in a book on the history of magic. Hedwig is used for delivering messages throughout the series, and also serves as a companion to Harry, especially when he is unable to interact with other wizards. It is implied throughout the books that Hedwig can fully understand Harry's speech. In the fifth book, ''Order of the Phoenix'',<ref>Rowling, J. K. ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix''. New York: Listening Library, 2003. Print.</ref> Hedwig is intercepted by [[Dolores Umbridge]] and is hurt, but is later healed by [[Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank|Professor Grubbly-Plank]]. In the seventh book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|The Deathly Hallows]]'', Hedwig is killed by a curse from a [[Death Eater]]; in the film version, she is killed defending Harry from the Death Eater. According to Rowling, Hedwig's death represents the loss of Harry's innocence.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/>\n\nAlthough the character of Hedwig is female, she is played on film by male owls (female [[snowy owl]]s have dark patches of plumage, while only the males are completely white). The [[John Williams]] composition which serves as title music for the entire film series is named \"Hedwig's Theme\".\n\n===Hokey===\n'''Hokey''' is a house-elf who works for [[Minor Harry Potter characters#Hepzibah Smith|Hepzibah Smith]], an old woman deceived by Tom Riddle into showing him Slytherin's locket and Hufflepuff's cup, which he uses as two of his Horcruxes. Hokey's memory allows Harry and Dumbledore a glimpse of the visit Voldemort makes two days before Hepzibah Smith is poisoned and both treasures disappear; whereafter Riddle, who magically tampers with Hokey's memories, frames Hokey for Hepzibah's murder. She does not deny the accusation and is convicted for accidental murder.\n\n===Kreacher===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (Kreacher).jpg|thumb]]\n'''Kreacher''' is a house-elf who serves the [[Black family (Harry Potter)|House of Black]] for generations and whose name is a play on the word ''[[wikt:creature|creature]]''. Kreacher first appears in ''Order of the Phoenix'' as an unwilling servant to [[Sirius Black]]. Kreacher disdains Sirius, mainly due to his devotion to his former masters ([[Regulus Black]] in particular), whose pure-blood values Sirius has rejected. Sirius also treats him harshly because the elf is a living reminder of a home to which he earlier had no intention of returning. Knowing too much of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]]'s activity, Kreacher is not allowed to leave [[Grimmauld Place]]. Kreacher has lived alone in the house for years with only the screaming portrait of Mrs. Black for company. Despite obeying Sirius, he is insolent and rude, insulting in undertones all present who he refers to as ''\"Blood traitors, Mudbloods and scum\"''.  Hermione comments on this: \"I don't think he realises we can hear him.\"  <ref>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, chapter 6.</ref>\n\nKreacher desires to leave Sirius and serve his next of kin, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] and the Malfoys. He betrays Sirius and persuades Harry to go to the [[Department of Mysteries]], where a trap has been laid. Sirius is killed by Bellatrix in the ensuing combat, while trying to save Harry. Following Sirius' death, Harry inherits all of Sirius' possessions, including a highly unwilling Kreacher. Harry immediately orders him to work at Hogwarts, where he comes to blows with Dobby about his lack of loyalty to Harry.\n\nIn ''Deathly Hallows'', Harry and his friends coax from the house-elf the current whereabouts of [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Salazar Slytherin's Locket]], a Black heirloom and one of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es; whereafter Harry sends Kreacher to retrieve the locket from [[Mundungus Fletcher]] and gives him its substitute as a token of remembrance (referring to Regulus Black, who alone treated Kreacher with respect). Thereafter Kreacher appears cleaner and happier, restores the house to pristine condition, and begins to treat Harry and his friends with courtesy and respect. When Grimmauld Place is infiltrated by Death Eaters, Harry decides against calling the elf back to them, fearing possible betrayal. In the Battle of Hogwarts, Kreacher rallies the Hogwarts house-elves against the [[Death Eaters]], calling Harry his \"master and defender of house elves\". It is implied that he survived the battle, as Harry wonders 'whether Kreacher will bring him a sandwich' after his battle with Voldemort.\n\nKreacher appears in the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (movie)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', voiced by [[Timothy Bateson]].<ref name=kreacher-mtv>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1542581/10062006/story.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler|title=Elf's Absence From Next 'Harry Potter' Flick Opens Up Plot Questions|website=MTV|date=6 October 2006|accessdate=6 October 2006}}</ref> Producers admitted they had wished to cut the character from the film, but when Rowling was consulted, she advised: \"You know, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

He is capable of flight and can choose whether to be tangible; and is able to manipulate objects, a trait not generally possible with ghosts, but common among poltergeists. Peeves' existence is essentially the embodiment of disorder,<ref>{{cite web|title=FAQ: Peeves chews gum, how can he when he is a ghost?

In appearance, he is a small man with a mischievous face and a wide mouth, dressed in vibrantly coloured clothing. He derives joy from disaster and mischievous acts, usually causing disruptions to daily activity.\n\nPeeves only listens to a select few: Dumbledore; [[the Bloody Baron]]; in the second book [[Nearly Headless Nick]]; and in the fifth book, [[Fred and George Weasley]]. Filch, who is usually left with cleaning up the mess and damage that Peeves causes, tries repeatedly to remove him; however, Rowling has stated in an interview that not even Dumbledore would be able to rid Hogwarts of Peeves forever.<ref>{{cite news | title = J.

In ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Harry uses magic to attach Peeves' tongue to the roof of his mouth, after which Peeves angrily departs.\n\nDuring [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s attempts to take control of Hogwarts in ''Order of the Phoenix'', Peeves, along with many of the non-Slytherin students, begins a concerted campaign of practical jokes and pranks at the Weasley twins' request, in order to make Umbridge's time at Hogwarts as unpleasant as possible, a task Peeves undertakes with tremendous glee. When Umbridge attempts to sneak out of Hogwarts, Peeves chases her out, whacking her with [[Minerva McGonagall]]'s cane (which she lent to him expressly for that purpose) and a sock full of chalk. Many of the other professors also resent her presence and either turn a blind eye to what is done to Umbridge at the hands of Peeves and the students, or occasionally even providing a small measure of assistance. Peeves is twice depicted at the conclusion of ''Deathly Hallows'': initially attacking Death Eaters with vicious plants and subsequently singing a victory song for Harry.\n\nIt is indicated that Peeves was still at Hogwarts at the time of the epilogue, since Harry tells his son Albus Severus not to \"mess with Peeves\".\n\n[[Rik Mayall]] was cast as Peeves for the film adaptation of ''Philosopher's Stone'', but his scenes were cut from the final film and do not even appear in the deleted scenes section of the DVD release.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/050/050980p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112013124/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/050/050980p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 January 2008 |title=Potter Gloucester Set Report |accessdate=8 August 2007 |date=4 April 2001 |first=Brian |last=Linder |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]}}</ref> He had not been made aware that his scenes had been cut until the full film was officially unveiled at the premiere.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I8SYswvVe-YC&printsec=frontcover |title=Bigger than Hitler \u2013 Better than Christ |first=Rik |last=Mayall |author-link=Rik Mayall |publisher=[[HarperCollins UK]] |date=10 January 2014 |pages=352 |isbn=9780007375431}}</ref> Peeves was subsequently omitted from the ''Harry Potter'' films that followed, though he can be seen in the video games.\n\n===Winky===\n'''Winky''' is a house-elf who originally served the Crouch family, described as having enormous brown eyes and a large, round, soft nose. She viewed herself as a dutiful servant and guarded the family's many secrets. When [[Barty Crouch Jr]] is rescued from [[Azkaban]] by his mother, he is supervised and nursed back to health by Winky. In ''Goblet of Fire'', she persuades [[Barty Crouch Sr]] to let his son attend the Quidditch World Cup; she attends it with the younger Crouch, who is hiding under an [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]], and claims the apparently empty seat beside her is being saved for Crouch Sr. During the festivities, Crouch Jr steals Harry's wand from his pocket and later uses it to conjure the [[Dark Mark]], in spite of Winky's attempts to stop him. In the resulting chaos, Harry and his friends see Winky running into the forest, appearing to struggle against the invisible Crouch Jr. Later she is caught with Harry's wand, which is magically proven to be the one used to conjure the Dark Mark; though Crouch Sr realises what happened, he agrees with the apparent conclusion that Winky conjured the mark, and fires her, both to save face and as punishment for failing to control Crouch Jr. Following her dismissal, Dobby takes the distraught Winky to work with him at Hogwarts. There the unhappy Winky, retaining her loyalty to Crouch, becomes an alcoholic until the final book, and eventually fights in the Battle of Hogwarts with the other house-elves.<ref name=\"RowlingWeb2007\"/>\n\n===The Weasleys' creatures===\nMany pets and animals are associated with the Weasley family:\n\n* [[Scabbers]] \u2013 a [[brown rat]] retained for twelve years; at first by Percy, but passed to Ron. Near the end of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|third book]], Scabbers is revealed to be [[Death Eater#Peter Pettigrew|Peter Pettigrew]], an [[Animagus]] whose betrayal of [[James Potter (character)|James]] and [[Lily Potter]] led to their deaths at the hand of [[Lord Voldemort]].\n* Pigwidgeon (nicknamed \"Pig\") \u2013 Ron's hyperactive [[scops owl]], a gift from [[Sirius Black]] upon the loss of Scabbers.\n* Hermes \u2013 a [[screech owl]] owned by Percy, which was a gift to him from his parents for becoming a Prefect in his fifth year. He is named after the [[Greek god]] [[Hermes]].\n* Errol \u2013 an aged [[great grey owl]] who serves as the family's courier. He has trouble carrying loads and is often found unconscious after collision or exhaustion. Possibly a reference to [[Errol Fuller]], who wrote a few books on extinct birds.\n* Arnold \u2013 a purple Pygmy Puff (miniature puffskein) owned by Ginny and obtained from [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] in the sixth book.\n* A puffskein belonging to Ron and killed by Fred when he used it for Bludger practice, revealed in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|first ''Harry Potter'' game]], and later confirmed in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]].''\n* A benevolent [[ghoul]] lives in the attic of [[The Burrow (Harry Potter)|The Burrow]] and causes minor disruptions by groaning and banging on the walls and pipes. In ''Deathly Hallows'', the ghoul is magically altered in appearance to resemble Ron as cover for his absence from school.  The ghoul is enthusiastic about this and seems to relish the attention it receives. In 12 Grimmauld Place there is also a ghoul in \"an upstairs bathroom\".\n* The Weasleys have [[gnome]]s all over their garden and in their shed, bushes, [[Wellington boots]], and more. They are quarrelsome and seem to know many obscenities, which they were supposedly taught by Fred and George Weasley. [[#Crookshanks|Crookshanks]] likes to chase the gnomes while visiting; the rest of the family deals with them by physically throwing them off the grounds. In ''Deathly Hallows'' one bites Luna Lovegood; whereas Fred is bitten by one in ''Half-Blood Prince'' and as a punishment stuns it, paints it gold, gives it a miniature tutu with wings and hangs it on top of the Christmas tree as an angel.\n\n===Hagrid's pets===\n[[File:The Making of Harry Potter 29-05-2012 (7527263992).jpg|150px|thumb]]\nOver the course of the series, Hagrid cares for a large number of animals, many of them dangerous, including [[Aragog]] (a giant spider or 'Acromantula'), [[Buckbeak]] ([[Hippogriff]]), [[Fang (Harry Potter)|Fang]] (boarhound), [[Fluffy (Harry Potter)|Fluffy]] ([[Cerberus|Three-Headed Dog]]), [[Norbert]] ('Norwegian Ridgeback' [[Dragon]]; later found to be female and re-named Norberta), and Tenebrus (Thestral). Hagrid's love for animals got him the teaching job for Care of Magical Creatures at Hogwarts. In their fourth year, Harry and his classmates take care of Hagrid's Blast-Ended Skrewts (a crustacean-like predator), one of which (grown to giant size) is placed in the hedge maze for the final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Although its exoskeleton can repel spells, Harry is able to pass it unhurt. They also have lessons on Nifflers, Unicorns, Fire salamanders and Flobberworms.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Wikipedia books|Harry Potter}}\n* [[Care of Magical Creatures]]\n* [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Harry Potter}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magical Creatures in Harry Potter}}\n[[Category:Harry Potter universe|Creatures]]\n[[Category:Fantasy creatures]]\n[[Category:Ghosts in written fiction]]\n", "name_user": "82.9.101.135", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDobby)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter"}

In contrast to honey bees, yellowjackets have yellow or white markings, are not covered with tan-brown dense hair on their bodies, do not carry pollen, and do not have the flattened, hairy hind legs used to carry it.\n\nYellowjackets have lance-like stingers with small barbs, and typically sting repeatedly,<ref name = Akre/> though occasionally a stinger becomes lodged and pulls free of the wasp's body; the [[venom]], like most [[Bee sting|bee]] and wasp venoms, is primarily dangerous to only those humans who are [[allergic]] or are stung many times. All species have yellow or white on their faces. Their mouthparts are well-developed with strong [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] for capturing and chewing insects, with [[Proboscis|probosces]] for sucking nectar, fruit, and other juices. Yellowjackets build nests in trees, shrubs, or in protected places such as inside man-made structures, or in soil cavities, tree stumps, mouse burrows, etc. They build them from wood fiber they chew into a paper-like pulp. Many other insects exhibit [[protective mimicry]] of aggressive, stinging yellowjackets; in addition to numerous [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s ([[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]), the list includes some [[fly|flies]], [[moth]]s, and [[beetle]]s ([[Batesian mimicry]]).\n\nYellowjackets' closest relatives, the [[hornet]]s, closely resemble them, but have larger heads, seen especially in the large distance from the eyes to the back of the head.<ref name = Akre/> {{clr}}\n\n== Life cycle and habits ==\n[[File:Vespula 0078.JPG|thumb|left|''Vespula squamosa'' queen]]\nYellowjackets are social hunters living in colonies containing workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens [[overwinter]]ing. Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as in hollow logs, in stumps, under bark, in leaf litter, in soil cavities, and in man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20&nbsp;days. [[Larvae]] [[pupate]], then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed up meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.\n\nFrom this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4000 to 5000<ref>Lives of Social Insects Peggy Larson p.13</ref> workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. (This is true of most species in most areas; however, ''V. squamosa'', in the southern part of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by scores of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells.) At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.\n\nThe diet of the adult yellowjacket consists primarily of items rich in sugars and [[carbohydrates]], such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish, which are collected by the adults, which chew and condition them before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the adults are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/benefits-of-wasps-yellow-jackets-zw0z1303zkin.aspx|title=About Yellowjackets and the Benefits of Wasps in the Garden|work=Mother Earth News}}</ref> Larvae, in return, secrete a sugar material to be eaten by the adults; this exchange is a form of [[trophallaxis]]. In late summer, foraging workers pursue other food sources from meats to ripe fruits, or scavenge human garbage, sodas, picnics, etc., as additional sugar is needed to foster the next generation's queens.<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\"/>\n\n== Notable species ==\n*European yellowjackets, the German wasp (''[[Vespula germanica]]''), and the common wasp (''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'') were originally native to Europe, but are now established in southern Africa, New Zealand, and eastern Australia\n*The North American yellowjacket (''[[Vespula alascensis]]''), [[eastern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula maculifrons''), western yellowjacket (''[[Vespula pensylvanica]]''), and prairie yellowjacket (''[[Vespula atropilosa]]'') are native to North America.\n*[[Vespula squamosa|Southern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula squamosa'')\n*[[Bald-faced hornet]]s (''Dolichovespula maculata'') belong among the yellowjackets rather than the true hornets.

Collected in Alabama, USA, 2007. Dimensions approximately 18 inches by 24 inches by 12 inches (46 cm by 61 cm by 30 cm).]]\n\n''Dolichovespula'' species such as the aerial yellowjacket, ''D. arenaria'', and the [[bald-faced hornet]], tend to create exposed aerial nests. This feature is shared with some true hornets, which has led to some naming confusion.\n\n''Vespula'' species, in contrast, build concealed nests, usually underground.\n\nYellowjacket nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the \"foundress\". Typically, a nest can reach the size of a basketball by the end of a season. In parts of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and southwestern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest overwintering. Nests that survive multiple seasons become massive and often possess multiple egg-laying queens.<ref name=tuscaloosa>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060717/NEWS/607180308/1007/9112002|author=|date=|title=Yellow jackets building enormous nests|publisher=TuscaloosaNews.com|accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aces.edu/department/extcomm/npa/daily/archives/002193.php Extension Daily: What is Causing Super-sized Yellow Jacket Nests?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629105352/http://www.aces.edu/department/extcomm/npa/daily/archives/002193.php |date=2007-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n== In the United States ==\nThe [[Vespula germanica|German yellowjacket]] (''V. germanica'') first appeared in Ohio in 1975, and has now become the dominant species over the eastern yellowjacket. It is bold and aggressive, and can sting repeatedly and painfully. It will mark aggressors and pursue them. It is often confused with ''[[Polistes dominula]]'', an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities\u2014not necessarily underground\u2014with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on the source of the wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within the combs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn the southeastern United States, where southern yellowjacket (''[[Vespula squamosa]]'') nests may persist through the winter, [[Group size measures|colony sizes]] of this species may reach 100,000 adult wasps.<ref name=tuscaloosa/> The same kind of nest expansion has occurred in [[Hawaii]] with the invasive western yellowjacket (''V. pensylvanica'').<ref>[http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/hcsu/projects.php \"Response of Native Plant Communities to Alien Species Management on the Island of Hawaii\"] on the Hawaiian Cooperative Studies Program website</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Giovanna Garzoni (Italian - Still Life with Bowl of Citrons - Google Art Project (detail with wasp).jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Giovanna Garzoni]]'s ''Still Life with Bowl of Citrons'', 17th century]]\n\nThe yellowjacket's most visible place in American popular culture is as a [[mascot]], most famously with the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]], represented by the mascot [[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]].

Yellowjackets build nests in trees, shrubs, or in protected places such as inside man-made structures, or in soil cavities, tree stumps, mouse burrows, etc. They build them from wood fiber they chew into a paper-like pulp. Many other insects exhibit [[protective mimicry]] of aggressive, stinging yellowjackets; in addition to numerous [[bee]]s and [[wasp]]s ([[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]), the list includes some [[fly|flies]], [[moth]]s, and [[beetle]]s ([[Batesian mimicry]]).\n\nYellowjackets' closest relatives, the [[hornet]]s, closely resemble them, but have larger heads, seen especially in the large distance from the eyes to the back of the head.<ref name = Akre/> {{clr}}\n\n== Life cycle and habits ==\n[[File:Vespula 0078.JPG|thumb|left|''Vespula squamosa'' queen]]\nYellowjackets are social hunters living in colonies containing workers, queens, and males (drones). Colonies are annual with only inseminated queens [[overwinter]]ing. Fertilized queens are found in protected places such as in hollow logs, in stumps, under bark, in leaf litter, in soil cavities, and in man-made structures. Queens emerge during the warm days of late spring or early summer, select a nest site, and build a small paper nest in which they lay eggs. After eggs hatch from the 30 to 50 brood cells, the queen feeds the young larvae for about 18 to 20&nbsp;days. [[Larvae]] [[pupate]], then emerge later as small, infertile females called workers. Workers in the colony take over caring for the larvae, feeding them with chewed up meat or fruit. By midsummer, the first adult workers emerge and assume the tasks of nest expansion, foraging for food, care of the queen and larvae, and colony defense.\n\nFrom this time until her death in the autumn, the queen remains inside the nest, laying eggs. The colony then expands rapidly, reaching a maximum size of 4000 to 5000<ref>Lives of Social Insects Peggy Larson p.13</ref> workers and a nest of 10,000 to 15,000 cells in late summer. (This is true of most species in most areas; however, ''V. squamosa'', in the southern part of its range, may build much larger perennial colonies populated by scores of queens, tens of thousands of workers, and hundreds of thousands of cells.) At peak size, reproductive cells are built with new males and queens produced. Adult reproductives remain in the nest fed by the workers. New queens build up fat reserves to overwinter. Adult reproductives leave the parent colony to mate. After mating, males quickly die, while fertilized queens seek protected places to overwinter. Parent colony workers dwindle, usually leaving the nest to die, as does the foundress queen. Abandoned nests rapidly decompose and disintegrate during the winter. They can persist as long as they are kept dry, but are rarely used again. In the spring, the cycle is repeated; weather in the spring is the most important factor in colony establishment.\n\nThe diet of the adult yellowjacket consists primarily of items rich in sugars and [[carbohydrates]], such as fruits, flower nectar, and tree sap. Larvae feed on proteins derived from insects, meats, and fish, which are collected by the adults, which chew and condition them before feeding them to the larvae. Many of the insects collected by the adults are considered pest species, making the yellowjacket beneficial to [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/benefits-of-wasps-yellow-jackets-zw0z1303zkin.aspx|title=About Yellowjackets and the Benefits of Wasps in the Garden|work=Mother Earth News}}</ref> Larvae, in return, secrete a sugar material to be eaten by the adults; this exchange is a form of [[trophallaxis]]. In late summer, foraging workers pursue other food sources from meats to ripe fruits, or scavenge human garbage, sodas, picnics, etc., as additional sugar is needed to foster the next generation's queens.<ref name=\"motherearthnews.com\"/>\n\n== Notable species ==\n*European yellowjackets, the German wasp (''[[Vespula germanica]]''), and the common wasp (''[[Vespula vulgaris]]'') were originally native to Europe, but are now established in southern Africa, New Zealand, and eastern Australia\n*The North American yellowjacket (''[[Vespula alascensis]]''), [[eastern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula maculifrons''), western yellowjacket (''[[Vespula pensylvanica]]''), and prairie yellowjacket (''[[Vespula atropilosa]]'') are native to North America.\n*[[Vespula squamosa|Southern yellowjacket]] (''Vespula squamosa'')\n*[[Bald-faced hornet]]s (''Dolichovespula maculata'') belong among the yellowjackets rather than the true hornets.

This feature is shared with some true hornets, which has led to some naming confusion.\n\n''Vespula'' species, in contrast, build concealed nests, usually underground.\n\nYellowjacket nests usually last for only one season, dying off in winter. The nest is started by a single queen, called the \"foundress\". Typically, a nest can reach the size of a basketball by the end of a season. In parts of Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, and southwestern coastal areas of the United States, the winters are mild enough to allow nest overwintering. Nests that survive multiple seasons become massive and often possess multiple egg-laying queens.<ref name=tuscaloosa>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060717/NEWS/607180308/1007/9112002|author=|date=|title=Yellow jackets building enormous nests|publisher=TuscaloosaNews.com|accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aces.edu/department/extcomm/npa/daily/archives/002193.php Extension Daily: What is Causing Super-sized Yellow Jacket Nests?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629105352/http://www.aces.edu/department/extcomm/npa/daily/archives/002193.php |date=2007-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n== In the United States ==\nThe [[Vespula germanica|German yellowjacket]] (''V. germanica'') first appeared in Ohio in 1975, and has now become the dominant species over the eastern yellowjacket. It is bold and aggressive, and can sting repeatedly and painfully. It will mark aggressors and pursue them. It is often confused with ''[[Polistes dominula]]'', an invasive species in the United States, due to their very similar pattern. The German yellowjacket builds its nests in cavities\u2014not necessarily underground\u2014with the peak worker population in temperate areas between 1000 and 3000 individuals between May and August. Each colony produces several thousand new reproductives after this point through November. The eastern yellowjacket builds its nests underground, also with the peak worker population between 1000 and 3000 individuals, similar to the German yellowjacket. Nests are built entirely of wood fiber and are completely enclosed except for a small entrance at the bottom. The color of the paper is highly dependent on the source of the wood fibers used. The nests contain multiple, horizontal tiers of combs within. Larvae hang within the combs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn the southeastern United States, where southern yellowjacket (''[[Vespula squamosa]]'') nests may persist through the winter, [[Group size measures|colony sizes]] of this species may reach 100,000 adult wasps.<ref name=tuscaloosa/> The same kind of nest expansion has occurred in [[Hawaii]] with the invasive western yellowjacket (''V. pensylvanica'').<ref>[http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/hcsu/projects.php \"Response of Native Plant Communities to Alien Species Management on the Island of Hawaii\"] on the Hawaiian Cooperative Studies Program website</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Giovanna Garzoni (Italian - Still Life with Bowl of Citrons - Google Art Project (detail with wasp).jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Giovanna Garzoni]]'s ''Still Life with Bowl of Citrons'', 17th century]]\n\nThe yellowjacket's most visible place in American popular culture is as a [[mascot]], most famously with the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]], represented by the mascot [[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]].
