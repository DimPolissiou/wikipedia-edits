They scored over 40 goals between them in their first season together and were considered to be Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, [[Georgios Samaras]] was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/celtic/268099-gary-hooper-wants-to-maintain-strike-partnership/ |title=Gary Hooper wants to maintain strike partnership |publisher=STV Sport |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role.

They scored over 40 goals between them in their first season together and were considered to be Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, [[Georgios Samaras]] was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sport.stv.tv/football/scottish-premier/celtic/268099-gary-hooper-wants-to-maintain-strike-partnership/ |title=Gary Hooper wants to maintain strike partnership |publisher=STV Sport |date=29 August 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}</ref> In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role.

Stafford]] and cosmonaut [[Alexei Leonov]] shake hands in space during the [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]].\n}}\nThe '''Space Race''' was a 20th-century competition between two [[Cold War]] rivals, the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) and the [[United States]] (US), to achieve firsts in [[spaceflight]] capability. It had its origins in the [[ballistic missile]]-based [[nuclear arms race]] between the two nations following [[World War&nbsp;II]]. The technological advantage required to rapidly achieve spaceflight milestones was seen as necessary for [[national security]], and mixed with the symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race led to pioneering efforts to launch [[artificial satellite]]s, uncrewed [[space probe]]s of the [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]], and [[human spaceflight]] in [[low Earth orbit]] and to the Moon.<ref>[https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race history.com, Space Race]</ref>\n\nThe competition began in earnest on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the [[International Geophysical Year]], by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful launch with the October 4, 1957, orbiting of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of [[Yuri Gagarin]] on April 12, 1961. The USSR also sent the first woman, [[Valentina Tereshkova]], to space on June 16, 1963, with numerous other firsts taking place activities. According to Russian sources, these achievements led to the conclusion that the USSR had an advantage in space technology in the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.history.com/news/from-sputnik-to-spacewalking-7-soviet-space-firsts history.com, From Sputnik to Spacewalking: 7 Soviet Space Firsts, Oct 4, 2012]</ref>\n\nAccording to US sources, the \"race\" peaked with the July 20, 1969, US landing of the first humans on the Moon with [[Apollo 11]]. Most US sources will point to the Apollo 11 lunar landing as a singular achievement far outweighing any combination of Soviet achievements. The USSR attempted several [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|crewed lunar missions]], but eventually canceled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations, while the US landed several more times on the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059A|title=Apollo 11 Command and Service Module (CSM)|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059C|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Module / EASEP|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"orbit\">{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/landing-missions/apollo11.cfm |title=Apollo 11 Mission Summary |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_sites.html |title=Apollo Landing Site Coordinates |publisher=NASA|work=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive |first=David R. |last=Williams |date=December 11, 2003 |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA period of [[d\u00e9tente]] followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and co-developing the enabling docking standard [[APAS-75]].

The United States had used these weapons operationally during World War II, and it could use them again against the Soviet Union, laying waste to its cities and military centers.<ref name=Burroughs149-51/> Since the Americans had a much larger air force than the Soviet Union, and the United States maintained advance air bases near Soviet territory, in 1947 Stalin ordered the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs) in order to counter the perceived American threat.<ref name=\"Gatland 100-01\">Gatland (1976), pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n[[File:Roket_Launcher_R-7.svg|thumb|Soviet R-7 [[intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBM]], and [[R-7 (rocket family)|its derivative launch vehicles]] for Sputnik, Vostok, Voskhod, and Soyuz]]\n\nIn 1953, Korolev was given the go-ahead to develop the [[R-7 Semyorka]] rocket, which represented a major advance from the German design. Although some of its components (notably boosters) still resembled the German G-4, the new rocket incorporated staged design, a completely new control system, and a new fuel. It was successfully tested on August 21, 1957, and became the world's first fully operational ICBM the following month.<ref>Hall & Shayler (2001), p. 56</ref> It was later used to launch the first satellite into space, and [[R-7 (rocket family)|derivatives]] launched all piloted Soviet spacecraft.<ref>Siddiqi (2003a), pp. 468\u2013469</ref>\n\nThe United States had multiple rocket programs divided among the different branches of the American armed services, which meant that each force developed its own ICBM program.

Therefore, he selected the untried [[Naval Research Laboratory]]'s [[Vanguard rocket]], which was a research-only booster.<ref name=\"Schefter15-18\">Schefter (1999), pp. 15\u201318</ref> This meant that von Braun's team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their Jupiter-C rocket, because of its intended use as a future military vehicle.<ref name=\"Schefter15-18\"/> On September 20, 1956, von Braun and his team did launch a Jupiter-C that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit, but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of reentry vehicle technology.<ref name=\"Schefter15-18\"/>\n\nKorolev received word about von Braun's 1956 Jupiter-C test and, mistakenly thinking it was a satellite mission that failed, expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit.

Shortly thereafter, [[Soyuz 1]] impacted the ground 3&nbsp;km (1.9&nbsp;mi) west of Karabutak, exploding into a ball of flames. The official autopsy states Komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact, and that the subsequent heat mutilation of his corpse was a result of the explosive impact. Fixing the spacecraft's faults caused an eighteen-month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Onward to the Moon==\nThe United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire, fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Major differences between Block I and Block II|Block II command module]].

NASA had achieved its first landing goal with enough Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launchers left for eight follow-on lunar landings through Apollo 20, conducting extended-endurance missions and transporting the landing crews in [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s on the last five. They also planned an [[Apollo Applications Program]] to develop a longer-duration Earth orbital workshop (later named [[Skylab]]) to be constructed in orbit from a spent [[S-IVB]] upper stage, using several launches of the smaller [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle. But planners soon decided this could be done more efficiently by using the two live stages of a Saturn V to launch the workshop pre-fabricated from an S-IVB (which was also the Saturn V third stage), which immediately removed Apollo 20. Budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well, but keep three extended/Lunar Rover missions. [[Apollo 13]] encountered an in-flight spacecraft failure and had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970, returning its crew safely but temporarily grounding the program again. It resumed with four successful landings on [[Apollo 14]] (February 1971), [[Apollo 15]] (July 1971), [[Apollo 16]] (April 1972), and [[Apollo 17]] (December 1972).{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn February 1969, President [[Richard M. Nixon]] convened a [[National Space Council|Space Task Group]] to set recommendations for the future US civilian space program, headed by his Vice President [[Spiro T. Agnew]].<ref>Hepplewhite, p. 123</ref> Agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of NASA's follow-on plans, and the STG recommended plans to develop a reusable [[Space Transportation System]] including a [[Space Shuttle]], which would facilitate development of permanent [[space station]]s in Earth and lunar orbit, perhaps a base on the lunar surface, and the first human flight to Mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000.<ref>Hepplewhite, pp. 136-150</ref> Nixon had a better sense of the declining political support in Congress for a new Apollo-style program, which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing, and he intended to pursue detente with the USSR and China, which he hoped might ease Cold War tensions. He cut the spending proposal he sent to Congress to include funding for only the Space Shuttle, with perhaps an option to pursue the Earth orbital space station for the foreseeable future.<ref>Hepplewhite, pp. 150-177</ref>\n\nThe USSR continued trying to perfect their N1 rocket, finally canceling it in 1976, after two more launch failures in 1971 and 1972.<ref>Portree, 1.2.4 Manned Lunar Program (1964-1976)</ref>\n\n===Salyuts and Skylab===\n[[File:The Soviet Union 1971 CPA 4060 stamp (Cosmonauts Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsayev).jpg|thumb|right|The Soyuz 11 crew with the Salyut station in the background, in a Soviet commemorative stamp]]\nHaving lost the race to the Moon, the USSR decided to concentrate on orbital space stations. During 1969 and 1970, they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3, then launched the first [[space station]], the [[Salyut 1]] laboratory designed by [[Kerim Kerimov]], on April 19, 1971. <!-- The dimensions, habitable volume and mass of the Salyuts don't seem to be readily available, but should go here.--> Three days later, the [[Soyuz 10]] crew attempted to dock with it, but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station. The [[Soyuz 11]] crew of [[Vladislav Volkov]], [[Georgi Dobrovolski]] and [[Viktor Patsayev]] successfully docked on June 7, and completed a record 22-day stay. The crew became the second in-flight space fatality during their reentry on June 30. They were [[asphyxiated]] when their spacecraft's cabin lost all pressure, shortly after undocking. The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve, that allowed all the air to vent into space. The crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nSalyut 1's orbit was increased to prevent premature reentry, but further piloted flights were delayed while the Soyuz was redesigned to fix the new safety problem. The station re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on October 11, after 175 days in orbit. The USSR attempted to launch a second Salyut-class station designated Durable Orbital Station-2 (DOS-2) on July 29, 1972, but a rocket failure caused it to fail to achieve orbit. After the DOS-2 failure, the USSR attempted to launch four more Salyut-class stations up to 1975, with another failure due to an explosion of the final rocket stage, which punctured the station with shrapnel so that it would not hold pressure. All of the Salyuts were presented to the public as non-military scientific laboratories, but some of them were covers for the military [[Almaz]] reconnaissance stations.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe United States launched the orbital workstation [[Skylab]] 1 on May 14, 1973.

Skylab was damaged during the ascent to orbit, losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield. Subsequent crewed missions repaired the station, and the final mission's crew, [[Skylab 4]], set a human endurance record with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on February 8, 1974.

To prepare, the US designed a docking module for the Apollo that was compatible with the Soviet docking system, which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other (e.g. Soyuz/Soyuz as well as Soyuz/Salyut). The module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each other's craft, which had incompatible cabin atmospheres.

It had its origins in the [[ballistic missile]]-based [[nuclear arms race]] between the two nations following [[World War&nbsp;II]]. The technological advantage required to rapidly achieve spaceflight milestones was seen as necessary for [[national security]], and mixed with the symbolism and ideology of the time. The Space Race led to pioneering efforts to launch [[artificial satellite]]s, uncrewed [[space probe]]s of the [[Moon]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]], and [[human spaceflight]] in [[low Earth orbit]] and to the Moon.<ref>[https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race history.com, Space Race]</ref>\n\nThe competition began in earnest on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the [[International Geophysical Year]], by declaring they would also launch a satellite \"in the near future\". The Soviet Union achieved the first successful launch with the October 4, 1957, orbiting of ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', and sent the first human to space with the orbital flight of [[Yuri Gagarin]] on April 12, 1961. The USSR also sent the first woman, [[Valentina Tereshkova]], to space on June 16, 1963, with numerous other firsts taking place over the next few years with regards to flight duration, spacewalks and related activities. According to Russian sources, these achievements led to the conclusion that the USSR had an advantage in space technology in the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.history.com/news/from-sputnik-to-spacewalking-7-soviet-space-firsts history.com, From Sputnik to Spacewalking: 7 Soviet Space Firsts, Oct 4, 2012]</ref>\n\nAccording to US sources, the \"race\" peaked with the July 20, 1969, US landing of the first humans on the Moon with [[Apollo 11]]. Most US sources will point to the Apollo 11 lunar landing as a singular achievement far outweighing any combination of Soviet achievements. The USSR attempted several [[Soviet crewed lunar programs|crewed lunar missions]], but eventually canceled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations, while the US landed several more times on the Moon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059A|title=Apollo 11 Command and Service Module (CSM)|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1969-059C|title=Apollo 11 Lunar Module / EASEP|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 20, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"orbit\">{{cite web |url=https://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/topics/apollo/apollo-program/landing-missions/apollo11.cfm |title=Apollo 11 Mission Summary |website=Smithsonian Air and Space Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/lunar_sites.html |title=Apollo Landing Site Coordinates |publisher=NASA|work=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive |first=David R. |last=Williams |date=December 11, 2003 |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA period of [[d\u00e9tente]] followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative [[Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project]] (ASTP), resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew and co-developing the enabling docking standard [[APAS-75]].

The mission was planned to be a three-day test, to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted [[Soyuz 2]], but the mission was plagued with problems. Early on, Komarov's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two [[solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] had deployed. Then the automatic [[attitude control system]] began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely, resulting in the craft spinning wildly. Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system, which was only partially effective. The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day. During the emergency re-entry, a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail, and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute, causing descent speed to reach as high as 40&nbsp;m/s (140&nbsp;km/h; 89&nbsp;mph). Shortly thereafter, [[Soyuz 1]] impacted the ground 3&nbsp;km (1.9&nbsp;mi) west of Karabutak, exploding into a ball of flames. The official autopsy states Komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact, and that the subsequent heat mutilation of his corpse was a result of the explosive impact. Fixing the spacecraft's faults caused an eighteen-month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Onward to the Moon==\nThe United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire, fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Major differences between Block I and Block II|Block II command module]].

NASA had achieved its first landing goal with enough Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launchers left for eight follow-on lunar landings through Apollo 20, conducting extended-endurance missions and transporting the landing crews in [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s on the last five. They also planned an [[Apollo Applications Program]] to develop a longer-duration Earth orbital workshop (later named [[Skylab]]) to be constructed in orbit from a spent [[S-IVB]] upper stage, using several launches of the smaller [[Saturn IB]] launch vehicle. But planners soon decided this could be done more efficiently by using the two live stages of a Saturn V to launch the workshop pre-fabricated from an S-IVB (which was also the Saturn V third stage), which immediately removed Apollo 20. Budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well, but keep three extended/Lunar Rover missions. [[Apollo 13]] encountered an in-flight spacecraft failure and had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970, returning its crew safely but temporarily grounding the program again. It resumed with four successful landings on [[Apollo 14]] (February 1971), [[Apollo 15]] (July 1971), [[Apollo 16]] (April 1972), and [[Apollo 17]] (December 1972).{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nIn February 1969, President [[Richard M.

Agnew]].<ref>Hepplewhite, p. 123</ref> Agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of NASA's follow-on plans, and the STG recommended plans to develop a reusable [[Space Transportation System]] including a [[Space Shuttle]], which would facilitate development of permanent [[space station]]s in Earth and lunar orbit, perhaps a base on the lunar surface, and the first human flight to Mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000.<ref>Hepplewhite, pp. 136-150</ref> Nixon had a better sense of the declining political support in Congress for a new Apollo-style program, which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing, and he intended to pursue detente with the USSR and China, which he hoped might ease Cold War tensions.

During 1969 and 1970, they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3, then launched the first [[space station]], the [[Salyut 1]] laboratory designed by [[Kerim Kerimov]], on April 19, 1971. <!-- The dimensions, habitable volume and mass of the Salyuts don't seem to be readily available, but should go here.--> Three days later, the [[Soyuz 10]] crew attempted to dock with it, but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station.

The crew became the second in-flight space fatality during their reentry on June 30. They were [[asphyxiated]] when their spacecraft's cabin lost all pressure, shortly after undocking. The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve, that allowed all the air to vent into space. The crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nSalyut 1's orbit was increased to prevent premature reentry, but further piloted flights were delayed while the Soyuz was redesigned to fix the new safety problem. The station re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on October 11, after 175 days in orbit. The USSR attempted to launch a second Salyut-class station designated Durable Orbital Station-2 (DOS-2) on July 29, 1972, but a rocket failure caused it to fail to achieve orbit. After the DOS-2 failure, the USSR attempted to launch four more Salyut-class stations up to 1975, with another failure due to an explosion of the final rocket stage, which punctured the station with shrapnel so that it would not hold pressure. All of the Salyuts were presented to the public as non-military scientific laboratories, but some of them were covers for the military [[Almaz]] reconnaissance stations.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe United States launched the orbital workstation [[Skylab]] 1 on May 14, 1973.

Subsequent crewed missions repaired the station, and the final mission's crew, [[Skylab 4]], set a human endurance record with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on February 8, 1974.

{"title_page": "Video game console", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Video games}}\nA '''video game console''' is a [[computer]] device that outputs a [[video signal]] or visual [[image]] to display a [[video game]] that one or more people can play.\n\nThe term \"video game console\" is primarily used to distinguish a console machine primarily designed for consumers to use for playing video games, in contrast to [[arcade cabinet|arcade machines]] or [[home computer]]s. An arcade machine consists of a video game computer, display, [[game controller]] (joystick, buttons, etc.) and [[loudspeaker|speakers]] housed in large or small chassis. A [[home computer]] is a personal computer designed for home use for a variety of purposes, such as bookkeeping, accessing the Internet and playing video games.  While arcades and computers are generally expensive or highly \"technical\"  devices, video game consoles were designed with affordability and [[accessibility]] to the [[general public]] in mind.\n\nUnlike similar consumer electronics such as music players and movie players, which use industry-wide standard formats, video game consoles use [[proprietary format]]s which compete with each other for market share.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=The Big Fight|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=24 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1996|pages=38\u201341}}</ref> There are various types of video game consoles, including [[home video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, [[microconsole]]s and [[dedicated console]]s. Although [[Ralph Baer]] had built working game consoles by 1966, it was nearly a decade before the ''[[Pong]]'' game made them commonplace in regular people's living rooms. Through evolution over the 1990s and 2000s, game consoles have expanded to offer additional functions such as [[CD player]]s, [[DVD player]]s, [[Blu-ray]] disc players, [[web browser]]s, [[set-top box]]es and more.\n== Types ==\nVideo game consoles can come in several varieties.\n* [[Home video game console]]s are devices that are generally meant to be hooked up to a television or other type of monitor, and with power supplied through an outlet, thus requiring the unit to be used in fixed locations. Early examples include the [[Atari 2600]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Sega Genesis]], while newer examples include the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n* [[Handheld video game console]]s are devices that typically include a built-in screen and a battery so that the unit can be carried around and be played anywhere. Examples of such include the , [[Game Boy]], the [[PlayStation Vita]], the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]].\n* Hybrid video game consoles have elements of both home and handheld systems.

[[Ralph H. Baer]] conceived the idea of a home video game in 1951. In the late 1960s, while working for [[Sanders Associates]], Baer created a series of video game console designs. One of these designs, which gained the nickname of the 1966 \"Brown Box\", featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufacturers, ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Ralph H.|date=2005|title=Videogames: In The Beginning|pages=52\u201359|publisher=Rolenta Press|isbn=978-0-9643848-1-1}}</ref> In 1972, [[Magnavox]] released the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set.  Ralph Baer's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console (the Odyssey lacked a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]) to create slightly different games like tennis, volleyball, hockey, and chase. Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] for each game.  Although Baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games, the cartridges released by Magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed players to choose from the Odyssey's built-in games.\n\nThe Odyssey initially sold about 100,000 units,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphbaer.com/how_video_games.htm|title=How Video Games Invaded the Home TV Set|publisher=Ralph H. Baer Consultants|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}</ref> making it moderately successful, and it was not until [[Atari]]'s [[arcade game]] ''[[Pong]]'' popularized video games that the public began to take more notice of the emerging industry. By autumn 1975, Magnavox, bowing to the popularity of ''Pong'', canceled the Odyssey and released a scaled-down version that played only ''Pong'' and hockey, the [[Magnavox Odyssey 100#Odyssey 100|Odyssey 100]]. A second, \"higher end\" console, the [[Odyssey 200]], was released with the 100 and added on-screen scoring, up to four players, and a third game\u2014''Smash''. Almost simultaneously released with Atari's own home Pong console through [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], these consoles jump-started the consumer market. All three of the new consoles used simpler designs than the original Odyssey did with no board game pieces or extra cartridges. In the years that followed, the market saw many companies rushing similar consoles to market. After [[General Instrument]] released their inexpensive microchips, each containing a complete console on a single chip, many small developers began releasing consoles that looked different externally, but internally were playing exactly the same games. Most of the consoles from this era were [[dedicated consoles]] playing only the games that came with the console. These video game consoles were often just called video games because there was little reason to distinguish the two yet. While a few companies like [[Atari]], Magnavox, and newcomer [[Coleco]] pushed the envelope, the market became flooded with simple, similar video games.\n\n=== Second generation ===\n{{main|Second generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atari 2600]] became the most popular game console of the second generation.]]\nFairchild released the [[Fairchild Channel F|Fairchild Video Entertainment System]] (VES) in 1976. While there had been previous game consoles that used cartridges, either the cartridges had no information and served the same function as flipping switches (the Odyssey) or the console itself was empty ([[Coleco Telstar]]) and the cartridge contained all of the game components. The VES, however, contained a programmable microprocessor so its cartridges only needed a single ROM chip to store microprocessor instructions. RCA and Atari soon released their own cartridge-based consoles, the [[RCA Studio II]] and the [[Atari 2600]] (originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System), respectively.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Fairchild Channel F]]\n|1977\n|1976\n|''none''\n|250,000\n|-\n![[Atari 2600]]\n|1983\n|1977\n|1978\n|30,000,000\n|-\n![[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]]\n|1982\n|1979\n|1978\n|2,000,000\n|-\n![[Intellivision]]\n|1982\n|1980\n|1982\n|3,000,000\n|-\n![[ColecoVision]]\n|''none''\n|1982\n|1983\n|2,000,000\n|-\n![[Atari 5200]]\n|''none''\n|1982\n|''none''\n|1,000,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nThe first [[handheld game console]] with interchangeable cartridges was the [[Microvision]] designed by Smith Engineering, and distributed and sold by [[Milton-Bradley]] in 1979. Crippled by a small, fragile LCD display and a very narrow selection of games, it was discontinued two years later. The [[Epoch Game Pocket Computer]] was released in Japan in 1984. The Game Pocket Computer featured an LCD screen with 75 X 64 resolution and could produce graphics at about the same level as early Atari 2600 games. The system sold very poorly, and as a result, only five games were made for it. Nintendo's [[Game & Watch]] series of dedicated game systems proved more successful. It helped to establish handheld video games as popular and lasted until 1991. Many Game & Watch games were later re-released on Nintendo's subsequent handheld systems.\n\n==== Rebirth of the home console market ====\nThe VES continued to be sold at a profit after 1977, and both Bally (with their [[Bally Astrocade|Home Library Computer]] in 1977) and Magnavox (with the [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2|Odyssey\u00b2]] in 1978) brought their own programmable cartridge-based consoles to the market. However, it was not until Atari released a conversion of the [[Golden age of arcade video games|golden age arcade]] hit ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1980 for the [[Atari 2600]] that the home console industry took off. Many consumers bought an Atari console so they could play ''Space Invaders'' at home. The unprecedented success of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' started the trend of console manufacturers trying to get exclusive rights to arcade titles, and the trend of advertisements for game consoles claiming to bring the arcade experience home. Throughout the early 1980s, other companies released video game consoles of their own. Many of the video game systems (e.g. [[ColecoVision]]) were technically superior to the Atari 2600, and marketed as improvements over the Atari 2600. However, Atari dominated the console market in the early 1980s.\n\n==== North American video game crash of 1983 ====\n{{main|North American video game crash of 1983}}\nIn 1983, the video game business suffered a much more severe crash. A flood of low-quality video games by smaller companies (especially for the 2600), industry leader Atari hyping games such as [[E.T. (Atari 2600)|E.T]] and a 2600 version of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' that were poorly received, and a growing number of [[home computer]] users caused consumers and retailers to lose faith in video game consoles. Most video game companies filed for bankruptcy, or moved into other industries, abandoning their game consoles. A group of employees from [[Mattel Electronics]] formed the INTV Corporation and bought the rights for the [[Intellivision]]. INTV alone continued to manufacture the Intellivision in small quantities and release new Intellivision games until 1991.  All other North American game consoles were discontinued by 1984. Revenues generated by the video game industry fell by 97% during the crash.\n\n=== Third generation ===\n{{main|Third generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:NES-Console-Set.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] made home console video games popular again in America after the 1983 crash]]\nIn 1983, [[Nintendo]] released the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (or Famicom) in Japan. The Famicom supported high-resolution sprites, larger color palettes, and tiled backgrounds, which allowed Famicom games to have more detailed graphics than games of prior consoles. Nintendo began attempts to bring their Famicom to the U.S. after the video game market had crashed. In the U.S., video games were seen as a fad that had already passed. To distinguish its product from older game consoles, Nintendo released their Famicom as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) which used a front-loading cartridge port similar to a VCR, included a plastic \"[[robot]]\" ([[R.O.B.]]), and was initially advertised as a toy. The NES was the highest selling console in the history of North America and revitalized the video game market.  Mario of [[Super Mario Bros.]] became a global icon starting with his NES games.  Nintendo took a somewhat unusual stance with third-party developers for its console.  Nintendo contractually restricted third-party developers to three NES titles per year and forbade them from developing for other video game consoles.  The practice ensured Nintendo's market dominance and prevented the flood of trash titles that had helped kill the Atari, but was ruled illegal late in the console's lifecycle.<ref name=opinion>\n{{cite court\n|litigants=Atari Games Corp. v.

It fared notably better in [[PAL]] territories.  In Europe and South America, the Master System competed with the NES and saw new game releases even after Sega's next-generation Mega Drive was released.  In Brazil where strict importation laws and rampant piracy kept out competitors, the Master System outsold the NES by a massive margin and remained popular into the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Master System Console in Brazil |date=April 29, 2013 |url=http://segaretro.org/Master_System_consoles_in_Brazil |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313025252/http://segaretro.org/Master_System_consoles_in_Brazil |archivedate=March 13, 2013 }}</ref> Jack Tramiel, after buying Atari, downsizing its staff, and settling its legal disputes, attempted to bring Atari back into the home console market.  Atari released a smaller, sleeker, cheaper version of their popular Atari 2600.  They also released the Atari 7800, a console technologically comparable with the NES and backward compatible with the 2600.  Finally, Atari repackaged its 8-bit XE home computer as the XEGS game console.  The new consoles helped Atari claw its way out of debt, but failed to gain much market share from Nintendo.  Atari's lack of funds meant that its consoles saw fewer releases, lower production values (both the manuals and the game labels were frequently black and white), and limited distribution. Additionally, two popular 8-bit computers, the Commodore 64 and [[Amstrad CPC]], were repackaged as the [[Commodore 64 Games System]] and [[Amstrad GX4000]] respectively, for entry into the console market.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]]\n|1983\n|1985\n|1986\n|61,910,000\n|-\n![[Master System|Mark III/Master System]]\n|1985\n|1986\n|1987\n|13,000,000\n|-\n![[Atari 7800]]\n|''none''\n|1986\n|1987\n|3,770,000\n|-\n![[Atari XEGS]]\n|''none''\n|1987\n|1987\n|100,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nIn the latter part of the third generation, Nintendo introduced the [[Game Boy]] and Atari released the [[Atari Lynx]] portable game consoles, pioneering and solidifying the handheld video game industry.\n\n=== Fourth generation ===\n{{main|Fourth generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|thumb|Nintendo Super Famicom]]\n[[NEC]] brought the first fourth-generation console to market with their [[PC Engine]] (or TurboGrafx16) when [[Hudson Soft]] approached them with an advanced graphics chip. Hudson had previously approached Nintendo, only to be rebuffed by a company still raking in the profits of the NES.  The TurboGrafx used the unusual [[HuCard]] format to store games. The small size of these proprietary cards allowed NEC to [[Turbo Express|re-release the console]] as a [[handheld game console]]. The PC Engine enjoyed brisk sales in Japan, but its North American counterpart, the TurboGrafx, lagged behind the competition. The console never saw an official release in Europe, but clones and North American imports were available in some markets starting in 1990. NEC advertised their console as \"16-bit\" to highlight its advances over the NES. This started the trend of all subsequent fourth generations consoles being advertised as 16 bit.  Many people still refer to this generation as the 16-bit generation and often refer to the third generation as \"8-bit\".\n\nSega scaled down and adapted their [[Sega System 16]] (used to power arcade hits like [[Altered Beast]] and Shinobi) into the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] (sold as the Genesis in North America) and released it with a near arcade-perfect port of Altered Beast. Sega's console met lukewarm sales in Japan, but skyrocketed to first place in PAL markets, and made major inroads in North America. Propelled by its effective \"Genesis does what Nintendon't\" marketing campaign, Sega capitalized on the Genesis's technological superiority over the NES, faithful ports of popular arcade games, and competitive pricing. The arcade gaming company [[SNK]] developed the high end [[Neo Geo MVS]] arcade system which used interchangeable cartridges similar to home consoles. Building on the success of the MVS, SNK repackaged the [[NeoGeo]] as the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo AES]] home console.  Though technologically superior to the other fourth-generation consoles, the AES and its games were prohibitively expensive, which kept sales low and prevented it from expanding outside its niche market and into serious competition with Nintendo and Sega. The AES did, however, amass a dedicated cult following, allowing it to see new releases into the 2000s. Fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles to reproduce the [[pixel art|art styles]] that were becoming popular in arcades and on home computers. These games often featured lavish background scenery, huge characters, broader color palettes, and increased emphasis on dithering and texture.  Games written specifically for the NES, like ''Megaman'', ''[[Shatterhand]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' were able to work cleverly within its limitations. Ports of the increasingly detailed arcade and home computer games came up with various solutions. For example, when Capcom released ''[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]'' in the arcade they created an entirely separate Strider game for the NES that only incorporated themes and characters from the arcade.\n\nIn 1990, Nintendo finally brought their [[Super Famicom]] to market and brought it to the United States as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (SNES) a year later. Its release marginalized the TurboGrafx and the Neo Geo, but came late enough for Sega to sell several million consoles in North America and gain a strong foothold. The same year the SNES was released Sega released ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', which spiked Genesis sales, similar to Space Invaders on the Atari. Also, by 1992 the first fully licensed NFL Football game was released: ''[[NFL Sports Talk Football '93]]'', which was available only on the Genesis.  This impact on Genesis sales and the overall interest of realistic sports games would start the trend of licensed sports games being viewed as necessary for the success of a console in the US. While Nintendo enjoyed dominance in Japan and Sega in Europe, the competition between the two was particularly fierce and close in North America. Ultimately, the SNES outsold the Genesis, but only after Sega discontinued the Genesis to focus on the next generation of consoles.\n\nOne trait that remains peculiar to the fourth generation is the huge number of exclusive games. Both Sega and Nintendo were very successful and their consoles developed massive libraries of games. Both consoles had to be programmed in assembly to get the most out of them. A game optimized for the Genesis could take advantage of its faster CPU and sound chip.  A game optimized for the SNES could take advantage of its graphics and its flexible, clean sound chip. Some game series, like [[Castlevania]], saw separate system exclusive releases rather than an attempt to port one game to disparate platforms. When compact disc (CD) technology became available midway through the fourth generation, each company attempted to integrate it into their existing consoles in different ways.  NEC and Sega released CD add-ons to their consoles in the form of the [[TurboGrafx-16|TurboGrafx-CD]] and [[Sega CD]], but both were only moderately successful. NEC also released the [[TurboDuo]] which combined the TurboGrafx-16 and its TurboGrafx-CD add-on (along with the RAM and BIOS upgrade from the Super System Card) into one unit.  SNK released a third version of the NeoGeo, the [[Neo Geo CD]], allowing the company to release its games on a cheaper medium than the AES's expensive cartridges, but it reached the market after Nintendo and Sega had already sold tens of millions of consoles each.  Nintendo partnered with [[Sony]] to work on a CD add-on for the SNES, but the deal fell apart when they realized how much control Sony wanted. Sony would use their work with Nintendo as the basis for their [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game console. While CDs became an increasingly visible part of the market, CD-reading technology was still expensive in the 1990s, limiting NEC's and Sega's add-ons' sales.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]]\n|1987\n|1989\n|1989\n|5,800,000\n|-\n![[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]]\n|1988\n|1989\n|1990\n|30,750,000\n|-\n![[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|1994\n|980,000\n|-\n![[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom/Super NES]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|1992\n|49,100,000\n|-\n![[Sega CD|Sega CD/Mega-CD]]\n|1991\n|1992\n|1993\n|2,240,000\n|-\n![[Neo Geo CD]]\n|1994\n|1996\n|1994\n|570,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nThe first [[handheld game console]] released in the fourth generation was the [[Game Boy]], on April 21, 1989. It went on to dominate handheld sales by an extremely large margin, despite featuring a low-contrast, unlit monochrome screen while all three of its leading competitors had color. Three major franchises made their debut on the Game Boy: ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]'', the Game Boy's [[killer application]]; [[Pok\u00e9mon]]; and [[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]. With some design (Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light) and hardware (Game Boy Color) changes, it continued in production in some form until 2008, enjoying a better than 18-year run. The [[Atari Lynx]] included hardware-accelerated color graphics, a backlight, and the ability to link up to sixteen units together in an early example of network play when its competitors could only link 2 or 4 consoles (or none at all),<ref name=\"The Atari Lynx\">{{cite web|url= http://www.ataritimes.com/lynx/index.html|title=The Atari Lynx|accessdate=August 20, 2006|publisher=ataritimes.com|year=2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810182044/http://www.ataritimes.com/lynx/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 10, 2006}}</ref> but its comparatively short battery life (approximately 4.5 hours on a set of alkaline cells, versus 35 hours for the Game Boy), high price, and weak games library made it one of the worst-selling handheld game systems of all time, with less than 500,000 units sold.<ref>{{cite web |last=Beuscher |first=Dave |title=allgame ( Atari Lynx > Overview ) |publisher=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=5:13 |quote=One drawback to the Lynx system is its power consumption.

It featured graphics capabilities roughly comparable to the [[Master System]] (better colours, but lower resolution), a ready made games library by using the \"Master-Gear\" adapter to play cartridges from the older console, and the opportunity to be converted into a portable TV using a cheap tuner adaptor, but it also suffered some of the same shortcomings as the Lynx. While it sold more than twenty times as many units as the Lynx, its bulky design - slightly larger than even the original Game Boy; relatively poor battery life - only a little better than the Lynx; and later arrival in the marketplace - competing for sales amongst the remaining buyers who didn't already have a Game Boy - hampered its overall popularity despite being more closely competitive to the Nintendo in terms of price and breadth of software library.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bauscher |first=Dave |title=allgame ( Sega Game Gear > Overview ) |publisher=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=5:25 |quote=While this feature is not included on the Game Boy it does provide a disadvantage -- the Game Gear requires 6 AA batteries that only last up to six hours.

Other handheld consoles released during the fourth generation included the [[TurboExpress]], a handheld version of the TurboGrafx-16 released by NEC in 1990, and the [[Game Boy Pocket]], an improved model of the Game Boy released about two years before the debut of the [[Game Boy Color]]. While the TurboExpress was another early pioneer of color handheld video game technology and had the added benefit of using the same game cartridges or 'HuCards' as the TurboGrafx16, it had even worse battery life than the Lynx and Game Gear - about three hours on six contemporary AA batteries - selling only 1.5 million units.<ref name=\"handheld sales\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Game Boy]]\n|1989\n|1989\n|1990\n|118,690,000\n|-\n![[Atari Lynx]]\n|1990\n|1989\n|1990\n|3,000,000\n|-\n![[Game Gear]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|1991\n|10,620,000\n|-\n![[TurboExpress]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|''none''\n|1,500,000\n|}\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n{{main|Fifth generation of video game consoles}}\nDuring this time home computers gained greater prominence as a way of playing video games. The video game console industry nonetheless continued to thrive alongside home computers, due to the advantages of much lower prices, easier portability, circuitry specifically dedicated towards video games, the ability to be played on a television set (which PCs of the time could not do in most cases), and intensive first party software support from manufacturers who were essentially banking their entire future on their consoles.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=PCs Versus Consoles |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1996|page=1}}</ref>\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:PSX-Console-wController.jpg|thumb|The Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular system of the fifth generation consoles, eventually selling over 100 million systems]]\nThe first fifth-generation consoles were the [[Amiga CD32]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] and the [[Atari Jaguar]]. Although all three consoles were more powerful than the fourth generation systems, none of them would become serious threats to [[Sega]] or [[Nintendo]]. The 3DO initially generated a great deal of hype in part because of a licensing scheme where 3DO licensed the manufacturing of its console out to third parties, similar to VCR or DVD players. However, unlike its competitors who could sell their consoles at a loss, all 3DO manufacturers had to sell for profit. The Jaguar had three processors and no C libraries to help developers cope with it. Atari was ineffective at courting third parties and many of their first party games were poorly received. Many of the Jaguar's games used mainly the slowest (but most familiar) of the console's processors, resulting in titles that could easily have been released on the SNES or Genesis.\n\nTo compete with emerging next gen consoles, Nintendo released ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' which could display a wide range of tones (something common in fifth-generation games) by limiting the number of hues onscreen, and ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]'' which used an extra chip inside of the cartridge to display polygon graphics. Sega followed suit, releasing ''[[Vectorman]]'' and ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' (the latter of which used the Sega Virtua Processor). Sega also released the [[32X]], an add-on for the Genesis, while their [[Sega Saturn]] was still in development. Despite public statements from Sega claiming that they would continue to support the Genesis/32X throughout the next generation, Sega Enterprises forced Sega of America to abandon the 32X. The 32X's brief and confusing existence damaged public perception of the coming Saturn and Sega as a whole.\n\nWhile the fourth generation had seen NEC's [[TurboGrafx-CD]] and Sega's [[Sega CD]] add-ons, it was not until the fifth generation that CD-based consoles and games began to seriously compete with cartridges. CD-ROMs were significantly cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were, and gave developers room to add cinematic cut-scenes, pre-recorded soundtracks, and voice acting that made more serious storytelling possible. [[NEC]] had been developing a successor to the [[TurboGrafx-16]] as early as 1990, and presented a prototype, dubbed the \"Iron Man,\" to developers in 1992, but shelved the project as the CD-ROM\u00b2 System managed to extend the console's market viability in Japan into the mid-90s. When sales started to dry up, NEC rushed its old project to the market. The [[PC-FX]], a CD-based, 32-bit console, had highly advanced, detailed 2D graphics capabilities, and better full-motion video than any other system on the market. It was, however, incapable of handling 3D graphics, forfeiting its chances at seriously competing with Sony and Sega. The console was limited to a niche market of dating sims and visual novels in Japan, and never saw release in Western markets.\n\nAfter the abortive 32X, Sega entered the fifth generation with the Saturn. Sega released several highly regarded titles for the Saturn, but a series of bad decisions alienated many developers and retailers. While the Saturn was technologically advanced, it was also complex, difficult, and unintuitive to write games for. In particular, programming 3D graphics that could compete with those on Nintendo and Sony's consoles proved exceptionally difficult for third-party developers. Because the Saturn used quadrilaterals, rather than triangles, as its basic polygon, cross platform games had to be completely rewritten to see a Saturn port. The Saturn was also a victim of internal politics at Sega. While the Saturn sold comparably well in Japan, Sega's branches in North America and Europe refused to license localizations of many popular Japanese titles, holding they were ill-suited to Western markets. First-party hits like [[Sakura Taisen]] never saw Western releases, while several third-party titles released on both [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and Saturn in Japan, like ''[[Grandia (video game)|Grandia]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', were released in North America and Europe as PlayStation exclusives.\n\nBorn from a failed attempt to create a console with Nintendo, Sony's PlayStation would not only dominate its generation but become the first console to sell over 100 million units by expanding the video game market. Sony actively courted third parties and provided them with convenient c libraries to write their games. Sony had built the console from the start as a 3D, disc-based system, and emphasized its 3D graphics that would come to be viewed as the future of video games. The PlayStation's CD technology won over several developers who had been releasing titles for Nintendo and Sega's fourth generation consoles, such as [[Konami]], [[Namco]], [[Capcom]], and [[Square (video game company)|Square]]. CDs were far cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were, meaning developers could release larger batches of games at higher profit margins; Nintendo's console, on the other hand, used cartridges, unwittingly keeping third-party developers away. The PlayStation's internal architecture was simpler and more intuitive to program for, giving the console an edge over Sega's Saturn.\n\nNintendo was the last to release a fifth generation console with their [[Nintendo 64]], and when they finally released their console in North America, it came with only two [[launch titles]]. Partly to curb piracy and partly as a result of Nintendo's failed disc projects with [[Sony]] (as [[Super NES CD-ROM|SNES-CD]]) and [[Philips]], Nintendo used cartridges for their console. The higher cost of cartridges drove many third party developers to the PlayStation. The Nintendo 64 could handle 3D polygons better than any console released before it, but its games often lacked the cut-scenes, soundtracks, and voice-overs that became standard on PlayStation discs. Nintendo released several highly acclaimed titles, such as [[Super Mario 64]], [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]. The Nintendo 64 was able to sell tens of millions of units on the strength of first-party titles alone, but its constant struggles against Sony would make the Nintendo 64 the last home console to use cartridges as a medium for game distribution until the Nintendo Switch in 2017.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[FM Towns Marty]]\n|1993\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|45,000\n|-\n![[Amiga CD32]]\n|''none''\n|1994\n|1993\n|100,000\n|-\n![[Atari Jaguar]]\n|1994\n|1993\n|1994\n|250,000\n|-\n![[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]]\n|1994\n|1993\n|1994\n|2,000,000\n|-\n![[PC-FX]]\n|1994\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|400,000\n|-\n![[32X|Sega 32X]]\n|1994\n|1994\n|1995\n|665,000\n|-\n![[Virtual Boy]]\n|1995\n|1995\n|''none''\n|770,000\n|-\n!

It was the final handheld to have 8-bit graphics.\n\nDespite Nintendo's domination of handheld console market, some competing consoles such as [[Neo Geo Pocket]], [[WonderSwan]], [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]], [[WonderSwan Color]] appeared in late 90s and discontinued several years later after their appearance in handheld console market.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Virtual Boy]]\n|1995\n|1995\n|''none''\n|770,000\n|-\n|-\n![[Genesis Nomad]]\n|''none''\n|1995\n|''none''\n|-\n|-\n![[Game Boy Pocket]]\n|1996\n|1996\n|1996<\n|-\n|-\n![[Game.com]]\n|''none''\n|1997\n|1997\n|>300,000\n|-\n![[Game Boy Light]]\n|1998\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|-\n|-\n![[Game Boy Color]]\n|1998\n|1998\n|1998\n|-\n![[Neo Geo Pocket]]\n|1998\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|-\n![[WonderSwan]]\n|1999\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|1,550,000\n|-\n![[Neo Geo Pocket Color]]\n|1999\n|1999\n|1999\n|-\n![[WonderSwan Color]]\n|2000\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|1,100,000\n|-\n|}\n\n<!-- <gallery class=\"center\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Sega-Nomad-Front.jpg|[[Sega Nomad]] <br />Released in 1995<ref name=\"RetroNomad\">{{cite magazine|author=''[[Retro Gamer]]'' staff|title=Retroinspection: Sega Nomad|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|issue=69|pages=46\u201353}}</ref>\nFile:Game-Boy-Pocket-FL.jpg|[[Game Boy#Game Boy Pocket|Game Boy Pocket]]<br />Released in 1996\nFile:Tiger-Game-Com-FL.jpg|[[Game.com]] <br />Released in September 1997<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecom/3045-77/|title=Game.Com (Platform) - Giant Bomb|website=www.giantbomb.com|access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\nFile:Game-Boy-Light-FL.jpg|[[Game Boy#Game Boy Light|Game Boy Light]]<br />Released in April 1998\nFile:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg|[[Game Boy Color]] <br /> Released in November 1998<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo Adds Color to Its \"Rainbow\" of Products With New Game Boy Color Titles |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Oct_12/ai_53077910/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714234241/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Oct_12/ai_53077910/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |publisher=''[[Business Wire]]'' |date=October 12, 1998 |accessdate=May 7, 2011 }}</ref>\nFile:Neo-Geo-Pocket-Anthra-Left.jpg|[[Neo Geo Pocket]]<br /> Released in 1998{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n</gallery> -->\n\n=== Sixth generation ===\n{{main|Sixth generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:PS2-Fat-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:PS2-Fat-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|upright|With more than 155 million units sold, the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] is the best selling video game console in history]]\n[[File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast was the last system released by Sega, who became a third-party software publisher.]]\nThe sixth generation witnessed a greater shift towards using DVDs for video game media.

The system launched in North America with 18 titles, including the much-anticipated [[Sonic Adventure]]. A large part of marketing their system to North America was taking advantage of the turn of the century and the tendency to end a products price tag with the number 9. They created the slogan \"9/9/99 for $199\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Dreamcast Launch Plans Unveiled - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/04/20/dreamcast-launch-plans-unveiled|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> This angle proved to be effective. Despite Japan having a year head start on North America, by the end of 1999 the Dreamcast had sold 2 million units in North America compared to only 1 million in Japan.

Sony announced their own upcoming system, the [[PlayStation 2]], in the fall of 1999; while they had few details on their system, many consumers held off on buying a console until Sony's own system launched. The PS2 released a year later and received critical acclaim. It quickly outsold the Dreamcast, going on to become the best-selling video game console of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/12/top-10-best-selling-videogame-consoles-551938|title=Top 10 best-selling videogame consoles|date=2018-12-21|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> while the Dreamcast's own sales stagnated.\n:Sega implemented a special type of optical media called the [[GD-ROM]]. These discs were created in order to prevent [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]], which had been more easily done with consoles of the previous generation; however, this format was soon cracked as well. It also sported a 33.6Kb or 56k modem which could be used to access the Internet or play some games that took advantage of this feature, such as ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', making it the first console with built-in Internet connectivity. An add-on for an Ethernet port allowed one to access broad band Internet though it did not come with the system. Despite these innovations, the competition was too successful. The Dreamcast was Sega's last video game console, and was discontinued in March, 2001. Sega transitioned to software developing/publishing only\n\n* [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]] was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, in North America on October 26, 2000, in Europe on November 24, 2000, and in Australia on November 30, 2000. It was the follow-up to its highly successful PlayStation and was also the first home game console to be able to play DVDs. As was done with the original PlayStation in 2000, Sony redesigned the console in 2004 into a smaller version. As of November 21, 2011 over 140 million PlayStation 2 units have been sold.<ref name=\"ps2shipped\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/hirai-targets-150-million-ps3-sales|title=Hirai targets 150 million PS3 sales|accessdate=July 21, 2008|date=July 21, 2008|publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/hirai-wants-ps3-to-beat-ps2|title=Hirai wants PS3 to beat PS2|accessdate=July 21, 2008|date=July 21, 2008|website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> This makes it the best selling home console of all time to date.\n* [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]] was released in Japan on September 15, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002. It was Nintendo's fourth home video game console and the first console by the company to use optical media instead of cartridges. The GameCube did not play standard 12&nbsp;cm DVDs, instead it employed smaller 8&nbsp;cm optical discs. With the release of the GameCube [[Game Boy Player]], all [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], and [[Game Boy Advance]] cartridges could be played on the platform. The GameCube was discontinued in 2007 with the release of [[Wii]].\n* [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was the first dedicated video game console released by the company in North America on November 15, 2001, in Japan on February 22, 2002, and in Europe and Australia on March 14, 2002. Microsoft realized the power of video game consoles and feared with growing capabilities they may take over more than the living room. It was the first console to employ a hard drive right out of the box to save games, the first to include an Ethernet port for broadband internet, and the beginning of Microsoft's online [[Xbox LIVE]] service.  Microsoft was able to attract many PC developers by using the [[Ntoskrnl.exe|NT kernel]] and [[DirectX]] from their [[Windows]] operating system.  Though criticized for its bulky size and the awkwardness of its original controller, the Xbox eventually gained popularity, especially in the US, where it outsold the GameCube to secure second place, due in part to the success of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' franchise]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Dreamcast]]\n|1998\n|1999\n|1999\n|9,130,000\n|-\n![[PlayStation 2]]\n|2000\n|2000\n|2000\n|155,000,000\n|-\n![[GameCube]]\n|2001\n|2001\n|2002\n|21,740,000\n|-\n![[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]\n|2002\n|2001\n|2002\n|24,000,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nDuring the sixth generation era, the [[handheld game console]] market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. Two redesigns of this system followed, the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] in 2003 and the [[Game Boy Micro]] in 2005. Also introduced were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company [[Game Park]] introduced its [[GP32]] handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of [[Open-source software|open source]] handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.<ref name=nintendosales>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1409.pdf|title=Consolidated Sales Transition by Region|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=May 7, 2014|publisher=Nintendo |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029173642/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1409.pdf|archivedate=October 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of \"non-gaming\" features into their handheld consoles, including [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable movie players, and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like features. The handheld that started this trend was [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the [[N-Gage QD]]. A second handheld, the [[Tapwave Zodiac|Zodiac]] from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the [[Palm OS]], it offered specialized video games-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation. With more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were \"the computers of handheld gaming\" because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move video games beyond the last generation's 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld video game consoles.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Game Boy Advance]]\n|2001\n|2001\n|2001\n|81,510,000\n|-\n![[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]]\n|''none''\n|2003\n|2003\n|3,000,000\n|}\n\n=== Seventh generation ===\n{{main|Seventh generation of video game consoles}}\nVideo game consoles had become an important part of the global [[IT infrastructure]].

Another new technology is the use of motion as input, and IR tracking (as implemented on the Wii). Also, all seventh generation consoles support wireless controllers. This generation also introduced the [[Nintendo DS]], and the Nintendo DSi, which brought touchscreens into the mainstream for and added cameras to portable video games.\n* [[Microsoft]] kicked off the seventh generation with the release of the [[Xbox 360]] on November 22, 2005, in the United States, December 2, 2005, in Europe, December 10, 2005, in Japan and March 23, 2006, in Australia. It featured market-leading processing power until the Sony [[PlayStation 3]] was released one year later. While the original Xbox 360 \"Core\" did not include an internal HDD, most Xbox 360 models since have included at least the option to have one. The Xbox 360 optical drive is a [[DVD9]] reader, allowing DVD movies to be played. No Blu-ray drive was included, making big games like Battlefield and Wolfenstein: The New Order require two or more DVDs to play. Up to four controllers can be connected to the console wirelessly on the standard 2.4&nbsp;GHz spectrum. There are 4 discontinued versions of the Xbox 360: the \"Arcade,\" the \"Pro,\" and the \"Elite,\" and the newer \"S\" or 'slim' model. The  \"E\" version of the Xbox 360 included 3 configurations: a 4GB internal [[SSD]] version which acts like a USB hard drive, a 250 GB HDD version, and a branded 320 GB HDD version. The Xbox 360 is [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with [[List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360|about half the games]] of the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] library. In 2010, Microsoft released [[Kinect]], allowing for motion-controlled games. The Xbox 360 was discontinued on April 20, 2016.\n:The Xbox 360 had [[Xbox 360 technical problems|major technical problems]] on release, with a large portion of its consoles suffering from general hardware failures, nicknamed \"the Red Ring of Death (RROD)\" for the display of a red ring around the console's power button indicating the problem.

All PlayStation 3's come with a hard drive and are able to play [[Blu-ray Disc]] games and [[Blu-ray Disc]] movies out of the box. The PlayStation 3 was the first video game console to support HDMI output out of the box, using full 1080p resolution. Up to seven controllers can connect to the console using [[Bluetooth]]. There are 6 discontinued versions of the PS3: a 20 GB HDD version (discontinued in North America and Japan, and was never released in PAL territories), a 40 GB HDD version (discontinued), a 60 GB HDD version (discontinued in North America, Japan and PAL territories), 80 GB HDD version (only in some NTSC territories and PAL territories), a \"slim\" 120GB HDD version (discontinued), and a \"slim\" 250 GB version (discontinued). The two current shipping versions of the PlayStation 3 are: a \"slim\" 160 GB HDD version and a \"slim\" 320 GB HDD version. The hard drive can be replaced with any standard 2.5\" [[Serial ATA]] drive and the system has support for removable media storage, such as [[Memory Stick]], Memory Stick Pro, Memory Stick Duo, Memory Stick PRO Duo, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[Secure Digital card|SD]], [[MiniSD]], and [[CompactFlash]] (CF) digital media, but only the PlayStation versions up to 80 GB support this.

In 2010, Sony released [[PlayStation Move]], allowing for motion-controlled games. With recent software updates, the PlayStation 3 can play 3D Blu-ray movies and 3D games.\n* Nintendo's [[Wii]] was released in North America on November 19, 2006, in Japan on December 2, 2006, in Australia on December 7, 2006, and in Europe on December 8, 2006. It is bundled with [[Wii Sports]] in all regions except for Japan. Unlike the other systems of the seventh generation, the Wii does not support an internal hard drive, but instead uses 512 MB of internal Flash memory and includes support for removable [[SD card]] storage. It also has a maximum resolution output of 480p, making it the only seventh generation console not able to output high-definition graphics. Along with its lower price, the Wii is notable for its unique controller, the [[Wii Remote]], which resembles a TV remote. The system uses a \"sensor bar\" that emits [[infrared]] light that is detected by an infrared camera in the Wii Remote to determine orientation relative to the source of the light. All models, other than the [[Wii Family Edition]] and the [[Wii Mini]], are backwards compatible with GameCube games and support up to four GameCube controllers and two memory cards. It also includes the [[Virtual Console]], which allows the purchase and downloading of games from older systems, including those of former competitors.

Simple games such as [[Tetris]] and [[Solitaire]] had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Nintendo DS]]\n|2004\n|2004\n|2005\n|154,020,000\n|-\n![[PlayStation Portable]]\n|2004\n|2005\n|2005\n|82,000,000\n|}\n\n=== Eighth generation ===\n{{main|Eighth generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:Wii U Console and Gamepad.png|thumb|The [[Wii U]] was the worst selling console of the eighth generation, selling around 13.56 million units before being discontinued, but some of Nintendo's first party games for the system have sold around half the install base of the system, telling that Nintendo has a very dedicated fanbase<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/349078/nintendo-wii-and-wii-u-console-sales/|title=Wii U Sales|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/news/nintendo-has-revealed-the-best-selling-games-for-wii-u-and-3ds|title=Nintendo Best Selling First Party Wii U Games|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=September 10, 2016}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Microsoft-Xbox-One-Console-Set-wKinect.jpg|thumb|\nThe original [[Xbox One]], Microsoft's eighth generation console, which has since been superseded by two upgraded models, the Xbox One S and the Xbox One X.\n]]\nAside from the usual hardware enhancements, consoles of the eighth generation focus on further integration with other media and increased connectivity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/blogs/flavi0/2013/02/24/next-gen-consoles-too-much-connectivity/|title=Next Gen Consoles: Too much connectivity - Blog by flavi0 - IGN|website=IGN}}</ref> The [[Wii U]] introduced a controller/tablet hybrid whose features include the possibility of augmented reality in video games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/11/20/why-you-may-want-to-wait-on-a-wii-u/|title=Why you should wait on a Wii U (review) - GamesBeat - Games - by Rus McLaughlin|website=VentureBeat}}</ref>  The [[PlayStation 4]] is Sony's eighth generation console, featuring a \"share\" button to stream video game content between devices, released on November 15, 2013.

These cards function similar to simple cartridges. Information is stored on a chip that is housed in plastic. Cards are more compact and simpler than cartridges, though. This makes them cheaper to produce and smaller, but limits what can be done with them. Cards cannot hold extra components, and common cartridge techniques like [[bank switching]] (a technique used to create very large games) were impossible to miniaturize into a card in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal| author = Richard Talbot-Watkins|title=Sega master system technical information|date=June 10, 1998|url=http://www.smspower.org/uploads/Development/richard.txt|format=.txt|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Jeff Bogumil|title=Sega MASTER SYSTEM Frequently Asked Questions|version=2.06|date=September 27, 1997|url=http://www.severedbbs.u-net.com/fletcher/SMSFAQ.txt|format=.txt|accessdate=June 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626104311/http://www.severedbbs.u-net.com/fletcher/SMSFAQ.txt|archivedate=June 26, 2007}}</ref> Compact Discs reduced much of the need for cards.

Nintendo has long used cartridges with their Game Boy line of hand held consoles because of their durability, small size, stability (not shaking and vibrating the handheld when it is in use), and low battery consumption.

Both [[tape drive]]s and [[floppy disk]] drives were common on early [[microcomputer]]s. Their popularity is in large part because a tape drive or disk drive can write to any material it can read. However, magnetic media is volatile and can be more easily damaged than game cartridges or optical discs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swearingen|first=Kirsten|author2=Peter Charles|author3=Nathan Good|author4=Laheem Lamar Jordan|author5=Joyojeet Pal|title=How Much Information? 2003|url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003/magnetic.htm|accessdate=June 20, 2007}}</ref> Among the first consoles to use magnetic media were the [[Bally Astrocade]] and [[APF-M1000]], both of which could use cassette tapes through expansions. In Bally's case, this allowed the console to see new game development even after Bally dropped support for it. While magnetic media remained limited in use as a primary form of distribution, three popular subsequent consoles also had expansions available to allow them to use this format. The [[Starpath Supercharger]] can load Atari 2600 games from audio cassettes; Starpath used it to cheaply distribute their own games from 1982 to 1984 and today it is used by many programmers to test, distribute, and play [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew software]]. The [[Family Computer Disk System|Disk System]], a floppy disk-reading add-on to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] (as the NES was known in Japan), was released by Nintendo in 1986 for the Japanese market. Nintendo sold the disks cheaply and sold vending machines where customers could have new games written to their disks up to 500 times.<ref>{{cite web| title = Family Computer Disk System|date=January 20, 2000|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/fds/fds.html|accessdate=June 20, 2007}}</ref> In 1999, Nintendo released another Japan-only floppy disk add-on, the [[Nintendo 64DD]], for the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\n=== Optical media ===\n[[Image:Opticalgames.JPG|thumb|200px|Shown is a CD-ROM (left) and a game in [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo optical discs|proprietary optical disc format]] similar to a [[MiniDVD]], as the most widely used forms of optical media are DVDs and [[compact discs]]]]\nIn the mid-1990s, various manufacturers shifted to optical media, specifically CD-ROM, for games. Although they were slower at loading game data than the cartridges available at that time, they were significantly cheaper to manufacture and had a larger capacity than the existing cartridge technology. [[NEC]] released the first CD-based video game system, the TurboGrafx-CD (an add-on for the [[TurboGrafx-16]]), in December 4, 1988 in Japan and August 1, 1990 in the United States. [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega CD]] (an add-on for the [[Sega Genesis]]) in Japan on December 12, 1991; [[Commodore International|Commodore]] stepped into the ring shortly after with the [[Amiga CD32|Amiga-CD32]], the first 32-bit game console, on September 17, 1993. During the later half of the 1990s, optical media began to supplant cartridges due to their greater storage capacity and cheaper manufacturing costs, with the CD-based [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] significantly outpacing the cartridge-based [[Nintendo 64]] in terms of sales. By the early 21st century, all of the major home consoles used optical media, usually DVD-ROM or similar discs, which are widely replacing CD-ROM for data storage. The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One systems use even higher-capacity [[Blu-ray]] optical discs for games and movies, while the Xbox 360 formerly used [[HD DVD]]s in the form of an external [[USB]] player add-on for video playback before it was discontinued. However, Microsoft still supports those who bought the accessory. [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]], [[Wii]], and [[Wii U]], meanwhile, use [[Nintendo optical disc|proprietary disc formats]] based on then-current industry standard discs\u2014the GameCube's discs are based on mini-DVDs, the Wii's on DVDs and the Wii U's are believed to be based on Blu-rays. These discs offer somewhat smaller storage capacities compared to the formats they are based on, though the difference is significantly smaller compared to the gap between the N64's cartridges and CDs.\n\n=== Internet distribution ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nAll seventh and eighth generation consoles offer some kind of Internet games distribution service, allowing users to download games for a fee onto some form of non-volatile storage, typically a hard disk or flash memory. Recently, the console manufacturers have been taking advantage of internet distribution with games, video streaming services like [[Netflix]], [[Hulu|Hulu Plus]] and film trailers being available.\n* Microsoft's [[Xbox Live]] service includes the Xbox Live Arcade and Xbox Live Marketplace, featuring digital distribution of classic and original titles. These include arcade classics, original titles, and games originally released on other consoles. The Xbox Live Marketplace also includes many different hit movies and trailers in [[High-definition video|high definition]], and is accessible with an Xbox Live Free Membership. There is also an \"Indie Games\" section where small-time developers can buy a license and release their own games onto the marketplace. Such is their volume, these games are not viewed by Microsoft as standard and are instead rated by the public.\n* Sony's online game distribution is known as the [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN). At launch, this service offered free online gaming, but now offers content through a paid service called PlayStation Plus, launched at the beginning of the eighth generation.<ref>https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-plus/</ref> The service offers downloadable content such as classic PlayStation games, high definition games and movie trailers, and original games such as [[flOw]] and [[Everyday Shooter]] as well as some games that also release on physical media, such as ''[[Warhawk (2007 video game)|Warhawk]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]''. A networking service, dubbed [[PlayStation Home]], was released in December 2008, alongside video and audio streaming services.\n* Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] service emulates games from previous-generation consoles and is available for Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U. Nintendo also has original content available for download through its online stores, the Wii Shop Channel ([[WiiWare]]), Nintendo DSi Shop ([[DSiWare]]) and [[Nintendo eShop]].\n** Nintendo launched the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection alongside the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]], which utilized [[GameSpy]]'s servers to offer free online multiplayer. In addition, Nintendo's Wii Shop Channel allowed for the digital distribution of downloadable games, emulated titles, and Wii applications known as \"Channels\", which provided functionality such as access to [[Netflix]], [[YouTube]] and an Internet browser, as well as online-enabled contests such as the [[Check Mii Out Channel]] and [[Everybody Votes Channel]]. Nintendo's WiiConnect24 service offered information and videos of upcoming software through the Wii's downloadable [[Nintendo Channel]], which also allowed users to download demos from the Wii console to a nearby Nintendo DS through a local wireless connection. Other WiiConnect24 services included dedicated channels for weather and news. WiiConnect24 also enabled a message board that allowed a connected Wii to receive messages from games, installed Channels and other users' consoles. In the summer of 2014, these services were discontinued, reportedly to let developers work harder on Wii U functionality. In 2018, the Wii Shop Channel was discontinued, ending digital distribution of Virtual Console games, WiiWare, and Wii Channels to Wii consoles.\n** [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|Eighth-generation]] Nintendo consoles (Nintendo 3DS and Wii U) took advantage of the services provided by the [[Nintendo Network]], including purchase and download of full titles, Virtual Console games, downloadable games (including most DSiWare/WiiWare titles), [[Downloadable content|DLC]], non-gaming apps, game demos, and other material. Nintendo Network also allowed online-gaming support to be provided either for free or for a premium cost. Nintendo also offered its own social network in the form of [[Nintendo Network|Miiverse]], which was shut down in 2017.\n** The [[Nintendo Switch]] is the first Nintendo console to utilize a paid online system instead of a free one. The new service is necessary to play online, and allows users to play emulated games from the Virtual Console service. The paid service was officially launched in 2018, although a free trial of many of its features had been available up until then. The system offers digital software downloads through the [[Nintendo eShop]] directly from the console, cloud save backups, and facilitates voice chat and party matching in multiplayer online titles such as ''[[Splatoon 2]]'', through use of an external [[smartphone]] application.\n* The [[Ouya]] had its games distributed entirely over the Internet, instead of using any physical media like a disk or cartridge. Users purchased games from Ouya's online shop, similar to those of other consoles.\n\n== Bits ==\nEach new generation of console hardware made use of the rapid development of processing technology. Newer machines could output a greater range of colors, more [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and introduced graphical technologies such as [[image scaling|scaling]], and [[vector graphics]].  One way console makers marketed these advances to consumers was through the measurement of [[bit|\"bits\".]] The [[TurboGrafx-16]], Genesis, and Super NES were among the first consoles to advertise the fact that they contained 16-bit [[processors]]. This fourth generation of console hardware was often referred to as the 16-bit era and the previous generation as the 8-bit. The ''bit-value'' of a console referred to the ''[[word length]]'' of a console's processor (although the value was sometimes misused, for example, the TurboGrafx 16 had only an 8-bit [[CPU]], and the Genesis/Mega Drive had the 16/32-bit [[Motorola 68000]], but both had a 16-bit dedicated graphics processor). As the graphical performance of console hardware is dependent on many factors, using bits was a crude way to gauge a console's overall ability.  For example, the NES, Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 2600 all used a very similar 8-bit CPU. The difference in their processing power is due to other causes.  For example, the Commodore 64 contains 64 kilobytes of RAM and the Atari 2600 has much less at 128 bytes of RAM. The jump from 8-bit machines to 16-bit machines to 32-bit machines made a noticeable difference in performance, so consoles from certain generations are frequently referred to as 8-bit or 16-bit consoles. However, the \"bits\" in a console are no longer a major factor in their performance. The Nintendo 64, for example, has been outpaced by several 32-bit machines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2001/12/18/interview-ibm-details-gekko-part-ii|title=Interview: IBM GEKKO (part II)|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Aside from some \"128 Bit\" advertising slogans at the beginning of the sixth generation, marketing with bits largely stopped after the fifth generation.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics|Video games}}\n* [[Console game]]\n* [[Console war]]\n* [[Dedicated console]]\n* [[Handheld game console]]\n* [[Handheld TV game]]\n* [[History of video games]]\n* [[Home video game console]]\n* [[List of video game consoles]]\n* [[Microconsole]]\n* [[Unlockable games]]\n* [[Video game clone]]\n* [[Virtual reality headset]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|author=Forster, Winnie|title=The Encyclopedia of Game Machines - Consoles, handheld & home computers 1972\u20132005|publisher=Gameplan|year=2005|isbn=978-3-00-015359-4|url=http://www.gameplan.de/gameplan_01.5_UK/index.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526032440/http://www.gameplan.de/gameplan_01.5_UK/index.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 26, 2005}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

An arcade machine consists of a video game computer, display, [[game controller]] (joystick, buttons, etc.) and [[loudspeaker|speakers]] housed in large or small chassis. A [[home computer]] is a personal computer designed for home use for a variety of purposes, such as bookkeeping, accessing the Internet and playing video games.  While arcades and computers are generally expensive or highly \"technical\"  devices, video game consoles were designed with affordability and [[accessibility]] to the [[general public]] in mind.\n\nUnlike similar consumer electronics such as music players and movie players, which use industry-wide standard formats, video game consoles use [[proprietary format]]s which compete with each other for market share.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=|first= |title=The Big Fight|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=24 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=December 1996|pages=38\u201341}}</ref> There are various types of video game consoles, including [[home video game console]]s, [[handheld game console]]s, [[microconsole]]s and [[dedicated console]]s. Although [[Ralph Baer]] had built working game consoles by 1966, it was nearly a decade before the ''[[Pong]]'' game made them commonplace in regular people's living rooms. Through evolution over the 1990s and 2000s, game consoles have expanded to offer additional functions such as [[CD player]]s, [[DVD player]]s, [[Blu-ray]] disc players, [[web browser]]s, [[set-top box]]es and more.\n== Types ==\nVideo game consoles can come in several varieties.\n* [[Home video game console]]s are devices that are generally meant to be hooked up to a television or other type of monitor, and with power supplied through an outlet, thus requiring the unit to be used in fixed locations. Early examples include the [[Atari 2600]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and the [[Sega Genesis]], while newer examples include the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]].\n* [[Handheld video game console]]s are devices that typically include a built-in screen and a battery so that the unit can be carried around and be played anywhere. Examples of such include the , [[Game Boy]], the [[PlayStation Vita]], the [[Nintendo DS]] and [[Nintendo 3DS]].\n* Hybrid video game consoles have elements of both home and handheld systems. Presently, the only hybrid console is the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Overview of timeline ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; width: 60%; font-size:80%; line-height:13px\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fff;\" colspan=\"2\"|<div style=\"width: 100%; height:auto; overflow: auto; padding: 1px;text-align: left\">\n{{#tag:timeline|\nDateFormat=mm/dd/yyyy\nDefine $now = {{#time:m/d/Y}}\nDefine $later = {{#time:m/d/Y|+6 years}}\nDefine $skip = at:end # Force a blank line\nDefine $dayunknown = 15 # what day to use if it's actually not known\nPeriod = from:06/01/1969 till:$later\nImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea = right:1 left:1 bottom:130 top:1\n\nColors =\n     id:bg            value:white\n     id:lightline     value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9)\n     id:lighttext     value:rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5)\n     id:server        value:rgb(0.8,0.8,0.9)\n     id:first         value:rgb(0.8,0.8,0.8)       Legend:First_generation\n     id:second        value:rgb(1,0.8,0.8)         Legend:Second_generation\n     id:third         value:rgb(0.4,0.7,0.9)       Legend:Third_generation\n     id:fourth        value:rgb(0.4,0.8,1)         Legend:Fourth_generation\n     id:fifth         value:rgb(0.3,0.9,0.4)       Legend:Fifth_generation\n     id:sixth         value:rgb(0.5,1,0.7)         Legend:Sixth_generation\n     id:seventh       value:rgb(1,0.7,0.3)         Legend:Seventh_generation\n     id:eighth        value:rgb(1,0.8,0.2)         Legend:Eighth_generation\n     id:current       value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9)       Legend:Current\n\nBackgroundColors = canvas:bg\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:lighttext unit:year increment:10 start:01/01/1970\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightline unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/1970\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\n\nBarData =\n  barset:model\n\nPlotData =\n  width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\n  barset:model\n    color:first from:05/01/1972 till:12/31/1980 text:\"First (1972\u20131980)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    color:second from:08/01/1976 till:01/01/1992 text:\"Second (1976\u20131992)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:third from:07/15/1983 till:09/25/2003 text:\"Third (1983\u20132003)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:fourth from:10/30/1987 till:04/22/2004 text:\"Fourth (1987\u20132004)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:fifth from:10/04/1993 till:03/31/2005 text:\"Fifth (1993\u20132005)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:sixth from:11/27/1998 till:01/04/2013 text:\"Sixth (1998\u20132013)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:seventh from:11/22/2005 till:05/29/2017 text:\"Seventh (2005\u20132017)\"\n    $skip\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:eighth from:02/26/2011 till:$now text:\"Eighth (2012\u2013ongoing)\"\n    $skip\n  barset:break\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    $skip\n    color:current from:$now till:end\n    $skip\n}}</div>\n|-\n!style=\"width:5%\"|Source\n|style=\"width:95%\"|{{efn|group=note|name=First|The first generation of video game consoles began with the release of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first commercial home video game console, was released in September 1972.<ref name=\"ODYSSEY: 35 YEARS LATER\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/01/odyssey-35-years-later|title=ODYSSEY: 35 YEARS LATER|last=Buchanan|first=Levi|date=May 31, 2007|website=IGN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201214452/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/01/odyssey-35-years-later|archivedate=December 1, 2016|url-status=live}}Between 1970 and 1972, Magnavox and Baer work together to fully develop the Odyssey.

[[Ralph H. Baer]] conceived the idea of a home video game in 1951. In the late 1960s, while working for [[Sanders Associates]], Baer created a series of video game console designs. One of these designs, which gained the nickname of the 1966 \"Brown Box\", featured changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufacturers, ultimately leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baer|first=Ralph H.|date=2005|title=Videogames: In The Beginning|pages=52\u201359|publisher=Rolenta Press|isbn=978-0-9643848-1-1}}</ref> In 1972, [[Magnavox]] released the [[Magnavox Odyssey]], the first home video game console which could be connected to a TV set.  Ralph Baer's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console (the Odyssey lacked a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]) to create slightly different games like tennis, volleyball, hockey, and chase. Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]] for each game.  Although Baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games, the cartridges released by Magnavox all served the same function as the switches and allowed players to choose from the Odyssey's built-in games.\n\nThe Odyssey initially sold about 100,000 units,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphbaer.com/how_video_games.htm|title=How Video Games Invaded the Home TV Set|publisher=Ralph H. Baer Consultants|accessdate=October 15, 2014}}</ref> making it moderately successful, and it was not until [[Atari]]'s [[arcade game]] ''[[Pong]]'' popularized video games that the public began to take more notice of the emerging industry. By autumn 1975, Magnavox, bowing to the popularity of ''Pong'', canceled the Odyssey and released a scaled-down version that played only ''Pong'' and hockey, the [[Magnavox Odyssey 100#Odyssey 100|Odyssey 100]]. A second, \"higher end\" console, the [[Odyssey 200]], was released with the 100 and added on-screen scoring, up to four players, and a third game\u2014''Smash''. Almost simultaneously released with Atari's own home Pong console through [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], these consoles jump-started the consumer market. All three of the new consoles used simpler designs than the original Odyssey did with no board game pieces or extra cartridges. In the years that followed, the market saw many companies rushing similar consoles to market. After [[General Instrument]] released their inexpensive microchips, each containing a complete console on a single chip, many small developers began releasing consoles that looked different externally, but internally were playing exactly the same games. Most of the consoles from this era were [[dedicated consoles]] playing only the games that came with the console. These video game consoles were often just called video games because there was little reason to distinguish the two yet. While a few companies like [[Atari]], Magnavox, and newcomer [[Coleco]] pushed the envelope, the market became flooded with simple, similar video games.\n\n=== Second generation ===\n{{main|Second generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:Atari-2600-Wood-4Sw-Set.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Atari 2600]] became the most popular game console of the second generation.]]\nFairchild released the [[Fairchild Channel F|Fairchild Video Entertainment System]] (VES) in 1976. While there had been previous game consoles that used cartridges, either the cartridges had no information and served the same function as flipping switches (the Odyssey) or the console itself was empty ([[Coleco Telstar]]) and the cartridge contained all of the game components. The VES, however, contained a programmable microprocessor so its cartridges only needed a single ROM chip to store microprocessor instructions. RCA and Atari soon released their own cartridge-based consoles, the [[RCA Studio II]] and the [[Atari 2600]] (originally branded as the Atari Video Computer System), respectively.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Fairchild Channel F]]\n|1977\n|1976\n|''none''\n|250,000\n|-\n![[Atari 2600]]\n|1983\n|1977\n|1978\n|30,000,000\n|-\n![[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]]\n|1982\n|1979\n|1978\n|2,000,000\n|-\n![[Intellivision]]\n|1982\n|1980\n|1982\n|3,000,000\n|-\n![[ColecoVision]]\n|''none''\n|1982\n|1983\n|2,000,000\n|-\n![[Atari 5200]]\n|''none''\n|1982\n|''none''\n|1,000,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nThe first [[handheld game console]] with interchangeable cartridges was the [[Microvision]] designed by Smith Engineering, and distributed and sold by [[Milton-Bradley]] in 1979. Crippled by a small, fragile LCD display and a very narrow selection of games, it was discontinued two years later. The [[Epoch Game Pocket Computer]] was released in Japan in 1984. The Game Pocket Computer featured an LCD screen with 75 X 64 resolution and could produce graphics at about the same level as early Atari 2600 games. The system sold very poorly, and as a result, only five games were made for it. Nintendo's [[Game & Watch]] series of dedicated game systems proved more successful. It helped to establish handheld video games as popular and lasted until 1991. Many Game & Watch games were later re-released on Nintendo's subsequent handheld systems.\n\n==== Rebirth of the home console market ====\nThe VES continued to be sold at a profit after 1977, and both Bally (with their [[Bally Astrocade|Home Library Computer]] in 1977) and Magnavox (with the [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2|Odyssey\u00b2]] in 1978) brought their own programmable cartridge-based consoles to the market. However, it was not until Atari released a conversion of the [[Golden age of arcade video games|golden age arcade]] hit ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1980 for the [[Atari 2600]] that the home console industry took off. Many consumers bought an Atari console so they could play ''Space Invaders'' at home. The unprecedented success of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' started the trend of console manufacturers trying to get exclusive rights to arcade titles, and the trend of advertisements for game consoles claiming to bring the arcade experience home. Throughout the early 1980s, other companies released video game consoles of their own. Many of the video game systems (e.g. [[ColecoVision]]) were technically superior to the Atari 2600, and marketed as improvements over the Atari 2600. However, Atari dominated the console market in the early 1980s.\n\n==== North American video game crash of 1983 ====\n{{main|North American video game crash of 1983}}\nIn 1983, the video game business suffered a much more severe crash. A flood of low-quality video games by smaller companies (especially for the 2600), industry leader Atari hyping games such as [[E.T. (Atari 2600)|E.T]] and a 2600 version of ''[[Pac-Man]]'' that were poorly received, and a growing number of [[home computer]] users caused consumers and retailers to lose faith in video game consoles. Most video game companies filed for bankruptcy, or moved into other industries, abandoning their game consoles. A group of employees from [[Mattel Electronics]] formed the INTV Corporation and bought the rights for the [[Intellivision]]. INTV alone continued to manufacture the Intellivision in small quantities and release new Intellivision games until 1991.  All other North American game consoles were discontinued by 1984. Revenues generated by the video game industry fell by 97% during the crash.\n\n=== Third generation ===\n{{main|Third generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:NES-Console-Set.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] made home console video games popular again in America after the 1983 crash]]\nIn 1983, [[Nintendo]] released the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer]] (or Famicom) in Japan. The Famicom supported high-resolution sprites, larger color palettes, and tiled backgrounds, which allowed Famicom games to have more detailed graphics than games of prior consoles. Nintendo began attempts to bring their Famicom to the U.S. after the video game market had crashed. In the U.S., video games were seen as a fad that had already passed. To distinguish its product from older game consoles, Nintendo released their Famicom as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) which used a front-loading cartridge port similar to a VCR, included a plastic \"[[robot]]\" ([[R.O.B.]]), and was initially advertised as a toy. The NES was the highest selling console in the history of North America and revitalized the video game market.  Mario of [[Super Mario Bros.]] became a global icon starting with his NES games.  Nintendo took a somewhat unusual stance with third-party developers for its console.  Nintendo contractually restricted third-party developers to three NES titles per year and forbade them from developing for other video game consoles.  The practice ensured Nintendo's market dominance and prevented the flood of trash titles that had helped kill the Atari, but was ruled illegal late in the console's lifecycle.<ref name=opinion>\n{{cite court\n|litigants=Atari Games Corp. v.

It fared notably better in [[PAL]] territories.  In Europe and South America, the Master System competed with the NES and saw new game releases even after Sega's next-generation Mega Drive was released.  In Brazil where strict importation laws and rampant piracy kept out competitors, the Master System outsold the NES by a massive margin and remained popular into the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Master System Console in Brazil |date=April 29, 2013 |url=http://segaretro.org/Master_System_consoles_in_Brazil |accessdate=April 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313025252/http://segaretro.org/Master_System_consoles_in_Brazil |archivedate=March 13, 2013 }}</ref> Jack Tramiel, after buying Atari, downsizing its staff, and settling its legal disputes, attempted to bring Atari back into the home console market.  Atari released a smaller, sleeker, cheaper version of their popular Atari 2600.  They also released the Atari 7800, a console technologically comparable with the NES and backward compatible with the 2600.  Finally, Atari repackaged its 8-bit XE home computer as the XEGS game console.  The new consoles helped Atari claw its way out of debt, but failed to gain much market share from Nintendo.  Atari's lack of funds meant that its consoles saw fewer releases, lower production values (both the manuals and the game labels were frequently black and white), and limited distribution. Additionally, two popular 8-bit computers, the Commodore 64 and [[Amstrad CPC]], were repackaged as the [[Commodore 64 Games System]] and [[Amstrad GX4000]] respectively, for entry into the console market.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom/NES]]\n|1983\n|1985\n|1986\n|61,910,000\n|-\n![[Master System|Mark III/Master System]]\n|1985\n|1986\n|1987\n|13,000,000\n|-\n![[Atari 7800]]\n|''none''\n|1986\n|1987\n|3,770,000\n|-\n![[Atari XEGS]]\n|''none''\n|1987\n|1987\n|100,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nIn the latter part of the third generation, Nintendo introduced the [[Game Boy]] and Atari released the [[Atari Lynx]] portable game consoles, pioneering and solidifying the handheld video game industry.\n\n=== Fourth generation ===\n{{main|Fourth generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:Nintendo-Super-Famicom-Set-FL.jpg|thumb|Nintendo Super Famicom]]\n[[NEC]] brought the first fourth-generation console to market with their [[PC Engine]] (or TurboGrafx16) when [[Hudson Soft]] approached them with an advanced graphics chip. Hudson had previously approached Nintendo, only to be rebuffed by a company still raking in the profits of the NES.  The TurboGrafx used the unusual [[HuCard]] format to store games. The small size of these proprietary cards allowed NEC to [[Turbo Express|re-release the console]] as a [[handheld game console]]. The PC Engine enjoyed brisk sales in Japan, but its North American counterpart, the TurboGrafx, lagged behind the competition. The console never saw an official release in Europe, but clones and North American imports were available in some markets starting in 1990. NEC advertised their console as \"16-bit\" to highlight its advances over the NES. This started the trend of all subsequent fourth generations consoles being advertised as 16 bit.  Many people still refer to this generation as the 16-bit generation and often refer to the third generation as \"8-bit\".\n\nSega scaled down and adapted their [[Sega System 16]] (used to power arcade hits like [[Altered Beast]] and Shinobi) into the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive]] (sold as the Genesis in North America) and released it with a near arcade-perfect port of Altered Beast. Sega's console met lukewarm sales in Japan, but skyrocketed to first place in PAL markets, and made major inroads in North America. Propelled by its effective \"Genesis does what Nintendon't\" marketing campaign, Sega capitalized on the Genesis's technological superiority over the NES, faithful ports of popular arcade games, and competitive pricing. The arcade gaming company [[SNK]] developed the high end [[Neo Geo MVS]] arcade system which used interchangeable cartridges similar to home consoles. Building on the success of the MVS, SNK repackaged the [[NeoGeo]] as the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo AES]] home console.  Though technologically superior to the other fourth-generation consoles, the AES and its games were prohibitively expensive, which kept sales low and prevented it from expanding outside its niche market and into serious competition with Nintendo and Sega. The AES did, however, amass a dedicated cult following, allowing it to see new releases into the 2000s. Fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles to reproduce the [[pixel art|art styles]] that were becoming popular in arcades and on home computers. These games often featured lavish background scenery, huge characters, broader color palettes, and increased emphasis on dithering and texture.  Games written specifically for the NES, like ''Megaman'', ''[[Shatterhand]]'', and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' were able to work cleverly within its limitations. Ports of the increasingly detailed arcade and home computer games came up with various solutions. For example, when Capcom released ''[[Strider (arcade game)|Strider]]'' in the arcade they created an entirely separate Strider game for the NES that only incorporated themes and characters from the arcade.\n\nIn 1990, Nintendo finally brought their [[Super Famicom]] to market and brought it to the United States as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (SNES) a year later. Its release marginalized the TurboGrafx and the Neo Geo, but came late enough for Sega to sell several million consoles in North America and gain a strong foothold. The same year the SNES was released Sega released ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', which spiked Genesis sales, similar to Space Invaders on the Atari. Also, by 1992 the first fully licensed NFL Football game was released: ''[[NFL Sports Talk Football '93]]'', which was available only on the Genesis.  This impact on Genesis sales and the overall interest of realistic sports games would start the trend of licensed sports games being viewed as necessary for the success of a console in the US. While Nintendo enjoyed dominance in Japan and Sega in Europe, the competition between the two was particularly fierce and close in North America. Ultimately, the SNES outsold the Genesis, but only after Sega discontinued the Genesis to focus on the next generation of consoles.\n\nOne trait that remains peculiar to the fourth generation is the huge number of exclusive games. Both Sega and Nintendo were very successful and their consoles developed massive libraries of games. Both consoles had to be programmed in assembly to get the most out of them. A game optimized for the Genesis could take advantage of its faster CPU and sound chip.  A game optimized for the SNES could take advantage of its graphics and its flexible, clean sound chip. Some game series, like [[Castlevania]], saw separate system exclusive releases rather than an attempt to port one game to disparate platforms. When compact disc (CD) technology became available midway through the fourth generation, each company attempted to integrate it into their existing consoles in different ways.  NEC and Sega released CD add-ons to their consoles in the form of the [[TurboGrafx-16|TurboGrafx-CD]] and [[Sega CD]], but both were only moderately successful. NEC also released the [[TurboDuo]] which combined the TurboGrafx-16 and its TurboGrafx-CD add-on (along with the RAM and BIOS upgrade from the Super System Card) into one unit.  SNK released a third version of the NeoGeo, the [[Neo Geo CD]], allowing the company to release its games on a cheaper medium than the AES's expensive cartridges, but it reached the market after Nintendo and Sega had already sold tens of millions of consoles each.  Nintendo partnered with [[Sony]] to work on a CD add-on for the SNES, but the deal fell apart when they realized how much control Sony wanted. Sony would use their work with Nintendo as the basis for their [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game console. While CDs became an increasingly visible part of the market, CD-reading technology was still expensive in the 1990s, limiting NEC's and Sega's add-ons' sales.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16]]\n|1987\n|1989\n|1989\n|5,800,000\n|-\n![[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]]\n|1988\n|1989\n|1990\n|30,750,000\n|-\n![[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|1994\n|980,000\n|-\n![[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom/Super NES]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|1992\n|49,100,000\n|-\n![[Sega CD|Sega CD/Mega-CD]]\n|1991\n|1992\n|1993\n|2,240,000\n|-\n![[Neo Geo CD]]\n|1994\n|1996\n|1994\n|570,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nThe first [[handheld game console]] released in the fourth generation was the [[Game Boy]], on April 21, 1989. It went on to dominate handheld sales by an extremely large margin, despite featuring a low-contrast, unlit monochrome screen while all three of its leading competitors had color. Three major franchises made their debut on the Game Boy: ''[[Tetris (Game Boy)|Tetris]]'', the Game Boy's [[killer application]]; [[Pok\u00e9mon]]; and [[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]. With some design (Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light) and hardware (Game Boy Color) changes, it continued in production in some form until 2008, enjoying a better than 18-year run. The [[Atari Lynx]] included hardware-accelerated color graphics, a backlight, and the ability to link up to sixteen units together in an early example of network play when its competitors could only link 2 or 4 consoles (or none at all),<ref name=\"The Atari Lynx\">{{cite web|url= http://www.ataritimes.com/lynx/index.html|title=The Atari Lynx|accessdate=August 20, 2006|publisher=ataritimes.com|year=2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810182044/http://www.ataritimes.com/lynx/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = August 10, 2006}}</ref> but its comparatively short battery life (approximately 4.5 hours on a set of alkaline cells, versus 35 hours for the Game Boy), high price, and weak games library made it one of the worst-selling handheld game systems of all time, with less than 500,000 units sold.<ref>{{cite web |last=Beuscher |first=Dave |title=allgame ( Atari Lynx > Overview ) |publisher=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=5:13 |quote=One drawback to the Lynx system is its power consumption.

It featured graphics capabilities roughly comparable to the [[Master System]] (better colours, but lower resolution), a ready made games library by using the \"Master-Gear\" adapter to play cartridges from the older console, and the opportunity to be converted into a portable TV using a cheap tuner adaptor, but it also suffered some of the same shortcomings as the Lynx. While it sold more than twenty times as many units as the Lynx, its bulky design - slightly larger than even the original Game Boy; relatively poor battery life - only a little better than the Lynx; and later arrival in the marketplace - competing for sales amongst the remaining buyers who didn't already have a Game Boy - hampered its overall popularity despite being more closely competitive to the Nintendo in terms of price and breadth of software library.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bauscher |first=Dave |title=allgame ( Sega Game Gear > Overview ) |publisher=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=5:25 |quote=While this feature is not included on the Game Boy it does provide a disadvantage -- the Game Gear requires 6 AA batteries that only last up to six hours.

Other handheld consoles released during the fourth generation included the [[TurboExpress]], a handheld version of the TurboGrafx-16 released by NEC in 1990, and the [[Game Boy Pocket]], an improved model of the Game Boy released about two years before the debut of the [[Game Boy Color]]. While the TurboExpress was another early pioneer of color handheld video game technology and had the added benefit of using the same game cartridges or 'HuCards' as the TurboGrafx16, it had even worse battery life than the Lynx and Game Gear - about three hours on six contemporary AA batteries - selling only 1.5 million units.<ref name=\"handheld sales\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Game Boy]]\n|1989\n|1989\n|1990\n|118,690,000\n|-\n![[Atari Lynx]]\n|1990\n|1989\n|1990\n|3,000,000\n|-\n![[Game Gear]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|1991\n|10,620,000\n|-\n![[TurboExpress]]\n|1990\n|1991\n|''none''\n|1,500,000\n|}\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n{{main|Fifth generation of video game consoles}}\nDuring this time home computers gained greater prominence as a way of playing video games. The video game console industry nonetheless continued to thrive alongside home computers, due to the advantages of much lower prices, easier portability, circuitry specifically dedicated towards video games, the ability to be played on a television set (which PCs of the time could not do in most cases), and intensive first party software support from manufacturers who were essentially banking their entire future on their consoles.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=PCs Versus Consoles |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=18|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1996|page=1}}</ref>\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:PSX-Console-wController.jpg|thumb|The Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] became the most popular system of the fifth generation consoles, eventually selling over 100 million systems]]\nThe first fifth-generation consoles were the [[Amiga CD32]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]] and the [[Atari Jaguar]]. Although all three consoles were more powerful than the fourth generation systems, none of them would become serious threats to [[Sega]] or [[Nintendo]]. The 3DO initially generated a great deal of hype in part because of a licensing scheme where 3DO licensed the manufacturing of its console out to third parties, similar to VCR or DVD players. However, unlike its competitors who could sell their consoles at a loss, all 3DO manufacturers had to sell for profit. The Jaguar had three processors and no C libraries to help developers cope with it. Atari was ineffective at courting third parties and many of their first party games were poorly received. Many of the Jaguar's games used mainly the slowest (but most familiar) of the console's processors, resulting in titles that could easily have been released on the SNES or Genesis.\n\nTo compete with emerging next gen consoles, Nintendo released ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' which could display a wide range of tones (something common in fifth-generation games) by limiting the number of hues onscreen, and ''[[Star Fox (1993 video game)|Star Fox]]'' which used an extra chip inside of the cartridge to display polygon graphics. Sega followed suit, releasing ''[[Vectorman]]'' and ''[[Virtua Racing]]'' (the latter of which used the Sega Virtua Processor). Sega also released the [[32X]], an add-on for the Genesis, while their [[Sega Saturn]] was still in development. Despite public statements from Sega claiming that they would continue to support the Genesis/32X throughout the next generation, Sega Enterprises forced Sega of America to abandon the 32X. The 32X's brief and confusing existence damaged public perception of the coming Saturn and Sega as a whole.\n\nWhile the fourth generation had seen NEC's [[TurboGrafx-CD]] and Sega's [[Sega CD]] add-ons, it was not until the fifth generation that CD-based consoles and games began to seriously compete with cartridges. CD-ROMs were significantly cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were, and gave developers room to add cinematic cut-scenes, pre-recorded soundtracks, and voice acting that made more serious storytelling possible. [[NEC]] had been developing a successor to the [[TurboGrafx-16]] as early as 1990, and presented a prototype, dubbed the \"Iron Man,\" to developers in 1992, but shelved the project as the CD-ROM\u00b2 System managed to extend the console's market viability in Japan into the mid-90s. When sales started to dry up, NEC rushed its old project to the market. The [[PC-FX]], a CD-based, 32-bit console, had highly advanced, detailed 2D graphics capabilities, and better full-motion video than any other system on the market. It was, however, incapable of handling 3D graphics, forfeiting its chances at seriously competing with Sony and Sega. The console was limited to a niche market of dating sims and visual novels in Japan, and never saw release in Western markets.\n\nAfter the abortive 32X, Sega entered the fifth generation with the Saturn. Sega released several highly regarded titles for the Saturn, but a series of bad decisions alienated many developers and retailers. While the Saturn was technologically advanced, it was also complex, difficult, and unintuitive to write games for. In particular, programming 3D graphics that could compete with those on Nintendo and Sony's consoles proved exceptionally difficult for third-party developers. Because the Saturn used quadrilaterals, rather than triangles, as its basic polygon, cross platform games had to be completely rewritten to see a Saturn port. The Saturn was also a victim of internal politics at Sega. While the Saturn sold comparably well in Japan, Sega's branches in North America and Europe refused to license localizations of many popular Japanese titles, holding they were ill-suited to Western markets. First-party hits like [[Sakura Taisen]] never saw Western releases, while several third-party titles released on both [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and Saturn in Japan, like ''[[Grandia (video game)|Grandia]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', were released in North America and Europe as PlayStation exclusives.\n\nBorn from a failed attempt to create a console with Nintendo, Sony's PlayStation would not only dominate its generation but become the first console to sell over 100 million units by expanding the video game market. Sony actively courted third parties and provided them with convenient c libraries to write their games. Sony had built the console from the start as a 3D, disc-based system, and emphasized its 3D graphics that would come to be viewed as the future of video games. The PlayStation's CD technology won over several developers who had been releasing titles for Nintendo and Sega's fourth generation consoles, such as [[Konami]], [[Namco]], [[Capcom]], and [[Square (video game company)|Square]]. CDs were far cheaper to manufacture and distribute than cartridges were, meaning developers could release larger batches of games at higher profit margins; Nintendo's console, on the other hand, used cartridges, unwittingly keeping third-party developers away. The PlayStation's internal architecture was simpler and more intuitive to program for, giving the console an edge over Sega's Saturn.\n\nNintendo was the last to release a fifth generation console with their [[Nintendo 64]], and when they finally released their console in North America, it came with only two [[launch titles]]. Partly to curb piracy and partly as a result of Nintendo's failed disc projects with [[Sony]] (as [[Super NES CD-ROM|SNES-CD]]) and [[Philips]], Nintendo used cartridges for their console. The higher cost of cartridges drove many third party developers to the PlayStation. The Nintendo 64 could handle 3D polygons better than any console released before it, but its games often lacked the cut-scenes, soundtracks, and voice-overs that became standard on PlayStation discs. Nintendo released several highly acclaimed titles, such as [[Super Mario 64]], [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and [[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]. The Nintendo 64 was able to sell tens of millions of units on the strength of first-party titles alone, but its constant struggles against Sony would make the Nintendo 64 the last home console to use cartridges as a medium for game distribution until the Nintendo Switch in 2017.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[FM Towns Marty]]\n|1993\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|45,000\n|-\n![[Amiga CD32]]\n|''none''\n|1994\n|1993\n|100,000\n|-\n![[Atari Jaguar]]\n|1994\n|1993\n|1994\n|250,000\n|-\n![[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]]\n|1994\n|1993\n|1994\n|2,000,000\n|-\n![[PC-FX]]\n|1994\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|400,000\n|-\n![[32X|Sega 32X]]\n|1994\n|1994\n|1995\n|665,000\n|-\n![[Virtual Boy]]\n|1995\n|1995\n|''none''\n|770,000\n|-\n!

It also has double the processor speed, three times as much memory,<ref>Game Boy has 8 KiB of RAM and 8 KiB of VRAM. Game Boy Color has 32 KiB of RAM and 16 KiB of VRAM.</ref> and an [[infrared]] communications port. Technologically, it was likened to the 8-bit [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] video game console from the 1980s although the Game Boy Color has a much larger color palette (56 simultaneous colors out of 32,768 possible) which had some classical NES ports and newer titles. It comes in seven different colors; Clear purple, purple, red, blue, green, yellow and silver for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' edition. Like the Game Boy Light, the Game Boy Color takes on two AA batteries. It was the final handheld to have 8-bit graphics.\n\nDespite Nintendo's domination of handheld console market, some competing consoles such as [[Neo Geo Pocket]], [[WonderSwan]], [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]], [[WonderSwan Color]] appeared in late 90s and discontinued several years later after their appearance in handheld console market.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Virtual Boy]]\n|1995\n|1995\n|''none''\n|770,000\n|-\n|-\n![[Genesis Nomad]]\n|''none''\n|1995\n|''none''\n|-\n|-\n![[Game Boy Pocket]]\n|1996\n|1996\n|1996<\n|-\n|-\n![[Game.com]]\n|''none''\n|1997\n|1997\n|>300,000\n|-\n![[Game Boy Light]]\n|1998\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|-\n|-\n![[Game Boy Color]]\n|1998\n|1998\n|1998\n|-\n![[Neo Geo Pocket]]\n|1998\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|-\n![[WonderSwan]]\n|1999\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|1,550,000\n|-\n![[Neo Geo Pocket Color]]\n|1999\n|1999\n|1999\n|-\n![[WonderSwan Color]]\n|2000\n|''none''\n|''none''\n|1,100,000\n|-\n|}\n\n<!-- <gallery class=\"center\" classes=\"center\">\nFile:Sega-Nomad-Front.jpg|[[Sega Nomad]] <br />Released in 1995<ref name=\"RetroNomad\">{{cite magazine|author=''[[Retro Gamer]]'' staff|title=Retroinspection: Sega Nomad|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=Imagine Publishing|issue=69|pages=46\u201353}}</ref>\nFile:Game-Boy-Pocket-FL.jpg|[[Game Boy#Game Boy Pocket|Game Boy Pocket]]<br />Released in 1996\nFile:Tiger-Game-Com-FL.jpg|[[Game.com]] <br />Released in September 1997<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/gamecom/3045-77/|title=Game.Com (Platform) - Giant Bomb|website=www.giantbomb.com|access-date=September 9, 2016}}</ref>\nFile:Game-Boy-Light-FL.jpg|[[Game Boy#Game Boy Light|Game Boy Light]]<br />Released in April 1998\nFile:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg|[[Game Boy Color]] <br /> Released in November 1998<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo Adds Color to Its \"Rainbow\" of Products With New Game Boy Color Titles |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Oct_12/ai_53077910/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714234241/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1998_Oct_12/ai_53077910/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 14, 2012 |publisher=''[[Business Wire]]'' |date=October 12, 1998 |accessdate=May 7, 2011 }}</ref>\nFile:Neo-Geo-Pocket-Anthra-Left.jpg|[[Neo Geo Pocket]]<br /> Released in 1998{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n</gallery> -->\n\n=== Sixth generation ===\n{{main|Sixth generation of video game consoles}}\n\n==== Home consoles ====\n[[File:PS2-Fat-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:PS2-Fat-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|upright|With more than 155 million units sold, the Sony [[PlayStation 2]] is the best selling video game console in history]]\n[[File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:Dreamcast-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|The Dreamcast was the last system released by Sega, who became a third-party software publisher.]]\nThe sixth generation witnessed a greater shift towards using DVDs for video game media. This in addition to better specs allowed for games that were both longer and more visually appealing. [[Online console gaming]] began in this generation. \n\n<br />\n\n*[[Sega]]'s [[Dreamcast]], the first console with a built-in modem,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/trivia/what-was-the-first-video-game-console-to-ship-with-a-modem-and-online-gaming-support/|title=What Was The First Video Game Console To Ship With A Modem And Online Gaming Support?|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Jason|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> was released in Japan on November 27, 1998. The Dreamcast under performed in Japan. While interest was initially strong, the company was forced to stop taking pre-orders due to manufacturing issues, and the system failed to meet its sales expectations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/04/hardware_classics_sega_dreamcast|title=Hardware Classics: Sega Dreamcast|last=Life|first=Nintendo|date=2015-04-16|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> Some disappointed consumers refunding their Dreamcasts in favor of PlayStation software.\n\n:After the sluggish sales in Japan, Sega pursued a different strategy in other regions. The system launched in North America with 18 titles, including the much-anticipated [[Sonic Adventure]]. A large part of marketing their system to North America was taking advantage of the turn of the century and the tendency to end a products price tag with the number 9. They created the slogan \"9/9/99 for $199\".<ref>{{Citation|title=Dreamcast Launch Plans Unveiled - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/04/20/dreamcast-launch-plans-unveiled|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> This angle proved to be effective. Despite Japan having a year head start on North America, by the end of 1999 the Dreamcast had sold 2 million units in North America compared to only 1 million in Japan. The Dreamcast went on to launch in Europe on October 14, 1999 and in Australia on November 30, 1999.<ref>{{Citation|title=IGN Presents the History of Dreamcast - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/10/ign-presents-the-history-of-dreamcast|language=en|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref>\n:However, Sega's success ultimately proved to be short-lived. Sony announced their own upcoming system, the [[PlayStation 2]], in the fall of 1999; while they had few details on their system, many consumers held off on buying a console until Sony's own system launched. The PS2 released a year later and received critical acclaim. It quickly outsold the Dreamcast, going on to become the best-selling video game console of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/12/top-10-best-selling-videogame-consoles-551938|title=Top 10 best-selling videogame consoles|date=2018-12-21|website=Guinness World Records|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-05}}</ref> while the Dreamcast's own sales stagnated.\n:Sega implemented a special type of optical media called the [[GD-ROM]]. These discs were created in order to prevent [[Copyright infringement of software|software piracy]], which had been more easily done with consoles of the previous generation; however, this format was soon cracked as well. It also sported a 33.6Kb or 56k modem which could be used to access the Internet or play some games that took advantage of this feature, such as ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', making it the first console with built-in Internet connectivity. An add-on for an Ethernet port allowed one to access broad band Internet though it did not come with the system. Despite these innovations, the competition was too successful. The Dreamcast was Sega's last video game console, and was discontinued in March, 2001. Sega transitioned to software developing/publishing only\n\n* [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 2]] was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, in North America on October 26, 2000, in Europe on November 24, 2000, and in Australia on November 30, 2000. It was the follow-up to its highly successful PlayStation and was also the first home game console to be able to play DVDs. As was done with the original PlayStation in 2000, Sony redesigned the console in 2004 into a smaller version. As of November 21, 2011 over 140 million PlayStation 2 units have been sold.<ref name=\"ps2shipped\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/hirai-targets-150-million-ps3-sales|title=Hirai targets 150 million PS3 sales|accessdate=July 21, 2008|date=July 21, 2008|publisher=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/hirai-wants-ps3-to-beat-ps2|title=Hirai wants PS3 to beat PS2|accessdate=July 21, 2008|date=July 21, 2008|website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> This makes it the best selling home console of all time to date.\n* [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]] was released in Japan on September 15, 2001, in North America on November 18, 2001, in Europe on May 3, 2002, and in Australia on May 17, 2002. It was Nintendo's fourth home video game console and the first console by the company to use optical media instead of cartridges. The GameCube did not play standard 12&nbsp;cm DVDs, instead it employed smaller 8&nbsp;cm optical discs. With the release of the GameCube [[Game Boy Player]], all [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], and [[Game Boy Advance]] cartridges could be played on the platform. The GameCube was discontinued in 2007 with the release of [[Wii]].\n* [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] was the first dedicated video game console released by the company in North America on November 15, 2001, in Japan on February 22, 2002, and in Europe and Australia on March 14, 2002. Microsoft realized the power of video game consoles and feared with growing capabilities they may take over more than the living room. It was the first console to employ a hard drive right out of the box to save games, the first to include an Ethernet port for broadband internet, and the beginning of Microsoft's online [[Xbox LIVE]] service.  Microsoft was able to attract many PC developers by using the [[Ntoskrnl.exe|NT kernel]] and [[DirectX]] from their [[Windows]] operating system.  Though criticized for its bulky size and the awkwardness of its original controller, the Xbox eventually gained popularity, especially in the US, where it outsold the GameCube to secure second place, due in part to the success of the [[Halo (series)|''Halo'' franchise]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Dreamcast]]\n|1998\n|1999\n|1999\n|9,130,000\n|-\n![[PlayStation 2]]\n|2000\n|2000\n|2000\n|155,000,000\n|-\n![[GameCube]]\n|2001\n|2001\n|2002\n|21,740,000\n|-\n![[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]\n|2002\n|2001\n|2002\n|24,000,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nDuring the sixth generation era, the [[handheld game console]] market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. Two redesigns of this system followed, the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] in 2003 and the [[Game Boy Micro]] in 2005. Also introduced were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company [[Game Park]] introduced its [[GP32]] handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of [[Open-source software|open source]] handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.<ref name=nintendosales>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1409.pdf|title=Consolidated Sales Transition by Region|accessdate=October 29, 2014|date=May 7, 2014|publisher=Nintendo |format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029173642/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1409.pdf|archivedate=October 29, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of \"non-gaming\" features into their handheld consoles, including [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable movie players, and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like features. The handheld that started this trend was [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the [[N-Gage QD]]. A second handheld, the [[Tapwave Zodiac|Zodiac]] from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the [[Palm OS]], it offered specialized video games-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation. With more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were \"the computers of handheld gaming\" because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move video games beyond the last generation's 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld video game consoles.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Game Boy Advance]]\n|2001\n|2001\n|2001\n|81,510,000\n|-\n![[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]]\n|''none''\n|2003\n|2003\n|3,000,000\n|}\n\n=== Seventh generation ===\n{{main|Seventh generation of video game consoles}}\nVideo game consoles had become an important part of the global [[IT infrastructure]].

Another new technology is the use of motion as input, and IR tracking (as implemented on the Wii). Also, all seventh generation consoles support wireless controllers. This generation also introduced the [[Nintendo DS]], and the Nintendo DSi, which brought touchscreens into the mainstream for and added cameras to portable video games.\n* [[Microsoft]] kicked off the seventh generation with the release of the [[Xbox 360]] on November 22, 2005, in the United States, December 2, 2005, in Europe, December 10, 2005, in Japan and March 23, 2006, in Australia. It featured market-leading processing power until the Sony [[PlayStation 3]] was released one year later. While the original Xbox 360 \"Core\" did not include an internal HDD, most Xbox 360 models since have included at least the option to have one. The Xbox 360 optical drive is a [[DVD9]] reader, allowing DVD movies to be played. No Blu-ray drive was included, making big games like Battlefield and Wolfenstein: The New Order require two or more DVDs to play. Up to four controllers can be connected to the console wirelessly on the standard 2.4&nbsp;GHz spectrum. There are 4 discontinued versions of the Xbox 360: the \"Arcade,\" the \"Pro,\" and the \"Elite,\" and the newer \"S\" or 'slim' model. The  \"E\" version of the Xbox 360 included 3 configurations: a 4GB internal [[SSD]] version which acts like a USB hard drive, a 250 GB HDD version, and a branded 320 GB HDD version. The Xbox 360 is [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with [[List of Xbox games compatible with Xbox 360|about half the games]] of the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] library. In 2010, Microsoft released [[Kinect]], allowing for motion-controlled games. The Xbox 360 was discontinued on April 20, 2016.\n:The Xbox 360 had [[Xbox 360 technical problems|major technical problems]] on release, with a large portion of its consoles suffering from general hardware failures, nicknamed \"the Red Ring of Death (RROD)\" for the display of a red ring around the console's power button indicating the problem.

The PlayStation 3 was the first video game console to support HDMI output out of the box, using full 1080p resolution. Up to seven controllers can connect to the console using [[Bluetooth]]. There are 6 discontinued versions of the PS3: a 20 GB HDD version (discontinued in North America and Japan, and was never released in PAL territories), a 40 GB HDD version (discontinued), a 60 GB HDD version (discontinued in North America, Japan and PAL territories), 80 GB HDD version (only in some NTSC territories and PAL territories), a \"slim\" 120GB HDD version (discontinued), and a \"slim\" 250 GB version (discontinued).

As a cost-cutting measure, later models removed the [[Emotion Engine]], making them incompatible with PlayStation 2 discs. In 2010, Sony released [[PlayStation Move]], allowing for motion-controlled games. With recent software updates, the PlayStation 3 can play 3D Blu-ray movies and 3D games.\n* Nintendo's [[Wii]] was released in North America on November 19, 2006, in Japan on December 2, 2006, in Australia on December 7, 2006, and in Europe on December 8, 2006. It is bundled with [[Wii Sports]] in all regions except for Japan. Unlike the other systems of the seventh generation, the Wii does not support an internal hard drive, but instead uses 512 MB of internal Flash memory and includes support for removable [[SD card]] storage. It also has a maximum resolution output of 480p, making it the only seventh generation console not able to output high-definition graphics. Along with its lower price, the Wii is notable for its unique controller, the [[Wii Remote]], which resembles a TV remote. The system uses a \"sensor bar\" that emits [[infrared]] light that is detected by an infrared camera in the Wii Remote to determine orientation relative to the source of the light. All models, other than the [[Wii Family Edition]] and the [[Wii Mini]], are backwards compatible with GameCube games and support up to four GameCube controllers and two memory cards. It also includes the [[Virtual Console]], which allows the purchase and downloading of games from older systems, including those of former competitors. In 2009, Nintendo introduced the '[[Wii MotionPlus]]' expansion, which uses the same technology as the console previously used, but with enhanced motion tracking and sensing to improve gameplay quality.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n!\n!Japan\n!North America\n!Europe\n!Units sold\n|-\n![[Xbox 360]]\n|2005\n|2005\n|2005\n|84,700,000\n|-\n![[PlayStation 3]]\n|2006\n|2006\n|2007\n|87,400,000\n|-\n![[Wii]]\n|2006\n|2006\n|2006\n|101,630,000\n|}\n\n==== Handheld game consoles ====\nFor [[handheld game console]]s, the seventh generation began with the release of the [[Nintendo DS]] on November 21, 2004.

Nintendo switched to cards starting with the DS, because advances in memory technology made putting extra memory on the cartridge unnecessary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nintendo DS Details Explosion - Screen, Battery, GBA Compatibility and More|date=January 29, 2004|url=http://news.spong.com/article/6128?cb=28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212181019/http://news.spong.com/article/6128?cb=28|archivedate=February 12, 2008|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref> The PlayStation Vita uses Sony's own proprietary flash-memory Vita cards as one method of game distribution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/e3-2011-sony-playstation-vita-inside-and-out-6317468/|title=E3 2011: Sony PlayStation Vita: Inside and Out|author=Sarju Shah|website=GameSpot.com|publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc.|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Magnetic media ===\n[[Image:Magneticgames.JPG|thumb|200px|Two forms of magnetic media commonly used in the 1980s and 1990s for video games are [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] and [[Floppy disk#The 3\u00bd-inch microfloppy diskette|floppy disk]]]]\nHome computers have long used [[magnetic storage]] devices. Both [[tape drive]]s and [[floppy disk]] drives were common on early [[microcomputer]]s. Their popularity is in large part because a tape drive or disk drive can write to any material it can read. However, magnetic media is volatile and can be more easily damaged than game cartridges or optical discs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swearingen|first=Kirsten|author2=Peter Charles|author3=Nathan Good|author4=Laheem Lamar Jordan|author5=Joyojeet Pal|title=How Much Information? 2003|url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info-2003/magnetic.htm|accessdate=June 20, 2007}}</ref> Among the first consoles to use magnetic media were the [[Bally Astrocade]] and [[APF-M1000]], both of which could use cassette tapes through expansions. In Bally's case, this allowed the console to see new game development even after Bally dropped support for it. While magnetic media remained limited in use as a primary form of distribution, three popular subsequent consoles also had expansions available to allow them to use this format. The [[Starpath Supercharger]] can load Atari 2600 games from audio cassettes; Starpath used it to cheaply distribute their own games from 1982 to 1984 and today it is used by many programmers to test, distribute, and play [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew software]]. The [[Family Computer Disk System|Disk System]], a floppy disk-reading add-on to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] (as the NES was known in Japan), was released by Nintendo in 1986 for the Japanese market. Nintendo sold the disks cheaply and sold vending machines where customers could have new games written to their disks up to 500 times.<ref>{{cite web| title = Family Computer Disk System|date=January 20, 2000|url=http://www.atarihq.com/tsr/fds/fds.html|accessdate=June 20, 2007}}</ref> In 1999, Nintendo released another Japan-only floppy disk add-on, the [[Nintendo 64DD]], for the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\n=== Optical media ===\n[[Image:Opticalgames.JPG|thumb|200px|Shown is a CD-ROM (left) and a game in [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo optical discs|proprietary optical disc format]] similar to a [[MiniDVD]], as the most widely used forms of optical media are DVDs and [[compact discs]]]]\nIn the mid-1990s, various manufacturers shifted to optical media, specifically CD-ROM, for games. Although they were slower at loading game data than the cartridges available at that time, they were significantly cheaper to manufacture and had a larger capacity than the existing cartridge technology. [[NEC]] released the first CD-based video game system, the TurboGrafx-CD (an add-on for the [[TurboGrafx-16]]), in December 4, 1988 in Japan and August 1, 1990 in the United States. [[Sega]] followed suit with the [[Sega CD]] (an add-on for the [[Sega Genesis]]) in Japan on December 12, 1991; [[Commodore International|Commodore]] stepped into the ring shortly after with the [[Amiga CD32|Amiga-CD32]], the first 32-bit game console, on September 17, 1993. During the later half of the 1990s, optical media began to supplant cartridges due to their greater storage capacity and cheaper manufacturing costs, with the CD-based [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] significantly outpacing the cartridge-based [[Nintendo 64]] in terms of sales. By the early 21st century, all of the major home consoles used optical media, usually DVD-ROM or similar discs, which are widely replacing CD-ROM for data storage. The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One systems use even higher-capacity [[Blu-ray]] optical discs for games and movies, while the Xbox 360 formerly used [[HD DVD]]s in the form of an external [[USB]] player add-on for video playback before it was discontinued. However, Microsoft still supports those who bought the accessory. [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]], [[Wii]], and [[Wii U]], meanwhile, use [[Nintendo optical disc|proprietary disc formats]] based on then-current industry standard discs\u2014the GameCube's discs are based on mini-DVDs, the Wii's on DVDs and the Wii U's are believed to be based on Blu-rays. These discs offer somewhat smaller storage capacities compared to the formats they are based on, though the difference is significantly smaller compared to the gap between the N64's cartridges and CDs.\n\n=== Internet distribution ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nAll seventh and eighth generation consoles offer some kind of Internet games distribution service, allowing users to download games for a fee onto some form of non-volatile storage, typically a hard disk or flash memory. Recently, the console manufacturers have been taking advantage of internet distribution with games, video streaming services like [[Netflix]], [[Hulu|Hulu Plus]] and film trailers being available.\n* Microsoft's [[Xbox Live]] service includes the Xbox Live Arcade and Xbox Live Marketplace, featuring digital distribution of classic and original titles. These include arcade classics, original titles, and games originally released on other consoles. The Xbox Live Marketplace also includes many different hit movies and trailers in [[High-definition video|high definition]], and is accessible with an Xbox Live Free Membership. There is also an \"Indie Games\" section where small-time developers can buy a license and release their own games onto the marketplace. Such is their volume, these games are not viewed by Microsoft as standard and are instead rated by the public.\n* Sony's online game distribution is known as the [[PlayStation Network]] (PSN). At launch, this service offered free online gaming, but now offers content through a paid service called PlayStation Plus, launched at the beginning of the eighth generation.<ref>https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-plus/</ref> The service offers downloadable content such as classic PlayStation games, high definition games and movie trailers, and original games such as [[flOw]] and [[Everyday Shooter]] as well as some games that also release on physical media, such as ''[[Warhawk (2007 video game)|Warhawk]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 5 Prologue]]''. A networking service, dubbed [[PlayStation Home]], was released in December 2008, alongside video and audio streaming services.\n* Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] service emulates games from previous-generation consoles and is available for Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U. Nintendo also has original content available for download through its online stores, the Wii Shop Channel ([[WiiWare]]), Nintendo DSi Shop ([[DSiWare]]) and [[Nintendo eShop]].\n** Nintendo launched the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection alongside the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]], which utilized [[GameSpy]]'s servers to offer free online multiplayer. In addition, Nintendo's Wii Shop Channel allowed for the digital distribution of downloadable games, emulated titles, and Wii applications known as \"Channels\", which provided functionality such as access to [[Netflix]], [[YouTube]] and an Internet browser, as well as online-enabled contests such as the [[Check Mii Out Channel]] and [[Everybody Votes Channel]]. Nintendo's WiiConnect24 service offered information and videos of upcoming software through the Wii's downloadable [[Nintendo Channel]], which also allowed users to download demos from the Wii console to a nearby Nintendo DS through a local wireless connection. Other WiiConnect24 services included dedicated channels for weather and news. WiiConnect24 also enabled a message board that allowed a connected Wii to receive messages from games, installed Channels and other users' consoles. In the summer of 2014, these services were discontinued, reportedly to let developers work harder on Wii U functionality. In 2018, the Wii Shop Channel was discontinued, ending digital distribution of Virtual Console games, WiiWare, and Wii Channels to Wii consoles.\n** [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|Eighth-generation]] Nintendo consoles (Nintendo 3DS and Wii U) took advantage of the services provided by the [[Nintendo Network]], including purchase and download of full titles, Virtual Console games, downloadable games (including most DSiWare/WiiWare titles), [[Downloadable content|DLC]], non-gaming apps, game demos, and other material. Nintendo Network also allowed online-gaming support to be provided either for free or for a premium cost. Nintendo also offered its own social network in the form of [[Nintendo Network|Miiverse]], which was shut down in 2017.\n** The [[Nintendo Switch]] is the first Nintendo console to utilize a paid online system instead of a free one. The new service is necessary to play online, and allows users to play emulated games from the Virtual Console service. The paid service was officially launched in 2018, although a free trial of many of its features had been available up until then. The system offers digital software downloads through the [[Nintendo eShop]] directly from the console, cloud save backups, and facilitates voice chat and party matching in multiplayer online titles such as ''[[Splatoon 2]]'', through use of an external [[smartphone]] application.\n* The [[Ouya]] had its games distributed entirely over the Internet, instead of using any physical media like a disk or cartridge. Users purchased games from Ouya's online shop, similar to those of other consoles.\n\n== Bits ==\nEach new generation of console hardware made use of the rapid development of processing technology. Newer machines could output a greater range of colors, more [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]], and introduced graphical technologies such as [[image scaling|scaling]], and [[vector graphics]].  One way console makers marketed these advances to consumers was through the measurement of [[bit|\"bits\".]] The [[TurboGrafx-16]], Genesis, and Super NES were among the first consoles to advertise the fact that they contained 16-bit [[processors]]. This fourth generation of console hardware was often referred to as the 16-bit era and the previous generation as the 8-bit. The ''bit-value'' of a console referred to the ''[[word length]]'' of a console's processor (although the value was sometimes misused, for example, the TurboGrafx 16 had only an 8-bit [[CPU]], and the Genesis/Mega Drive had the 16/32-bit [[Motorola 68000]], but both had a 16-bit dedicated graphics processor). As the graphical performance of console hardware is dependent on many factors, using bits was a crude way to gauge a console's overall ability.  For example, the NES, Commodore 64, Apple II, and Atari 2600 all used a very similar 8-bit CPU. The difference in their processing power is due to other causes.  For example, the Commodore 64 contains 64 kilobytes of RAM and the Atari 2600 has much less at 128 bytes of RAM. The jump from 8-bit machines to 16-bit machines to 32-bit machines made a noticeable difference in performance, so consoles from certain generations are frequently referred to as 8-bit or 16-bit consoles. However, the \"bits\" in a console are no longer a major factor in their performance. The Nintendo 64, for example, has been outpaced by several 32-bit machines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.ign.com/articles/2001/12/18/interview-ibm-details-gekko-part-ii|title=Interview: IBM GEKKO (part II)|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Aside from some \"128 Bit\" advertising slogans at the beginning of the sixth generation, marketing with bits largely stopped after the fifth generation.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics|Video games}}\n* [[Console game]]\n* [[Console war]]\n* [[Dedicated console]]\n* [[Handheld game console]]\n* [[Handheld TV game]]\n* [[History of video games]]\n* [[Home video game console]]\n* [[List of video game consoles]]\n* [[Microconsole]]\n* [[Unlockable games]]\n* [[Video game clone]]\n* [[Virtual reality headset]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|author=Forster, Winnie|title=The Encyclopedia of Game Machines - Consoles, handheld & home computers 1972\u20132005|publisher=Gameplan|year=2005|isbn=978-3-00-015359-4|url=http://www.gameplan.de/gameplan_01.5_UK/index.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526032440/http://www.gameplan.de/gameplan_01.5_UK/index.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 26, 2005}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- ======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

Director Stephen Frears stated that there are a small number of scenes in the film in which Beckinsale is just off camera, as well as a scene in which he is in a car, although indistinguishable to the viewer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Lives|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gj68j|work=BBC Radio 4|date=9 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and tributes==\nThree days after Beckinsale's death, ''Going Straight'' won a [[BAFTA]] award. Ronnie Barker delivered a brief acceptance speech in tribute to his co-star.\n\nWhen Beckinsale's book of poetry, ''With Love'' was published in 1980, Judy Loe, Ronnie Barker, and Richard Briers appeared on ''The Russell Harty Show'' to talk about the book and recite some of the poetry.<ref>''The Russell Harty Show'', 28 October 1980, ''BBC''.</ref>\n\nIn 2000, 21 years after his death, a documentary was broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in tribute, called ''The Unforgettable Richard Beckinsale''. It featured interviews with his widow, the actress [[Judy Loe]], as well as his father, sister, closest school friend and two daughters. Also contributing were his co-stars, [[Ronnie Barker]] of ''Porridge'' and [[Don Warrington]] of ''Rising Damp''. Barker, remembering Beckinsale's premature death, said: \"He was so loved. He hadn't done much but he was so loved that there was a universal sort of [[grief]] that went on.\"\n\nIn the 2006 film ''[[Venus (2006 film)|Venus]]'', during a scene inside the actors' church, [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]], [[Peter O'Toole]]'s character, an aging actor, points out Beckinsale's plaque, as an example of an actor who died in his prime.<ref>{{cite web|date=5 August 2012|title=Venus if you will, send a girl for me to thrill|last=Cho|first=Seongyong|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/far-flung-correspondents/venus-if-you-will-send-a-girl-for-me-to-thrill|website=RogerEbert.com|accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, actor [[Alan Davies]] nominated Beckinsale as his chosen subject for the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[Great Lives]]''.

They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]], [[Treasurer of the Chamber|Treasurer of the King's Chamber]] and the husband of [[Bess of Hardwick]], who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county.\n\nBess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished [[needlework|needlewoman]], Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].<ref name=\"Digby\">{{Cite book |last=Digby |first=George Wingfield |date=1964 |title=Elizabethan Embroidery |publisher=Thomas Yoseloff |pages=58\u201363 |asin=B0042KP67G}}</ref> Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, [[Henry Cavendish (politician)|Henry]]. The estate was purchased from Henry by his brother [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]], for \u00a310,000.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Birdseye view of Chatsworth in 1699.jpg|thumb|This engraving by [[Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff|Kip and Knyff]] shows Chatsworth part way through the 1st Duke's alterations.

[[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]] was a staunch Royalist and expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestrated.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Cavendish, William (1617-1684)}}</ref> Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until the restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe.\n\nThe [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|4th Earl of Devonshire]], who was to become the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of [[James II of England|King James II]]. This called for a rebuilding of the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish initially planned to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments, and so he decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, though this layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large [[parterre]] gardens designed by [[George London (landscape architect)|George London]] and [[Henry Wise (gardener)|Henry Wise]], who was later appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] as Royal Gardner at [[Kensington Palace]].\n\nIn 1774, [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], married [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana Spencer]] famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. Georgiana was the great-great-great-great aunt of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.[3] The movie [[The Duchess]] portrayed their life together.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:ChatsworthMarlow.JPG|thumb|This late 18th-century oil painting by William Marlow emphasises the [[Romanticism|romantic]] aspect of Chatsworth's setting on the edge of the [[Peak District]]]]\n[[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], and [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire]], made no changes to the house and gardens, but both contributed greatly to the collection found at Chatsworth to this date. Connoisseur of the arts the collection include paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had [[Devonshire House]] in London rebuilt following a fire in 1733. Upon the sale and demolition of Devonshire House in 1924 the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth.\n\nThe 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west and had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house. He also replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.\n\nIn 1748, the 4th Duke married [[Charlotte Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Lady Charlotte Boyle]], the sole surviving heiress of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including [[Chiswick House]]. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family.\n\n===19th century===\nThe [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] (known as 'the Bachelor Duke') was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates; Chatsworth and [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, [[Burlington House]] and [[Chiswick House]] in London, [[Bolton Abbey]] and [[Londesborough Hall]] in Yorkshire, and [[Lismore Castle]] in Ireland. These estates covered {{convert|200000|acre|km2}} of land in England and Ireland.\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Dining room.jpg|thumb|left|The 6th Duke's dining room]]\nThe Duke was a great collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of [[Sir Jeffry Wyatville]], it included a purpose built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection, and he repurposed several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he would purchase at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation  by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set of bedrooms from the period to survive with their original furnishings.<ref name=\"yourguide\"/>{{rp|52}} There is much eastern influence in the decoration including hand-painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics which are typical of Regency taste, which developed during the reign of [[George IV]] (1762\u20131830). People who have stayed at Chatsworth include [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Charles Dickens]].\n\n[[File:Chatsworth from Morris's Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1880).JPG|thumb|A view of Chatsworth from the south-west circa 1880. The stables can be seen behind the house and the Hunting Tower is visible in Stand Wood]]\nIn October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the [[Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], visited Chatsworth where she had her first formal adult dinner, at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another opportunity to welcome Victoria in 1843 when the Queen and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] returned to be entertained by a large array of illuminated fountains. The Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A [[Latin]] inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates as, \"William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840\". 1688 was the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]], supported by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 saw the death of the Duke's beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]]. In 1844 he published a book called ''Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick''.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, a colour postcard sent from Liverpool to Navsari, India in 1913.jpg|thumbnail|Chatsworth, c. 1913.]]\nIn the early 20th century social change and taxes began to affect the Devonshires' lifestyle. When the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th Duke]] died in 1908 over \u00a3500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared to what followed forty-two years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke's extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke's business ventures at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the depression in British agriculture that had been apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by [[William Caxton]] and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four [[Shakespeare]] [[Folio (printing)|folios]] and 39 Shakespeare [[quarto]]s, to the [[Huntington Library]] in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in [[Somerset]], [[Sussex]] and Derbyshire were also sold during, and immediately after, World War I.\n\nIn December 1904, [[Carlos I of Portugal|King Charles I of Portugal]] and [[Am\u00e9lie of Orl\u00e9ans|Queen Maria Am\u00e9lia]] stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to [[Great Britain]]. It snowed almost constantly while they were there, and the King reportedly started a [[snowball fight]] (in which the assembled ladies enthusiastically joined) when he met the [[Lu\u00eds Pinto de Soveral, 1st Marquis of Soveral|Marquis of Soveral]], the Portuguese [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[Court of St James's]].<ref>{{Cite journal |editor-last=Chaves |editor-first=Jos\u00e9 Joubert |date=5 December 1904 |title=Viagem Real&nbsp;\u2014 Os Reis de Portugal Sob a Nevada em Chatsworth |trans-title=Royal Trip&nbsp;\u2014 The King and Queen of Portugal under the Snow in Chatsworth |url=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |language=Portuguese |journal=Illustra\u00e7\u00e3o Portugueza |location=Lisbon |accessdate=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035903/http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the family's London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on [[Piccadilly]], was sold to developers and demolished. Much of the contents of Devonshire House was moved to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] was acquired. The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it, and all the plants had died during the war when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To further reduce running costs, there was also talk of pulling down the 6th Duke's north wing, which was then regarded as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House\u2014the celebrated [[Palladian]] villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|4th Duke]] married [[Lord Burlington]]'s daughter\u2014was sold to [[Brentford]] Council in 1929.\n\nNonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a [[comptroller]] and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the country than in the cities. The staff at Chatsworth at this time consisted of a butler, under butler, groom of the chambers, valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess's maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two stillroom maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess's secretary. All of these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, upholsterer, scullery-maid, two scrubbing women, laundry porter, steam boiler man, coal man, two porter's lodge attendants, two night firemen, night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between the 80 of the 6th Duke's time and the 20 or so of the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke's handbook.\n\nMost of the UK's country houses were put to institutional use during World War II. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke]], anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by [[Rydal Penrhos|Penrhos College]], a girls' [[Public School (UK)|public school]] in [[Colwyn Bay]], Wales. The contents of the house were packed away in 11 days and, in September 1939, 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.\n\nIn May 1944 [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish|Kathleen Kennedy]], sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], married [[William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington|William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington]], the elder son of the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke of Devonshire]]. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944, and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] in 1950. He was married to [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]], one of the [[Mitford family|Mitford girls]] and sister to [[Nancy Mitford]], [[Diana Mitford]], [[Pamela Mitford]], [[Unity Mitford]] and [[Jessica Mitford]]\n\n[[File:Chatsworth Cascade.jpg|thumb|Chatsworth House viewed from the top of the Cascade]]\nThe modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had not yet moved back after the war and, although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding [[death duties]], he died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply, and tax was charged at 80% on the whole estate. The amount due was \u00a37&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|7000000|1950|r=-4}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}. Some of the family's advisors considered the situation to be irretrievable, and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] of [[Northern England]]. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family's home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family's Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school. The effect of the death duties was mitigated to some extent by the historically low value of art during the post-war years and the increase in land values, subsequent to 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and, on the face of it, the losses were considerably less than 80% in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} were retained out of {{convert|83000|acre|km2}}. The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. Nonetheless, it took 17 years to complete negotiations with the [[Inland Revenue]], interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, which was established in 1946.\n[[File:View of Chatsworth House, England.jpg|thumb|left|A modern view of the house]]\nThe 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth, and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945 the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948\u201349 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women who had been Kathleen Kennedy's cook and housemaid in London and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951, following the passing of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]].<ref name=\"NHLE1373871\" />\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] and Duchess began to think about moving into the house. The pre-war house had relied entirely on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats were created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store, and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.\n\nIn 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new charitable trust, The Chatsworth House Trust. The intention was to preserve the house and its setting for \"the benefit of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.peakdistrictonline.co.uk/the-chatsworth-house-trust-c100228.html Peak District Online] Retrieved 24 September 2014.</ref> The new trust was granted a 99-year lease; this covered the house, its principal contents, grounds, precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of {{convert|1822|acre|km2}}. To legalise the arrangement, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of \u00a31 a year. To facilitate this arrangement and establish a sufficient multimillion-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old master drawings, which had not been on regular display. The family is represented on the House Trust's Council of Management, but the majority of directors are non-family members. The duke pays a market rent for the use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is around \u00a34&nbsp;million a year.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House 6 March 2011 4.JPG|thumb|Renovation of Chatsworth House, 2011]]\nThe 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, [[Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire]]. The 11th Duke's widow, the [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]], died on 24 September 2014. Up until her death she was very active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She was responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. She also wrote seven books about different aspects of Chatsworth and its estate.\n\nA structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation to the house was required. A \u00a332 million programme of works was subsequently undertaken, including the restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-43501436 |title=Chatsworth House \u00a332m restoration unveiled |date=24 March 2018 |first= |last= |accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nChatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by [[Bess of Hardwick]] in a quadrangle layout, approximately {{convert|170|ft|m|-1}} from north to south and {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the [[great hall]] in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day.\n\nThe south and east fronts were rebuilt under the order of [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] and were completed by 1696 for [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]]. The 1st Duke's Chatsworth was a key building in the development of [[English Baroque]] architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]], \"It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.\" The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] basement. The facade is dramatic and sculptural with [[Ionic order|ionic]] pilasters and a heavy [[entablature]] and [[balustrade]]. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in that it has an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards.\n\n[[File:Chatsworth - west front from Vitruvius Britannicus.jpg|thumb|left|The West Front of Chatsworth from [[Colen Campbell]]'s ''Vitruvius Britannicus'']]The west and north fronts may have been the work of [[Thomas Archer]], possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and [[pilaster]]s to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey facades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected nine feet (3 m) further than the north end of the east front. This problem was overcome by building a slightly curved facade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main facade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century when [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], along with the architect [[Jeffry Wyatville]], built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of this wing only has two storeys, compared to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house, and is around 400 feet (120 m) long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an [[Italianate]] style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house.\n\nThe 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central and largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, and the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke's time, but is now the family's private entrance once again.\n\nThe facades to the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque facade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by [[Samuel Watson (sculptor)|Samuel Watson]], a [[Derbyshire]] craftsman who did a lot of work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood.\n\n==Interiors==\nThe 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house, and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamentals of its layout, making Chatsworth's layout unique, full of irregularities and the interiors a collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance.\n\n===State apartments===\n[[File:Chatsworth main hallway.jpg|Painted Hall with murals completed 1694 by [[Louis Laguerre]]|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth bedroom.jpg|State Bedroom completed 1694|right|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House library.JPG|thumb|Library 1694\u20131700 plaster work by Edward Goudge, ceiling paintings by James Thornhill, bookcases and fireplace by Jeffry Wyatville 1824]]\nThe 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of [[state rooms]] across the south front in anticipation of a visit by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] that never occurred. The State Apartments are accessed from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals showing scenes from the life of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Louis Laguerre]], and ascending the cantilevered Great Stairs to the [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms that would control how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen.\n\nThe Great Chamber is the largest room in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet with each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber includes a painted ceiling of a classical scene by [[Antonio Verrio]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Tomlinson|first=Lucy|title=Inside Chatsworth House|magazine=Britain Magazine|date=11 October 2012}}</ref> The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room by the 6th Duke when he brought the violin door here from Devonshire House in London.

However, sensitive to his family's heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than change the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider and shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they would have looked in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dorment|first=Richard|title=Chatsworth House: a masterpiece in every room|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===18th-century alterations===\nIn the 1760s, [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]] redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall from which guests would walk through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook's bedroom and the back stairs and into the Painted Hall. He then built an neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that were a forerunner of the 6th Duke's north wing. [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]] had some of the family's private rooms redecorated and some partition walls were moved, but there are few traces of the mid- and late 18th century in the public rooms.\n\n===19th-century alterations===\n[[File:Venus supported by Iris, complaining to Mars 1820.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] supported by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], complaining to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' by [[George Hayter]], exhibited in 1820 at the [[Royal Academy|RA]] \"to acclaim\" (in the Ceiling of the Ante Library Chatsworth House)&nbsp;\u2013 Winner of the Royal Academy Painting of the Year in 1823]]\nThe 6th Duke conducted many modernisations of Chatsworth House to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, that suited a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke's time. The corridors around the edges of the courtyard were enclosed and furnished with a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook's bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome, that were built at the northern end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along this staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke transformed the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke, into a library. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room before the 6th Duke used it to house his increasing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms in which the Duke installed a single pane window, which he believed to be the 'greatest ornament of modern decoration'.<ref name=\"yourguide\" /> The window in the Ante-Library is the only one to have been preserved. Much of the scientific library of [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun but later abandoned.<ref name=\"yourguide\">{{Cite book |title=Your Guide to Chatsworth |year=2012 |publisher=Streamline Press Ltd |isbn=978-0-9537329-1-3}}</ref>\n\nThe entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants' hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper's rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called 'California' and 'The Birds.' The main rooms in the new wing face east, and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond this is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using the marble from the 1st Duke's bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] itself, an open viewing platform below the roof.\n\n===Private rooms===\nChatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]] described the family rooms in detail in her book ''Chatsworth: The House''. She lived at [[Edensor]] until her death in 2014, and the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the northeast corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route.\n\nThe main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the southeast corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke's dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little more than a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick's house and the 1st Duke's house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the [[Great Chamber]], which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that, to his knowledge, it had never been used.\n\nThe yellow drawing room, is next to the dining room and directly underneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess has written that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, which is below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and as a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front's external staircase.\n\nThree corridors called 'the Tapestry Gallery', 'the Burlington Corridor' and 'the Book Passage' are wrapped around the south, west and north passages at this level, and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner&nbsp;\u2014 one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is the reason why sometimes they are available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes they are not. This suite of rooms now contains the 11th Duke's Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the Chapel.\n\nThe private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right, on entering, is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room; with walls of leather and a great many books this is one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke's Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, \"three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris.\" The corner room on the ground floor is the former 'little dining room'. These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors around the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor.\n\nThe other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front and can be reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route, or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now the pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and was made out of the steward's room and the linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices.\n\n==Park and landscape==\nChatsworth's garden attracts around 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of different features from six different centuries and covers {{convert|105|acre|km2}}. The garden is surrounded by a wall 1.75 miles (2.8&nbsp;km) long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent River]] and blends into the landscape of the surrounding park, which covers {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}}. The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of approximately 20 full-time gardeners. The average rainfall is around 33.7&nbsp;inches (855&nbsp;mm) a year, and there are an average of 1,160 sunshine hours a year. Most of the principal features of the garden were created in five main phases of development.\n\n===Elizabethan garden===\nThe house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the modern garden is now. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of this time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary's Bower on account of a legend that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was allowed to take the air there while she was a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date to this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later.\n\n[[File:A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, by Pieter Tillemans (1684-1734).jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, early 18th century ([[Pieter Tillemans]])]]\n\n===1st Duke's garden (1684\u20131707)===\nAt the same time as he was rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created [[baroque]] gardens. It featured numerous [[parterre]]s cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The principal surviving features from this time are:\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire.jpg|Flora's Temple|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Grand Cascade.jpg|The Cascade|right|thumb]]\n*'''The Cascade''' and '''Cascade House''' is a set of stone steps over which water flows from a set of fountains at the top. It was built in 1696 and rebuilt on a grander scale in 1701. In 1703 a grand baroque Temple or Cascade House designed by [[Thomas Archer]] was added at the top. A major restoration of both the Cascade and the Cascade House in 1994\u20131996 took 10,000 man-hours of work. In 2004 the Cascade was voted the best water feature in England by a panel of 45 garden experts organised by ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |title=Chatsworth's Cascade is the best in England |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720143459/http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}</ref> It has 24 cut steps, each slightly different and with a variety of textures so that each gives a different sound when water runs over and down them.\n*The '''Canal Pond''', dug in 1702, is a {{convert|314|yd|adj=on}}-long rectangular lake to the south of the house.\n*'''The Seahorse Fountain''' is a sculptural fountain in a circular pond on the lawn between the house and the Canal Pond. Originally, it was the centrepiece of the main parterre.\n*'''The Willow Tree Fountain''' is an imitation tree that squirts water on the unsuspecting from its branches. The writer [[Celia Fiennes]] wrote in her diary: \"There&nbsp;... in the middle of ye grove stands a fine willow tree, the leaves, barke and all looks very naturall, ye roote is full of rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a sudden by ye turning of a sluice it rains from each leafe and from the branches like a shower, it being made of brass and pipes to each leafe, but in appearance is exactly like any willow.\" The tree has been replaced twice and then restored in 1983.\n*'''The First Duke's greenhouse''' is a long, low building with ten arched windows and a temple-like centrepiece. It has been moved from its original site overlooking the 1st Duke's bowling green to the northern edge of the main lawn and is now fronted by a rose garden.\n*'''Flora's Temple''' is a classical temple built in 1695 and moved to its present site at the northern end of the broad walk in 1760. It contains a statue of the goddess [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]] by [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]].\n*'''The West Garden'''\u2014now the family's private garden with modern planting in a three-section formal structure\u2014is mainly a creation of the 1st Duke's time, but the layout is not original.\n\n===4th Duke's garden (1755\u201364)=== <!--Section linked from [[Capability Brown]]-->\nThe 4th Duke commissioned the [[landscape architect]], [[Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown]] to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were converted to lawns, but as detailed above several important features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species specially imported from [[Philadelphia]] in 1759. The main aim of this work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown's 5.5 acre (22,000 m\u00b2) Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade.\n\n===6th Duke's garden (1826\u201358)===\n[[File:The Rockeries, Chatsworth House, England (2).JPG|thumb|The Rockeries]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor Fountain]]\n[[File:Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden, England.JPG|thumb|Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden]]\nIn 1826 a 23-year-old named [[Joseph Paxton]], who had been trained at [[Kew Gardens]], was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth fifteen years earlier and had previously shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth's garden. Features that survive from that time include:\n\n*'''The Rockeries and The Strid''': in 1842 Paxton began work on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks weighing several tons one on top of another. One of them was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: \"In one place a sort of miniature [[Matterhorn]] apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass.\" It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced that it can be swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named for the Queen and Prince Albert, and another for the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke's time. The Wellington Rock, a construction of several rocks piled on top of each other, is 45 feet (14 m) high and a small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in the winter the water freezes creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called 'The Strid', which is named after a stretch of the [[River Wharfe]] on the Devonshires' [[Bolton Abbey]] estate, where the river is compressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth's Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge.\n*'''The Arboretum and Pinetum''': the 6th Duke's time was an age of plant-hunting expeditions, with major new species readily discovered by intrepid botanists, and the Duke was one of the most generous sponsors. In 1829 he took an additional eight acres (32,000 m\u00b2) of the park into the garden to create a pinetum, and in 1835 Paxton began work on an [[arboretum]], which was planned as a systematic succession of trees in accordance with botanical classification. Chatsworth has some of the oldest specimens of species such as [[Douglas fir]] and [[Giant Sequoia]] in the UK. Also in this part of the garden is the Grotto Pond, which was originally a fishpond, breeding fish for Chatsworth's table. The 6th Duke's mother had had the rustic grotto built at the end of the 18th century. The area around the pond is now planted for autumn colour.\n*'''The Azalea Dell and the Ravine''': [[Rhododendron]]s and [[Azalea]]s grow well at Chatsworth as the soil suits them, and a section of the southern end of the garden is devoted to them. This is the most rugged part of the garden with steep serpentine paths and a stream running down a small valley known as The Ravine. In 1997 a waterfall was created out of old drinking troughs gathered from fields on the estate. There is also a [[bamboo]] walk there.\n*'''The [[Emperor Fountain]]''': in 1843 Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] informed the Duke that he was likely to visit Chatsworth the following year. In anticipation of this Imperial visit, the Duke decided to construct the world's highest fountain, and set Paxton to work to build it. An eight-acre (32,000 m\u00b2) lake was dug on the moors 350 feet (110 m) above the house to supply the natural water pressure. The work was finished in just six months, continuing at night by the light of flares, and the resulting water jet is on record as reaching a height of 296 feet (90 m). However, the Tsar died in 1855 and never saw the fountain. Because of the limited supply of water the fountain usually runs on partial power and only reaches half its full height, but occasionally it is switched to maximum flow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082911/http://www.chatswortheducation.com/news/news_fountain.htm Emperor Fountain goes sky high], Chatsworth press release, 25 April 2007.</ref> The water power found a practical use generating Chatsworth's electricity from 1893 to 1936. The house was then connected to the mains, and a new turbine was installed in 1988 that produces about a third of the electricity the house needs.\n*'''The Conservative Wall''' is a set of greenhouses that run up the slope from Flora's Temple to the stables against the north wall of the garden. A tall central section is flanked by ten smaller sections. They are used to grow fruit and [[camellia]]s. Two ''[[Camellia reticulata]]'' 'Captain Rawes' planted in 1850 survive. Chatsworth's camellias have won many prizes. The name of the building has no political connotations; the Dukes of Devonshire were [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and later [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Regia LIN 1849-.jpg|thumb|left|Paxton's daughter Annie standing on a ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' leaf in the lily house]][[File:Chatsworth - Great Conservatory in the 19th century.JPG|thumb|The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] at Chatsworth. Built from 1836 to 1841 and demolished in 1920.]]\nPaxton was responsible, along with architect [[Decimus Burton]], for Chatsworth's Great Conservatory, which began construction in 1836 and was completed in 1841. It was 277 feet (84 m) long, 123 feet (37 m) wide and 61 feet (19 m) high making it the largest glass house in the world at that time and cost \u00a333,099. A carriage drive ran the length of the building between lush tropical vegetation. One W. Adam called it \"A mountain of glass&nbsp;... an unexampled structure&nbsp;... like a sea of glass when the waves are settling and smoothing down after a storm.\" The [[King of Saxony]] compared it to \"A tropical scene with a glass sky.\" The Great Conservatory was demolished after World War I as all the plants had died as it had not been heated during the war, and the cost of running became too much. Another large glasshouse at Barbrook, on the edge of the park, was devoted to cultivation of the giant Amazon water lily, ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'', which flowered in captivity there for the first time. This Lily House has also been lost.\n\n===Modern garden (1950\u2013present)===\n[[File:Chatsworth House.jpg|thumb|The South Front and the South Lawn with the Seahorse Fountain. The exterior steps are a 19th-century replacement for the original horseshoe-shaped steps.]]\nThe 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Dukes made few changes to the garden. The garden suffered during World War II, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival in its fortunes. British gardening personality [[Alan Titchmarsh]] wrote in 2003: \"Chatsworth's greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.\" Many of the historical features have been restored to an immaculate condition, and unusually for an English country house garden in modern times, numerous important new features have been added including:\n*'''The South Lawn limes''' were double rows of [[espalier|pleached]] red-twigged limes on either side of the South Lawn, which were planted in 1952 and removed in 2014.\n*'''The Serpentine Hedge''' is a wavy hedged yew corridor that leads from the Ring Pond to the bust of the 6th Duke. It was planted in 1953.\n*'''The Maze''' was planted with 1,209 yews in the centre of the site of the former Great Conservatory in 1962. Two flower gardens occupy the rest of the site.\n*'''The Display Greenhouse''' (1970) is in a modern style, but is unobtrusively sited behind the First Duke's greenhouse. It has three climate zones, tropical, Mediterranean and temperate. Public access is limited but groups may book tours and there are first-come-first-served tours on a few days each season.\n*'''The Cottage Garden''' was inspired by an exhibit at the 1988 [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. A front garden of flower beds bordered by box leads to the \"kitchen/dining\" room with furniture covered with plants. There is a bedroom in the same style on the upper level.\n*'''The Kitchen Garden''' is a productive fruit and vegetable garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s. Chatsworth's original kitchen garden covered {{convert|11.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} and was by the river in the park.\n*'''Modern sculpture''' includes various pieces, such as ''War Horse'' and ''Walking Madonna'' by Dame [[Elizabeth Frink]], and 14 bronze portrait heads by [[Angela Conner]]. \n*'''The Sensory Garden''' is fully accessible to the disabled and features many fragrant plants. It was opened in 2004 by the then [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]].\n*'''Quebec''' is a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} part of the garden to the south and west of the canal pond that was, until 2006, a neglected and dank area covered with ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]''. This is now an extension to the Arboretum walk with a path that runs along the top of the steep bank. The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood. An 18th-century cascade was uncovered during the clearance.<ref name=\"trailleaflet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.chatsworth.org/files/hidden_gems_garden_trail.pdf |title=Hidden Gems Walking Tour |publisher=Chatsworth Estate |accessdate=22 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106222219/http://www.chatsworth.org/files/hidden_gems_garden_trail.pdf |archive-date=6 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Stables===\n[[File:Stable block - Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03651.jpg|left|thumb|The stable block 1758\u201367 by James Paine]]\n\nThe stable block at Chatsworth is prominently situated on the rising ground to the north-east of the house. Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rusticated banding, a pediment containing a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags in embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a [[cupola]]. The building was designed by [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758\u201367. It is approximately {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} square and is two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners in addition to the one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses, and all necessary equine facilities including a [[blacksmith]]s shop. The first floor was occupied by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess in her book, ''Chatsworth: The House'', one room still has \"Third Postillion\" painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s.\n\nThe last horses left the stables in 1939 and the building was then used as a store and garage. The grooms' accommodation was converted into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners and their families. When the house reopened to the public after the war, \"catering\" was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled \"water for dogs\". In 1975 a tea bar was established with an investment of \u00a3120. The first attempt at a caf\u00e9 opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was not satisfactory; either to the customers or from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess's private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre B\u00e9raud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge of the catering. After a failed attempt to obtain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen's Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop and three rooms available for hire. The stables cater for thirty thousand people a month during the visitor season.\n\n===Park, woods and farmyard===\nChatsworth's park covers about {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} and is open to the public free of charge all year-round, except for the south-east section, known as the Old Park, which is not open since it is used for breeding by the herds of red and fallow deer. The attitudes of the Dukes regarding wider access rights have changed significantly over the years. Upon his death, in 2004, the [[Ramblers Association]] praised the 11th Duke for his enlightened championing of open access, as well as his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even during the 11th Duke's tenure, however, disputes arose\u2014when the definitive [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] were being compiled in the 1960s and 70s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by one of the lakes in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps.\n[[File:The Hunting Tower Chatsworth House Derbyshire England.JPG|thumb|left|The Hunting Tower c.1580]]\n[[File:Chatsworth Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 112435.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridge 1759\u201364 by James Paine]]\nFarm stock also graze in the park, many of which belong to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use the park for summer grazing. Bess of Harwick's park was entirely on the eastern side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large, flat area used for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, that is typically held towards the end of August, is now.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chatsworth Country Fair|url=http://www.chatsworthcountryfair.co.uk|work=Chatsworth Country Fair|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The bridge across the river was at the southern end of the park and it crossed to the old village of [[Edensor]], which was by the river in full sight of the house.\n\nCapability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree-flecked landscape that is admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river, and there is a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms and managed to keep weeds and scrub under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. At the same time [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] designed the new bridge to the north of the house, which was set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished, and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland, and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps so that the screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown's plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to accommodate the increasing numbers of well-to-do travellers who were coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office.\n\nIn 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s land around [[Baslow]] to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for some land elsewhere. He extended the park around half a mile (800 m) north to its present boundary. He also had the remaining cottages from the old Edensor inside the park demolished apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation in the park today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]] had [[St Peter's Church, Edensor]] enlarged by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. The church's spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park, and inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick's sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter's in Edensor is also where the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th]], [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th]], [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th]], [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire|9th]], [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th]] and [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th]] Duke of Devonshire and their wives are buried. Their remains are not entombed in a vault inside the church but lie, marked by simple headstones, in individual graves in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard.\n\nOn the hills of the eastern side of the park there is Stand Wood, where the Hunting Tower is located, that was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top of Stand Wood there is a plateau covering several square miles by lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. This area is the source of the water for all the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake feeds the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade.\n\nThe late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life, and in 1973 the Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables. The aim was to explain to those unfamiliar with rural life how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983, and a venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by television gardener [[Alan Titchmarsh]] in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks during which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Estate==\n[[File:ChatsworthWeir.jpg|thumb|Weir on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] at the Chatsworth estate]]\n\nChatsworth is the hub of a {{convert|35,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} agricultural estate. The Chatsworth estate, together with {{convert|30,000|acre|km2}} around [[Bolton Abbey]] in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in [[Eastbourne]], belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family's {{convert|8,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Lismore Castle]] estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire:\n\n*'''The Main Estate''' is a compact block of {{convert|12,310|acres|0|abbr=on}} around the house, including the park and many properties in the villages of Baslow, Pilsley, Edensor, Beeley, and Calton Lees.\n*'''The West Estate''' is {{convert|6,498|acre|km2}} of scattered high ground, mostly in the [[Peak District]] and partly in [[Staffordshire]]. [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]], from which the family takes its secondary title is nearby.\n*'''The Shottle Estate''' is {{convert|3,519|acre|km2}} in and around [[Shottle]], which is around 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) south of Chatsworth. This is low-lying land and is home to most of the dairy farms on the estate, and also has some arable farms.\n*'''The Staveley Estate''' is {{convert|3,400|acre|km2}} at [[Staveley, Derbyshire|Staveley]] near [[Chesterfield]], including a {{convert|355|acre|km2}} industrial site called Staveley Works, which is let to various tenants, some woodlands, and arable farms.\n*'''The [[Scarcliffe]] Estate''', mostly arable farms, is {{convert|9,320|acre|km2}} east of Chesterfield.\n\nThe Chatsworth Settlement has a wide range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres of the estate, mostly around Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. A number of properties may be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick's Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals.\n\nThe 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for the \"theme park\" approach to modernising a country estate, but they did throw off the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a very large enterprise in the UK, employing over a hundred people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the farm shop |url=https://www.chatsworth.org/shopping-dining/farm-shop/about-the-farm-shop/ |website=Chatsworth |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2019|reason=nothing directly supporting number-of-peaple-employed}} A 90-seat restaurant opened at the farm shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of [[Belgravia]], but it was not successful and closed down. The Settlement also runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel & Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate and owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the [[Caravan Club]], and a paddock at the southern end of the park where bucks used to be fattened for Chatsworth's table is a tenanted garden centre. In both cases the Settlement receives a percentage of turnover as rent. There is also a line of Chatsworth branded foods, endorsed with the Dowager Duchess's signature, which is available by mail order. The Dowager Duchess has also established Chatsworth Design to exploit intellectual property rights to the Devonshire collections, and a furniture company called Chatsworth Carpenters, but the latter has now been licensed to an American company.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) \u2013 The house itself is named in the novel as one of the estates [[Elizabeth Bennet]] visits before arriving at Pemberley.\n*''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) \u2013 Chatsworth House represented Castle Hackton.\n*''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' (1984) \u2013 Two rooms in Chatsworth House represented two rooms in [[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]].\n*''[[Interceptor (TV series)|Interceptor]]'' (1989) \u2013 An episode was partially filmed on the grounds as the key was hidden on the top of the Cascade waterwork.\n*''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005) \u2013 Represented [[Pemberley]], Mr [[Fitzwilliam Darcy|Darcy]]'s home in the film adaptation.\n*On 9 July 2006, the Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their tour in support of their album ''[[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]]''.\n*''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]'' (2008)\n*''[[The Wolfman (2009 film)|The Wolfman]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Rivers with Griff Rhys Jones]]'' (2009) \u2013 [[Griff Rhys Jones]] was a guest at Chatsworth while making and filming his show.\n*''[[Chatsworth (TV series)|Chatsworth]]'' (2012) \u2013 Chatsworth House was the subject of a three-part documentary on [[BBC]] television.

The seat of the [[Duke of Devonshire]], it has been home to the [[House of Cavendish|Cavendish]] family since 1549. Standing on the east bank of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]], it looks across to the low hills between the Derwent and [[River Wye, Derbyshire|Wye]] valleys. The house is set in expansive parkland and backed by wooded, rocky hills rising to heather moorland.

They enclosed the first park at Chatsworth and built a house on the high ground in what is now the south-eastern part of the garden. In 1549 they sold all their property in the area to Sir [[William Cavendish (courtier)|William Cavendish]], [[Treasurer of the Chamber|Treasurer of the King's Chamber]] and the husband of [[Bess of Hardwick]], who had persuaded him to sell his property in Suffolk and settle in her native county.\n\nBess began to build the new house in 1553. She selected a site near the river, which was drained by digging a series of reservoirs, which doubled as fish ponds. Sir William died in 1557, but Bess finished the house in the 1560s and lived there with her fourth husband, [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]]. In 1568 Shrewsbury was entrusted with the custody of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and brought his prisoner to Chatsworth several times from 1570 onwards. She lodged in the apartment now known as the Queen of Scots rooms, on the top floor above the great hall, which faces onto the inner courtyard. An accomplished [[needlework|needlewoman]], Bess joined Mary at Chatsworth for extended periods in 1569, 1570, and 1571, during which time they worked together on the [[Oxburgh Hangings]].<ref name=\"Digby\">{{Cite book |last=Digby |first=George Wingfield |date=1964 |title=Elizabethan Embroidery |publisher=Thomas Yoseloff |pages=58\u201363 |asin=B0042KP67G}}</ref> Bess died in 1608 and Chatsworth was passed to her eldest son, [[Henry Cavendish (politician)|Henry]]. The estate was purchased from Henry by his brother [[William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire]], for \u00a310,000.\n\n===17th century===\n[[File:Birdseye view of Chatsworth in 1699.jpg|thumb|This engraving by [[Jan Kip and Leonard Knyff|Kip and Knyff]] shows Chatsworth part way through the 1st Duke's alterations.

The baroque garden has been laid out, but only the first, smaller version of the Cascade has been built, and the Canal Pond has not been dug. The 1st Duke's stables are to the left of the house]]\nFew changes were made at Chatsworth until the mid-17th century. [[William Cavendish, 3rd Earl of Devonshire]] was a staunch Royalist and expelled from the House of Lords in 1642. He left England for the safety of the continent and his estates were sequestrated.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{Cite DNB |wstitle=Cavendish, William (1617-1684)}}</ref> Chatsworth was occupied by both sides during the Civil War, and the 3rd Earl did not return to the house until the restoration of the monarchy. He reconstructed the principal rooms in an attempt to make them more comfortable, but the Elizabethan house was outdated and unsafe.\n\nThe [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire|4th Earl of Devonshire]], who was to become the 1st Duke in 1694 for helping to put William of Orange on the English throne, was an advanced [[British Whig Party|Whig]] and forced to retire to Chatsworth during the reign of [[James II of England|King James II]]. This called for a rebuilding of the house, which began in 1687. Cavendish initially planned to reconstruct only the south wing with the State Apartments, and so he decided to retain the Elizabethan courtyard plan, though this layout was becoming increasingly unfashionable. He enjoyed building and reconstructed the East Front, which included the Painted Hall and Long Gallery, followed by the West Front from 1699 to 1702. The North Front was completed in 1707 just before he died. The 1st Duke also had large [[parterre]] gardens designed by [[George London (landscape architect)|George London]] and [[Henry Wise (gardener)|Henry Wise]], who was later appointed by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] as Royal Gardner at [[Kensington Palace]].\n\nIn 1774, [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]], married [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana Spencer]] famous as a socialite who gathered around her a large circle of literary and political friends. Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds would paint her; the Gainsborough painting would be disposed of by the 5th Duke and be recovered much later, after many vicissitudes. Georgiana was the great-great-great-great aunt of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. Their lives, centuries apart, have been compared in tragedy.[3] The movie [[The Dutchess]] portrayed their life together.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:ChatsworthMarlow.JPG|thumb|This late 18th-century oil painting by William Marlow emphasises the [[Romanticism|romantic]] aspect of Chatsworth's setting on the edge of the [[Peak District]]]]\n[[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire]], and [[William Cavendish, 3rd Duke of Devonshire]], made no changes to the house and gardens, but both contributed greatly to the collection found at Chatsworth to this date. Connoisseur of the arts the collection include paintings, Old Master drawings and prints, ancient coins and carved Greek and Roman sculptures. Palladian furniture designed by [[William Kent]] was commissioned by the 3rd Duke when he had [[Devonshire House]] in London rebuilt following a fire in 1733. Upon the sale and demolition of Devonshire House in 1924 the furniture was transferred to Chatsworth.\n\nThe 4th Duke made great changes to the house and gardens. He decided the approach to the house should be from the west and had the old stables and offices as well as parts of Edensor village pulled down so they were not visible from the house. He also replaced the 1st Duke's formal gardens with a more natural look, designed by Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown, which he helped bring into fashion.\n\nIn 1748, the 4th Duke married [[Charlotte Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington|Lady Charlotte Boyle]], the sole surviving heiress of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]. Lord Burlington was an accomplished architect in his own right with many works to his name including [[Chiswick House]]. With his death, his important collection of architectural drawings and Inigo Jones masque designs, Old Master paintings and William Kent designed furniture were transferred to the Dukes of Devonshire. This inheritance also brought many estates to the family.\n\n===19th century===\nThe [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] (known as 'the Bachelor Duke') was a passionate traveller, builder, gardener and collector who transformed Chatsworth. In 1811 he inherited the title and eight major estates; Chatsworth and [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire, Devonshire House, [[Burlington House]] and [[Chiswick House]] in London, [[Bolton Abbey]] and [[Londesborough Hall]] in Yorkshire, and [[Lismore Castle]] in Ireland. These estates covered {{convert|200000|acre|km2}} of land in England and Ireland.\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Dining room.jpg|thumb|left|The 6th Duke's dining room]]\nThe Duke was a great collector especially of sculpture and books. When he built the North Wing to the designs of [[Sir Jeffry Wyatville]], it included a purpose built Sculpture Gallery to house his collection, and he repurposed several rooms in the house to contain the entire libraries he would purchase at auction. The 6th Duke loved to entertain, and the early 19th century saw a rise in popularity of country house parties. In addition to a sculpture gallery, the new north wing housed an orangery, a theatre, a Turkish bath, a dairy, a vast new kitchen and numerous servants rooms. In 1830 the Duke increased the guest accommodation  by converting suites of rooms into individual guest bedrooms. People invited to stay at Chatsworth spent their days hunting, riding, reading and playing billiards. In the evening formal dinners would take place, followed by music, charades and billiards or conversation in the smoking room for the men. Women would return to their bedroom many times during the day to change their outfits. The guest bedrooms on the east front at Chatsworth are the most complete set of bedrooms from the period to survive with their original furnishings.<ref name=\"yourguide\"/>{{rp|52}} There is much eastern influence in the decoration including hand-painted Chinese wallpapers and fabrics which are typical of Regency taste, which developed during the reign of [[George IV]] (1762\u20131830). People who have stayed at Chatsworth include [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Charles Dickens]].\n\n[[File:Chatsworth from Morris's Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen (1880).JPG|thumb|A view of Chatsworth from the south-west circa 1880. The stables can be seen behind the house and the Hunting Tower is visible in Stand Wood]]\nIn October 1832, Princess Victoria (later Queen Victoria) and her mother, the [[Viktoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|Duchess of Kent]], visited Chatsworth where she had her first formal adult dinner, at the age of 13, in the new dining room. The 6th Duke had another opportunity to welcome Victoria in 1843 when the Queen and [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Prince Albert]] returned to be entertained by a large array of illuminated fountains. The Duke spent 47 years transforming the house and gardens. A [[Latin]] inscription over the fireplace in the Painted Hall translates as, \"William Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, inherited this most beautiful house from his father in the year 1811, which had been begun in the year of English liberty 1688, and completed it in the year of his bereavement 1840\". 1688 was the year of the [[Glorious Revolution]], supported by the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] dynasties including the Cavendishes. The year 1840 saw the death of the Duke's beloved niece Blanche, who was married to his heir, the future [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]]. In 1844 he published a book called ''Handbook to Chatsworth and Hardwick''.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, a colour postcard sent from Liverpool to Navsari, India in 1913.jpg|thumbnail|Chatsworth, c. 1913.]]\nIn the early 20th century social change and taxes began to affect the Devonshires' lifestyle. When the [[Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th Duke]] died in 1908 over \u00a3500,000 of death duties became due. This was a small charge compared to what followed forty-two years later, but the estate was already burdened with debt from the 6th Duke's extravagances, the failure of the 7th Duke's business ventures at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], and the depression in British agriculture that had been apparent since the 1870s. In 1912 the family sold 25 books printed by [[William Caxton]] and a collection of 1,347 volumes of plays acquired by the 6th Duke, including four [[Shakespeare]] [[Folio (printing)|folios]] and 39 Shakespeare [[quarto]]s, to the [[Huntington Library]] in California. Tens of thousands of acres of land in [[Somerset]], [[Sussex]] and Derbyshire were also sold during, and immediately after, World War I.\n\nIn December 1904, [[Carlos I of Portugal|King Charles I of Portugal]] and [[Am\u00e9lie of Orl\u00e9ans|Queen Maria Am\u00e9lia]] stayed at Chatsworth House during their visit to [[Great Britain]]. It snowed almost constantly while they were there, and the King reportedly started a [[snowball fight]] (in which the assembled ladies enthusiastically joined) when he met the [[Lu\u00eds Pinto de Soveral, 1st Marquis of Soveral|Marquis of Soveral]], the Portuguese [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] to the [[Court of St James's]].<ref>{{Cite journal |editor-last=Chaves |editor-first=Jos\u00e9 Joubert |date=5 December 1904 |title=Viagem Real&nbsp;\u2014 Os Reis de Portugal Sob a Nevada em Chatsworth |trans-title=Royal Trip&nbsp;\u2014 The King and Queen of Portugal under the Snow in Chatsworth |url=http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |language=Portuguese |journal=Illustra\u00e7\u00e3o Portugueza |location=Lisbon |accessdate=7 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035903/http://hemerotecadigital.cm-lisboa.pt/OBRAS/IlustracaoPort/1904/N57/N57_item1/P7.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1920 the family's London mansion, Devonshire House, which occupied a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} site on [[Piccadilly]], was sold to developers and demolished. Much of the contents of Devonshire House was moved to Chatsworth and a much smaller house at 2 Carlton Gardens near [[The Mall (London)|The Mall]] was acquired. The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] in the garden at Chatsworth was demolished as it needed 10 men to run it, huge quantities of coal to heat it, and all the plants had died during the war when no coal had been available for non-essential purposes. To further reduce running costs, there was also talk of pulling down the 6th Duke's north wing, which was then regarded as having no aesthetic or historical value, but nothing came of it. Chiswick House\u2014the celebrated [[Palladian]] villa in the suburbs of West London that the Devonshires inherited when the [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire|4th Duke]] married [[Lord Burlington]]'s daughter\u2014was sold to [[Brentford]] Council in 1929.\n\nNonetheless, life at Chatsworth continued much as before. The household was run by a [[comptroller]] and domestic staff were still available, although more so in the country than in the cities. The staff at Chatsworth at this time consisted of a butler, under butler, groom of the chambers, valet, three footmen, a housekeeper, the Duchess's maid, 11 housemaids, two sewing women, a cook, two kitchen maids, a vegetable maid, two or three scullery maids, two stillroom maids, a dairy maid, six laundry maids and the Duchess's secretary. All of these 38 or 39 people lived in the house. Daily staff included the odd man, upholsterer, scullery-maid, two scrubbing women, laundry porter, steam boiler man, coal man, two porter's lodge attendants, two night firemen, night porter, two window cleaners, and a team of joiners, plumbers and electricians. The Clerk of Works supervised the maintenance of the house and other properties on the estate. There were also grooms, chauffeurs and gamekeepers. The number of garden staff was somewhere between the 80 of the 6th Duke's time and the 20 or so of the early 21st century. There was also a librarian, Francis Thompson, who wrote the first book-length account of Chatsworth since the 6th Duke's handbook.\n\nMost of the UK's country houses were put to institutional use during World War II. Some of those used as barracks were badly damaged, but the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke]], anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, arranged for Chatsworth to be occupied by [[Rydal Penrhos|Penrhos College]], a girls' [[Public School (UK)|public school]] in [[Colwyn Bay]], Wales. The contents of the house were packed away in 11 days and, in September 1939, 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind some of the pictures. The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.\n\nIn May 1944 [[Kathleen Kennedy Cavendish|Kathleen Kennedy]], sister of [[John F. Kennedy]], married [[William John Robert Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington|William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington]], the elder son of the [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th Duke of Devonshire]]. However, he was killed in action in Belgium in September 1944, and Kathleen died in a plane crash in 1948. His younger brother Andrew became the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] in 1950. He was married to [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]], one of the [[Mitford family|Mitford girls]] and sister to [[Nancy Mitford]], [[Diana Mitford]], [[Pamela Mitford]], [[Unity Mitford]] and [[Jessica Mitford]]\n\n[[File:Chatsworth Cascade.jpg|thumb|Chatsworth House viewed from the top of the Cascade]]\nThe modern history of Chatsworth begins in 1950. The family had not yet moved back after the war and, although the 10th Duke had transferred his assets to his son during his lifetime in the hope of avoiding [[death duties]], he died a few weeks too early for the lifetime exemption to apply, and tax was charged at 80% on the whole estate. The amount due was \u00a37&nbsp;million (\u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|7000000|1950|r=-4}}}} as of {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}. Some of the family's advisors considered the situation to be irretrievable, and there was a proposal to transfer Chatsworth to the nation as a [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] of [[Northern England]]. Instead, the Duke decided to retain his family's home if he could. He sold tens of thousands of acres of land, transferred Hardwick Hall to the National Trust in lieu of tax, and sold some major works of art from Chatsworth. The family's Sussex house, Compton Place was lent to a school. The effect of the death duties was mitigated to some extent by the historically low value of art during the post-war years and the increase in land values, subsequent to 1950, during the post-war agricultural revival, and, on the face of it, the losses were considerably less than 80% in terms of physical assets. In Derbyshire {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} were retained out of {{convert|83000|acre|km2}}. The Bolton Abbey estate in Yorkshire and the Lismore Castle estate in Ireland remained in the family. Nonetheless, it took 17 years to complete negotiations with the [[Inland Revenue]], interest being due in the meantime. The Chatsworth Estate is now managed by the Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, which was established in 1946.\n[[File:View of Chatsworth House, England.jpg|thumb|left|A modern view of the house]]\nThe 10th Duke was pessimistic about the future of houses like Chatsworth, and made no plans to move back in after the war. After Penrhos College left in 1945 the only people who slept in the house were two housemaids, but over the winter of 1948\u201349 the house was cleaned and tidied for reopening to the public by two Hungarian women who had been Kathleen Kennedy's cook and housemaid in London and a team of their compatriots. The house was Grade I listed in 1951, following the passing of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1947]].<ref name=\"NHLE1373871\" />\n\nIn the mid-1950s, the [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th Duke]] and Duchess began to think about moving into the house. The pre-war house had relied entirely on a large staff for its comforts, and lacked modern facilities. The building was rewired, the plumbing and heating were overhauled, and six self-contained staff flats were created to replace the small staff bedrooms and communal servants' hall. Including those in the staff flats, 17 bathrooms were added to the existing handful. The 6th Duke's cavernous kitchen was abandoned and a new one was created closer to the family dining room. The family rooms were repainted, carpets were brought out of store, and curtains were repaired or replaced. The Duke and Duchess and their three children moved across the park from Edensor House in 1959.\n\nIn 1981, the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement, owners of the house, created a new charitable trust, The Chatsworth House Trust. The intention was to preserve the house and its setting for \"the benefit of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.peakdistrictonline.co.uk/the-chatsworth-house-trust-c100228.html Peak District Online] Retrieved 24 September 2014.</ref> The new trust was granted a 99-year lease; this covered the house, its principal contents, grounds, precincts and adjacent forestry, a total of {{convert|1822|acre|km2}}. To legalise the arrangement, the Chatsworth House Trust pays a token rent of \u00a31 a year. To facilitate this arrangement and establish a sufficient multimillion-pound endowment fund, the trustees sold works of art, mostly old master drawings, which had not been on regular display. The family is represented on the House Trust's Council of Management, but the majority of directors are non-family members. The duke pays a market rent for the use of his private apartments in the house. The cost of running the house and grounds is around \u00a34&nbsp;million a year.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Chatsworth House 6 March 2011 4.JPG|thumb|Renovation of Chatsworth House, 2011]]\nThe 11th Duke died in 2004 and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, [[Peregrine Cavendish, 12th Duke of Devonshire]]. The 11th Duke's widow, the [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]], died on 24 September 2014. Up until her death she was very active in promoting the estate and increasing its visitor income. She was responsible for many additions to the gardens, including the maze, the kitchen, the cottage gardens and several commissions of modern sculpture. She also wrote seven books about different aspects of Chatsworth and its estate.\n\nA structural survey in 2004 showed that major renovation to the house was required. A \u00a332 million programme of works was subsequently undertaken, including the restoration of stonework, statues, paintings, tapestries and water features. The work, the most extensive for 200 years, took ten years and was completed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-43501436 |title=Chatsworth House \u00a332m restoration unveiled |date=24 March 2018 |first= |last= |accessdate=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nChatsworth House is built on sloping ground, lower on the north and west sides than on the south and east sides. The original Tudor mansion was built in the 1560s by [[Bess of Hardwick]] in a quadrangle layout, approximately {{convert|170|ft|m|-1}} from north to south and {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} from east to west, with a large central courtyard. The main entrance was on the west front, which was embellished with four towers or turrets, and the [[great hall]] in the medieval tradition was on the east side of the courtyard, where the Painted Hall remains the focus of the house to this day.\n\nThe south and east fronts were rebuilt under the order of [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] and were completed by 1696 for [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire]]. The 1st Duke's Chatsworth was a key building in the development of [[English Baroque]] architecture. According to the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]], \"It inaugurates an artistic revolution which is the counterpart of the political revolution in which the Earl was so prominent a leader.\" The design of the south front was revolutionary for an English house, with no attics or hipped roof, but instead two main stories supported by a [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] basement. The facade is dramatic and sculptural with [[Ionic order|ionic]] pilasters and a heavy [[entablature]] and [[balustrade]]. The existing heavy and angular stone stairs from the first floor down to the garden are a 19th-century replacement of an elegant curved double staircase. The east front is the quietest of the four on the main block. Like the south front it is unusual in that it has an even number of bays and no centrepiece. The emphasis is placed on the end bays, each highlighted by double pairs of pilasters, of which the inner pairs project outwards.\n\n[[File:Chatsworth - west front from Vitruvius Britannicus.jpg|thumb|left|The West Front of Chatsworth from [[Colen Campbell]]'s ''Vitruvius Britannicus'']]The west and north fronts may have been the work of [[Thomas Archer]], possibly in collaboration with the Duke himself. The west front has nine wide bays with a central pediment supported by four columns and [[pilaster]]s to the other bays. Due to the slope of the site this front is taller than the south front. It is also large, with many other nine-bay three-storey facades little more than half as wide and tall. The west front is very lively with much carved stonework, and the window frames are highlighted with gold leaf, which catches the setting sun. The north front was the last to be built. It presented a challenge, as the north end of the west front projected nine feet (3 m) further than the north end of the east front. This problem was overcome by building a slightly curved facade to distract the eye. The attic windows on this side are the only ones visible on the exterior of the house and are set into the main facade, rather than into a visible roof. Those in the curved section were originally oval, but are now rectangular like those in the end sections. The north front was altered in the 19th century when [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], along with the architect [[Jeffry Wyatville]], built the North Wing, doubling the size of the house. Most of this wing only has two storeys, compared to the three of the main block. It is attached to the north-east corner of the house, and is around 400 feet (120 m) long. At the end of the North Wing is the North, or Belvedere, Tower. The work was carried out in an [[Italianate]] style that blends smoothly with the elaborate finish of the baroque house.\n\nThe 6th Duke built a gatehouse at this end of the house with three gates. The central and largest gate led to the North Entrance, then the main entrance to the house. This is now the entrance used by visitors. The north gate led to the service courtyard, and the matching south gate led to the original front door in the west front, which was relegated to secondary status in the Duke's time, but is now the family's private entrance once again.\n\nThe facades to the central courtyard were also rebuilt by the 1st Duke. The courtyard was larger than it is now, as there were no corridors on the western side and the northern and southern sides only had enclosed galleries on the first floor with open galleries below. In the 19th century, new accommodation was built on these three sides on all three levels. The only surviving baroque facade is that on the eastern side, where five bays of the original seven remain, and are largely as built. There are carved trophies by [[Samuel Watson (sculptor)|Samuel Watson]], a [[Derbyshire]] craftsman who did a lot of work at Chatsworth in stone, marble and wood.\n\n==Interiors==\nThe 1st and 6th Dukes both inherited an old house, and tried to adapt to the lifestyle of their time without changing the fundamentals of its layout, making Chatsworth's layout unique, full of irregularities and the interiors a collection of different styles. Many of the rooms are recognisable of one main period, but in nearly every case, they have been altered more often than might be supposed at first glance.\n\n===State apartments===\n[[File:Chatsworth main hallway.jpg|Painted Hall with murals completed 1694 by [[Louis Laguerre]]|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth bedroom.jpg|State Bedroom completed 1694|right|thumb]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House library.JPG|thumb|Library 1694\u20131700 plaster work by Edward Goudge, ceiling paintings by James Thornhill, bookcases and fireplace by Jeffry Wyatville 1824]]\nThe 1st Duke created a richly appointed Baroque suite of [[state rooms]] across the south front in anticipation of a visit by [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] that never occurred. The State Apartments are accessed from the Painted Hall, decorated with murals showing scenes from the life of [[Julius Caesar]] by [[Louis Laguerre]], and ascending the cantilevered Great Stairs to the [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms that would control how far a person could progress into the presence of the King and Queen.\n\nThe Great Chamber is the largest room in the State Apartments, followed by the State Drawing Room, the Second Withdrawing Room, the State Bedroom and finally the State Closet with each room being more private and ornate than the last. The Great Chamber includes a painted ceiling of a classical scene by [[Antonio Verrio]].<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Tomlinson|first=Lucy|title=Inside Chatsworth House|magazine=Britain Magazine|date=11 October 2012}}</ref> The Second Withdrawing Room was renamed the State Music Room by the 6th Duke when he brought the violin door here from Devonshire House in London. The door features a very convincing [[trompe l'oeil]] of a violin and bow \"hanging\" on a silver knob, painted around 1723 by [[Jan van der Vaart (painter)|Jan van der Vaart]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.touruk.co.uk/houses/housederby_chatsworth.htm#text|title=Chatsworth House|last=Anon|work=tour K|publisher=Just Tour Ltd|accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/learning/photolibrary_images.htm |title=Chatsworth&nbsp;\u2013 photo library |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705013815/http://www.chatsworth.org/learning/photolibrary_images.htm |archivedate=5 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAround the time [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] decided that [[Hampton Court]], with its state apartments in the same style, was uninhabitable, the 6th Duke wrote that he was tempted to demolish the State Apartments to make way for new bedrooms. However, sensitive to his family's heritage, he left the rooms largely untouched, making additions rather than change the existing spaces of the house. Changes to the main baroque interiors were restricted to details such as stamped leather hangings on the walls of the State Music Room and State Bedroom, and a wider and shallower, but less elegant staircase in the Painted Hall, which was itself later replaced. The contents of the State Apartments were rearranged in 2010 to reflect the way they would have looked in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dorment|first=Richard|title=Chatsworth House: a masterpiece in every room|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===18th-century alterations===\nIn the 1760s, [[William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire]] redirected the approach to Chatsworth. He converted the kitchen in the centre of the north front into an entrance hall from which guests would walk through an open colonnade in the courtyard, through a passage past the cook's bedroom and the back stairs and into the Painted Hall. He then built an neoclassical service wing for his kitchens that were a forerunner of the 6th Duke's north wing. [[William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire]] had some of the family's private rooms redecorated and some partition walls were moved, but there are few traces of the mid- and late 18th century in the public rooms.\n\n===19th-century alterations===\n[[File:Venus supported by Iris, complaining to Mars 1820.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] supported by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], complaining to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]'' by [[George Hayter]], exhibited in 1820 at the [[Royal Academy|RA]] \"to acclaim\" (in the Ceiling of the Ante Library Chatsworth House)&nbsp;\u2013 Winner of the Royal Academy Painting of the Year in 1823]]\nThe 6th Duke conducted many modernisations of Chatsworth House to meet 19th-century standards of comfort, that suited a less formal lifestyle than that of the 1st Duke's time. The corridors around the edges of the courtyard were enclosed and furnished with a multicoloured marble floor, so that rooms could be easily reached from indoors, and more shared living rooms to replace individual guest apartments. The cook's bedroom and the back stairs made way for the Oak Stairs, topped by a glass dome, that were built at the northern end of the Painted Hall to improve internal communications. Along this staircase hang portraits of the first 11 Dukes and some of their family members. The Duke transformed the long gallery, originally created by the 1st Duke, into a library. He was a great lover of books and purchased entire libraries. The Ante-Library in the adjoining room was originally used by the 1st Duke as a dining room and then a billiard room before the 6th Duke used it to house his increasing collection of books. This was just one of the rooms in which the Duke installed a single pane window, which he believed to be the 'greatest ornament of modern decoration'.<ref name=\"yourguide\" /> The window in the Ante-Library is the only one to have been preserved. Much of the scientific library of [[Henry Cavendish]] (1731\u20131810) is in this room. The most notable addition by the 6th Duke to Chatsworth was the Wyatville designed North Wing. Plans for a symmetrical wing to the south were begun but later abandoned.<ref name=\"yourguide\">{{Cite book |title=Your Guide to Chatsworth |year=2012 |publisher=Streamline Press Ltd |isbn=978-0-9537329-1-3}}</ref>\n\nThe entire ground floor of the North Wing was occupied by service rooms, including a kitchen, servants' hall, laundry, butler and housekeeper's rooms. On the first floor, facing west, were two sets of bachelor bedrooms called 'California' and 'The Birds.' The main rooms in the new wing face east, and were accessed from the main house through a small library called the Dome Room. The first room beyond this is a dining room, with a music gallery in the serving lobby where the musicians played. Next is the sculpture gallery, the largest room in the house, and then the orangery. The Belvedere Tower contains a plunge bath, using the marble from the 1st Duke's bathroom, and a ballroom that was later turned into a theatre by the 8th Duke. Above the theatre is the [[Belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] itself, an open viewing platform below the roof.\n\n===Private rooms===\nChatsworth has 126 rooms, with nearly 100 of them closed to visitors. The house is well adapted to allow the family to live privately in their apartments while the house is open to the public. [[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire]] described the family rooms in detail in her book ''Chatsworth: The House''. She lived at [[Edensor]] until her death in 2014, and the present (12th) Duke and Duchess live at Chatsworth. The family occupies rooms on the ground and first floors of the south front, all three floors of the west front, and the upper two floors of the north front. Staircases in the northeast corner of the main block and in a turret in the east front enable them to move about without crossing the public route.\n\nThe main family living rooms are on the first floor of the south front. The family dining room is in the southeast corner and has the same dimensions as the State Dining Room directly above. This has been the usual location of the family dining room; the Bachelor Duke's dining room in the north wing took over that role for an interlude of little more than a hundred years. Both Bess of Hardwick's house and the 1st Duke's house had a hierarchy of three dining rooms in this corner, each taller and more lavishly decorated than the one below. A common parlour on the ground floor was used by the gentlemen of the household, and later for informal family meals. Above it was the main family dining room, and at the top the [[Great Chamber]], which was reserved for royalty, although the 6th Duke wrote that, to his knowledge, it had never been used.\n\nThe yellow drawing room, is next to the dining room and directly underneath the State Drawing Room. The Dowager Duchess has written that the house is so solidly built that the crowds passing above are imperceptible. The trio of reception rooms here is completed by the blue drawing room, which is below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and as a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of the house. Both drawing rooms have access to the garden through the South Front's external staircase.\n\nThree corridors called 'the Tapestry Gallery', 'the Burlington Corridor' and 'the Book Passage' are wrapped around the south, west and north passages at this level, and give access to family bedrooms. There is a sitting room in the north-west corner&nbsp;\u2014 one of the few rooms in the house with outside views in two directions. There are more family bedrooms on the second floor facing west and north. The Scots and Leicester bedrooms in the east wing are still used when there is a large house party, which is the reason why sometimes they are available as a separately charged optional extra in the tour of the house and sometimes they are not. This suite of rooms now contains the 11th Duke's Exhibition. Visitors bypass the first floor on their way down the West Stairs from the state rooms to the Chapel.\n\nThe private north stairs lead down to more private rooms on the ground floor of the West Front. In the centre is the West Entrance Hall, which is, once again, the family entrance. To the right, on entering, is a passage room known as the mineral room, which leads through to a study. To the left there is the Leather Room; with walls of leather and a great many books this is one of at least six libraries in the house. The next room is the Duke's Study, which has two windows, many more books and floral decoration painted for the Bachelor Duke by, in his own words, \"three bearded artists in blouses imported from Paris.\" The corner room on the ground floor is the former 'little dining room'. These rooms are all very high, as the ground level in the west wing is lower than that of the Painted Hall and the ground floor corridors around the courtyard. Steps from the West Entrance Hall lead up to the west corridor.\n\nThe other family living rooms are in the eastern half of the ground floor of the South Front and can be reached through the Chapel Corridor on the public route, or the turret staircase from the dining room. The room in the south-east corner was once the Ducal bathroom, until the Bachelor Duke built his new plunge bath in the North Wing, and is now the pantry where the family china is kept. This connects to the modern kitchen, which is under the library and was made out of the steward's room and the linen room. Next to the pantry in the south front are offices.\n\n==Park and landscape==\nChatsworth's garden attracts around 300,000 visitors a year. It has a complex blend of different features from six different centuries and covers {{convert|105|acre|km2}}. The garden is surrounded by a wall 1.75 miles (2.8&nbsp;km) long. It sits on the eastern side of the valley of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent River]] and blends into the landscape of the surrounding park, which covers {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}}. The woods on the moors to the east of the valley form a backdrop to the garden. There is a staff of approximately 20 full-time gardeners. The average rainfall is around 33.7&nbsp;inches (855&nbsp;mm) a year, and there are an average of 1,160 sunshine hours a year. Most of the principal features of the garden were created in five main phases of development.\n\n===Elizabethan garden===\nThe house and garden were first constructed by Sir William Cavendish and Bess of Hardwick in 1555. The Elizabethan garden was much smaller than the modern garden is now. There were terraces to the east of the house where the main lawn is now, ponds and fountains to the south, and fishponds to the west by the river. The main visual remnant of this time is a squat stone tower known as Queen Mary's Bower on account of a legend that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was allowed to take the air there while she was a prisoner at Chatsworth. The bower is now outside the garden wall in the park. Some of the retaining walls of the West Garden also date to this era, but they were reconstructed and extended later.\n\n[[File:A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, by Pieter Tillemans (1684-1734).jpg|thumb|800px|center|A panoramic view of Chatsworth House and Park, early 18th century ([[Pieter Tillemans]])]]\n\n===1st Duke's garden (1684\u20131707)===\nAt the same time as he was rebuilding the house, the 1st Duke also created [[baroque]] gardens. It featured numerous [[parterre]]s cut into the slopes above the house, and many fountains, garden buildings and classical sculptures. The principal surviving features from this time are:\n[[File:Chatsworth House, Derbyshire.jpg|Flora's Temple|left|thumb]]\n[[File:Grand Cascade.jpg|The Cascade|right|thumb]]\n*'''The Cascade''' and '''Cascade House''' is a set of stone steps over which water flows from a set of fountains at the top. It was built in 1696 and rebuilt on a grander scale in 1701. In 1703 a grand baroque Temple or Cascade House designed by [[Thomas Archer]] was added at the top. A major restoration of both the Cascade and the Cascade House in 1994\u20131996 took 10,000 man-hours of work. In 2004 the Cascade was voted the best water feature in England by a panel of 45 garden experts organised by ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |title=Chatsworth's Cascade is the best in England |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=28 September 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720143459/http://www.chatsworth.org/news/news_cascade.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 }}</ref> It has 24 cut steps, each slightly different and with a variety of textures so that each gives a different sound when water runs over and down them.\n*The '''Canal Pond''', dug in 1702, is a {{convert|314|yd|adj=on}}-long rectangular lake to the south of the house.\n*'''The Seahorse Fountain''' is a sculptural fountain in a circular pond on the lawn between the house and the Canal Pond. Originally, it was the centrepiece of the main parterre.\n*'''The Willow Tree Fountain''' is an imitation tree that squirts water on the unsuspecting from its branches. The writer [[Celia Fiennes]] wrote in her diary: \"There&nbsp;... in the middle of ye grove stands a fine willow tree, the leaves, barke and all looks very naturall, ye roote is full of rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a sudden by ye turning of a sluice it rains from each leafe and from the branches like a shower, it being made of brass and pipes to each leafe, but in appearance is exactly like any willow.\" The tree has been replaced twice and then restored in 1983.\n*'''The First Duke's greenhouse''' is a long, low building with ten arched windows and a temple-like centrepiece. It has been moved from its original site overlooking the 1st Duke's bowling green to the northern edge of the main lawn and is now fronted by a rose garden.\n*'''Flora's Temple''' is a classical temple built in 1695 and moved to its present site at the northern end of the broad walk in 1760. It contains a statue of the goddess [[Flora (goddess)|Flora]] by [[Caius Gabriel Cibber]].\n*'''The West Garden'''\u2014now the family's private garden with modern planting in a three-section formal structure\u2014is mainly a creation of the 1st Duke's time, but the layout is not original.\n\n===4th Duke's garden (1755\u201364)=== <!--Section linked from [[Capability Brown]]-->\nThe 4th Duke commissioned the [[landscape architect]], [[Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown]] to transform the garden in the fashionable naturalistic landscape style of the day. Most of the ponds and parterres were converted to lawns, but as detailed above several important features were spared. Many trees were planted, including various American species specially imported from [[Philadelphia]] in 1759. The main aim of this work was to improve integration of the garden and park. Brown's 5.5 acre (22,000 m\u00b2) Salisbury Lawns still form the setting of the Cascade.\n\n===6th Duke's garden (1826\u201358)===\n[[File:The Rockeries, Chatsworth House, England (2).JPG|thumb|The Rockeries]]\n[[File:Chatsworth House Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|The Emperor Fountain]]\n[[File:Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden, England.JPG|thumb|Neoclassical sculpture, Chatsworth House garden]]\nIn 1826 a 23-year-old named [[Joseph Paxton]], who had been trained at [[Kew Gardens]], was appointed head gardener at Chatsworth. The 6th Duke had inherited Chatsworth fifteen years earlier and had previously shown little interest in improving the neglected garden, but he soon formed a productive and extravagantly funded partnership with Paxton, who proved to be the most innovative garden designer of his era, and remains the greatest single influence on Chatsworth's garden. Features that survive from that time include:\n\n*'''The Rockeries and The Strid''': in 1842 Paxton began work on a rockery of a gargantuan scale, piling rocks weighing several tons one on top of another. One of them was described thus by Lord Desart in the 1860s: \"In one place a sort of miniature [[Matterhorn]] apparently blocked the path but with the touch of the finger it revolved on a metal axis and made a way to pass.\" It is now locked in place to comply with health and safety regulations. Another rock is so balanced that it can be swayed with little pressure. Two rocks are named for the Queen and Prince Albert, and another for the Duke of Wellington, all of whom visited Chatsworth in the 6th Duke's time. The Wellington Rock, a construction of several rocks piled on top of each other, is 45 feet (14 m) high and a small waterfall drips over it into a pond. Sometimes in the winter the water freezes creating icicles. The water flows into a pond created by Paxton called 'The Strid', which is named after a stretch of the [[River Wharfe]] on the Devonshires' [[Bolton Abbey]] estate, where the river is compressed into a turbulent chasm just a yard wide. Chatsworth's Strid is a placid stretch of water fringed with rocks and luxuriant vegetation and crossed by a rustic bridge.\n*'''The Arboretum and Pinetum''': the 6th Duke's time was an age of plant-hunting expeditions, with major new species readily discovered by intrepid botanists, and the Duke was one of the most generous sponsors. In 1829 he took an additional eight acres (32,000 m\u00b2) of the park into the garden to create a pinetum, and in 1835 Paxton began work on an [[arboretum]], which was planned as a systematic succession of trees in accordance with botanical classification. Chatsworth has some of the oldest specimens of species such as [[Douglas fir]] and [[Giant Sequoia]] in the UK. Also in this part of the garden is the Grotto Pond, which was originally a fishpond, breeding fish for Chatsworth's table. The 6th Duke's mother had had the rustic grotto built at the end of the 18th century. The area around the pond is now planted for autumn colour.\n*'''The Azalea Dell and the Ravine''': [[Rhododendron]]s and [[Azalea]]s grow well at Chatsworth as the soil suits them, and a section of the southern end of the garden is devoted to them. This is the most rugged part of the garden with steep serpentine paths and a stream running down a small valley known as The Ravine. In 1997 a waterfall was created out of old drinking troughs gathered from fields on the estate. There is also a [[bamboo]] walk there.\n*'''The [[Emperor Fountain]]''': in 1843 Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] informed the Duke that he was likely to visit Chatsworth the following year. In anticipation of this Imperial visit, the Duke decided to construct the world's highest fountain, and set Paxton to work to build it. An eight-acre (32,000 m\u00b2) lake was dug on the moors 350 feet (110 m) above the house to supply the natural water pressure. The work was finished in just six months, continuing at night by the light of flares, and the resulting water jet is on record as reaching a height of 296 feet (90 m). However, the Tsar died in 1855 and never saw the fountain. Because of the limited supply of water the fountain usually runs on partial power and only reaches half its full height, but occasionally it is switched to maximum flow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080204082911/http://www.chatswortheducation.com/news/news_fountain.htm Emperor Fountain goes sky high], Chatsworth press release, 25 April 2007.</ref> The water power found a practical use generating Chatsworth's electricity from 1893 to 1936. The house was then connected to the mains, and a new turbine was installed in 1988 that produces about a third of the electricity the house needs.\n*'''The Conservative Wall''' is a set of greenhouses that run up the slope from Flora's Temple to the stables against the north wall of the garden. A tall central section is flanked by ten smaller sections. They are used to grow fruit and [[camellia]]s. Two ''[[Camellia reticulata]]'' 'Captain Rawes' planted in 1850 survive. Chatsworth's camellias have won many prizes. The name of the building has no political connotations; the Dukes of Devonshire were [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and later [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Regia LIN 1849-.jpg|thumb|left|Paxton's daughter Annie standing on a ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'' leaf in the lily house]][[File:Chatsworth - Great Conservatory in the 19th century.JPG|thumb|The Great [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]] at Chatsworth. Built from 1836 to 1841 and demolished in 1920.]]\nPaxton was responsible, along with architect [[Decimus Burton]], for Chatsworth's Great Conservatory, which began construction in 1836 and was completed in 1841. It was 277 feet (84 m) long, 123 feet (37 m) wide and 61 feet (19 m) high making it the largest glass house in the world at that time and cost \u00a333,099. A carriage drive ran the length of the building between lush tropical vegetation. One W. Adam called it \"A mountain of glass&nbsp;... an unexampled structure&nbsp;... like a sea of glass when the waves are settling and smoothing down after a storm.\" The [[King of Saxony]] compared it to \"A tropical scene with a glass sky.\" The Great Conservatory was demolished after World War I as all the plants had died as it had not been heated during the war, and the cost of running became too much. Another large glasshouse at Barbrook, on the edge of the park, was devoted to cultivation of the giant Amazon water lily, ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'', which flowered in captivity there for the first time. This Lily House has also been lost.\n\n===Modern garden (1950\u2013present)===\n[[File:Chatsworth House.jpg|thumb|The South Front and the South Lawn with the Seahorse Fountain. The exterior steps are a 19th-century replacement for the original horseshoe-shaped steps.]]\nThe 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Dukes made few changes to the garden. The garden suffered during World War II, but the 11th Duke and his wife were keen gardeners and oversaw a revival in its fortunes. British gardening personality [[Alan Titchmarsh]] wrote in 2003: \"Chatsworth's greatest strength is that its owners have refused to let the garden rest on its Victorian laurels. It continues to grow and develop, and that is what makes it one of the best and most vibrant gardens in Britain.\" Many of the historical features have been restored to an immaculate condition, and unusually for an English country house garden in modern times, numerous important new features have been added including:\n*'''The South Lawn limes''' were double rows of [[espalier|pleached]] red-twigged limes on either side of the South Lawn, which were planted in 1952 and removed in 2014.\n*'''The Serpentine Hedge''' is a wavy hedged yew corridor that leads from the Ring Pond to the bust of the 6th Duke. It was planted in 1953.\n*'''The Maze''' was planted with 1,209 yews in the centre of the site of the former Great Conservatory in 1962. Two flower gardens occupy the rest of the site.\n*'''The Display Greenhouse''' (1970) is in a modern style, but is unobtrusively sited behind the First Duke's greenhouse. It has three climate zones, tropical, Mediterranean and temperate. Public access is limited but groups may book tours and there are first-come-first-served tours on a few days each season.\n*'''The Cottage Garden''' was inspired by an exhibit at the 1988 [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. A front garden of flower beds bordered by box leads to the \"kitchen/dining\" room with furniture covered with plants. There is a bedroom in the same style on the upper level.\n*'''The Kitchen Garden''' is a productive fruit and vegetable garden with decorative features. It was created behind the stables in the early 1990s. Chatsworth's original kitchen garden covered {{convert|11.5|acres|0|abbr=on}} and was by the river in the park.\n*'''Modern sculpture''' includes various pieces, such as ''War Horse'' and ''Walking Madonna'' by Dame [[Elizabeth Frink]], and 14 bronze portrait heads by [[Angela Conner]]. \n*'''The Sensory Garden''' is fully accessible to the disabled and features many fragrant plants. It was opened in 2004 by the then [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]].\n*'''Quebec''' is a {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} part of the garden to the south and west of the canal pond that was, until 2006, a neglected and dank area covered with ''[[Rhododendron ponticum]]''. This is now an extension to the Arboretum walk with a path that runs along the top of the steep bank. The new walk gives views out into the south park, across the River Derwent and up the hill towards New Piece wood. An 18th-century cascade was uncovered during the clearance.<ref name=\"trailleaflet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.chatsworth.org/files/hidden_gems_garden_trail.pdf |title=Hidden Gems Walking Tour |publisher=Chatsworth Estate |accessdate=22 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106222219/http://www.chatsworth.org/files/hidden_gems_garden_trail.pdf |archive-date=6 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Stables===\n[[File:Stable block - Chatsworth House - Derbyshire, England - DSC03651.jpg|left|thumb|The stable block 1758\u201367 by James Paine]]\n\nThe stable block at Chatsworth is prominently situated on the rising ground to the north-east of the house. Its entrance gate features four Doric columns with rusticated banding, a pediment containing a huge carving of the family coat of arms, two life-size stags in embellished with real antlers, and a clock tower topped by a [[cupola]]. The building was designed by [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] for the 4th Duke and was built in 1758\u201367. It is approximately {{convert|190|ft|m|-1}} square and is two storeys tall. There are low towers in the corners in addition to the one over the entrance gate. The stables originally had stalls for 80 horses, and all necessary equine facilities including a [[blacksmith]]s shop. The first floor was occupied by granaries and accommodation for the many stable staff. According to the Dowager Duchess in her book, ''Chatsworth: The House'', one room still has \"Third Postillion\" painted on the door. The 6th Duke added a carriage house behind the stables in the 1830s.\n\nThe last horses left the stables in 1939 and the building was then used as a store and garage. The grooms' accommodation was converted into flats for Chatsworth employees and pensioners and their families. When the house reopened to the public after the war, \"catering\" was limited to an outdoor tap, which has since been relabelled \"water for dogs\". In 1975 a tea bar was established with an investment of \u00a3120. The first attempt at a caf\u00e9 opened in 1979. It seated 90 in some old horse stalls in the stables and was not satisfactory; either to the customers or from a commercial point of view. In 1987 the Duke and Duchess's private chef, a Frenchman named Jean-Pierre B\u00e9raud who was also a leading light in the success of the Chatsworth Farm Shop and Chatsworth Foods, took charge of the catering. After a failed attempt to obtain planning permission for a new building incorporating the old ice house in the park, a 250-seat restaurant was created in the carriage house. The 19th-century coach used by the Dowager Duchess and the late Duke at the Queen's Coronation is on display there. Other facilities include The Cavendish Rooms, which also serves refreshments, a shop and three rooms available for hire. The stables cater for thirty thousand people a month during the visitor season.\n\n===Park, woods and farmyard===\nChatsworth's park covers about {{convert|1,000|acre|km2}} and is open to the public free of charge all year-round, except for the south-east section, known as the Old Park, which is not open since it is used for breeding by the herds of red and fallow deer. The attitudes of the Dukes regarding wider access rights have changed significantly over the years. Upon his death, in 2004, the [[Ramblers Association]] praised the 11th Duke for his enlightened championing of open access, as well as his apologies for the attitude of the 10th Duke, who had restricted access to much estate land. Even during the 11th Duke's tenure, however, disputes arose\u2014when the definitive [[Rights of way in England and Wales|rights of way]] were being compiled in the 1960s and 70s, the footpath to the Swiss Cottage (an isolated house by one of the lakes in the woods) was contested, and the matter went to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], making Derbyshire one of the last counties to settle its definitive maps.\n[[File:The Hunting Tower Chatsworth House Derbyshire England.JPG|thumb|left|The Hunting Tower c.1580]]\n[[File:Chatsworth Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 112435.jpg|thumb|right|The Bridge 1759\u201364 by James Paine]]\nFarm stock also graze in the park, many of which belong to tenant farmers or smallholders, who use the park for summer grazing. Bess of Harwick's park was entirely on the eastern side of the river and only extended as far south as the Emperor Fountain and as far north as the cricket ground. Seven fish ponds were dug to the north-west of the house, where the large, flat area used for events such as the annual Chatsworth Horse Trials and the Country Fair, that is typically held towards the end of August, is now.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chatsworth Country Fair|url=http://www.chatsworthcountryfair.co.uk|work=Chatsworth Country Fair|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> The bridge across the river was at the southern end of the park and it crossed to the old village of [[Edensor]], which was by the river in full sight of the house.\n\nCapability Brown did at least as much work in the park as he did in the garden. The open, tree-flecked landscape that is admired today is man-made. Brown straightened the river, and there is a network of drainage channels under the grass. The park is fertilised with manure from the estates farms and managed to keep weeds and scrub under control. Brown filled in most of the fishponds and extended the park to the west of the river. At the same time [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]] designed the new bridge to the north of the house, which was set at an angle of 40 degrees to command the best view of the West Front of the house. Most of the houses in Edensor were demolished, and the village was rebuilt out of sight of the house. The hedges between the fields on the west bank of the river were grubbed up to create open parkland, and woods were planted on the horizon. These were arranged in triangular clumps so that the screen of trees could be maintained when each planting had to be felled. Brown's plantings reached their peak in the mid-20th century and are gradually being replaced. The 5th Duke had an elegant red-brick inn built at Edensor to accommodate the increasing numbers of well-to-do travellers who were coming to see Chatsworth. It is now the estate office.\n\nIn 1823 the Bachelor Duke acquired the [[Duke of Rutland]]'s land around [[Baslow]] to the north of Chatsworth in exchange for some land elsewhere. He extended the park around half a mile (800 m) north to its present boundary. He also had the remaining cottages from the old Edensor inside the park demolished apart from the home of one old man who did not wish to move, which still stands in isolation in the park today. The houses in Edensor were rebuilt in picturesque pattern-book styles. In the 1860s the [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th Duke]] had [[St Peter's Church, Edensor]] enlarged by Sir [[George Gilbert Scott]]. The church's spire embellishes the views from the house, garden and park, and inside there is a remarkable monument to Bess of Hardwick's sons Henry Cavendish and William, 1st Earl of Devonshire. St Peter's in Edensor is also where the [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th]], [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire|7th]], [[Spencer Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire|8th]], [[Victor Cavendish, 9th Duke of Devonshire|9th]], [[Edward Cavendish, 10th Duke of Devonshire|10th]] and [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|11th]] Duke of Devonshire and their wives are buried. Their remains are not entombed in a vault inside the church but lie, marked by simple headstones, in individual graves in the Cavendish family plot overlooking the churchyard.\n\nOn the hills of the eastern side of the park there is Stand Wood, where the Hunting Tower is located, that was built in 1582 by Bess of Hardwick. At the top of Stand Wood there is a plateau covering several square miles by lakes, woods and moorland. There are public paths through the area and Chatsworth offers guided tours with commentary in a 28-seater trailer pulled by a tractor. This area is the source of the water for all the gravity-fed waterworks in the garden. The Swiss Lake feeds the Cascade and the Emperor Lake feeds the Emperor Fountain. The Bachelor Duke had an aqueduct built, over which water tumbles on its way to the cascade.\n\nThe late Deborah, Dowager Duchess of Devonshire, was a keen advocate of rural life, and in 1973 the Chatsworth Farmyard exhibit was opened in the old building yard above the stables. The aim was to explain to those unfamiliar with rural life how food was produced. There are milking demonstrations and displays of rare breeds. An adventure playground was added in 1983, and a venue for talks and exhibitions called Oak Barn was opened by television gardener [[Alan Titchmarsh]] in 2005. Chatsworth also runs two annual rural-skills weeks during which demonstrations of agricultural and forestry are given to groups of schoolchildren on the estate farms and woods.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Estate==\n[[File:ChatsworthWeir.jpg|thumb|Weir on the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] at the Chatsworth estate]]\n\nChatsworth is the hub of a {{convert|35,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} agricultural estate. The Chatsworth estate, together with {{convert|30,000|acre|km2}} around [[Bolton Abbey]] in Yorkshire (mostly moorland) and some land in [[Eastbourne]], belongs to The Trustees of Chatsworth Settlement, a family trust established in 1946. The Duke and other members of the family are entitled to the income. The family's {{convert|8,000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Lismore Castle]] estate in Ireland is held in a separate trust. The estate includes dozens of tenanted farms and over 450 houses and flats. There are five sub-estates scattered across Derbyshire:\n\n*'''The Main Estate''' is a compact block of {{convert|12,310|acres|0|abbr=on}} around the house, including the park and many properties in the villages of Baslow, Pilsley, Edensor, Beeley, and Calton Lees.\n*'''The West Estate''' is {{convert|6,498|acre|km2}} of scattered high ground, mostly in the [[Peak District]] and partly in [[Staffordshire]]. [[Hartington, Derbyshire|Hartington]], from which the family takes its secondary title is nearby.\n*'''The Shottle Estate''' is {{convert|3,519|acre|km2}} in and around [[Shottle]], which is around 15 miles (24&nbsp;km) south of Chatsworth. This is low-lying land and is home to most of the dairy farms on the estate, and also has some arable farms.\n*'''The Staveley Estate''' is {{convert|3,400|acre|km2}} at [[Staveley, Derbyshire|Staveley]] near [[Chesterfield]], including a {{convert|355|acre|km2}} industrial site called Staveley Works, which is let to various tenants, some woodlands, and arable farms.\n*'''The [[Scarcliffe]] Estate''', mostly arable farms, is {{convert|9,320|acre|km2}} east of Chesterfield.\n\nThe Chatsworth Settlement has a wide range of sources of income in addition to agricultural rents. Several thousand acres of the estate, mostly around Chatsworth and on the Staveley estate, are farmed in hand. A number of properties may be rented as holiday cottages, including Bess of Hardwick's Hunting Tower in the park. Several quarries produce limestone and other minerals.\n\nThe 11th Duke and Duchess did not opt for the \"theme park\" approach to modernising a country estate, but they did throw off the traditional aristocratic reluctance to participate in commerce. The Chatsworth Farm Shop is a very large enterprise in the UK, employing over a hundred people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About the farm shop |url=https://www.chatsworth.org/shopping-dining/farm-shop/about-the-farm-shop/ |website=Chatsworth |access-date=9 June 2019}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2019|reason=nothing directly supporting number-of-peaple-employed}} A 90-seat restaurant opened at the farm shop in 2005. From 1999 to 2003 there was also a shop in the exclusive London district of [[Belgravia]], but it was not successful and closed down. The Settlement also runs the four shops and the catering operations at Chatsworth, paying a percentage of turnover to the charitable Chatsworth House Trust in lieu of rent. It also runs the Devonshire Arms Hotel and the Devonshire Fell Hotel & Bistro on the Bolton Abbey estate and owns the Cavendish Hotel at Baslow on the edge of Chatsworth Park, which is let to a tenant. The old kitchen garden at Barbrook on the edge of the park is let to the [[Caravan Club]], and a paddock at the southern end of the park where bucks used to be fattened for Chatsworth's table is a tenanted garden centre. In both cases the Settlement receives a percentage of turnover as rent. There is also a line of Chatsworth branded foods, endorsed with the Dowager Duchess's signature, which is available by mail order. The Dowager Duchess has also established Chatsworth Design to exploit intellectual property rights to the Devonshire collections, and a furniture company called Chatsworth Carpenters, but the latter has now been licensed to an American company.\n\n==In popular culture==\n*''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1813) \u2013 The house itself is named in the novel as one of the estates [[Elizabeth Bennet]] visits before arriving at Pemberley.\n*''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) \u2013 Chatsworth House represented Castle Hackton.\n*''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' (1984) \u2013 Two rooms in Chatsworth House represented two rooms in [[Admiralty House, London|Admiralty House]].\n*''[[Interceptor (TV series)|Interceptor]]'' (1989) \u2013 An episode was partially filmed on the grounds as the key was hidden on the top of the Cascade waterwork.\n*''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]]'' (2005) \u2013 Represented [[Pemberley]], Mr [[Fitzwilliam Darcy|Darcy]]'s home in the film adaptation.\n*On 9 July 2006, the Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their tour in support of their album ''[[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]]''.\n*''[[The Duchess (film)|The Duchess]]'' (2008)\n*''[[The Wolfman (2009 film)|The Wolfman]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Rivers with Griff Rhys Jones]]'' (2009) \u2013 [[Griff Rhys Jones]] was a guest at Chatsworth while making and filming his show.\n*''[[Chatsworth (TV series)|Chatsworth]]'' (2012) \u2013 Chatsworth House was the subject of a three-part documentary on [[BBC]] television.

Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War. As a result Matthews transferred back to the Ponsonby club where he played for the remainder of the season. In 1919 the North Shore team was revived and he returned to them. This was to be the most impressive season of Matthews career.\n\nIn May 1919 he played in a trial match to make the New Zealand team.

It found a benefit cost ratio (BCR) of 1.3 using \"conservative state modelling\" and explained: \"What this means is for every $1 invested, the project will bring at least $1.30 benefit.\"<ref>{{Citation  | title = Western Distributor and Monash Freeway Upgrade: Key findings from the business case | publisher = Victorian state government | page = 2|date = December 2015 | url = https://transport.vic.gov.au/-/media/tfv-documents/western-distributor/key-findings-from-the-business-case.pdf?la=en&hash=434FECC515868CE6C67B822B66DF9F57 | access-date = 9 March 2020}}</ref> With the Monash Freeway works excluded, the BCR was 1.1.<ref>{{Citation  |  title = Western Distributor Business Case | publisher = Victorian government | date =November 2015 | page = 190 | url = https://transport.vic.gov.au/-/media/tfv-documents/western-distributor/western-distributor-business-case-redacted.pdf?la=en&hash=0FC0D1C80E71BDF007DB374B1338BDA0 | access-date = 10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIt highlighted two corridors that had been identified in the 2008 [[Eddington Transport Report, Victoria|\"Investing in Transport\u2013East West Link Needs Assessment\"]] infrastructure report by businessman Sir [[Rod Eddington]]: a northern route connecting [[CityLink]] and the M80 under [[Footscray, Victoria|Footscray]], and a southern route connecting CityLink and the West Gate Freeway in the vicinity of Williamstown Road. It said rapid traffic and population growth suggested the need for both corridors in the long term, but identified the southern route as the one that would produce benefits earlier and greater over time than the northern one. It said: \"The southern corridor is likely to be a medium term solution. It accommodates future construction of the northern corridor and provides the 'real option' to defer significant investment in the northern corridor for 10 to 15 years.

It forecast that by 2031 16,000 to 22,000 vehicles would be taken off the West Gate Bridge as a result of the project, reducing the reliance on the West Gate Bridge for travel between the west and the CBD and eastern suburbs and providing greater redundancy in the road network.

The project's effect on West Gate Bridge truck traffic also underwent revision: its claim that 8000 trucks a day would be taken off the bridge was as much as double the 4000-6000 estimate in the business case. Although the EES cited a net reduction of 9300 trucks daily on several major roads in the inner west, it also revealed they would \"increase significantly\" on two key inner west residential routes\u2014truck numbers would double on Williamstown Road, while on Millers Road they would more than triple to almost 15,000 a day.<ref>{{Citation  |  title =Technical Report A: West Gate Tunnel Transport Impact Assessment | place = Melbourne | publisher = Western Distributor Authority |  year = May 2017 |  pages = 116, 341, 344, 345, 346 |  url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqx0wd0dkhzaakp/Technical%20report%20A%20Transport.pdf?dl=1}}</ref>\n\nAt the city end of the project, Dudley Street traffic volumes were tipped to fall slightly, but Dryburgh, Arden, Curzon, Queensberry and Victoria streets were all projected to receive between 1500 and 3500 additional vehicles a day.

The IAC said the project was likely to impose significant constraints on the urban renewal area at E-Gate in [[West Melbourne, Victoria|West Melbourne]], primarily through the elevated [[Wurundjeri Way]] extension and said a \"demonstrably superior outcome\" should be possible. It said the project should aim to contribute to improvements in air quality and recommended that pollution control equipment be installed on the tunnel ventilation system.<ref name=\"iacnotes\" />\n\nThe IAC said there would be an overall reduction in trucks on residential streets, producing beneficial environmental effects, although fulltime truck bans in Yarraville and Footscray would result in negative environmental effects because of a \"significant increase\" in truck volumes on Millers Road and Williamstown Road.

The report said the increased truck traffic would cause \"high\" or \"major\" residual social impacts for residential communities on both roads. It recommended a corridor study be carried out on Millers Road to determine traffic management works, considering the safety, accessibility and amenity of the abutting local residential communities; it also recommended an air quality mitigation response be developed for both Millers Road and Williamstown Road.<ref>{{Citation | title = Inquiry and Advisory Committee Report, West Gate Tunnel Project | publisher = Victorian Government | date = 23 October 2017 | pages = 26, 52, 133, 189  | url = https://www.planning.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0026/119258/West-Gate-Tunnel-Project-IAC-Report.pdf | access-date = 30 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe IAC urged more work to be done to develop a solution to manage growth in truck traffic between the Brooklyn/Tottenham industrial area and the port.

It accommodates future construction of the northern corridor and provides the 'real option' to defer significant investment in the northern corridor for 10 to 15 years.

It forecast that by 2031 16,000 to 22,000 vehicles would be taken off the West Gate Bridge as a result of the project, reducing the reliance on the West Gate Bridge for travel between the west and the CBD and eastern suburbs and providing greater redundancy in the road network.

Total daily vehicle projections were now 55,000 to 67,000, which included between 13,200 and 16,200 trucks (up from 9000 to 11,000). The project's effect on West Gate Bridge truck traffic also underwent revision: its claim that 8000 trucks a day would be taken off the bridge was as much as double the 4000-6000 estimate in the business case. Although the EES cited a net reduction of 9300 trucks daily on several major roads in the inner west, it also revealed they would \"increase significantly\" on two key inner west residential routes\u2014truck numbers would double on Williamstown Road, while on Millers Road they would more than triple to almost 15,000 a day.<ref>{{Citation  |  title =Technical Report A: West Gate Tunnel Transport Impact Assessment | place = Melbourne | publisher = Western Distributor Authority |  year = May 2017 |  pages = 116, 341, 344, 345, 346 |  url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqx0wd0dkhzaakp/Technical%20report%20A%20Transport.pdf?dl=1}}</ref>\n\nAt the city end of the project, Dudley Street traffic volumes were tipped to fall slightly, but Dryburgh, Arden, Curzon, Queensberry and Victoria streets were all projected to receive between 1500 and 3500 additional vehicles a day.

Millers Road residents would suffer a decrease in safety and amenity and greater difficulty in reaching services and facilities south of the West Gate Freeway, while on Williamstown Road it would affect connectivity and travel times, as well as affecting the likelihood of cyclists and pedestrians using and crossing the road. Of Williamstown Road, the report noted: \"This is a significant change for a road which has a high proportion of residential frontages, and high density residential areas east and west of the road itself.\"<ref>{{Citation  |  title =Technical Report L: Social Impact Assessment | place = Melbourne | publisher = Western Distributor Authority |  year = May 2017 |  pages = 49 |  url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/c9vc8r3e8i166z5/Technical%20report%20L%20Social.pdf?dl=1}}</ref>\n\n===Built environment===\n\nThe EES concluded that high quality urban design, extensive landscaping and revegetation would help integrate such infrastructure as ramps, bridges, pedestrian overpasses and noise barriers with the immediate surrounds. Although some structures near the northern tunnel portals in Footscray would be higher than existing buildings, they would not have a negative effect on existing built form given the industrial character of the area.

It recommended upgrading Grieve Parade as the preferred truck route (via Princes Highway) to access the West Gate Freeway, with an extension northward to Market Road, Tottenham, an upgraded freeway interchange including additional ramps to and from the M80 Western Ring Road, and new west-facing ramps to Dohertys Road and Princes Freeway. The council submission also said a corridor study was required on Millers Road between Geelong Road and Blackshaws Road.

The report said Treasury Department officials failed to warn the government that extending CityLink tolling could \"create an unintended monopoly advantage for Transurban\". It said  Treasury officials also failed to properly consider a range of alternative project options, or other ways\u2013apart from extending Transurban's tolling on CityLink\u2013to pay for the new road. \"The business case was not sufficiently comprehensive and so undermined one of its key purposes\u2013to provide confidence to decision-makers that they are selecting the right investment option,\" the audit said. \n\nAuditor-General Andrew Greaves argued funds to build the road could have been raised through other means. The state government could have increased taxes, borrowed the money, taken control of CityLink tolling, or opened it up to competitive tender, he said. The report said including the Monash Freeway upgrade \"lacked a convincing rationale\" and coupled with a series of other abnormal additions might have inflated the project's benefits on paper.

The school was forced to close its doors in 1979.<ref>\"Christian Academy, Bible College Closing Doors\", The Courier Gazette, August 28, 1979,page one.</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nDuring its twenty-year history, the campus was developed to include a gymnasium and soccer field, an academy boys dormitory, a co-ed Bible college dormitory, and an academy classroom building, Tracey Hall.  The thirty-five room Warrenton Cottage housed the kitchen, dining halls, library, administrative offices, academy girls dormitory, and a snack bar/recreation center.  The former carriage house was renovated to provide Bible college classrooms, library, and chapel for both schools.  A capital campaign was begun in 1976 to provide funding for a multi-purpose building housing a new kitchen, dining hall, and larger chapel necessitated by increasing enrollment in both schools.  Due to the closure of the schools in 1979 the chapel complex was never completed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Activities==\nThe academy fielded a variety of interscholastic sports teams.  They were active participants in the State Principal's Association sports leagues as a Class S school.  Girls teams included basketball, softball, and volleyball teams.  Boys teams included cross country, soccer, basketball, baseball, and volleyball.  The boys basketball team reached Class S/D state tournament status in 1964, 1965, and 1976.  In 1969, the boys varsity basketball team won the Western Maine Class D Runner-up trophy.<ref>Strong grabs Western S Title, Morning Sentinel (Waterville, ME)February 24, 1969, page 8</ref>  In 1977, the boys team won the Western Maine Class D Title, but lost to Eastern Maine champs, Jonesport-Beals in the Class D State Championship contest. In 1978, the boys team lost to Oak Grove-Coburn in the Western Maine Semifinal matchup.\n\nThe schools provided several musical opportunities for students. School choirs,<ref>Glen Cove Choir will perform at Wells Branch, Biddeford-Saco Journal, March 23, 1965, Page 3</ref> quartets, trios and vocal ensembles performed locally and traveled to churches, schools, and conferences throughout the Northeast United States.

Eventually, the curriculum was expanded into three separate tracks.  A one-year certificate program and a four-year college program were added to the three year diploma track.  The first graduating class of 1963 included nine members, and by its tenth year of existence enrollment had increased to ninety-five students with a graduating class of 14.<ref>Glen Cove Bible College course catalogs</ref>{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}\n\n\"In 1973, [[Kenneth M.

These served as an outreach to young people and a student recruitment opportunity.  Bible and missionary conferences were also hosted on the campus during the school year and during summer months.

The estate consisted of sixty-seven acres of land with 2500 feet of ocean front and a main house of thirty-five rooms and ten baths, a carriage house and an outlying barn, all in good condition. The property, formerly a private residence adjacent to the Samoset Resort, had recently been used by a research organization and had been vacant for two years.  The former owners, The Round Table Foundation, allowed the school to occupy and use the property pending the settling of the title.

The school was founded in 1958 in [[Glen Cove, Maine]] under the leadership of Harold Duff and Arthur Fish. The school was forced to close its doors in 1979.<ref>\"Christian Academy, Bible College Closing Doors\", The Courier Gazette, August 28, 1979,page one.</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nDuring its twenty-year history, the campus was developed to include a gymnasium and soccer field, an academy boys dormitory, a co-ed Bible college dormitory, and an academy classroom building, Tracey Hall.  The thirty-five room Warrenton Cottage housed the kitchen, dining halls, library, administrative offices, academy girls dormitory, and a snack bar/recreation center.  The former carriage house was renovated to provide Bible college classrooms, library, and chapel for both schools.  A capital campaign was begun in 1976 to provide funding for a multi-purpose building housing a new kitchen, dining hall, and larger chapel necessitated by increasing enrollment in both schools.  Due to the closure of the schools in 1979 the chapel complex was never completed.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Activities==\nThe academy fielded a variety of interscholastic sports teams.  They were active participants in the State Principal's Association sports leagues as a Class S school.  Girls teams included basketball, softball, and volleyball teams.  Boys teams included cross country, soccer, basketball, baseball, and volleyball.  The boys basketball team reached Class S/D state tournament status in 1964, 1965, and 1976.  In 1969, the boys varsity basketball team won the Western Maine Class D Runner-up trophy.<ref>Strong grabs Western S Title, Morning Sentinel (Waterville, ME)February 24, 1969, page 8</ref>  In 1977, the boys team won the Western Maine Class D Title, but lost to Eastern Maine champs, Jonesport-Beals in the Class D State Championship contest. In 1978, the boys team lost to OakGrove-Coburn in the Western Maine Semifinal matchup.\n\nThe schools provided several musical opportunities for students. School choirs,<ref>Glen Cove Choir will perform at Wells Branch, Biddeford-Saco Journal, March 23, 1965, Page 3</ref> quartets, trios and vocal ensembles performed locally and traveled to churches, schools, and conferences throughout the Northeast United States.  There was an active drama program at the school, and students were also active in the local chapter of the National Honor Society and the DAR\n\n==Glen Cove Bible College==\nIn 1960 the board of directors voted to establish a post secondary Bible Institute on the same campus.  Eventually, the curriculum was expanded into three separate tracks.  A one-year certificate program and a four-year college program were added to the three year diploma track.  The first graduating class of 1963 included nine members, and by its tenth year of existence enrollment had increased to ninety-five students with a graduating class of 14.<ref>Glen Cove Bible College course catalogs</ref>{{primary source inline|date=August 2016}}\n\n\"In 1973, [[Kenneth M.

These served as an outreach to young people and a student recruitment opportunity.  Bible and missionary conferences were also hosted on the campus during the school year and during summer months.  Missionaries from around the globe and popular Bible teachers were featured at these conferences which were also open to the general public.<ref>\"The Christian Forward\" quarterly news magazine of Christian Schools, Inc.</ref>\n<ref>Glen Cove Christian Schools brochures</ref><ref>IVCF Student Christian Conference, The Courier Gazette, March 21, 1961</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe school opened in 1958 as a state approved class A secondary school with 34 students and met in renovated classrooms of the Calvary Baptist Church in Pittsfield, Maine.<ref>Board Minutes of Christian Schools, Inc.</ref> One senior was graduated in June 1959.

The estate consisted of sixty-seven acres of land with 2500 feet of ocean front and a main house of thirty-five rooms and ten baths, a carriage house and an outlying barn, all in good condition. The property, formerly a private residence adjacent to the Samoset Resort, had recently been used by a research organization and had been vacant for two years.  The former owners, The Round Table Foundation, allowed the school to occupy and use the property pending the settling of the title.

He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma.  A new copyist, Anna Holtz ([[Diane Kruger]]) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score of his symphony for the first performance.  Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer.  Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world.  Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to rely on her and view her with respect, and even with admiration. \n\nAnna Holtz (as Beethoven always refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be his final concert. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes the model of Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin.

He is plagued by deafness, loneliness and personal trauma.  A new copyist, Anna Holtz ([[Diane Kruger]]) is engaged to help the composer finish preparing the score of his symphony for the first performance.  Anna is a young conservatory student and aspiring composer.  Her understanding of his work is such that she corrects mistakes he has made, while her personality opens a door into his private world.  Beethoven is initially skeptical, but he slowly comes to trust Anna's assistance and eventually grows to rely on her and view her with respect, and even with admiration. \n\nAnna Holtz (as Beethoven always refers to her) is sent to be his copyist, but due to her gender, is constantly thought less of, and is mistaken for a serving girl, maid, and even prostitute. Pushing past, though quite unhappily, from these assumptions, Anna proves herself to Beethoven, not only as a copyist, but also as his friend, and something of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and heir as far as he is concerned. He gains much admiration of her, after she assists him by directing him, hidden among his musicians, as he simultaneously copies her movements to direct the orchestra during what would turn out to be his final concert. Though Anna agreed to her romantic interest, Martin Bauer, that she would help him complete his symphony, and then immediately leave after showing him her work, she instead continues to assist him as his copyist. After seeing the admiration she has gained from Beethoven, Anna proceeds to show him a piece of music that she composed. Beethoven tactlessly and unknowingly insults her. Anna, more than ready not to return, continues to stay with her great aunt and the nuns at the convent. Anna is surprised when Beethoven, desperate to keep Anna in his employment and under his tutelage, bursts into the convent and begs Anna, on his knees, to come back and work as his equal on both of their music. He begins to teach her about Romanticism, music, and mostly, how to allow her artistic side freedom. Continuing his infuriating behavior, Beethoven smashes the model of Martin's bridge he built for an engineer's competition, thereby ruining Martin as well. Anna, angry, confronts Beethoven, asking him if he had ever considered that she loved Martin. Beethoven replies, \"You don't love him.\" Upon hearing this, Anna angrily asks if she is supposed to love Beethoven instead. Beethoven again replies, \"No. You want to be me.\" From here, Anna agrees that Beethoven did the right thing, and continues to work with him, pushing him past his hardships and failures, and then staying by his bedside until he died. The movie ends though, with Anna finally embracing herself as an artist, unique from all other composers, including Beethoven, and readying herself for a promising future. \n\nThough the film is directed very abstractly, leaving room for the audience to view Anna and Beethoven's relationship as that of a chaste romance, the characters remain very platonic, and could much more easily be viewed as a strong and close friendship, bordering on Beethoven even being viewed as a father figure of Anna's.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ed Harris]] as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]\n*[[Diane Kruger]] as Anna Holtz\n*[[Matthew Goode]] as Martin Bauer\n*[[Phyllida Law]] as Mother Canisius\n*[[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]] as Karl van Beethoven\n*[[Ralph Riach]] as Wenzel Schlemmer\n*[[Bill Stewart (actor)|Bill Stewart]] as Rudy\n\n==Artistic license==\nThe working manuscript of the score of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is attributed to two copyists,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3049061.stm |title=Beethoven's Ninth fetches \u00a32.1m |author=BBC News |date=22 May 2003 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> both of whom were male, not a single female as depicted in the film.
