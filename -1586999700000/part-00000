The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

In August 1961, most of the Belgian officers returned to Belgium, and [[mercenaries]] began training many of the soldiers. From its formation the force struggled with divisions between various white and black commanders.{{Sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47-48}} Though [[South Africa]] officially denied Katangese requests for arms, there is evidence of a covert program supplying weapons to the Gendarmerie.{{Sfn|Passemiers|2016|p=81}}\n\n== In the Congo (1960-1967) ==\n\n=== Early action and suppressing rebellion in northern Katanga ===\n{{further information|Battle of Kabalo}}\nThe Gendarmerie first saw action in [[Tanganyika Province|Northern Katanga]] in efforts to suppress the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT), a political party which represented the [[Luba people]] of northern Katanga and rebelled against Katangese authority.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=48}} Some prominent BALUBAKAT politicians allied themselves with the Stanleyville government.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=289}} On October 17, 1960, neutral zones were created in the region under a temporary agreement with the United Nations.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47-49}} In theory the region was controlled by ONUC contingents, but in reality the peacekeeping units were too weak to exercise authority.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|pp=302\u2013303}} Because the rebellion threatened Katanga's communications, partially trained soldiers and policemen were dispatched in units of around 60 people to the region.{{Sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47-49}}{{Sfn|Larmer|Kennes|2014|pp=15-16}} The inexperienced troops often resorted to [[pillaging]] and burning settlements.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

Such efforts largely failed.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=|p=50}}\n\nAfter being pressured by the United States and United Nations, Belgium removed many of its forces from the region from August to September 1961. However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. There had also been ongoing efforts by the United Nations to suppress Belgian support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August. That same month, war veterans were first [[Military awards and decorations|honored]]. Dead soldiers were also remembered in ceremonies at the [[Sts.

UMHK officials privately told Tshombe they were withdrawing their support for succession.<ref name=\"othen\" /> General Moke vainly attempted to organise the 140 mercenaries and 2,000 gendarmes under his command to prepare a final defence of Kolwezi. His efforts, undermined by the force's low morale and indiscipline, were further hampered by an influx of refugees. Discipline in the garrison increasingly faltered; in once instance, two mercenaries attempted to steal Puren's jeep. Tshombe ordered the Katangese garrison of [[Baudouinville]] to surrender to besieging UN and ANC forces. Instead, they and most of the population deserted the city while a handful of gendarmes near [[Kongolo, Katanga|Kongolo]] laid down their arms to Nigerian and Malaysian soldiers. On 14 January, Indian troops found the last intact bridge into Kolwezi. After a brief fight with gendarmes and mercenaries they secured it and crossed over, stopping at the city outskirts to await further instruction.<ref name=\"othen\" /> At a final meeting with his mercenary commanders, Tshombe ordered all remaining Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. [[Jean Schramme]] was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what remained of the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January.<ref name=\"othen\" />\n\nOn 15 January, Tshombe sent a formal message to Thant, \"I am ready to proclaim immediately before the world that the Katanga's secession is ended.\"{{sfn|Meisler|2011|p=133}} Munongo fled Kolwezi and angrily declared that he would continue the campaign from Rhodesia, though he soon returned.<ref name=\"othen\" /> Tshombe offered to return to \u00c9lisabethville to oversee the implementation of Thant's proposal for reunification if Prime Minister Adoula granted amnesty to himself and his government. At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties from Operation Grandslam are unknown.

On 8 February 1963, General Moke and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000-17,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000-3,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the Kwilu and Simba rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against the insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime.

After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and [[Kisangani]], after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes, led by Belgian mercenary [[Jean Schramme]] were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=|pp=77-78}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). The Gendarmerie were involved in fighting the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) in Northern Katanga at the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1960. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Rum Punch]] (August 1961), [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961) and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1963). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Genarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.

Greek astronomy is understood to include the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Greco-Roman]], and [[Late Antiquity]] eras. It is not limited [[geographic]]ally to [[Greece]] or to ethnic [[Greek people|Greeks]], as the Greek language had become the language of scholarship throughout the [[Hellenistic world]] following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This phase of Greek astronomy is also known as '''Hellenistic astronomy''', while the pre-Hellenistic phase is known as '''Classical Greek astronomy'''. During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, much of the Greek and non-Greek [[astronomers]] working in the Greek tradition studied at the [[Musaeum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n THE GREEK GOD \nJADEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE by the Greek and notably Hellenistic astronomers is considered to be a major phase in the [[history of astronomy]]. Greek astronomy is characterized by seeking a geometrical model for celestial phenomena.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| last = Krafft| first = Fritz| date = 2009| title = Astronomy| editor-last = Cancik| editor-first = Hubert| editor2-last = Schneider| editor2-first = Helmuth| encyclopedia = [[Brill's New Pauly]]}}</ref>  Most of the names of the stars, planets, and constellations of the northern hemisphere are inherited from the terminology of the Greek astronomy,<ref>Thurston, H., ''Early Astronomy.'' Springer, 1994. p.2</ref>, which are however indeed transliterated from the empirical knowledge in [[Babylonian astronomy]], characterized by its theoretical model formulation in terms of algebraic and numerical relations, and to a lesser extent from [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian]] astronomy. Later, the scientific work by astronomers and mathematicians of the arbo-moslem empire, of diverse backgrounds and religions (such as the Syriac Christians{{Citation needed |date=April 2020}}), to translate, comment and then correct Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], influenced in their turn [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Western European]] astronomy.\n\n== Archaic Greek astronomy ==\nBoth Hesiod and Homer were directly and deeply influenced by the mythologies of Phoenicia and Mesopotamia, thanks to Phoenician sailors and literate Babylonians and Arameans who went to Lefkandi in Greece during the Orientalizing Period, between c. 750 BC and c. 630 BC, for maritime commerce and some to live and work; the Babylonians and Arameans came from the Levant and North Syria where they were forcibly transported in their hundreds of thousands by the Assyrian army from Babylonia during the reign of the last six Assyrian kings, from 745 BC to 627 BC. Hesiod's theogony and cosmogony are the Greek version of two Phoenician myths. The Odyssey of Homer is inspired by the Epopee of Gilgamesh. See for references the work of M.L. West et W. Burkret.\n\nIn this context it is reasonable to suggest that whatever Homer and Hesiod hinted at in their small contributions comes from the knowledge they acquired from the Oriental people they rubbed shoulder with in Lefkandi, the center of Greek culture at that time. References to identifiable [[star]]s and [[constellation]]s appear in the writings of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], the earliest surviving examples of Greek literature. In the oldest European texts, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Homer has several astronomical phenomena including solar eclipses. In the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Homer refers to the following celestial objects:\n* the constellation [[Bo\u00f6tes]]\n* the [[star cluster]] [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]]\n* the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]\n* the star cluster [[Pleiades]]\n* [[Sirius]], the Dog Star\n* the constellation [[Ursa Major]]\n\n[[File:Anaximander.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Anaximander]]\n\n\nWe  really have no material evidence whatever of what some Greek philosophers said or did between 600 BC and 300 BC. Despite this, continues the speculation that [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 BC\u2013c. 546 BC) described a cyclical earth suspended in the center of the cosmos, surrounded by rings of fire, that [[Philolaus]] (c.  480 BC\u2013c. 405 BC) the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] described [[Pythagorean astronomical system|a cosmos]] with the stars, planets, [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[Earth]], and a counter-Earth (''[[Counter-Earth|Antichthon]]'')\u2014ten bodies in all\u2014circling an unseen central fire. It is hence [[pure conjecture]] that Greeks of the 6th and 5th centuries BC were aware of the planets and speculated about the structure of the cosmos.\nAlso, a more detailed description about the cosmos, Stars, Sun, Moon and the Earth can be found in the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], which dates back to the end of the 5th century BC. Within the lyrics of the Orphic poems we can find remarkable information such as that the Earth is round, it has an axis and it moves around it in one day, it has three climate zones and that the Sun magnetizes the Stars and planets.<ref>I. Passas, K. Hasapis, ''\u039f\u03c1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac.''  Encyclopedia Helios, 1984</ref>\n\n=== The Planets in Early Greek Astronomy ===\n\nThe name \"planet\" comes from the Greek term [[wikt:\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2]] (''plan\u0113t\u0113s''), meaning \"wanderer\", as ancient astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars. Five extraterrestrial planets can be seen with the naked eye: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]], the Greek names being Hermes, Aphrodite, Ares, Zeus and Cronus. Sometimes the [[luminary (astrology)|luminaries]], the Sun and Moon, are added to the list of [[naked eye planets]] to make a total of seven. Since the planets disappear from time to time when they approach the Sun, careful attention is required to identify all five. [[Observations and explorations of Venus|Observations of Venus]] are not straightforward. Early Greeks thought that the evening and morning appearances of Venus represented two different objects, calling it ''[[Hesperus]]'' (\"evening star\") when it appeared in the western evening sky and ''[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]'' (\"light-bringer\") when it appeared in the eastern morning sky. They eventually came to recognize that both objects were the same planet. [[Pythagoras]] is given credit for this realization.\n\n[[File:Development of Ancient Greek Astronomy.jpg|Development of Ancient Greek Astronomy]]\n\n== Eudoxan astronomy ==\n\nIn [[classical Greece]], astronomy was a branch of [[mathematics]]; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. This tradition began with the [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreans]], who placed astronomy among the four mathematical arts (along with [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], and [[music]]). The study of [[number]] comprising the four arts was later called the ''[[Quadrivium]]''.\n\nAlthough he was not a creative mathematician, [[Plato]] (427\u2013347 BC) included the ''quadrivium'' as the basis for philosophical education in the ''Republic''. He encouraged a younger mathematician, [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (c. 410 BC\u2013c. 347 BC), to develop a system of Greek astronomy. According to a modern historian of science, [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]]:\n{{quote|\n\"In their work we find (1) a shift from stellar to planetary concerns, (2) the creation of a geometrical model, the \"two-sphere model,\" for the representation of stellar and planetary phenomena, and (3) the establishment of criteria governing theories designed to account for planetary observations\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David C. Lindberg|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&pg=PA86|edition=Second|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48204-0|page=86}}</ref>}}\n\nThe two-sphere model is a [[geocentric model]] that divides the [[cosmos]] into two regions, a spherical Earth, central and motionless (the [[sublunary sphere]]) and a spherical heavenly realm centered on the Earth, which may contain multiple rotating spheres made of [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\n[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Renaissance woodcut illustrating the two-sphere model.]]\nPlato's main books on cosmology are the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In them he described the two-sphere model and said there were eight circles or spheres carrying the seven planets and the fixed stars.\nAccording to the \"[[Myth of Er]]\" in the ''Republic'', the cosmos is the [[Spindle of Necessity]], attended by [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and spun by the three daughters of the Goddess Necessity known collectively as the [[Moirai]] or Fates.\n\nAccording to a story reported by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] (6th century), Plato posed a question for the Greek mathematicians of his day: \"By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?\" (quoted in Lloyd 1970, p.&nbsp;84). Plato proposed that the seemingly chaotic wandering motions of the planets could be explained by combinations of uniform circular motions centered on a spherical Earth, apparently a novel idea in the 4th century.\n\nEudoxus rose to the challenge by assigning to each planet a set of [[concentric]] spheres. By tilting the axes of the spheres, and by assigning each a different period of revolution, he was able to approximate the celestial \"appearances.\" Thus, he was the first to attempt a mathematical description of the motions of the planets. A general idea of the content of ''On Speeds'', his book on the planets, can be gleaned from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' XII, 8, and a commentary by Simplicius on ''De caelo'', another work by Aristotle. Since all his own works are lost, our knowledge of Eudoxus is obtained from secondary sources. [[Aratus]]'s poem on [[astronomy]] is based on a work of Eudoxus, and possibly also [[Theodosius of Bithynia|Theodosius of Bithynia's]] ''[[Sphaerics]]''. They give us an indication of his work in [[spherical astronomy]] as well as planetary motions.\n\n[[Callippus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, added seven spheres to Eudoxus' original 27 (in addition to the planetary spheres, Eudoxus included a sphere for the fixed stars). Aristotle described both systems, but insisted on adding \"unrolling\" spheres between each set of spheres to cancel the motions of the outer set. Aristotle was concerned about the physical nature of the system; without unrollers, the outer motions would be transferred to the inner planets.\n\n== Hellenistic astronomy ==\n\n=== Planetary models and observational astronomy ===\nThe Eudoxan system had several critical flaws. One was its inability to predict motions exactly. Callippus' work may have been an attempt to correct this flaw. A related problem is the inability of his models to explain why planets appear to change speed. A third flaw is its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by [[Autolycus of Pitane]] (c. 310 BC).\n\n[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 BC\u2013c. 190 BC) responded by introducing two new mechanisms that allowed a planet to vary its distance and speed: the [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] deferent and the [[deferent and epicycle]]. The '''deferent''' is a circle carrying the planet around the Earth. (The word ''deferent'' comes from the Greek fero \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 \"to carry\"and Latin ''ferro, ferre'', meaning \"to carry.\") An '''eccentric deferent''' is slightly off-center from Earth. In a '''deferent and epicycle''' model, the deferent carries a small circle, the '''epicycle''', which carries the planet. The deferent-and-epicycle model can mimic the eccentric model, as shown by '''Apollonius' theorem'''. It can also explain [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrogradation]], which happens when planets appear to reverse their motion through the [[zodiac]] for a short time. Modern historians of astronomy have determined that Eudoxus' models could only have approximated retrogradation crudely for some planets, and not at all for others.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, [[Hipparchus]], aware of the extraordinary accuracy with which [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] could predict the planets' motions, insisted that Greek astronomers achieve similar levels of accuracy. Somehow he had access to Babylonian observations or predictions, and used them to create better geometrical models. For the Sun, he used a simple eccentric model, based on observations of the [[equinoxes]], which explained both changes in the speed of the Sun and differences in the lengths of the [[seasons]]. For the Moon, he used a [[deferent and epicycle]] model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.\n\nHipparchus also compiled a [[star catalogue]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], he observed a ''[[nova]]'' (new star). So that later generations could tell whether other stars came to be, perished, moved, or changed in brightness, he recorded the position and brightness of the stars. [[Ptolemy]] mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' [[discovery of precession]]. ([[Precession]] of the equinoxes is a slow motion of the place of the equinoxes through the zodiac, caused by the shifting of the Earth's axis). Hipparchus thought it was caused by the motion of the sphere of fixed stars.\n\n=== Heliocentrism and cosmic scales ===\n[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aristarchus's 3rd-century BCE calculations on the relative sizes of (from left) the Sun, Earth and Moon, from a 10th-century CE Greek copy]]\nIn the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] proposed an alternate [[cosmology]] (arrangement of the universe): a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the [[Solar System]], placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe (hence he is sometimes known as the \"Greek [[Copernicus]]\"). His astronomical ideas were not well-received, however, and only a few brief references to them are preserved. We know the name of one follower of Aristarchus: [[Seleucus of Seleucia]].\n\nAristarchus also wrote a book ''[[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which is his only work to have survived. In this work, he calculated the sizes of the Sun and Moon, as well as their distances from the Earth in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]]. Shortly afterwards, [[Eratosthenes]] calculated the size of the Earth, providing a value for the Earth radii which could be plugged into Aristarchus' calculations. Hipparchus wrote another book ''[[Hipparchus On Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which has not survived. Both Aristarchus and Hipparchus drastically underestimated the distance of the Sun from the Earth.\n\n== Astronomy in the Greco-Roman and Late Antique eras ==\n[[Hipparchus]] is considered to have been among the most important Greek astronomers, because he introduced the concept of exact prediction into astronomy. He was also the last innovative astronomer before Claudius [[Ptolemy]], a mathematician who worked at [[Alexandria]] in [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] in the 2nd century. Ptolemy's works on astronomy and [[astrology]] include the ''[[Almagest]]'', the ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', as well as the ''Handy Tables'', the ''Canobic Inscription'', and other minor works.\n\n===Ptolemaic astronomy===\nThe ''Almagest'' is one of the most influential books in the history of Western astronomy. In this book, Ptolemy explained how to predict the behavior of the planets, as Hipparchus could not, with the introduction of a new mathematical tool, the [[equant]]. The ''Almagest'' gave a comprehensive treatment of astronomy, incorporating theorems, models, and observations from many previous mathematicians. This fact may explain its survival, in contrast to more specialized works that were neglected and lost. Ptolemy placed the planets in the order that would remain standard until it was displaced by the [[heliocentric]] system and the [[Tychonic system]]:\n\n# Moon\n# Mercury\n# Venus\n# Sun\n# Mars\n# Jupiter\n# Saturn\n# Fixed stars\n\nThe extent of Ptolemy's reliance on the work of other mathematicians, in particular his use of Hipparchus' star catalogue, has been debated since the 19th century. A controversial claim was made by Robert R. Newton in the 1970s. in ''The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy'', he argued that Ptolemy faked his observations and falsely claimed the catalogue of Hipparchus as his own work. Newton's theories have not been adopted by most historians of astronomy.\n\n[[Claudius Ptolemy]] of Alexandria performed a deep examination of the shape and motion of the Earth and celestial bodies. He worked at the museum, or instructional center, school and library of manuscripts in Alexandria. [[Ptolemy]] is responsible for a lot of concepts, but one of his most famous works summarizing these concepts is the Almagest, a series of 13 books where he presented his astronomical theories. Ptolemy discussed the idea of epicycles and center of the world. The epicycle center moves at a constant rate in a counter clockwise direction. Once other celestial bodies, such as the planets, were introduced into this system, it became more complex. The models for Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars included the center of the circle, the equant point, the epicycle, and an observer from earth to give perspective. The discovery of this model was that the center of the Mercury and Venus epicycles must always be colinear with the Sun. This assures of bounded elongation. (Bowler, 2010, 48) Bounded elongation is the angular distance of celestial bodies from the center of the universe. Ptolemy's model of the [[cosmos]] and his studies landed him an important place in history in the development of modern-day science.\nThe cosmos was a concept further developed by Ptolemy that included equant circles, however [[Copernicus]] model of the universe was simpler. In the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was at the center of the universe with the Moon, the Sun, and five planets circling it. The circle of fixed stars marked the outermost sphere of the universe and beyond that would be the philosophical \u201caether\u201d realm. The Earth was at the exact center of the cosmos, most likely because people at the time believed the Earth had to be at the center of the universe because of the deductions made by observers in the system. The sphere carrying the Moon is described as the boundary between the corruptible and changing sublunary world and the incorruptible and unchanging heavens above it (Bowler, 2010, 26). The heavens were defined as incorruptible and unchanging based on theology and mythology of the past. \nThe [[Almagest]] introduced the idea of the sphericity of heavens. The assumption is that the sizes and mutual distances of the stars must appear to vary however one supposes the earth to be positioned, yet no such variation occurred (Bowler, 2010, 55), The [[aether (classical element)|aether]] is the area that describes the universe above the terrestrial sphere. This component of the atmosphere is unknown and named by philosophers, though many do not know what lies beyond the realm of what has been seen by human beings. The aether is used to affirm the sphericity of the heavens and this is confirmed by the belief that different shapes have an equal boundary and those with more angles are greater, the circle is greater than all other surfaces, and a sphere greater than all other solids. Therefore, through physical considerations, and heavenly philosophy, there is an assumption that the heavens must be spherical. The Almagest also suggested that the earth was spherical because of similar philosophy. The differences in the hours across the globe are proportional to the distances between the spaces at which they are being observed. Therefore, it can be deduced that the Earth is spherical because of the evenly curving surface and the differences in time that was constant and proportional. In other words, the Earth must be spherical because they change in time-zones across the world occur in a uniform fashion, as with the rotation of a sphere. The observation of eclipses further confirmed these findings because everyone on Earth could see a lunar eclipse, for example, but it would be at different hours.\nThe ''Almagest'' also suggest that the Earth is at the center of the universe. The basis on which this is found is in the fact that six zodiac signs can be seen above Earth, while at the same time the other signs are not visible (Bowler, 2010, 57). The way that we observe the increase and decrease of daylight would be different if the Earth was not at the center of the universe. Though this view later proofed to be invalid, this was a good proponent to the discussion of the design of the universe. Ideas on the universe were later developed and advanced through the works of other philosophers such as Copernicus, who built on ideas through his knowledge of the world and God.\n\nA few mathematicians of Late Antiquity wrote commentaries on the ''Almagest'', including [[Pappus of Alexandria]] as well as [[Theon of Alexandria]] and his daughter [[Hypatia]]. Ptolemaic astronomy became standard in medieval western European and [[Islamic astronomy]] until it was displaced by [[Maragheh observatory|Maraghan]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] and [[Tychonic system]]s by the 16th century. However, recently discovered manuscripts reveal that Greek [[astrologers]] of Antiquity continued using pre-Ptolemaic methods for their calculations (Aaboe, 2001).\n\n==Influence on Indian astronomy==\n{{further|Indian astronomy}}\n[[File:AiKhanoumSunDial.jpg|thumb|200px|Greek equatorial [[sun dial]], [[Ai-Khanoum]], [[Afghanistan]] 3rd-2nd century BC.]]\n[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] astronomy is known to have been practiced near India in the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] from the 3rd century BC.

The ''[[Yavanajataka]]'' (\"Sayings of the Greeks\") was translated from Greek to Sanskrit by [[Yavanesvara]] during the 2nd century, under the patronage of the [[Western Satrap]] [[Saka]] king [[Rudradaman I]]. Rudradaman's capital at Ujjain \"became the Greenwich of Indian astronomers and the Arin of the Arabic and Latin astronomical treatises; for it was he and his successors who encouraged the introduction of Greek horoscopy and astronomy into India.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pingree |first=David |title=Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |date=1963 |pages=229\u2013246 |jstor=228540 |doi=10.1086/349703}}</ref>\n\nLater in the 6th century, the ''[[Romaka Siddhanta]]'' (\"Doctrine of the Romans\"),  and the ''[[Paulisa Siddhanta]]'' (sometimes attributed as the \"Doctrine of [[Paulus Alexandrinus|Paul]]\" or in general the Doctrine of Paulisa muni) were considered as two of the five main astrological treatises, which were compiled by [[Varahamihira]] in his ''Pa\u00f1ca-siddh\u0101ntik\u0101'' (\"Five Treatises\").<ref>\"the Pa\u00f1ca-siddh\u0101ntik\u0101 (\"Five Treatises\"), a compendium of Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy.

In 5 sections, his monumental work progresses through native Indian astronomy and culminates in 2 treatises on Western astronomy, showing calculations based on Greek and Alexandrian reckoning and even giving complete Ptolemaic mathematical charts and tables. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623232/Varahamihira Source]</ref> Varahamihira wrote in the [[Brihat-Samhita]]: \"For, the Greeks are foreigners.

Some elementary works have survived because they were largely non-mathematical and suitable for use in schools. Books in this class include the ''Phaenomena'' of [[Euclid]] and two works by [[Autolycus of Pitane]]. Three important textbooks, written shortly before Ptolemy's time, were written by [[Cleomedes]], [[Geminus]], and [[Theon of Smyrna]]. Books by Roman authors like Pliny the Elder and [[Vitruvius]] contain some information on Greek astronomy.

Greek astronomy is understood to include the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]], [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Greco-Roman]], and [[Late Antiquity]] eras. It is not limited [[geographic]]ally to [[Greece]] or to ethnic [[Greek people|Greeks]], as the Greek language had become the language of scholarship throughout the [[Hellenistic world]] following the conquests of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]. This phase of Greek astronomy is also known as '''Hellenistic astronomy''', while the pre-Hellenistic phase is known as '''Classical Greek astronomy'''. During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, much of the Greek and non-Greek [[astronomers]] working in the Greek tradition studied at the [[Musaeum]] and the [[Library of Alexandria]] in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]].\n\nThe development of astronomy by the Greek and notably Hellenistic astronomers is considered to be a major phase in the [[history of astronomy]]. Greek astronomy is characterized by seeking a geometrical model for celestial phenomena.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| last = Krafft| first = Fritz| date = 2009| title = Astronomy| editor-last = Cancik| editor-first = Hubert| editor2-last = Schneider| editor2-first = Helmuth| encyclopedia = [[Brill's New Pauly]]}}</ref>  Most of the names of the stars, planets, and constellations of the northern hemisphere are inherited from the terminology of the Greek astronomy,<ref>Thurston, H., ''Early Astronomy.'' Springer, 1994. p.2</ref>, which are however indeed transliterated from the empirical knowledge in [[Babylonian astronomy]], characterized by its theoretical model formulation in terms of algebraic and numerical relations, and to a lesser extent from [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian]] astronomy. Later, the scientific work by astronomers and mathematicians of the arbo-moslem empire, of diverse backgrounds and religions (such as the Syriac Christians{{Citation needed |date=April 2020}}), to translate, comment and then correct Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], influenced in their turn [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Western European]] astronomy.\n\n== Archaic Greek astronomy ==\nBoth Hesiod and Homer were directly and deeply influenced by the mythologies of Phoenicia and Mesopotamia, thanks to Phoenician sailors and literate Babylonians and Arameans who went to Lefkandi in Greece during the Orientalizing Period, between c. 750 BC and c. 630 BC, for maritime commerce and some to live and work; the Babylonians and Arameans came from the Levant and North Syria where they were forcibly transported in their hundreds of thousands by the Assyrian army from Babylonia during the reign of the last six Assyrian kings, from 745 BC to 627 BC. Hesiod's theogony and cosmogony are the Greek version of two Phoenician myths. The Odyssey of Homer is inspired by the Epopee of Gilgamesh. See for references the work of M.L. West et W. Burkret.\n\nIn this context it is reasonable to suggest that whatever Homer and Hesiod hinted at in their small contributions comes from the knowledge they acquired from the Oriental people they rubbed shoulder with in Lefkandi, the center of Greek culture at that time. References to identifiable [[star]]s and [[constellation]]s appear in the writings of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]], the earliest surviving examples of Greek literature. In the oldest European texts, the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Homer has several astronomical phenomena including solar eclipses. In the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', Homer refers to the following celestial objects:\n* the constellation [[Bo\u00f6tes]]\n* the [[star cluster]] [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]]\n* the constellation [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]\n* the star cluster [[Pleiades]]\n* [[Sirius]], the Dog Star\n* the constellation [[Ursa Major]]\n\n[[File:Anaximander.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Anaximander]]\n\n\nWe  really have no material evidence whatever of what some Greek philosophers said or did between 600 BC and 300 BC. Despite this, continues the speculation that [[Anaximander]] (c. 610 BC\u2013c. 546 BC) described a cyclical earth suspended in the center of the cosmos, surrounded by rings of fire, that [[Philolaus]] (c.  480 BC\u2013c. 405 BC) the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] described [[Pythagorean astronomical system|a cosmos]] with the stars, planets, [[Sun]], [[Moon]], [[Earth]], and a counter-Earth (''[[Counter-Earth|Antichthon]]'')\u2014ten bodies in all\u2014circling an unseen central fire. It is hence [[pure conjecture]] that Greeks of the 6th and 5th centuries BC were aware of the planets and speculated about the structure of the cosmos.\nAlso, a more detailed description about the cosmos, Stars, Sun, Moon and the Earth can be found in the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], which dates back to the end of the 5th century BC. Within the lyrics of the Orphic poems we can find remarkable information such as that the Earth is round, it has an axis and it moves around it in one day, it has three climate zones and that the Sun magnetizes the Stars and planets.<ref>I. Passas, K. Hasapis, ''\u039f\u03c1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac.''  Encyclopedia Helios, 1984</ref>\n\n=== The Planets in Early Greek Astronomy ===\n\nThe name \"planet\" comes from the Greek term [[wikt:\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2#Ancient Greek|\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2]] (''plan\u0113t\u0113s''), meaning \"wanderer\", as ancient astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky in relation to the other stars. Five extraterrestrial planets can be seen with the naked eye: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]], the Greek names being Hermes, Aphrodite, Ares, Zeus and Cronus. Sometimes the [[luminary (astrology)|luminaries]], the Sun and Moon, are added to the list of [[naked eye planets]] to make a total of seven. Since the planets disappear from time to time when they approach the Sun, careful attention is required to identify all five. [[Observations and explorations of Venus|Observations of Venus]] are not straightforward. Early Greeks thought that the evening and morning appearances of Venus represented two different objects, calling it ''[[Hesperus]]'' (\"evening star\") when it appeared in the western evening sky and ''[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]]'' (\"light-bringer\") when it appeared in the eastern morning sky. They eventually came to recognize that both objects were the same planet. [[Pythagoras]] is given credit for this realization.\n\n[[File:Development of Ancient Greek Astronomy.jpg|Development of Ancient Greek Astronomy]]\n\n== Eudoxan astronomy ==\n\nIn [[classical Greece]], astronomy was a branch of [[mathematics]]; astronomers sought to create geometrical models that could imitate the appearances of celestial motions. This tradition began with the [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreans]], who placed astronomy among the four mathematical arts (along with [[arithmetic]], [[geometry]], and [[music]]). The study of [[number]] comprising the four arts was later called the ''[[Quadrivium]]''.\n\nAlthough he was not a creative mathematician, [[Plato]] (427\u2013347 BC) included the ''quadrivium'' as the basis for philosophical education in the ''Republic''. He encouraged a younger mathematician, [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (c. 410 BC\u2013c. 347 BC), to develop a system of Greek astronomy. According to a modern historian of science, [[David C. Lindberg|David Lindberg]]:\n{{quote|\n\"In their work we find (1) a shift from stellar to planetary concerns, (2) the creation of a geometrical model, the \"two-sphere model,\" for the representation of stellar and planetary phenomena, and (3) the establishment of criteria governing theories designed to account for planetary observations\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David C. Lindberg|title=The Beginnings of Western Science: The European Scientific Tradition in Philosophical, Religious, and Institutional Context, Prehistory to A.D. 1450|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dPUBAkIm2lUC&pg=PA86|edition=Second|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-48204-0|page=86}}</ref>}}\n\nThe two-sphere model is a [[geocentric model]] that divides the [[cosmos]] into two regions, a spherical Earth, central and motionless (the [[sublunary sphere]]) and a spherical heavenly realm centered on the Earth, which may contain multiple rotating spheres made of [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].\n\n[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|Renaissance woodcut illustrating the two-sphere model.]]\nPlato's main books on cosmology are the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. In them he described the two-sphere model and said there were eight circles or spheres carrying the seven planets and the fixed stars.\nAccording to the \"[[Myth of Er]]\" in the ''Republic'', the cosmos is the [[Spindle of Necessity]], attended by [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and spun by the three daughters of the Goddess Necessity known collectively as the [[Moirai]] or Fates.\n\nAccording to a story reported by [[Simplicius of Cilicia]] (6th century), Plato posed a question for the Greek mathematicians of his day: \"By the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?\" (quoted in Lloyd 1970, p.&nbsp;84). Plato proposed that the seemingly chaotic wandering motions of the planets could be explained by combinations of uniform circular motions centered on a spherical Earth, apparently a novel idea in the 4th century.\n\nEudoxus rose to the challenge by assigning to each planet a set of [[concentric]] spheres. By tilting the axes of the spheres, and by assigning each a different period of revolution, he was able to approximate the celestial \"appearances.\" Thus, he was the first to attempt a mathematical description of the motions of the planets. A general idea of the content of ''On Speeds'', his book on the planets, can be gleaned from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' XII, 8, and a commentary by Simplicius on ''De caelo'', another work by Aristotle. Since all his own works are lost, our knowledge of Eudoxus is obtained from secondary sources. [[Aratus]]'s poem on [[astronomy]] is based on a work of Eudoxus, and possibly also [[Theodosius of Bithynia|Theodosius of Bithynia's]] ''[[Sphaerics]]''. They give us an indication of his work in [[spherical astronomy]] as well as planetary motions.\n\n[[Callippus]], a Greek astronomer of the 4th century, added seven spheres to Eudoxus' original 27 (in addition to the planetary spheres, Eudoxus included a sphere for the fixed stars). Aristotle described both systems, but insisted on adding \"unrolling\" spheres between each set of spheres to cancel the motions of the outer set. Aristotle was concerned about the physical nature of the system; without unrollers, the outer motions would be transferred to the inner planets.\n\n== Hellenistic astronomy ==\n\n=== Planetary models and observational astronomy ===\nThe Eudoxan system had several critical flaws. One was its inability to predict motions exactly. Callippus' work may have been an attempt to correct this flaw. A related problem is the inability of his models to explain why planets appear to change speed. A third flaw is its inability to explain changes in the brightness of planets as seen from Earth. Because the spheres are concentric, planets will always remain at the same distance from Earth. This problem was pointed out in Antiquity by [[Autolycus of Pitane]] (c. 310 BC).\n\n[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 BC\u2013c. 190 BC) responded by introducing two new mechanisms that allowed a planet to vary its distance and speed: the [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] deferent and the [[deferent and epicycle]]. The '''deferent''' is a circle carrying the planet around the Earth. (The word ''deferent'' comes from the Greek fero \u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 \"to carry\"and Latin ''ferro, ferre'', meaning \"to carry.\") An '''eccentric deferent''' is slightly off-center from Earth. In a '''deferent and epicycle''' model, the deferent carries a small circle, the '''epicycle''', which carries the planet. The deferent-and-epicycle model can mimic the eccentric model, as shown by '''Apollonius' theorem'''. It can also explain [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrogradation]], which happens when planets appear to reverse their motion through the [[zodiac]] for a short time. Modern historians of astronomy have determined that Eudoxus' models could only have approximated retrogradation crudely for some planets, and not at all for others.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC, [[Hipparchus]], aware of the extraordinary accuracy with which [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] could predict the planets' motions, insisted that Greek astronomers achieve similar levels of accuracy. Somehow he had access to Babylonian observations or predictions, and used them to create better geometrical models. For the Sun, he used a simple eccentric model, based on observations of the [[equinoxes]], which explained both changes in the speed of the Sun and differences in the lengths of the [[seasons]]. For the Moon, he used a [[deferent and epicycle]] model. He could not create accurate models for the remaining planets, and criticized other Greek astronomers for creating inaccurate models.\n\nHipparchus also compiled a [[star catalogue]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], he observed a ''[[nova]]'' (new star). So that later generations could tell whether other stars came to be, perished, moved, or changed in brightness, he recorded the position and brightness of the stars. [[Ptolemy]] mentioned the catalogue in connection with Hipparchus' [[discovery of precession]]. ([[Precession]] of the equinoxes is a slow motion of the place of the equinoxes through the zodiac, caused by the shifting of the Earth's axis). Hipparchus thought it was caused by the motion of the sphere of fixed stars.\n\n=== Heliocentrism and cosmic scales ===\n[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aristarchus's 3rd-century BCE calculations on the relative sizes of (from left) the Sun, Earth and Moon, from a 10th-century CE Greek copy]]\nIn the 3rd century BC, [[Aristarchus of Samos]] proposed an alternate [[cosmology]] (arrangement of the universe): a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the [[Solar System]], placing the Sun, not the Earth, at the center of the known universe (hence he is sometimes known as the \"Greek [[Copernicus]]\"). His astronomical ideas were not well-received, however, and only a few brief references to them are preserved. We know the name of one follower of Aristarchus: [[Seleucus of Seleucia]].\n\nAristarchus also wrote a book ''[[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which is his only work to have survived. In this work, he calculated the sizes of the Sun and Moon, as well as their distances from the Earth in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]]. Shortly afterwards, [[Eratosthenes]] calculated the size of the Earth, providing a value for the Earth radii which could be plugged into Aristarchus' calculations. Hipparchus wrote another book ''[[Hipparchus On Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which has not survived. Both Aristarchus and Hipparchus drastically underestimated the distance of the Sun from the Earth.\n\n== Astronomy in the Greco-Roman and Late Antique eras ==\n[[Hipparchus]] is considered to have been among the most important Greek astronomers, because he introduced the concept of exact prediction into astronomy. He was also the last innovative astronomer before Claudius [[Ptolemy]], a mathematician who worked at [[Alexandria]] in [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] in the 2nd century. Ptolemy's works on astronomy and [[astrology]] include the ''[[Almagest]]'', the ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', as well as the ''Handy Tables'', the ''Canobic Inscription'', and other minor works.\n\n===Ptolemaic astronomy===\nThe ''Almagest'' is one of the most influential books in the history of Western astronomy. In this book, Ptolemy explained how to predict the behavior of the planets, as Hipparchus could not, with the introduction of a new mathematical tool, the [[equant]]. The ''Almagest'' gave a comprehensive treatment of astronomy, incorporating theorems, models, and observations from many previous mathematicians. This fact may explain its survival, in contrast to more specialized works that were neglected and lost. Ptolemy placed the planets in the order that would remain standard until it was displaced by the [[heliocentric]] system and the [[Tychonic system]]:\n\n# Moon\n# Mercury\n# Venus\n# Sun\n# Mars\n# Jupiter\n# Saturn\n# Fixed stars\n\nThe extent of Ptolemy's reliance on the work of other mathematicians, in particular his use of Hipparchus' star catalogue, has been debated since the 19th century. A controversial claim was made by Robert R. Newton in the 1970s. in ''The Crime of Claudius Ptolemy'', he argued that Ptolemy faked his observations and falsely claimed the catalogue of Hipparchus as his own work. Newton's theories have not been adopted by most historians of astronomy.\n\n[[Claudius Ptolemy]] of Alexandria performed a deep examination of the shape and motion of the Earth and celestial bodies. He worked at the museum, or instructional center, school and library of manuscripts in Alexandria. [[Ptolemy]] is responsible for a lot of concepts, but one of his most famous works summarizing these concepts is the Almagest, a series of 13 books where he presented his astronomical theories. Ptolemy discussed the idea of epicycles and center of the world. The epicycle center moves at a constant rate in a counter clockwise direction. Once other celestial bodies, such as the planets, were introduced into this system, it became more complex. The models for Jupiter, Saturn, and Mars included the center of the circle, the equant point, the epicycle, and an observer from earth to give perspective. The discovery of this model was that the center of the Mercury and Venus epicycles must always be colinear with the Sun. This assures of bounded elongation. (Bowler, 2010, 48) Bounded elongation is the angular distance of celestial bodies from the center of the universe. Ptolemy's model of the [[cosmos]] and his studies landed him an important place in history in the development of modern-day science.\nThe cosmos was a concept further developed by Ptolemy that included equant circles, however [[Copernicus]] model of the universe was simpler. In the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was at the center of the universe with the Moon, the Sun, and five planets circling it. The circle of fixed stars marked the outermost sphere of the universe and beyond that would be the philosophical \u201caether\u201d realm. The Earth was at the exact center of the cosmos, most likely because people at the time believed the Earth had to be at the center of the universe because of the deductions made by observers in the system. The sphere carrying the Moon is described as the boundary between the corruptible and changing sublunary world and the incorruptible and unchanging heavens above it (Bowler, 2010, 26). The heavens were defined as incorruptible and unchanging based on theology and mythology of the past. \nThe [[Almagest]] introduced the idea of the sphericity of heavens. The assumption is that the sizes and mutual distances of the stars must appear to vary however one supposes the earth to be positioned, yet no such variation occurred (Bowler, 2010, 55), The [[aether (classical element)|aether]] is the area that describes the universe above the terrestrial sphere. This component of the atmosphere is unknown and named by philosophers, though many do not know what lies beyond the realm of what has been seen by human beings. The aether is used to affirm the sphericity of the heavens and this is confirmed by the belief that different shapes have an equal boundary and those with more angles are greater, the circle is greater than all other surfaces, and a sphere greater than all other solids. Therefore, through physical considerations, and heavenly philosophy, there is an assumption that the heavens must be spherical. The Almagest also suggested that the earth was spherical because of similar philosophy. The differences in the hours across the globe are proportional to the distances between the spaces at which they are being observed. Therefore, it can be deduced that the Earth is spherical because of the evenly curving surface and the differences in time that was constant and proportional. In other words, the Earth must be spherical because they change in time-zones across the world occur in a uniform fashion, as with the rotation of a sphere. The observation of eclipses further confirmed these findings because everyone on Earth could see a lunar eclipse, for example, but it would be at different hours.\nThe ''Almagest'' also suggest that the Earth is at the center of the universe. The basis on which this is found is in the fact that six zodiac signs can be seen above Earth, while at the same time the other signs are not visible (Bowler, 2010, 57). The way that we observe the increase and decrease of daylight would be different if the Earth was not at the center of the universe. Though this view later proofed to be invalid, this was a good proponent to the discussion of the design of the universe. Ideas on the universe were later developed and advanced through the works of other philosophers such as Copernicus, who built on ideas through his knowledge of the world and God.\n\nA few mathematicians of Late Antiquity wrote commentaries on the ''Almagest'', including [[Pappus of Alexandria]] as well as [[Theon of Alexandria]] and his daughter [[Hypatia]]. Ptolemaic astronomy became standard in medieval western European and [[Islamic astronomy]] until it was displaced by [[Maragheh observatory|Maraghan]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] and [[Tychonic system]]s by the 16th century. However, recently discovered manuscripts reveal that Greek [[astrologers]] of Antiquity continued using pre-Ptolemaic methods for their calculations (Aaboe, 2001).\n\n==Influence on Indian astronomy==\n{{further|Indian astronomy}}\n[[File:AiKhanoumSunDial.jpg|thumb|200px|Greek equatorial [[sun dial]], [[Ai-Khanoum]], [[Afghanistan]] 3rd-2nd century BC.]]\n[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] astronomy is known to have been practiced near India in the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai-Khanoum]] from the 3rd century BC. Various sun-dials, including an equatorial sundial adjusted to the latitude of [[Ujjain]] have been found in archaeological excavations there.<ref>\"Afghanistan, les tr\u00e9sors retrouv\u00e9s\", p269</ref> Numerous interactions with the [[Mauryan Empire]], and the later expansion of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greeks]] into India suggest that some transmission may have happened during that period.<ref>\"Les influences de l'astronomie grecques sur l'astronomie indienne auraient pu commencer de se manifester plus tot qu'on ne le pensait, des l'epoque Hellenistique en fait, par l'intermediaire des colonies grecques des Greco-Bactriens et Indo-Grecs\" (French) Afghanistan, les tr\u00e9sors retrouv\u00e9s\", p269.

The ''[[Yavanajataka]]'' (\"Sayings of the Greeks\") was translated from Greek to Sanskrit by [[Yavanesvara]] during the 2nd century, under the patronage of the [[Western Satrap]] [[Saka]] king [[Rudradaman I]]. Rudradaman's capital at Ujjain \"became the Greenwich of Indian astronomers and the Arin of the Arabic and Latin astronomical treatises; for it was he and his successors who encouraged the introduction of Greek horoscopy and astronomy into India.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pingree |first=David |title=Astronomy and Astrology in India and Iran |journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] |volume=54 |issue=2 |date=1963 |pages=229\u2013246 |jstor=228540 |doi=10.1086/349703}}</ref>\n\nLater in the 6th century, the ''[[Romaka Siddhanta]]'' (\"Doctrine of the Romans\"),  and the ''[[Paulisa Siddhanta]]'' (sometimes attributed as the \"Doctrine of [[Paulus Alexandrinus|Paul]]\" or in general the Doctrine of Paulisa muni) were considered as two of the five main astrological treatises, which were compiled by [[Varahamihira]] in his ''Pa\u00f1ca-siddh\u0101ntik\u0101'' (\"Five Treatises\").<ref>\"the Pa\u00f1ca-siddh\u0101ntik\u0101 (\"Five Treatises\"), a compendium of Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy. Var\u0101hamihira's knowledge of Western astronomy was thorough. In 5 sections, his monumental work progresses through native Indian astronomy and culminates in 2 treatises on Western astronomy, showing calculations based on Greek and Alexandrian reckoning and even giving complete Ptolemaic mathematical charts and tables. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica  [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623232/Varahamihira Source]</ref> Varahamihira wrote in the [[Brihat-Samhita]]: \"For, the Greeks are foreigners.

Some elementary works have survived because they were largely non-mathematical and suitable for use in schools. Books in this class include the ''Phaenomena'' of [[Euclid]] and two works by [[Autolycus of Pitane]]. Three important textbooks, written shortly before Ptolemy's time, were written by [[Cleomedes]], [[Geminus]], and [[Theon of Smyrna]].

critical reception. [[AllMusic]]'s Marisa Brown called Sia's vocal performance \"rich and passionate\" and compared it to [[Nelly Furtado]] and Morley. Brown stated the band was \"tight and lush\" and that the music was \"very modern, warm and melodic and cleanly intricate\".<ref name=AllMusic/> In his review for [[BBC Music]], Paul Sullivan wrote that the album successfully displayed Sia's vocal capabilities and versatility. However, he noted the minimal audience participation and felt that this prevented the album from capturing a \"live\" experience. For Sullivan, highlights included \"[[Don't Bring Me Down (Sia song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\", \"Destiny\", and \"Lentil\", which he believed were \"executed with an appealing mixture of frankness and fluidity\".<ref name=Sullivan/> Mark Perlaki of [[Gigwise.com]] awarded the album four out of five stars and opined that the album \"portrays an artist who's star is in the ascendant, whose voice is unrivaled in style and expression, an artist on the brink of deserved and assured greater recognition\".<ref name=Perlaki/> The [[Selby Times]]{{'}} review called the collection \"mesmerising\" and a good indicator of Sia's future work.<ref name=Selby/> One reviewer for [[WERS]] called the album \"breathtaking\" and wrote positively of Sia's vocals and the instrumentation. Like Sullivan, the reviewer warned that listeners expecting a traditional live album with \"raw cuts and heavy improvisation\" might be disappointed.<ref name=WERS/>\n\nRoque Strew of [[Pitchfork Media]] found Sia's Adelaide accent to be a \"liability\", specifically noting difference in pronunciation between the studio versions of \"Destiny\" and \"Distractions\" and the live performances. Strew complimented \"Pictures\" and \"Lentil\", the latter of which shined through the \"fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants\".<ref name=Pitchfork/> [[Popmatters]]' Mike Schiller felt the instrumentation was \"robotic\" and found Sia's vocal manipulation and bending of vowels \"infuriating\", even unintelligible at times. Schiller did, however, favor her vocal tone and found the power of her voice \"occasionally transcendent\".<ref name=Schiller/> Stuart McCaighy of ''[[This Is Fake DIY]]'' appreciated \"Pictures\" but also criticized Sia's performance for lacking diversity and for \"incomprehensible\" vocals due to her slurring of words.

critical reception. [[AllMusic]]'s Marisa Brown called Sia's vocal performance \"rich and passionate\" and compared it to [[Nelly Furtado]] and Morley. Brown stated the band was \"tight and lush\" and that the music was \"very modern, warm and melodic and cleanly intricate\".<ref name=AllMusic/> In his review for [[BBC Music]], Paul Sullivan wrote that the album successfully displayed Sia's vocal capabilities and versatility. However, he noted the minimal audience participation and felt that this prevented the album from capturing a \"live\" experience. For Sullivan, highlights included \"[[Don't Bring Me Down (Sia song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\", \"Destiny\", and \"Lentil\", which he believed were \"executed with an appealing mixture of frankness and fluidity\".<ref name=Sullivan/> Mark Perlaki of [[Gigwise.com]] awarded the album four out of five stars and opined that the album \"portrays an artist who's star is in the ascendant, whose voice is unrivaled in style and expression, an artist on the brink of deserved and assured greater recognition\".<ref name=Perlaki/> The ''Selby Times''{{'}} review called the collection \"mesmerising\" and a good indicator of Sia's future work.<ref name=Selby/> One reviewer for [[WERS]] called the album \"breathtaking\" and wrote positively of Sia's vocals and the instrumentation. Like Sullivan, the reviewer warned that listeners expecting a traditional live album with \"raw cuts and heavy improvisation\" might be disappointed.<ref name=WERS/>\n\nRoque Strew of [[Pitchfork Media]] found Sia's Adelaide accent to be a \"liability\", specifically noting difference in pronunciation between the studio versions of \"Destiny\" and \"Distractions\" and the live performances. Strew complimented \"Pictures\" and \"Lentil\", the latter of which shined through the \"fog of elongated syllables and cut consonants\".<ref name=Pitchfork/> [[Popmatters]]' Mike Schiller felt the instrumentation was \"robotic\" and found Sia's vocal manipulation and bending of vowels \"infuriating\", even unintelligible at times. Schiller did, however, favor her vocal tone and found the power of her voice \"occasionally transcendent\".<ref name=Schiller/> Stuart McCaighy of ''[[This Is Fake DIY]]'' appreciated \"Pictures\" but also criticized Sia's performance for lacking diversity and for \"incomprehensible\" vocals due to her slurring of words. McCaighy concluded that, like other live albums, ''Lady Croissant'' was redundant but would be appreciated by fans.<ref name=McCaighy/> The Australian publication ''[[DNA (magazine)|DNA]]'' published a mixed review of the album in 2010 following the release of ''[[We Are Born]]'', complimenting Sia's vocals but suggesting that \"Pictures\"  sounded like a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] and that the album's release smells like a \"cash-in\" on her \"recent success\".<ref name=DNA>{{cite journal|issn=1443-1122|location=Australia|publisher=DNA Publications|work=[[DNA (magazine)|DNA]]|url=http://www.dnamagazine.com.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=13562&c=75545|title=SIA \u2013 Lady Croissant|accessdate=6 December 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829134305/http://www.dnamagazine.com.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=13562&c=75545 | archivedate=29 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n[[File:Sia Furler and Zero 7 in concert.jpg|thumb|right|Sia and [[Zero 7]] performing in 2006; Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker of Zero 7 are credited as co-writers for \"[[Destiny (Zero 7 song)|Destiny]]\" and \"Distractions\"]]\n\nCredits adapted from AllMusic.<ref name=AllMusic/>\n\n{{Tracklist\n\n| title1 = Pictures\n| note1 = studio recording\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Dan Carey (music)|Dan Carey]]|[[Sia Furler]]}}\n| length1 = 3:37\n|-\n| title2 = [[Don't Bring Me Down (Sia song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]\n| writer2 = {{hlist|Furler|[[Blair MacKichan]]}}\n| length2 = 4:36\n|-\n| title3 = [[Destiny (Zero 7 song)|Destiny]]\n| writer3 = {{hlist|[[Sophie Barker]]|[[Zero 7|Henry Binns]]|Furler|[[Zero 7|Sam Hardaker]]}}\n| length3 = 3:55\n|-\n| title4 = Blow It All Away\n| writer4 = {{hlist|Kevin Armstrong|Furler|Felix Howard|MacKichan}}\n| length4 = 5:19\n|-\n| title5 = Lentil\n| writer5 = {{hlist|[[Samuel Dixon]]|Furler}}\n| length5 = 4:11\n|-\n| title6 = Numb\n| writer6 = {{hlist|Furler|Howard|James McMillan}}\n| length6 = 4:26\n|-\n| title7 = [[I Go to Sleep]]\n| writer7 = [[Ray Davies]]\n| length7 = 3:17\n|-\n| title8 = [[Breathe Me]]\n| writer8 = {{hlist|Carey|Furler}}\n| length8 = 5:52\n|-\n| title9 = Distractions\n| writer9 = {{hlist|Binns|Furler|Hardaker}}\n| length9 = 5:03\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{Div col}}\n* Kevin Armstrong \u2013 composer\n* [[Sophie Barker]] \u2013 composer\n* Henry Binns \u2013 composer\n* Felix Bloxsom \u2013 drums\n* [[Dan Carey (music)|Dan Carey]] \u2013 bass, composer, [[Audio engineering|engineer]], [[guitar]], keyboards, [[Record producer|producer]], [[Wurlitzer]]\n* [[Robin Danar]] \u2013 assistant engineer\n* [[Ray Davies]] \u2013 composer\n* John Dent \u2013 [[Audio mastering|mastering]]\n* [[Samuel Dixon]] \u2013 bass, composer\n* [[Tom Elmhirst]] \u2013 [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]\n* [[Sia (musician)|Sia Furler]] \u2013 composer, [[Singing|vocals]]\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez (singer)|Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez]] \u2013 photography\n* Sam Hardaker \u2013 composer\n* Felix Howard \u2013 composer\n* Joe Kennedy \u2013 keyboards\n* Olliver Kraus \u2013 cello\n* [[Emily Lazar]] \u2013 mastering\n* Joey Lemon \u2013 mixing\n* [[Blair MacKichan]] \u2013 composer\n* Taz Mattar \u2013 mixing engineer\n* James McMillan \u2013 composer\n* Stephanie Pistel \u2013 cover photo, photography\n* Sarah Register \u2013 mastering\n* Michael Sendaydiego \u2013 photography\n* Gus Seyffert \u2013 guitar\n* Jeff Tweedy \u2013 photography\n* [[Joey Waronker]] \u2013 drums\n{{Div col end}}\n\nCredits adapted from AllMusic and CD liner notes.<ref name=AllMusic/><ref name=Liner/>\n\n==Release history==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders unsortable\"\n|-\n!
