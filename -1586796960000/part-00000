It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden is currently the oldest major party presumptive nominee in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, he will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]. On March 10, following primary elections in six states, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled planned campaign night events and further in-person campaigning and campaign rallies.<ref name=\"JAb2o\" /><ref name=\"t9U5e\" /> On March 12, President Trump also stated his intent to postpone further campaign rallies.<ref name=\"NM4Ve\" /> The 11th Democratic debate was held on March 15 without an audience at the [[CNN]] studios in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"iUhTN\" /> Several states have also postponed their primaries to a later date, including Georgia,<ref name=\"2rHUH\" /> Kentucky,<ref name=\"BOyPg\" /> Louisiana,<ref name=\"9Jz7W\" /> Ohio,<ref name=\"YrwnH\" /> and Maryland.<ref name=\"slHNd\" /> As of March 24, 2020, all major-party presidential candidates have halted in-person campaigning and campaign rallies over coronavirus concerns. Political analysts have stated that the moratorium on traditional campaigning coupled to the effects of the pandemic on the nation could have unpredictable effects on the voting populace and possibly, how the election will be conducted.<ref name=\"sXzhh\" /><ref name=\"u1jgH\" /><ref name=\"w7xk5\" />\n\nThe [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act]] included money for states to increase mail-in voting.<ref name=\"NQGai\" />\n\nGovernment response to the impact of the pandemic from the Trump administration, coupled to the differing positions taken by congressional Democrats and Republicans regarding [[Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act|economic stimulus]] remains a major campaign issue for both parties.<ref name=\"kLGv5\" /><ref name=\"jAPgE\" />\n\n==Nominations==\n===Republican Party nomination===\n{{main|2020 Republican Party presidential primaries}}\n====Primaries====\nIn election cycles with incumbent presidents running for re-election, the race for their party nomination are usually ''pro-forma'', with token opposition instead of any serious challengers and with their party rules being fixed in their favor.<ref name=\"B1TfP\" /><ref name=\"politico20190506\" /> The 2020 election is no exception; with Donald Trump formally seeking a second term,<ref name=\"DFAz3\" /><ref name=\"VkToz\" /> the official Republican apparatus, both state and national, have coordinated with his campaign to implement changes to make it difficult for any primary opponent to mount a serious challenge.<ref name=\"ct7mA\" /><ref name=\"Rbspl\" /> On January 25, 2019, the [[Republican National Committee]] unofficially endorsed Trump.<ref name=\"u5OTG\" />\n\nSeveral Republican state committees have scrapped their respective primaries or caucuses.<ref name=\"politico20190906\" /> They have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H.

Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22.

It will be the 59th quadrennial [[United States presidential election|presidential election]]. Voters will select [[United States Electoral College|presidential electors]] who in turn will vote on December 14, 2020,<ref name=\"Nu5tF\" /> to either elect a new [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] or reelect the incumbents [[Donald Trump]] and [[Mike Pence]] respectively. The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to June 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics. Former Vice President [[Joe Biden]] became the presumptive Democratic nominee when Senator [[Bernie Sanders]], his last major primary opponent, suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020. The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden is currently the oldest major party presumptive nominee in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, he will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

Bush]] sought a second term in [[1992 Republican Party presidential primaries|1992]] and [[2004 Republican Party presidential primaries|2004]], respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]] were seeking reelection in [[1996 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1996]] and [[2012 Democratic Party presidential primaries|2012]], respectively.<ref name=\"YYpWu\" /><ref name=\"b3RX8\" /> After cancelling their races, some of those states like Hawaii and New York immediately binded their delegates to Trump,<ref name=\"DzEs1\" /><ref name=\"0zsgw\" /> while other such states like Kansas and Nevada later formally held a convention or meeting to officially award their delegates to him.<ref name=\"cw1Ms\" /><ref name=\"vHq4G\" />\n\nIn addition, the Trump campaign urged Republican state committees that used proportional methods to award delegates in 2016 (where a state's delegates are basically divided proportionally among the candidates based on the vote percentage) to switch to a \"[[Plurality voting|winner-takes-all]]\" (where the winning candidate in a state gets all its delegates) or \"winner-takes-most\" (where the winning candidate only wins all of the state's delegates if he exceeds a predetermined amount, otherwise they are divided proportionally) for 2020.<ref name=\"politico20190506\" /><ref name=\"AP20190920\" />\n\nNevertheless, reports arose beginning in August 2017 that members of the Republican Party were preparing a \"shadow campaign\" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-[[Arizona]] senator [[John McCain]] said, \"Republicans see weakness in this president.\"<ref name=\"wjjR6\" /><ref name=\"yDOhp\" /> [[Maine]] senator [[Susan Collins]], [[Kentucky]] senator [[Rand Paul]], and former [[New Jersey]] governor [[Chris Christie]] all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating \"it's too difficult to say.\"<ref name=\"C9L6O\" /><ref name=\"f20FO\" /> Senator [[Jeff Flake]] claimed in 2017 that Trump was \"inviting\" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.<ref name=\"Ogmqz\" /> Longtime political strategist [[Roger Stone]], however, predicted in May 2018 that Trump might not seek a second term were he to succeed in keeping all his campaign promises and \"mak[ing] America great again\".<ref name=\"GxyXS\" />\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor [[Bill Weld]] then became Trump's first major challenger in the Republican primaries following an announcement on April 15, 2019.<ref name=\"1Ad6f\" /> Weld, who was the Libertarian Party's nominee for vice president in 2016, was considered a long shot because his [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian]] views on several political positions such as abortion rights, gay marriage and marijuana legalization that conflicted with traditionalist [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.<ref name=\"oioUK\" />\n\nIn addition, businessman [[Rocky De La Fuente]] entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate.\n\nFormer Illinois [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|representative]] [[Joe Walsh (American politician)|Joe Walsh]] launched a primary challenge on August 25, 2019, saying, \"I'm going to do whatever I can. I don't want [Trump] to win. The country cannot afford to have him win. If I'm not successful, I'm not voting for him.\"<ref name=\"6L2x8\" /> Walsh ended his presidential bid on February 7, 2020, after drawing around 1% support in the Iowa caucuses. Walsh declared that \"nobody can beat Trump in a Republican primary\" because the Republican Party was now \"a cult\" of Trump. According to Walsh, Trump supporters had become \"followers\" who think that Trump \"can do no wrong\", after absorbing misinformation \"from 'conservative' media. They don't know what the truth is and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 they don't care.\"<ref name=\"iWwLJ\" />\n\nOn September 8, 2019, former South Carolina governor and representative [[Mark Sanford]] officially announced that he would be another Republican primary challenger to Trump.<ref name=\"NYTimesSanford\" /> He dropped out of the race 65 days later on November 12, 2019, after failing to gain support in Republican circles.<ref name=\"JE5vC\" />\n\nStill, [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|Donald Trump's re-election campaign]] has essentially been ongoing since his victory in 2016, leading pundits to describe his tactic of holding rallies continuously throughout his presidency as a \"never-ending campaign\".<ref name=\"kn3IR\" /> On January 20, 2017, at 5:11&nbsp;p.m., he submitted a letter as a substitute of FEC Form 2, by which he reached the legal threshold for filing, in compliance with the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]].<ref name=\"0ergM\" /> Trump has run an active campaign during the primary season, even holding rallies in the February primary states, including South Carolina and Nevada where those Republican races were canceled.<ref name=\"vckt4\" /><ref name=\"y1IrS\" />\n\nThrough Super Tuesday, March 3, Trump won every race. Including those states who have canceled their races and have awarded their delegates to him, Trump through Super Tuesday won an estimated 1,023 of the 1,276 required to officially become the presumptive Republican Party nominee.<ref name=\"RifKC\" /> After the March 10 primaries, he was a mere 11 delegates shy of clinching, which he did the following week.

This would require a candidate to win a majority of pledged delegates from the assorted primary elections in order to win the party's nomination.

In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates.

He enjoyed secondary careers as a [[dancer]] and [[college]] [[professor]].\n\nBorn Frederick Wittop Koning in [[Bussum, Netherlands]], Wittop emigrated with his family to [[Brussels]], where he [[apprentice]]d at the age of thirteen with the resident designer at the Brussels Opera.<ref name=times/> Moving to [[Paris]] in 1931, he designed for the [[Folies Berg\u00e8re]] and other music halls, creating costumes for [[Mistinguett]] and [[Josephine Baker]], among others. He studied Spanish dance and, as Frederico Rey, began a professional career that led to international acclaim as he and his first partner, [[La Argentinita]], performed worldwide. He also toured with [[Jose Greco]] and [[Tina Ramirez]].\n\nIn 1942, Wittop designed costumes for the [[Ice Capades]], [[George Abbott]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''Beat the Band'', and [[Lucille Ball]] for her film [[melodrama]] ''The Big Street''. Soon after this, Wittop joined the U.S. Armed Forces during [[World War II]] and served overseas for three and a half years. His service awarded him American citizenship. \n\nOnce Wittop returned to America after the war, he had a stint dressing show girls and dancers at the [[Latin Quarter (nightclub)]] in [[New York City]]. He then formed his own dance company in 1951 and for the next seven years toured the US and [[Europe]].

He enjoyed secondary careers as a [[dancer]] and [[college]] [[professor]].\n\nBorn Frederick Wittop Koning in [[Bussum]], the [[Netherlands]], Wittop emigrated with his family to [[Brussels]], where he [[apprentice]]d at the age of thirteen with the resident designer at the Brussels Opera.<ref name=times/> Moving to [[Paris]] in 1931, he designed for the [[Folies Berg\u00e8re]] and other music halls, creating costumes for [[Mistinguett]] and [[Josephine Baker]], among others. He studied Spanish dance and, as Frederico Rey, began a professional career that led to international acclaim as he and his first partner, [[La Argentinita]], performed worldwide. He also toured with [[Jose Greco]] and [[Tina Ramirez]].\n\nIn 1942, Wittop designed costumes for the [[Ice Capades]], [[George Abbott]]'s [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''Beat the Band'', and [[Lucille Ball]] for her film [[melodrama]] ''The Big Street''. Soon after this, Wittop joined the U.S. Armed Forces during [[World War II]] and served overseas for three and a half years. His service awarded him American citizenship. \n\nOnce Wittop returned to America after the war, he had a stint dressing show girls and dancers at the [[Latin Quarter (nightclub)]] in [[New York City]]. He then formed his own dance company in 1951 and for the next seven years toured the US and [[Europe]]. He returned to theatre design at the behest of [[theatre director|director]] [[Harold Clurman]], who saw his show and asked him to design his 1959 Broadway production of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Heartbreak House]]''. He actively worked in New York for the next fourteen years.\n\nIn 1973, Wittop retired to [[Ibiza]], where he remained for eleven years before returning to New York to work on two more projects before settling in [[Tequesta, Florida]].

The first production engines of the [[1880s]] to [[1920s]] usually used separate components for each of these elements, which were bolted together during engine assembly. Modern engines, however, often combine many of these elements into a single component, in order to reduce [[production costs]]. \nThe evolution from separate components to an engine block integrating several elements (a [[monobloc engine]]) has been a gradual progression throughout the history of internal combustion engines. The integration of elements has relied on the development of [[foundry]] and [[machining]] techniques. For example, a practical low-cost V8 engine was not feasible until Ford developed the techniques used to build the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]]. These techniques were then applied to other engines and manufacturers.\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Cylinder blocks ===\n{{multiple image \n | title             = Cylinder blocks for a [[straight-six engine|straight-6]] engine\n | width             = 200\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Wolseley 6-cylinder marine oil engine (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol V).jpg\n | caption1          = Cylinders cast in three pairs (on a marine engine)\n | image2            = Six cylinder engine with three cylinder blocks (Autocar Handbook, Ninth edition).jpg\n | caption2          = Cylinders cast in two blocks of three\n | image3            = CarterBMW1.JPG\n | caption3          = Cylinders cast in a single block of six, with integrated crankcase (turbocharger in background)\n}}\n\nA cylinder block is the structure which contains the [[Cylinder_(engine)|cylinder]], plus any [[Cylinder_(engine)#Cylinder_sleeving|cylinder sleeves]] and coolant passages. In the earliest decades of internal combustion engine development, cylinders were usually cast individually, so cylinder blocks were usually produced individually for each cylinder. Following that, engines began to combine two or three cylinders into a single cylinder block, with an engine combining several of these cylinder blocks combined together.\n\nIn early engines with multiple cylinder banks \u2014 such as a [[V6 engine|V6]], [[V8 engine|V8]] or [[Flat-six engine|flat-6]] engine \u2014 each bank was typically a separate cylinder block (or multiple blocks per bank). Since the 1930s, mass production methods have developed to allow both banks of cylinders to be integrated into the same cylinder block.\n\n=== Cylinder liners ===\n{{Anchor|wet liners}}\n'''Wet liner''' cylinder blocks use cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which fit into the block by means of special gaskets. They are referred to as \"wet liners\" because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a sleeve. \n\nAdvantages of wet liners are a lower mass, reduced space requirement and that the coolant liquid is heated quicker from a cold start, which reduces start-up fuel consumption and provides heating for the car cabin sooner.\n\n{{Anchor|dry liners}}\n'''Dry liner''' cylinder blocks use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain \"dry\" on their outside, surrounded by the block's material.\n\nFor either wet or dry liner designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself, although this is often not a practical repair option. So what? They allowed me to edit an article? Can you believe that? Seriously?\n\n=== Coolant passages ===\n{{main|Internal combustion engine cooling}}\n\n=== Oil passages ===\n{{main|Oil pump (internal combustion engine)}}\n\n=== Crankcase ===\n{{main|crankcase}}\n{{clear right}}\n\n== Monoblocs ==\n[[File:Cylinder block and head of sidevalve engine (Autocar Handbook, Ninth edition).jpg|thumb|Typical 1930-1960 [[flathead engine]] with integrated crankcase (the cylinder head is tipped upwards for illustrative purposes)]]\nAn engine where all the cylinders share a common block is called a [[monobloc engine]]. Most modern engines (including [[automobile|cars]], [[truck]]s, [[bus]]es and [[tractor]]s) use a monoblock design of some type, therefore few modern engines have a separate block for each cylinder. This has led to the term \"engine block\" usually implying a monobloc design and the term monobloc itself is rarely used.\n\nIn the early years of the internal combustion engine, [[casting]] technology could produce either large castings, or castings with complex [[core (manufacturing)|internal cores]] to allow for water jackets, but not both simultaneously. Most early engines, particularly those with more than four cylinders, had their cylinders cast as pairs or triplets of cylinders, then bolted to a single crankcase.\n\nAs casting techniques improved, an entire cylinder block of 4, 6, or 8 cylinders could be produced in one piece. This monobloc construction was simpler and more cost effective to produce. For engines with an [[straight engine|inline]] configuration, this meant that all the cylinders, plus the crankcase, could be produced in a single component. One of the early engines produced using this method is the 4-cylinder engine in the [[Ford Model T]], introduced in 1908. The method spread to [[straight-six engine]]s and was commonly used by the mid-1920s.\n\nUp until the 1930s, most [[V engine]]s retained a separate block casting for each cylinder bank, with both bolted onto a common crankcase (itself a separate casting). For economy, some engines were designed to use identical castings for each bank, left and right.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, Buzzard\">{{cite book |title=The V12 Engine  |last=Ludvigsen  |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen  |publisher=Haynes Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=1-84425-004-0}}</ref>{{refpage|page=120}} A rare exception is the [[Lancia]] 22\u00bd\u00b0 narrow-angle V12 of 1919, which used a single block casting combining both banks.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, Buzzard\"/>{{refpage|pages=50-53}} The [[Ford flathead V-8]] \u2014 introduced in 1932 \u2014 represented a significant development in the production of affordable V engines. It was the first V8 engine with a single engine block casting, putting a V8 into an affordable car for the first time.<ref name=\"Sorensen1956pp225-231\">{{cite book |last1=Sorensen |first1=Charles E. |last2=Williamson |first2=Samuel T. |title=My Forty Years with Ford |date=1956 |publisher=Norton |location=New York, USA |isbn=9780814332795 |pages=225-231}}</ref>\n\nThe communal water jacket of monobloc designs permitted closer spacing between cylinders. The monobloc design also improved the mechanical stiffness of the engine against bending and the increasingly important torsional twist, as cylinder numbers, engine lengths, and power ratings increased.\n\n=== Integrated crankcase ===\nMost engine blocks today, except some unusual V or radial engines and large marine engines, are a monobloc for all the cylinders, plus an integrated crankcase. In such cases, the skirts of the cylinder banks form a crankcase area of sorts, which is still often called a crankcase despite no longer being a discrete part.\n\nUse of steel [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] liners and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] shells minimizes the effect of the relative softness of aluminium. Some engine designs use [[plasma transferred wire arc thermal spraying]] instead cylinder sleeves, to reduce weight. They can also be produced in [[compacted graphite iron]] (CGI) such as some diesel engines.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://foundrymag.com/materials/navistar-now-producing-engine-blocks-heads-cgi |title=Navistar Now Producing Engine Blocks, Heads in CGI |work=Foundry Management & Technology |first=Robert |last=Brooks |date=January 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Integrated cylinder head ===\n{{multiple image \n | title             = Integrated cylinder head engines\n | width             = 200\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Daimler DB 605 cutaway.jpg\n | caption1          = [[DB 605]] inverted V12 aircraft engine\n | image2            = Honda GX 160 engine.jpg\n | caption2          = Honda GX 160 engine in a ride-on lawnmower\n}}\n\nSome modern consumer-grade [[small engine]]s use a monobloc design where the cylinder head, block, and half the crankcase share the same casting. One reason for this, apart from cost, is to produce an overall lower engine height. The disadvantage can be that repairs become more time-consuming and perhaps impractical. \n\nAn example of engines with integrated cylinder heads are the Honda [[list of Honda engines#Power equipment|GC]]-series and GXV-series engines, which are sometimes called \"Uniblock\" by Honda.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Honda General Purpose Engines: GC Series - Single Cylinder\n|url = http://www.perr.com/honda.html\n|url-status = dead\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101127185645/http://perr.com/honda.html\n|archivedate = 2010-11-27\n}} Includes sectioned drawings</ref>\n\n=== Integrated transmission ===\nSeveral cars with [[transverse engine]]s have used an engine block consisting of an integrated [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] and crankcase.

These techniques were then applied to other engines and manufacturers.\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Cylinder blocks ===\n{{multiple image \n | title             = Cylinder blocks for a [[straight-six engine|straight-6]] engine\n | width             = 200\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Wolseley 6-cylinder marine oil engine (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol V).jpg\n | caption1          = Cylinders cast in three pairs (on a marine engine)\n | image2            = Six cylinder engine with three cylinder blocks (Autocar Handbook, Ninth edition).jpg\n | caption2          = Cylinders cast in two blocks of three\n | image3            = CarterBMW1.JPG\n | caption3          = Cylinders cast in a single block of six, with integrated crankcase (turbocharger in background)\n}}\n\nA cylinder block is the structure which contains the [[Cylinder_(engine)|cylinder]], plus any [[Cylinder_(engine)#Cylinder_sleeving|cylinder sleeves]] and coolant passages. In the earliest decades of internal combustion engine development, cylinders were usually cast individually, so cylinder blocks were usually produced individually for each cylinder. Following that, engines began to combine two or three cylinders into a single cylinder block, with an engine combining several of these cylinder blocks combined together.\n\nIn early engines with multiple cylinder banks \u2014 such as a [[V6 engine|V6]], [[V8 engine|V8]] or [[Flat-six engine|flat-6]] engine \u2014 each bank was typically a separate cylinder block (or multiple blocks per bank). Since the 1930s, mass production methods have developed to allow both banks of cylinders to be integrated into the same cylinder block.\n\n=== Cylinder liners ===\n{{Anchor|wet liners}}\n'''Wet liner''' cylinder blocks use cylinder walls that are entirely removable, which fit into the block by means of special gaskets. They are referred to as \"wet liners\" because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine's coolant. In other words, the liner is the entire wall, rather than being merely a sleeve. \n\nAdvantages of wet liners are a lower mass, reduced space requirement and that the coolant liquid is heated quicker from a cold start, which reduces start-up fuel consumption and provides heating for the car cabin sooner.\n\n{{Anchor|dry liners}}\n'''Dry liner''' cylinder blocks use either the block's material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall. Additional sleeves are inserted within, which remain \"dry\" on their outside, surrounded by the block's material.\n\nFor either wet or dry liner designs, the liners (or sleeves) can be replaced, potentially allowing overhaul or rebuild without replacement of the block itself, although this is often not a practical repair option.\n\n=== Coolant passages ===\n{{main|Internal combustion engine cooling}}\n\n=== Oil passages ===\n{{main|Oil pump (internal combustion engine)}}\n\n=== Crankcase ===\n{{main|crankcase}}\n{{clear right}}\n\n== Monoblocs ==\n[[File:Cylinder block and head of sidevalve engine (Autocar Handbook, Ninth edition).jpg|thumb|Typical 1930-1960 [[flathead engine]] with integrated crankcase (the cylinder head is tipped upwards for illustrative purposes)]]\nAn engine where all the cylinders share a common block is called a [[monobloc engine]]. Most modern engines (including [[automobile|cars]], [[truck]]s, [[bus]]es and [[tractor]]s) use a monoblock design of some type, therefore few modern engines have a separate block for each cylinder. This has led to the term \"engine block\" usually implying a monobloc design and the term monobloc itself is rarely used.\n\nIn the early years of the internal combustion engine, [[casting]] technology could produce either large castings, or castings with complex [[core (manufacturing)|internal cores]] to allow for water jackets, but not both simultaneously. Most early engines, particularly those with more than four cylinders, had their cylinders cast as pairs or triplets of cylinders, then bolted to a single crankcase.\n\nAs casting techniques improved, an entire cylinder block of 4, 6, or 8 cylinders could be produced in one piece. This monobloc construction was simpler and more cost effective to produce. For engines with an [[straight engine|inline]] configuration, this meant that all the cylinders, plus the crankcase, could be produced in a single component. One of the early engines produced using this method is the 4-cylinder engine in the [[Ford Model T]], introduced in 1908. The method spread to [[straight-six engine]]s and was commonly used by the mid-1920s.\n\nUp until the 1930s, most [[V engine]]s retained a separate block casting for each cylinder bank, with both bolted onto a common crankcase (itself a separate casting). For economy, some engines were designed to use identical castings for each bank, left and right.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, Buzzard\">{{cite book |title=The V12 Engine  |last=Ludvigsen  |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Ludvigsen  |publisher=Haynes Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=1-84425-004-0}}</ref>{{refpage|page=120}} A rare exception is the [[Lancia]] 22\u00bd\u00b0 narrow-angle V12 of 1919, which used a single block casting combining both banks.<ref name=\"Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, Buzzard\"/>{{refpage|pages=50-53}} The [[Ford flathead V-8]] \u2014 introduced in 1932 \u2014 represented a significant development in the production of affordable V engines.

The monobloc design also improved the mechanical stiffness of the engine against bending and the increasingly important torsional twist, as cylinder numbers, engine lengths, and power ratings increased.\n\n=== Integrated crankcase ===\nMost engine blocks today, except some unusual V or radial engines and large marine engines, are a monobloc for all the cylinders, plus an integrated crankcase. In such cases, the skirts of the cylinder banks form a crankcase area of sorts, which is still often called a crankcase despite no longer being a discrete part.\n\nUse of steel [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] liners and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] shells minimizes the effect of the relative softness of aluminium. Some engine designs use [[plasma transferred wire arc thermal spraying]] instead cylinder sleeves, to reduce weight. They can also be produced in [[compacted graphite iron]] (CGI) such as some diesel engines.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://foundrymag.com/materials/navistar-now-producing-engine-blocks-heads-cgi |title=Navistar Now Producing Engine Blocks, Heads in CGI |work=Foundry Management & Technology |first=Robert |last=Brooks |date=January 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 2, 2017}}</ref>\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Integrated cylinder head ===\n{{multiple image \n | title             = Integrated cylinder head engines\n | width             = 200\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | image1            = Daimler DB 605 cutaway.jpg\n | caption1          = [[DB 605]] inverted V12 aircraft engine\n | image2            = Honda GX 160 engine.jpg\n | caption2          = Honda GX 160 engine in a ride-on lawnmower\n}}\n\nSome modern consumer-grade [[small engine]]s use a monobloc design where the cylinder head, block, and half the crankcase share the same casting. One reason for this, apart from cost, is to produce an overall lower engine height. The disadvantage can be that repairs become more time-consuming and perhaps impractical. \n\nAn example of engines with integrated cylinder heads are the Honda [[list of Honda engines#Power equipment|GC]]-series and GXV-series engines, which are sometimes called \"Uniblock\" by Honda.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Honda General Purpose Engines: GC Series - Single Cylinder\n|url = http://www.perr.com/honda.html\n|url-status = dead\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101127185645/http://perr.com/honda.html\n|archivedate = 2010-11-27\n}} Includes sectioned drawings</ref>\n\n=== Integrated transmission ===\nSeveral cars with [[transverse engine]]s have used an engine block consisting of an integrated [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] and crankcase.

Farmer,&nbsp;Jr.]], and activist [[Bernice Fisher]] as they formed the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). Rustin was not a direct founder, but was \"an uncle of CORE,\" Farmer and Houser said later. CORE was conceived as a pacifist organization based on the writings of [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s who used [[non-violent resistance]] against British rule in [[India]].

During his incarceration, Rustin also organized FOR's Free India Committee. After his release from prison, he was frequently arrested for protesting against British colonial rule in [[India]] and Africa.\n\nJust before a trip to Africa while college secretary of the FOR, Rustin recorded a 10-inch LP for the Fellowship Records label.

The conference had been organized before Gandhi's assassination earlier that year. Between 1947 and 1952, Rustin also met with leaders of independence movements in [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. In 1951, he formed the Committee to Support South African Resistance, which later became the [[American Committee on Africa]].\n\nRustin was arrested in [[Pasadena, California]], in 1953 for sexual activity with another man in a parked car. Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of \"sex perversion\" (as [[sodomy]] was officially referred to in California then, even if consensual) and served 60 days in jail.

This was one of the most influential and widely commented upon [[Pacifism|pacifist]] essays in the United States. Rustin had wanted to keep his participation quiet, as he believed that his known sexual orientation would be used by critics as an excuse to compromise the 71-page pamphlet when it was published. It analyzed the [[Cold War]] and the American response to it, and recommended [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] solutions.\n\nRustin took leave from the War Resisters League in 1956 to advise minister [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] of the Baptist Church on Gandhian tactics. King was organizing the public transportation [[boycott]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], which became known as the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. According to Rustin, \"I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns.\" Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection, including a personal handgun.<ref>[http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin \"Bayard Rustin&nbsp;\u2013 Who Is This Man\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516061236/http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin |date=May 16, 2013 }}, ''State of the Reunion,'' radio show, aired February 2011 on NPR, 1:40\u20132:10.

Many African-American leaders were concerned that Rustin's sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. After the organization of the SCLC, Rustin and King planned a march. However, they did not plan on the march to be included in the Democratic National Convention. This did not sit well with U.S. Representative [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]] Powell threatened to leak to the press rumors of a fake affair between Rustin and King. King, acting in his interests, cancelled the march, and Rustin left his position in the SCLC. King received criticism for this action from ''Harper's'' magazine, which wrote about him, \"Lost much moral credit&nbsp;... in the eyes of the young\". Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his convictions were a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership.

Both men denied the allegation of an affair.\n\nRustin became involved in the March on Washington in 1962 when he was recruited by A. Philip Randolph. The march was planned to be a commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation one hundred years earlier.<ref name=Gates-Rivers/> Rustin was instrumental in organizing the march. He drilled off-duty police officers as marshals, bus captains to direct traffic, and scheduled the podium speakers. [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] and Rachelle Horowitz were aides.<ref name=\"WP-20110821\"/> Despite King's support, NAACP chairman [[Roy Wilkins]] did not want Rustin to receive any public credit for his role in planning the march.<ref name=\":7\" /> Roy Wilkins said, \"This march is of such importance that we must not put a person of his liabilities at the head.\" Because of this conflict, Randolph served as the director of the march and Rustin as his deputy. During the planning of the march, Rustin feared his previous legal issues would pose a threat to the march. U.S. Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] attacked him about them three weeks before the march.<ref name=Gates-Rivers/> Nevertheless, Rustin did become well known.

Prior to the boycott, the organizers asked the [[United Federation of Teachers]] Executive Board to join the boycott or ask teachers to join the picket lines. The union declined, promising only to protect from reprisals any teachers who participated. More than 400,000 New Yorkers participated in a one-day February 3, 1964 boycott. Historian [[Daniel Perlstein]] notes that \"newspapers were astounded both by the numbers of black and Puerto Rican parents and children who boycotted and by the complete absence of violence or disorder from the protesters.\"<ref name=\"perlstein\"/> It was, Rustin stated, and newspapers reported, \"the largest civil rights demonstration\" in American history. Rustin said that \"the movement to integrate the schools will create far-reaching benefits\" for teachers as well as students.<ref name=\"perlstein\">[http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/justice/downloads/pdf/the_end_of_despair.pdf Daniel Perlstein, \"The dead end of despair: Bayard Rustin, the 1968 New York school crisis, and the struggle for racial justice\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203513/http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/justice/downloads/pdf/the_end_of_despair.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}, New York City government</ref>\n\nThe protest demanded complete integration of the city's schools (which would require some whites to attend schools in black neighborhoods), and it challenged the coalition between African Americans and white liberals. An ensuing white backlash affected relations among the black leaders. Writing to black labor leaders, Rustin denounced Galamison for seeking to conduct another boycott in the spring, and soon abandoned the coalition.<ref name=\"perlstein\"/>\n\nRustin organized a May March 18 which called for \"maximum possible\" integration. Perlstein recounts. \"This goal was to be achieved through such modest programs as the construction of larger schools and the replacement of junior high schools with middle schools. The UFT and other white moderates endorsed the May rally, yet only four thousand protesters showed up, and the Board of Education was no more responsive to the conciliatory May demonstration than to the earlier, more confrontational boycott.\"<ref name=\"perlstein\"/>\n\nWhen Rustin was invited to speak at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1964, school administrators tried to ban him, out of fear that he would organize a school boycott there. The flagship state university and local schools were still segregated.\n\n===From protest to politics===\n{{anchor|From Protest to Politics}}\n\nIn the spring of 1964, Rev. Martin Luther King was considering hiring Rustin as executive director of SCLC, but was advised against it by [[Stanley Levison]], a longtime activist friend of Rustin's. He opposed the hire because of what he considered Rustin's growing devotion to the political theorist [[Max Shachtman]]. \"[[Shachtmanism|Shachtmanites]]\" have been described as an ideologically cultish group with ardently [[anti-communist]] positions, and attachments to the Democratic Party and the [[AFL-CIO]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CUI6tY9RJUYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pillar+of+fire&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NI0HVZrZMsHaUsWWgaAP&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=shachtman&f=false Taylor Branch, ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-1965'' (Simon & Schuster, 1999), p. 292-293] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406210727/https://books.google.com/books?id=CUI6tY9RJUYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=pillar+of+fire&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NI0HVZrZMsHaUsWWgaAP&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=shachtman&f=false |date=April 6, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]], which followed [[Freedom Summer]] in Mississippi, Rustin became an adviser to the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP); they were trying to gain recognition as the legitimate, non-[[Jim Crow]] delegation from their state, where blacks had been officially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] since the turn of the century (as they were generally throughout the South) and excluded from the official political system.

With [[Tom Kahn]], Rustin wrote an influential article in 1964 called \"From Protest to Politics,\" published in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine; it analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote presciently that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban African-American working class, particularly in northern states. He believed that the working class had to collaborate across racial lines for common economic goals. His prophecy has been proven right in the dislocation and loss of jobs for many urban African Americans due to restructuring of industry in the coming decades.\n\nRustin believed that the African-American community needed to change its political strategy, building and strengthening a political alliance with predominately white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. He wrote that it was time to move from protest to politics. Rustin's analysis of the economic problems of the Black community was widely influential.<ref>[[Staughton Lynd]], another civil rights activist, responded with an article entitled, \"Coalition Politics or Nonviolent Revolution?\"</ref>\n\nRustin argued that since black people could now legally sit in the restaurant after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they needed to be able to afford service financially. He believed that a coalition of progressive forces to move the Democratic Party forward was needed to change the economical structure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/2004/01/books/bayard-rustins-life-in-struggle|title=Bayard Rustin's Life in Struggle|last=Chandra|first=Mridu|date=2004-01-01|website=The Brooklyn Rail|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHe also argued that the African-American community was threatened by the appeal of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of \"[[Black power]].\" He thought this position was a fantasy of middle-class black people that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]], while alienating the white allies needed by the African-American community.

Podhoretz and the magazine promoted the [[neoconservative]] movement, which had implications for civil rights initiatives as well as other economic aspects of the society. In 1985, Rustin publicly praised Podhoretz for his refusal to \"pander to minority groups\" and for opposing affirmative action quotas in hiring as well as black studies programs in colleges.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/21/specials/podhoretz-25years.html Walter Goodman, \"Podhoretz on 25 Years at Commentary\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305093450/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/21/specials/podhoretz-25years.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}, ''The New York Times,'' January 31, 1985</ref>\n\nBecause of these positions, Rustin was criticized as a \"sell-out\" by many of his former colleagues in the civil rights movement, especially those connected to [[grassroots organizing]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gBH5GRFw-fkC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=bayard.+sell+out.+grassroots#v=onepage&q=bayard.%20sell%20out.%20grassroots&f=false|title=Bayard Rustin: American Dreamer|last=Podair|first=Jerald|date=December 16, 2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742564800|location=|pages=64, 77|language=en}}</ref> They charged that he was lured by the material comforts that came with a less radical and more professional type of activism.

He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social-democratic politics.\nHe was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL-CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper.\n\nOn the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]].

In particular, to maintain independent labor unions and political opposition in [[Vietnam]], Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the [[Vietnam War]], while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being \"angered and humiliated by the kind of war being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages.\"<ref>Rustin 2012, pp. 291-2</ref>\n\nAlong with [[Allard Lowenstein]] and [[Norman Thomas]], Rustin worked with the [[CIA]]-sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the Dominican Republic, which lent international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the socialist former president, [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0 Nathan Glazer \"A Word From Our Sponsor: Review of Hugh Wilford's The Mighty Wurlitzer\" ''The New York Times'', January 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909023200/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0 |date=September 9, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a human rights and [[Election monitoring|election monitor]] for [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=249|title=Freedom House: A History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823010319/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=249|archivedate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Rustin called for the U.S. to send military jets in the fight against [[Arab states]] by Israel; referring to a New York Times article he authored, Rustin wrote to Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] \"...I hope that the ad will also have an effect on a serious domestic question: namely, the relations between the Jewish and the Negro communities in America.\" Rustin was concerned about unity between two groups that he argued faced discrimination in America and abroad, and also believed that Israel's democratic ideals were proof that justice and equality would prevail in the Arab territories despite the atrocities of war. His former colleagues in the peace movement considered it to be a profound betrayal of Rustin's nonviolent ideals.<ref>[http://forusa.org/fellowship/2013/summer/book-review-i-must-resist/12390 Matthew Arlyck \"Review of I Must Resist: Letters of Bayard Rustin\" Fellowship of Reconciliation website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419182230/http://forusa.org/fellowship/2013/summer/book-review-i-must-resist/12390 |date=April 19, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRustin maintained his strongly anti-Soviet and anti-communist views later in his life, especially with regard to Africa. Rustin co-wrote with [[Carl Gershman]] (a former director of [[Social Democrats, USA]] and future [[Ronald Reagan]] appointee) an essay entitled \"Africa, Soviet Imperialism & the Retreat of American Power,\" in which he decried Russian and Cuban involvement in the [[Angolan Civil War]] and defended the military intervention by [[apartheid South Africa]] on behalf of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]). \"And if a South African force did intervene at the urging of ''black'' leaders and on the side of the forces that clearly represent the ''black'' majority in Angola, to counter a non-African army of Cubans ten times its size, by what standard of political judgment is this immoral?\" Rustin accused the Soviet Union of a classic imperialist agenda in Africa in pursuit of economic resources and vital sea lanes, and called the [[Carter Administration]] \"hypocritical\" for claiming to be committed to the welfare of blacks while doing too little to thwart Russian and Cuban expansion throughout Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/download/AfricaSovietImperialismAndTheRetreatOfAmericanPower/SDP2.pdf |title=Africa, Soviet Imperialism & The Retreat Of American Power |publisher=Social Democrats, U.S.A.|author=Bayard Rustin and Carl Gershman |date=October 1977|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Rustin helped found the [[Committee on the Present Danger]] (CPD) with Paul Nitze, leader of the CIAs [[Team B]] project. CPD promoted Team B's controversial intelligence claims about Soviet foreign policy, using them as an argument against arms control agreements such as [[SALT II]].

In 1986, he gave a speech \"The New Niggers Are Gays\", in which he asserted,\n\n{{quote|text=Today, blacks are no longer the litmus paper or the barometer of social change.

In 1986, Rustin was invited to contribute to the book ''In the Life: A Black Gay Anthology''. He declined, explaining\n\n<blockquote>I was not involved in the struggle for gay rights as a youth. ...I did not \"come out of the closet\" voluntarily\u2014circumstances forced me out. While I have no problem with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights. ...I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter.

Meeting with President Roosevelt in the [[Oval Office]], Randolph respectfully and politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that African Americans would march in the capital unless desegregation occurred. To prove their good faith, the organizers canceled the planned march after Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the [[Fair Employment Act]]), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies.

Impressed with Rustin's organizational skills, A.J. Muste appointed him as FOR's secretary for student and general affairs.\n\nRustin was also a pioneer in the movement to desegregate interstate bus travel. In 1942, he boarded a bus in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], bound for [[Nashville]], and sat in the second row. A number of drivers asked him to move to the back, according to Southern practice of [[Jim Crow]], but Rustin refused.

Rustin was not a direct founder, but was \"an uncle of CORE,\" Farmer and Houser said later.

During his incarceration, Rustin also organized FOR's Free India Committee. After his release from prison, he was frequently arrested for protesting against British colonial rule in [[India]] and Africa.\n\nJust before a trip to Africa while college secretary of the FOR, Rustin recorded a 10-inch LP for the Fellowship Records label.

The conference had been organized before Gandhi's assassination earlier that year. Between 1947 and 1952, Rustin also met with leaders of independence movements in [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. In 1951, he formed the Committee to Support South African Resistance, which later became the [[American Committee on Africa]].\n\nRustin was arrested in [[Pasadena, California]], in 1953 for sexual activity with another man in a parked car. Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of \"sex perversion\" (as [[sodomy]] was officially referred to in California then, even if consensual) and served 60 days in jail.

This was one of the most influential and widely commented upon [[Pacifism|pacifist]] essays in the United States.

It analyzed the [[Cold War]] and the American response to it, and recommended [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] solutions.\n\nRustin took leave from the War Resisters League in 1956 to advise minister [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] of the Baptist Church on Gandhian tactics. King was organizing the public transportation [[boycott]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], which became known as the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. According to Rustin, \"I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns.\" Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection, including a personal handgun.<ref>[http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin \"Bayard Rustin&nbsp;\u2013 Who Is This Man\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516061236/http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin |date=May 16, 2013 }}, ''State of the Reunion,'' radio show, aired February 2011 on NPR, 1:40\u20132:10.

Many African-American leaders were concerned that Rustin's sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. After the organization of the SCLC, Rustin and King planned a march. However, they did not plan on the march to be included in the Democratic National Convention. This did not sit well with U.S. Representative [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]] Powell threatened to leak to the press rumors of a fake affair between Rustin and King. King, acting in his interests, cancelled the march, and Rustin left his position in the SCLC. King received criticism for this action from ''Harper's'' magazine, which wrote about him, \"Lost much moral credit&nbsp;... in the eyes of the young\". Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his convictions were a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership.

The march was planned to be a commemoration of the Emancipation Proclamation one hundred years earlier.<ref name=Gates-Rivers/> Rustin was instrumental in organizing the march. He drilled off-duty police officers as marshals, bus captains to direct traffic, and scheduled the podium speakers.

During the planning of the march, Rustin feared his previous legal issues would pose a threat to the march. U.S. Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] attacked him about them three weeks before the march.<ref name=Gates-Rivers/> Nevertheless, Rustin did become well known.

Prior to the boycott, the organizers asked the [[United Federation of Teachers]] Executive Board to join the boycott or ask teachers to join the picket lines. The union declined, promising only to protect from reprisals any teachers who participated. More than 400,000 New Yorkers participated in a one-day February 3, 1964 boycott. Historian [[Daniel Perlstein]] notes that \"newspapers were astounded both by the numbers of black and Puerto Rican parents and children who boycotted and by the complete absence of violence or disorder from the protesters.\"<ref name=\"perlstein\"/> It was, Rustin stated, and newspapers reported, \"the largest civil rights demonstration\" in American history.

An ensuing white backlash affected relations among the black leaders. Writing to black labor leaders, Rustin denounced Galamison for seeking to conduct another boycott in the spring, and soon abandoned the coalition.<ref name=\"perlstein\"/>\n\nRustin organized a May March 18 which called for \"maximum possible\" integration. Perlstein recounts. \"This goal was to be achieved through such modest programs as the construction of larger schools and the replacement of junior high schools with middle schools. The UFT and other white moderates endorsed the May rally, yet only four thousand protesters showed up, and the Board of Education was no more responsive to the conciliatory May demonstration than to the earlier, more confrontational boycott.\"<ref name=\"perlstein\"/>\n\nWhen Rustin was invited to speak at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1964, school administrators tried to ban him, out of fear that he would organize a school boycott there.

With [[Tom Kahn]], Rustin wrote an influential article in 1964 called \"From Protest to Politics,\" published in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine; it analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote presciently that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban African-American working class, particularly in northern states. He believed that the working class had to collaborate across racial lines for common economic goals. His prophecy has been proven right in the dislocation and loss of jobs for many urban African Americans due to restructuring of industry in the coming decades.\n\nRustin believed that the African-American community needed to change its political strategy, building and strengthening a political alliance with predominately white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. He wrote that it was time to move from protest to politics. Rustin's analysis of the economic problems of the Black community was widely influential.<ref>[[Staughton Lynd]], another civil rights activist, responded with an article entitled, \"Coalition Politics or Nonviolent Revolution?\"</ref>\n\nRustin argued that since black people could now legally sit in the restaurant after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, they needed to be able to afford service financially. He believed that a coalition of progressive forces to move the Democratic Party forward was needed to change the economical structure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brooklynrail.org/2004/01/books/bayard-rustins-life-in-struggle|title=Bayard Rustin's Life in Struggle|last=Chandra|first=Mridu|date=2004-01-01|website=The Brooklyn Rail|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\nHe also argued that the African-American community was threatened by the appeal of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of \"[[Black power]].\" He thought this position was a fantasy of middle-class black people that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]], while alienating the white allies needed by the African-American community. ''Nation'' editor and [[Harvard Law School|Harvard Law]] Professor [[Randall Kennedy]] noted later that, while Rustin had a general \"disdain of nationalism,\" he had a \"very different attitude toward Jewish nationalism\" and was \"unflaggingly supportive of [[Zionism]].\"<ref name=\"thenation.com\">[http://www.thenation.com/article/protest-patronage?page=0,3 Randall Kennedy, \"From Protest to Patronage\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104194411/http://www.thenation.com/article/protest-patronage?page=0%2C3 |date=January 4, 2016 }}, ''The Nation,'' September 11, 2003</ref>\n\n''Commentary'' editor-in-chief [[Norman Podhoretz]] had commissioned the article from Rustin, and the two men remained intellectually and personally aligned for the next 20 years. Podhoretz and the magazine promoted the [[neoconservative]] movement, which had implications for civil rights initiatives as well as other economic aspects of the society. In 1985, Rustin publicly praised Podhoretz for his refusal to \"pander to minority groups\" and for opposing affirmative action quotas in hiring as well as black studies programs in colleges.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/21/specials/podhoretz-25years.html Walter Goodman, \"Podhoretz on 25 Years at Commentary\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305093450/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/21/specials/podhoretz-25years.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}, ''The New York Times,'' January 31, 1985</ref>\n\nBecause of these positions, Rustin was criticized as a \"sell-out\" by many of his former colleagues in the civil rights movement, especially those connected to [[grassroots organizing]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gBH5GRFw-fkC&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=bayard.+sell+out.+grassroots#v=onepage&q=bayard.%20sell%20out.%20grassroots&f=false|title=Bayard Rustin: American Dreamer|last=Podair|first=Jerald|date=December 16, 2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780742564800|location=|pages=64, 77|language=en}}</ref> They charged that he was lured by the material comforts that came with a less radical and more professional type of activism. While biographer [[John D'Emilio]] rejects these characterizations, Randall Kennedy wrote in a 2003 article that descriptions of Rustin as \"a bought man\" are \"at least partly true.\" <ref name=\"thenation.com\"/>\n\n===Labor movement: Unions and social democracy===\nRustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the African-American community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social-democratic politics.\nHe was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL-CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper.\n\nOn the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]]. In early 1972, he became a national co-chairman of the Socialist Party of America. In December 1972, when the Socialist Party changed its name to [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) by a vote of 73\u201334, Rustin continued to serve as national co-chairman, along with [[Charles S. Zimmerman]] of the [[International Ladies Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU).<ref name=\"NYTimes\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html |title=Socialist Party Now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|date=December 31, 1972 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 8, 2010}} (limited free access)</ref> In his opening speech to the December 1972 Convention, Co-Chairman Rustin called for SDUSA to organize against the \"reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration\"; Rustin also criticized the \"irresponsibility and \u00e9litism of the 'New Politics' liberals\".<ref name=\"NYTimes\"/> In later years, Rustin served as the national chairman of SDUSA.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Rustin was a member<ref>{{cite book|last1=Forman|first1=James|title=The Making of Black Revolutionaries|date=1972|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=220}}</ref> of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Clayborne|title=In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s|url=https://archive.org/details/instrugglesnccbl00cars_1|url-access=registration|date=1981|publisher=[[Harvard University]] Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/instrugglesnccbl00cars_1/page/29 29]}}</ref> He would remain a member for years, and became vice president during the 1980s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/WorkersRightsEastAndWestAComparativeStudyOfTradeUnionAnd|last1=Karatnycky|first1=Adrian|last2=Motyl|first2=Alexander J.|last3=Sturmthal|first3=Adolf|author3-link= Adolf Sturmthal |title=Workers' rights, East and West : a comparative study of trade union and workers' rights in Western democracies and Eastern Europe |date=1980|publisher=Transaction Publishing / [[League for Industrial Democracy]]|pages=150}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nLike many liberals and some socialists, Rustin supported President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[containment policy]] against [[communism]], while criticizing specific conduct of this policy. In particular, to maintain independent labor unions and political opposition in [[Vietnam]], Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the [[Vietnam War]], while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being \"angered and humiliated by the kind of war being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages.\"<ref>Rustin 2012, pp. 291-2</ref>\n\nAlong with [[Allard Lowenstein]] and [[Norman Thomas]], Rustin worked with the [[CIA]]-sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the Dominican Republic, which lent international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the socialist former president, [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0 Nathan Glazer \"A Word From Our Sponsor: Review of Hugh Wilford's The Mighty Wurlitzer\" ''The New York Times'', January 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909023200/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html?pagewanted=print&_r=0 |date=September 9, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a human rights and [[Election monitoring|election monitor]] for [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=249|title=Freedom House: A History|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823010319/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=249|archivedate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Rustin called for the U.S. to send military jets in the fight against [[Arab states]] by Israel; referring to a New York Times article he authored, Rustin wrote to Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] \"...I hope that the ad will also have an effect on a serious domestic question: namely, the relations between the Jewish and the Negro communities in America.\" Rustin was concerned about unity between two groups that he argued faced discrimination in America and abroad, and also believed that Israel's democratic ideals were proof that justice and equality would prevail in the Arab territories despite the atrocities of war. His former colleagues in the peace movement considered it to be a profound betrayal of Rustin's nonviolent ideals.<ref>[http://forusa.org/fellowship/2013/summer/book-review-i-must-resist/12390 Matthew Arlyck \"Review of I Must Resist: Letters of Bayard Rustin\" Fellowship of Reconciliation website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419182230/http://forusa.org/fellowship/2013/summer/book-review-i-must-resist/12390 |date=April 19, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRustin maintained his strongly anti-Soviet and anti-communist views later in his life, especially with regard to Africa. Rustin co-wrote with [[Carl Gershman]] (a former director of [[Social Democrats, USA]] and future [[Ronald Reagan]] appointee) an essay entitled \"Africa, Soviet Imperialism & the Retreat of American Power,\" in which he decried Russian and Cuban involvement in the [[Angolan Civil War]] and defended the military intervention by [[apartheid South Africa]] on behalf of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]). \"And if a South African force did intervene at the urging of ''black'' leaders and on the side of the forces that clearly represent the ''black'' majority in Angola, to counter a non-African army of Cubans ten times its size, by what standard of political judgment is this immoral?\" Rustin accused the Soviet Union of a classic imperialist agenda in Africa in pursuit of economic resources and vital sea lanes, and called the [[Carter Administration]] \"hypocritical\" for claiming to be committed to the welfare of blacks while doing too little to thwart Russian and Cuban expansion throughout Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/download/AfricaSovietImperialismAndTheRetreatOfAmericanPower/SDP2.pdf |title=Africa, Soviet Imperialism & The Retreat Of American Power |publisher=Social Democrats, U.S.A.|author=Bayard Rustin and Carl Gershman |date=October 1977|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Rustin helped found the [[Committee on the Present Danger]] (CPD) with Paul Nitze, leader of the CIAs [[Team B]] project. CPD promoted Team B's controversial intelligence claims about Soviet foreign policy, using them as an argument against arms control agreements such as [[SALT II]]. This cemented Rustin's leading role in the neoconservative movement.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_JX04sBnEWUC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=committee+on+the+present+danger+members,+rustin&source=bl&ots=McPgDKvLmg&sig=XNcW-pyaNXbU4KoEwBa57v54vl4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=viQcVfa_LYqSsQS0l4CYCw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=bayard%20rustin&f=false John Ehrman, The Rise of Neoconservatism: Intellectuals and Foreign Affairs, 1945-1994 (Yale University Press, 1996), p. 107-114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610060721/https://books.google.com/books?id=_JX04sBnEWUC&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=committee+on+the+present+danger+members%2C+rustin&source=bl&ots=McPgDKvLmg&sig=XNcW-pyaNXbU4KoEwBa57v54vl4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=viQcVfa_LYqSsQS0l4CYCw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ |date=June 10, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== Soviet Jewry movement ===\n{{Main|Soviet Jewry Movement}}\nThe plight of Jews in the Soviet Union reminded Rustin of the struggles that blacks faced in the United States.

Members of the panel included [[Telford Taylor]], the Nuremberg war trial prosecutor and Columbia University professor of law; Dr. John C.

In 1986, he gave a speech \"The New Niggers Are Gays\", in which he asserted,\n\n{{quote|text=Today, blacks are no longer the litmus paper or the barometer of social change.

In 1986, Rustin was invited to contribute to the book ''In the Life: A Black Gay Anthology''. He declined, explaining\n\n<blockquote>I was not involved in the struggle for gay rights as a youth. ...I did not \"come out of the closet\" voluntarily\u2014circumstances forced me out. While I have no problem with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights. ...I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter.
