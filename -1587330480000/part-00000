Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Scholars reject Smith's claims of ancient origin and consider the book a fabrication by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from contemporary 19th-century works rather than translating an ancient record.

To provide support towards the existence of the plates, Smith included two statements in the Book of Mormon saying that the [[Book of Mormon witnesses]] had been shown the plates, and their testimony is typically published at the beginning of the Book of Mormon. While none of these men ever retracted their statement, critics nevertheless discount these testimonies for varying reasons, one of which is because most of these men were closely interrelated.  In later years Martin Harris, one of the witnesses, is recorded to have confessed that none of the witnesses saw the plates with their natural eyes but only through a vision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brodie|first1=Fawn M.|title=No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet|date=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679730540|page=[https://archive.org/details/nomanknowsmyhist00brod_1/page/78 78]|edition=2. ed., rev.and enl., 1.

There they produced a new type of Egyptian at this time which was Meroitic (I've got a picture of it here).  When you compare the Anthon transcripts with Meroitic, it's very impressive. In fact, Brother Bushman back at Brown University (which is one of the four universities in the country where Egyptian has always been a big thing), showed them the Anthon transcript, and Parker immediately recognized them as Meroitic.

(See [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|Settlement of the Americas]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]).\n\nThe mainstream scientific consensus about the origin of the ancient Americans and peoples is apparently at odds with the claims put forth in the Book of Mormon, although [[Mormon apologetics|Mormon apologists]] have made efforts to reconcile these apparent contradictions.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints released an essay on their website titled \"Book of Mormon and DNA Studies\".

To provide support towards the existence of the plates, Smith included two statements in the Book of Mormon saying that the [[Book of Mormon witnesses]] had been shown the plates, and their testimony is typically published at the beginning of the Book of Mormon. While none of these men ever retracted their statement, critics nevertheless discount these testimonies for varying reasons, one of which is because most of these men were closely interrelated.

This conclusion from a genetic perspective supports a large amount of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic evidence that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. (See [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|Settlement of the Americas]] and [[Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]).\n\nThe mainstream scientific consensus about the origin of the ancient Americans and peoples is apparently at odds with the claims put forth in the Book of Mormon, although [[Mormon apologetics|Mormon apologists]] have made efforts to reconcile these apparent contradictions.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints released an essay on their website titled \"Book of Mormon and DNA Studies\".

Ritner concludes, contrary to the LDS position, due to the microfilms being published prior to the rediscovery of the Joseph Smith Papyri, that \"it is not true that 'no eyewitness account of the translation survives'\", that the Book of Abraham is \"confirmed as a perhaps well-meaning, but erroneous invention by Joseph Smith\", and \"despite its inauthenticity as a genuine historical narrative, the Book of Abraham remains a valuable witness to early American religious history and to the recourse to ancient texts as sources of modern religious faith and speculation\".<ref name=ritnerresponse>{{Citation|url=http://signaturebooks.com/a-response-to-translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham-by-dr-robert-ritner/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20161022063517/http://signaturebooks.com/a-response-to-translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham-by-dr-robert-ritner/|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 22, 2016|title=A Response to 'Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham'|first=Robert K.|last=Ritner|authorlink=Robert K.
