Its screenplay, by [[James Ivory]], who also co-produced, is based on the [[Call Me by Your Name (novel)|2007 novel of the same name]] by [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]]. The film is the final installment in Guadagnino's thematic \"Desire\" trilogy, after ''[[I Am Love (film)|I Am Love]]'' (2009), and ''[[A Bigger Splash (2015 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'' (2015). Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of [[1983]]. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver commands Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

Set in 1983 in northern Italy, ''Call Me by Your Name'' chronicles the romantic relationship between a 17-year-old, [[Elio Perlman]] ([[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]]), and Oliver ([[Armie Hammer]]), a 24-year-old graduate-student assistant to Elio's father ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), an archaeology professor. The film also stars the French actresses [[Amira Casar]], [[Esther Garrel]], and [[Victoire Du Bois]].\n\nDevelopment began in 2007 when producers [[Peter Spears]] and [[Howard Rosenman]] [[optioned]] the rights to Aciman's novel. Ivory had been chosen to co-direct with Guadagnino, but stepped down in 2016. Guadagnino had joined the project as a [[location scout]], and eventually became sole director, and co-producer. ''Call Me by Your Name'' was financed by several international companies, and its [[principal photography]] took place mainly in the city and {{Lang|it|[[comune]]}} of [[Crema, Lombardy]], between May and June 2016. Cinematographer [[Sayombhu Mukdeeprom]] used [[35mm movie film|35 mm film]], as opposed to employing [[digital cinematography]]. The filmmakers spent weeks decorating [[Villa Albergoni]], one of the main shooting locations. Guadagnino curated [[Call Me by Your Name: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|the film's soundtrack]], which features two original songs by American singer-songwriter [[Sufjan Stevens]].\n\n[[Sony Pictures Classics]] acquired <!-- US-only? -->distribution rights to ''Call Me by Your Name'' before its premiere at the [[2017 Sundance Film Festival]] on January 22, 2017. The film began a [[limited release]] in the United States on November 24, 2017, and went on general release on January 19, 2018. It received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Ivory's screenplay, Guadagnino's direction, and the performances of Chalamet, Hammer, and Stuhlbarg. The film garnered [[List of accolades received by Call Me by Your Name (film)|a number of accolades]], including many for its screenplay, direction, acting, and music. It received four nominations at the [[90th Academy Awards]] (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]), winning for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The screenplay also won at the [[23rd Critics' Choice Awards]], [[71st British Academy Film Awards]], and the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2017]].\n\n==Plot==\nIt is the summer of [[1983]]. [[Elio Perlman|Elio]], a 17-year-old [[Jewish American]], lives with his parents in rural [[northern Italy]]. Elio's father, a professor of archaeology, invites a 24-year-old graduate student, Oliver, who is also Jewish-American, to live with the family over the summer and help with his academic paperwork. Elio, an introspective [[bibliophile]] and a talented musician, initially thinks he has little in common with Oliver, who has a carefree and exuberant personality. Elio resents having to give up his bedroom to Oliver for the duration of his stay, and spends much of the summer reading, playing piano, and hanging out with childhood friend, Marzia. Meanwhile, Oliver admits being attracted to one of the local girls, much to Elio's annoyance.\n\nElio and Oliver swim together, go for long walks into town, and accompany Elio's father on an archaeological trip. Elio begins a sexual relationship with Marzia and brags about it in front of Oliver to gauge his reaction, but nonetheless finds himself increasingly attracted to him. During a trip to the local post office, Elio indirectly confesses his feelings to Oliver, who tells him he should not act on them. Later that day, the two kiss, but Oliver is reluctant to go any further. They grow distant.\n\nIn response to a note from Elio, Oliver leaves a message on his desk suggesting they meet at midnight. Elio spends the day with Marzia, but longs to see Oliver. At midnight, he approaches Oliver and their rendezvous results in the two sleeping together for the first time. They become more physically and emotionally intimate in the days that follow, frequenting sexual encounters while still keeping their relationship a secret. One day, in bed, Oliver commands Elio, \"Call me by your name and I'll call you by mine.\" Now completely smitten with Oliver, Elio starts avoiding Marzia.\n\nAs the end of Oliver's stay approaches, he and Elio both find themselves overcome by uncertainty and longing. Elio's parents, who are privately aware of the bond between the two but do not address it openly, recommend he and Oliver visit [[Bergamo]] together before Oliver returns home to the U.S. They spend three romantic days together. Elio, heartbroken after Oliver's departure, calls his mother and asks her to pick him up from the train station and take him home. Marzia is sympathetic to Elio's feelings and says she wants to remain friends. Elio's father, observing his deep sadness, tells him he was aware of his relationship with Oliver and confesses to almost having had a similar relationship in his own youth. He urges Elio to learn from his grief and grow, instead of just moving on too quickly.\n\nDuring [[Hanukkah]], Oliver calls Elio's family to tell them he is engaged to be married. He tells Elio that he remembers everything very clearly. After the call, Elio sits down by the fireplace and stares into the flames, tearfully reminiscing, as his parents and the house staff prepare a holiday dinner. The movie ends when Elio, still seated by the fireplace and now appearing to be more content, throws a glance into the camera as his mother calls for him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet]] as [[Elio Perlman]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as Oliver\n* [[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as Samuel Perlman{{efn|Mr. Perlman's full name is mentioned in the film as Samuel Perlman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|title=Michael Stuhlbarg's 'fragile balancing act' in playing a supportive dad in 'Call Me by Your Name'|first=Margy|last=Rochlin|date=December 21, 2017|accessdate=July 2, 2018|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122213946/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-michael-stuhlbarg-20171220-story.html|archivedate=January 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n* [[Amira Casar]] as Annella Perlman\n* [[Esther Garrel]] as Marzia\n* [[Victoire Du Bois]] as Chiara\n* Vanda Capriolo as Mafalda\n* Antonio Rimoldi as Anchise\n* Elena Bucci as Bambi\n* Marco Sgrosso as Nico\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Aciman]] as Mounir\n* [[Peter Spears]] as Isaac\n* [[Beppe Grillo]] as himself <small>(archive footage)</small><ref>{{cite news|last=Gallo|first=Francesco|date=February 14, 2017|title=Luca Guadagnino, la mia storia gay per famiglie|trans-title=Luca Guadagnino, my gay story for families|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/2017/02/13/luca-guadagnino-la-mia-storia-gay-per-famiglie_ab6bd724-d152-4b18-a45a-6dc8e991485d.html|language=it|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Styles and themes==\n''Call Me by Your Name'' is the final installment in a thematic trilogy Guadagnino calls his \"Desire\" trilogy;

An apartment building or student [[hall of residence]] may have a shared laundry facility such as a ''[[tv\u00e4ttstuga]]''. A stand-alone business is referred to as a [[self-service laundry]] (launderette in [[British English]] or laundromat in [[American English]]). The material that is being washed, or has been laundered, is also generally referred to as ''laundry''.\n\nLaundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship. Laundry work has traditionally been [[Occupational segregation|highly gendered]], with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (known as laundresses or [[washerwoman|washerwomen]]). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanised solutions to laundry work, notably the [[washing machine]] and later the [[tumble dryer]]. Laundry, like cooking and child care, is done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.<ref>https://thescrubba.com/blogs/news/how-people-used-to-wash-the-fascinating-history-of-laundry</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Watercourses ===\n[[File:Laundry 1806.PNG|thumb|\"Man and woman washing linen in a brook\", from [[William Henry Pyne]]'s ''Microcosm'' (1806). Unusually, this is depicted as a mixed-sex activity.]]\n\nLaundry was first done in watercourses, letting the water carry away the materials which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done this way in the rural regions of poor countries. [[Agitation (action)|Agitation]] helps remove the dirt, so the laundry was rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. One name for this surface is a beetling-stone, related to [[beetling]], a technique in the production of linen; one name for a wooden substitute is a battling-block.<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last1=Katz-Hyman|first1=Martha B.|last2=editors|first2=Kym S.

Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply were gradually replaced by portable rub boards, including factory-made corrugated glass or metal [[washboard (laundry)|washboards]].\n\nOnce clean, the clothes were rinsed and then wrung out \u2014 twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or [[clothes line]]s to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass, bushes, or trees. Finally, they were ironed.\n\n=== Washhouses ===\n{{Main|Lavoir}}\n[[File:Brogi, Carlo (1850-1925) - n. 12182 - Sanremo - Popolane al lavatojo.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Sanremo]], Italy, at about the turn of the 20th century]]\n[[File:Tanque das Lavandeiras - comunitario II.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Cabe\u00e7\u00e3o]], Portugal, today. Note the two basins and inclined stone lip.]]\nBefore the advent of the [[washing machine]], laundry was often done in a communal setting.\n\nVillages across Europe that could afford it built a wash-house, sometimes known by the French name of ''[[lavoir]]''. Water was channelled from a stream or spring and fed into a building, possibly just a roof with no walls. This wash-house usually contained two basins \u2013 one for washing and the other for rinsing \u2013 through which the water was constantly flowing, as well as a stone lip inclined towards the water against which the wet laundry could be beaten. Such facilities were more comfortable and convenient than washing in a watercourse. Some lavoirs had the wash-basins at waist height, although others remained on the ground. The launderers were protected to some extent from rain, and their travel was reduced, as the facilities were usually at hand in the village or at the edge of a town. These facilities were public and available to all families, and usually used by the entire village. Many of these village wash-houses are still standing, historic structures with no obvious modern purpose.\n\nThe job of doing the laundry was [[occupational segregation|reserved for women]], who washed all their family's laundry. [[Washerwoman|Washerwomen]] (laundresses) took in the laundry of others, charging by the piece. As such, wash-houses were an obligatory stop in many women's weekly lives and became a sort of institution or meeting place. It was a [[women-only space]] where they could discuss issues or simply chat (cf the concept of the [[village pump]]). Indeed, this tradition is reflected in the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] idiom \"''fer safareig''\" (literally, \"to do the laundry\"), which means to gossip.\n\nEuropean cities also had public wash-houses. The city authorities wanted to give the poorer population, who would otherwise not have access to laundry facilities, the opportunity to wash their clothes. Sometimes these facilities were combined with [[public baths]], see for example [[Baths and wash houses in Britain]]. The aim was to foster hygiene and thus reduce outbreaks of epidemics.\n\nSometimes large metal cauldrons (a \"[[wash copper]]\", even when not made of that metal),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Clarendon Press|edition= Second|volume=III|isbn=0-19-861215-X|page=908: copper 3.a}}</ref> were filled with fresh water and heated over a fire, as hot or boiling water is more effective than cold in removing dirt. A [[posser]] could be used to agitate clothes in a tub.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oldandinteresting.com/laundry-ponches-punches.aspx |title=Ponch, punch or ? |publisher=OldandInteresting.com |accessdate=2014-03-06}}</ref> A related implement called a washing dolly is \"a wooden stick or mallet with an attached cluster of legs or pegs\" that moves the cloth through the water.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Maxwell|first1=Lee|title=Save womens lives : history of washing machines|date=2003|publisher=Oldewash|location=Eaton, CO|isbn=9780972971003|page=8|edition= 1st}}</ref>\n\n=== Washing machines and other devices ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Woman's Friend - Indiana State Museum - DSC00433.JPG|thumb|The \"Woman's Friend\" washing machine, circa 1890 U.S.]]\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] completely transformed laundry technology. [[Christina Hardyment]], in her history from the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, argues that it was the development of domestic machinery that led to [[women's liberation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hardyment|first1=Christina|title=From mangle to microwave : the mechanization of household work|date=1988|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0745602061|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/frommangletomicr0000hard}}</ref>\n\nThe [[mangle (machine)|mangle]] (or \"wringer\" in [[American English]]) was developed in the 19th century \u2014 two long rollers in a frame and a crank to revolve them. A laundry-worker took sopping wet clothing and cranked it through the mangle, compressing the cloth and expelling the excess water. The mangle was much quicker than hand twisting. It was a variation on the [[box mangle]] used primarily for pressing and smoothing cloth.\n\nMeanwhile, 19th-century inventors further mechanized the laundry process with various hand-operated [[washing machine]]s to replace tedious hand rubbing against a washboard. Most involved turning a handle to move paddles inside a tub. Then some early-20th-century machines used an electrically powered [[agitator (device)|agitator]].

For wool garments, this is due to scales on the fibers, which heat and agitation cause to stick together. In cold countries they dry it with their fireplaces, others just have many or buy more garments in preparation for winter or cold times.  Other fabrics are stretched by mechanical forces during production, and can shrink slightly when heated (though to a lesser degree than wool). Some clothes are \"pre-shrunk\" to avoid this problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=98759520|title=Why Clothes Shrink}}</ref>\n\nAnother common problem is color bleeding. For example, washing a red shirt with white underwear can result in pink underwear. Often only similar colors are washed together to avoid this problem, which is lessened by cold water and repeated washings. Sometimes this blending of colors is seen as a [[selling point]], as with [[Madras (cloth)|madras cloth]].\n\n[[Laundry symbol]]s are included on many clothes to help consumers avoid these problems.\n\nSynthetic fibers in laundry can also contribute to [[microplastic]] pollution.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1504135112 |pmid=25944930 |pmc=4426466 |title=News Feature: Microplastics present pollution puzzle |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=18 |pages=5547\u20135549 |year=2015 |last1=Katsnelson |first1=Alla |bibcode=2015PNAS..112.5547K }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''laundry'' comes from [[Middle English]] lavendrye, laundry, from [[Old French]] ''lavanderie'', from lavandier.<ref name=\"Laundry\"/>\n\n==In culture==\n[[File:0 Bruxelles - Petit Sablon - Blanchisseur.JPG|thumb|''The launderer'' by [[Jef Lambeaux]]]]\n\nIn [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Princess [[Nausicaa]] and her handmaidens are washing laundry by the shore when they see and rescue the ship-wrecked [[Odysseus|Ulysses]].\n\nA [[washerwoman]] is the disguise adopted by Toad in ''[[Wind in the Willows]]''.\n\nThe film ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'' features two laundry entrepreneurs.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of laundry topics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links |wikt=laundry |commons=Category:Laundry |b=Laundry_separation_and_washing |n=no |q=no |s=no |v=no |voy=Laundry |species=no |d=no |display=Laundry }}\n\n{{Laundry navbox}}\n{{Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Laundry|*]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Santarfas washing place.jpg|thumb|[[Santarfa]]'s laundry place ([[Ethiopia]])]]\n[[File:Italian hanging laundry.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Laundry is hung to dry above an Italian street.]]\n[[File:Laundry in Paris.jpg|thumb|A [[self-service laundry]] in Paris]]\n[[File:Laundry in the river.jpg|thumb|Laundry in the river in contemporary [[Abidjan]]]]\n\n'''Laundry''' refers to the washing of clothing and other textiles.<ref name=\"Laundry\">{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/laundry|title=Laundry|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref> Laundry processes are often done in a room reserved for that purpose; in an individual home this is referred to as a [[laundry room]], Laundry in Australian English or [[utility room]]. An apartment building or student [[hall of residence]] may have a shared laundry facility such as a ''[[tv\u00e4ttstuga]]''. A stand-alone business is referred to as a [[self-service laundry]] (launderette in [[British English]] or laundromat in [[American English]]). The material that is being washed, or has been laundered, is also generally referred to as ''laundry''.\n\nLaundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship. Laundry work has traditionally been [[Occupational segregation|highly gendered]], with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (known as laundresses or [[washerwoman|washerwomen]]). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanised solutions to laundry work, notably the [[washing machine]] and later the [[tumble dryer]]. Laundry, like cooking and child care, is done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.<ref>https://thescrubba.com/blogs/news/how-people-used-to-wash-the-fascinating-history-of-laundry</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Watercourses ===\n[[File:Laundry 1806.PNG|thumb|\"Man and woman washing linen in a brook\", from [[William Henry Pyne]]'s ''Microcosm'' (1806). Unusually, this is depicted as a mixed-sex activity.]]\n\nLaundry was first done in watercourses, letting the water carry away the materials which could cause stains and smells. Laundry is still done this way in the rural regions of poor countries. [[Agitation (action)|Agitation]] helps remove the dirt, so the laundry was rubbed, twisted, or slapped against flat rocks. One name for this surface is a beetling-stone, related to [[beetling]], a technique in the production of linen; one name for a wooden substitute is a battling-block.<ref name=\"Greenwood\">{{cite book|last1=Katz-Hyman|first1=Martha B.|last2=editors|first2=Kym S.

Wooden or stone scrubbing surfaces set up near a water supply were gradually replaced by portable rub boards, including factory-made corrugated glass or metal [[washboard (laundry)|washboards]].\n\nOnce clean, the clothes were rinsed and then wrung out \u2014 twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or [[clothes line]]s to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass, bushes, or trees. Finally, they were ironed.\n\n=== Washhouses ===\n{{Main|Lavoir}}\n[[File:Brogi, Carlo (1850-1925) - n. 12182 - Sanremo - Popolane al lavatojo.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Sanremo]], Italy, at about the turn of the 20th century]]\n[[File:Tanque das Lavandeiras - comunitario II.jpg|thumb|Washhouse in [[Cabe\u00e7\u00e3o]], Portugal, today. Note the two basins and inclined stone lip.]]\nBefore the advent of the [[washing machine]], laundry was often done in a communal setting.\n\nVillages across Europe that could afford it built a wash-house, sometimes known by the French name of ''[[lavoir]]''. Water was channelled from a stream or spring and fed into a building, possibly just a roof with no walls. This wash-house usually contained two basins \u2013 one for washing and the other for rinsing \u2013 through which the water was constantly flowing, as well as a stone lip inclined towards the water against which the wet laundry could be beaten. Such facilities were more comfortable and convenient than washing in a watercourse. Some lavoirs had the wash-basins at waist height, although others remained on the ground. The launderers were protected to some extent from rain, and their travel was reduced, as the facilities were usually at hand in the village or at the edge of a town. These facilities were public and available to all families, and usually used by the entire village. Many of these village wash-houses are still standing, historic structures with no obvious modern purpose.\n\nThe job of doing the laundry was [[occupational segregation|reserved for women]], who washed all their family's laundry. [[Washerwoman|Washerwomen]] (laundresses) took in the laundry of others, charging by the piece. As such, wash-houses were an obligatory stop in many women's weekly lives and became a sort of institution or meeting place. It was a [[women-only space]] where they could discuss issues or simply chat (cf the concept of the [[village pump]]). Indeed, this tradition is reflected in the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] idiom \"''fer safareig''\" (literally, \"to do the laundry\"), which means to gossip.\n\nEuropean cities also had public wash-houses. The city authorities wanted to give the poorer population, who would otherwise not have access to laundry facilities, the opportunity to wash their clothes. Sometimes these facilities were combined with [[public baths]], see for example [[Baths and wash houses in Britain]]. The aim was to foster hygiene and thus reduce outbreaks of epidemics.\n\nSometimes large metal cauldrons (a \"[[wash copper]]\", even when not made of that metal),<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Clarendon Press|edition= Second|volume=III|isbn=0-19-861215-X|page=908: copper 3.a}}</ref> were filled with fresh water and heated over a fire, as hot or boiling water is more effective than cold in removing dirt.

[[Christina Hardyment]], in her history from the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851, argues that it was the development of domestic machinery that led to [[women's liberation]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hardyment|first1=Christina|title=From mangle to microwave : the mechanization of household work|date=1988|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0745602061|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/frommangletomicr0000hard}}</ref>\n\nThe [[mangle (machine)|mangle]] (or \"wringer\" in [[American English]]) was developed in the 19th century \u2014 two long rollers in a frame and a crank to revolve them. A laundry-worker took sopping wet clothing and cranked it through the mangle, compressing the cloth and expelling the excess water. The mangle was much quicker than hand twisting. It was a variation on the [[box mangle]] used primarily for pressing and smoothing cloth.\n\nMeanwhile, 19th-century inventors further mechanized the laundry process with various hand-operated [[washing machine]]s to replace tedious hand rubbing against a washboard. Most involved turning a handle to move paddles inside a tub. Then some early-20th-century machines used an electrically powered [[agitator (device)|agitator]]. Many of these washing machines were simply a tub on legs, with a hand-operated mangle on top. Later the mangle too was electrically powered, then replaced by a perforated double tub, which spun out the excess water in a spin cycle.\n\nLaundry drying was also mechanized, with [[clothes dryer]]s.

Some organizations have been campaigning against legislation which has outlawed line-drying of clothing in public places, especially given the increased [[greenhouse gas]] emissions produced by some types of electrical power generation needed to power electric clothes dryers, since driers can constitute a considerable fraction of a home's total energy usage.\n\nFlorida (\"the Sunshine State\") is the only state to expressly guarantee a right to dry, although Utah and Hawaii have passed solar rights legislation.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} A Florida law explicitly states: \"No deed restrictions, covenants, or similar binding agreements running with the land shall prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting solar collectors, clotheslines, or other energy devices based on renewable resources from being installed on buildings erected on the lots or parcels covered by the deed restrictions, covenants, or binding agreements.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.flsenate.gov/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=Ch0163/SEC04.HTM&Title=-%3E2008-%3ECh0163-%3ESection%2004#0163.04|title=The 2008 Florida Statutes (chapter: Energy devices based on renewable resources)|volume=163|issue=4|year=2008|publisher=[[Florida Senate]]|journal=|access-date=2020-02-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503144033/http://www.flsenate.gov/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute#0163.04|archive-date=2007-05-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> No other state has such clearcut legislation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Vermont considered a \"Right to Dry\" bill in 1999, but it was defeated in the Senate Natural Resources & Energy Committee.  The language has been included in a 2007 voluntary [[energy conservation]] bill, introduced by Senator [[Dick McCormack]]. Legislation making it possible for thousands of American families to start using clotheslines in communities where they were formerly banned was passed in Colorado in 2008. In 2009, clothesline legislation was debated in the states of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, Nebraska, Oregon, Virginia, and Vermont. Other states{{which|date=September 2013}} are considering similar bills.{{clarify|date=September 2013}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nSimilar measures have been introduced in Canada, in particular the province of Ontario.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n== Common problems ==\n[[File:NewBritainUnderwearWashingDirections.jpg|thumb|Directions for hand-washing New Britain Standard Hygienic Underwear, circa 1915]]\n\nNovice users of modern laundry machines sometimes experience accidental [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] of garments, especially when applying heat. For wool garments, this is due to scales on the fibers, which heat and agitation cause to stick together. In cold countries they dry it with their fireplaces, others just have many or buy more garments in preparation for winter or cold times.  Other fabrics are stretched by mechanical forces during production, and can shrink slightly when heated (though to a lesser degree than wool). Some clothes are \"pre-shrunk\" to avoid this problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=98759520|title=Why Clothes Shrink}}</ref>\n\nAnother common problem is color bleeding. For example, washing a red shirt with white underwear can result in pink underwear. Often only similar colors are washed together to avoid this problem, which is lessened by cold water and repeated washings. Sometimes this blending of colors is seen as a [[selling point]], as with [[Madras (cloth)|madras cloth]].\n\n[[Laundry symbol]]s are included on many clothes to help consumers avoid these problems.\n\nSynthetic fibers in laundry can also contribute to [[microplastic]] pollution.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1504135112 |pmid=25944930 |pmc=4426466 |title=News Feature: Microplastics present pollution puzzle |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=18 |pages=5547\u20135549 |year=2015 |last1=Katsnelson |first1=Alla |bibcode=2015PNAS..112.5547K }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''laundry'' comes from [[Middle English]] lavendrye, laundry, from [[Old French]] ''lavanderie'', from lavandier.<ref name=\"Laundry\"/>\n\n==In culture==\n[[File:0 Bruxelles - Petit Sablon - Blanchisseur.JPG|thumb|''The launderer'' by [[Jef Lambeaux]]]]\n\nIn [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Princess [[Nausicaa]] and her handmaidens are washing laundry by the shore when they see and rescue the ship-wrecked [[Odysseus|Ulysses]].\n\nA [[washerwoman]] is the disguise adopted by Toad in ''[[Wind in the Willows]]''.\n\nThe film ''[[My Beautiful Laundrette]]'' features two laundry entrepreneurs.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of laundry topics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links |wikt=laundry |commons=Category:Laundry |b=Laundry_separation_and_washing |n=no |q=no |s=no |v=no |voy=Laundry |species=no |d=no |display=Laundry }}\n\n{{Laundry navbox}}\n{{Clothing}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Laundry|*]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "45.251.33.15", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added brief about history in india)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry"}
