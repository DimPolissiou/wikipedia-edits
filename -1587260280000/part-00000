The character has starred in three self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. In 2008, Hercules debuted in his own series titled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]''. The character was ranked 21st in [[IGN]]'s list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\",<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/21 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and has appeared in various forms of media including television series and video games.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was adapted from mythology by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nHercules debuted in ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #10 (Nov. 1964) as a minion of Immortus, although his appearance was revealed in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 \u2013 Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became ''[[Journey into Mystery]] Annual'' #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=169}}</ref>\n\nHercules became a regular guest star in the title ''Thor'', appearing in issue #126 (March 1966). The character guest-starred in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #79 (May 1966), and his deadlocked battle with the [[Hulk]], as told by Lee, Kirby, and [[Bill Everett]], has come to be regarded as a classic. The tale parallels Hercules and the Hulk's titanic strength, short temper, and simple-mindedness, while contrasting their lot in life: Hercules being a beloved hero and pampered celebrity, while the Hulk is a hated and feared fugitive. The character teamed up with the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' in issue #38 (March 1967), but was not yet an official member; he was merely a guest of the Avengers during his banishment from Olympus. In issue #45 of ''The Avengers'', Hercules became a \"full-fledged Avenger\" by way of Goliath's announcement to the press during the first annual \"Avengers Day\".  Hercules also guest starred in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #28 (Dec. 1974) and ''Marvel Premiere'' #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975 \u2013 Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17\u201323|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> After this, Hercules made a guest appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #44 (Oct. 1978).\n\nHercules starred in two limited series by writer-artist [[Bob Layton]], with both set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]. A 24th century version of Hercules starred in ''Hercules'' #1 - 4 (Sep. \u2013 Dec. 1982), which was popular enough to spawn a sequel, ''Hercules'' vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March \u2013 June 1984). The storylines dealt with Hercules's [[exile]] from [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity.\n\nHercules remained a constant guest star in both ''Thor'' and the ''Avengers'', playing a significant role in the \"Avengers Under Siege\" storyline in ''Avengers'' #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 \u2013 March 1987), involving supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]].

The character has starred in three self-titled [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] and been a perennial member of the [[superhero]] team the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. In 2008, Hercules debuted in his own series titled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]''. The character was ranked 21st in [[IGN]]'s list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\",<ref>{{cite web |last= |first= |date=April 30, 2012 |title=The Top 50 Avengers |url=http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/21 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and has appeared in various forms of media including television series and video games.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was adapted from mythology by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-plotter [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nHercules debuted in ''[[Avengers (comic book)|Avengers]]'' #10 (Nov. 1964) as a minion of Immortus, although his appearance was revealed in the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[Avengers Forever]]'' #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 \u2013 Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became ''[[Journey into Mystery]] Annual'' #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=169}}</ref>\n\nHercules became a regular guest star in the title ''Thor'', appearing in issue #126 (March 1966). The character guest-starred in ''[[Tales To Astonish]]'' #79 (May 1966), and his deadlocked battle with the [[Hulk]], as told by Lee, Kirby, and [[Bill Everett]], has come to be regarded as a classic. The tale parallels Hercules and the Hulk's titanic strength, short temper, and simple-mindedness, while contrasting their lot in life: Hercules being a beloved hero and pampered celebrity, while the Hulk is a hated and feared fugitive. The character teamed up with the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' in issue #38 (March 1967), but was not yet an official member; he was merely a guest of the Avengers during his banishment from Olympus. In issue #45 of ''The Avengers'', Hercules became a \"full-fledged Avenger\" by way of Goliath's announcement to the press during the first annual \"Avengers Day\".  Hercules also guest starred in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #28 (Dec. 1974) and ''Marvel Premiere'' #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]]'' which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975 \u2013 Jan. 1978).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Karen|title='We'll Keep on Fighting 'Til the End': The Story of the Champions|journal=[[Back Issue!]] |issue=65|pages=17\u201323|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> After this, Hercules made a guest appearance in ''[[Marvel Two-In-One]]'' #44 (Oct. 1978).\n\nHercules starred in two limited series by writer-artist [[Bob Layton]], with both set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]. A 24th century version of Hercules starred in ''Hercules'' #1 - 4 (Sep. \u2013 Dec. 1982), which was popular enough to spawn a sequel, ''Hercules'' vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March \u2013 June 1984). The storylines dealt with Hercules's [[exile]] from [[Olympus (Marvel Comics)|Olympus]], completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity.\n\nHercules remained a constant guest star in both ''Thor'' and the ''Avengers'', playing a significant role in the \"Avengers Under Siege\" storyline in ''Avengers'' #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 \u2013 March 1987), involving supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]].

These accumulations of biogenic carbonate lie upon the higher crests of major submarine ridges that are uplifted [[fault block]]s known by geologists as [[Horst (geology)|horsts]]. These horsts are part of a series of parallel and en echelon, half-grabens and rotated fault-blocks. The long axes of the horsts, rotated fault blocks and half-[[grabens]] form well-defined linear trends that lie parallel to [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] exhibited by the [[oceanic crust]] of the adjacent South China Sea. The horsts, rotated fault blocks, and the rock forming the bottoms of associated grabens consist of stretched and subsided [[continental crust]] that is composed of [[Triassic]], [[Jurassic]], and [[Cretaceous]] [[strata]] that include [[Calc-alkaline magma series|calc-alkalic]] [[extrusive]] [[igneous]] rocks, intermediate to acid [[Intrusion|intrusive]] igneous rocks, [[sandstone]]s, [[siltstone]]s, dark-green [[claystone]]s, and [[metamorphic rocks]] that include [[biotite]]&ndash;[[muscovite]]&ndash;[[feldspar]]&ndash;[[quartz]] [[migmatites]] and [[garnet]]&ndash;[[mica]] [[schists]].<ref name=\"Hutchison2010a\">Hutchison, C.

They occurred as the result of the tectonic stretching of continental crust along underlying deeply rooted detachment faults. During the Late Cretaceous and Early [[Oligocene]], the earliest period of tectonic stretching of continental crust and formation of horsts, half-grabens, and rotated fault-blocks occurred in association the rifting and later sea-floor spreading that created the South China Sea. During the Late Oligocene-Early [[Miocene]] additional stretching and block faulting of continental crust occurred within the Spratly Islands and adjacent Dangerous Ground. During and after this period of tectonic activity, corals and other marine life colonised the crests of the horsts and other ridges that lay in shallow water. The remains of these organisms accumulated over time as biogenic carbonates that comprise the current day reefs, shoals and cays of the Spratly Islands. Starting with their formation in Late Cretaceous, fine-grained organic-rich marine sediments accumulated within the numerous submarine half-grabens that underlie sea bottom within the Dangerous Ground region.<ref name=\"Hutchison2010a\"/><ref name=\"Wei2011a\"/><ref name=\"Zhen2013a\"/>\n\nThe geological surveys show localised areas within the Spratly Islands region are favourable for the accumulation of economic oil and gas reserves. They include thick sequences of [[Cenozoic]] sediments east of the Spratly Islands. Southeast and west of them, there also exist thick accumulations of sediments that possibly might contain economic oil and gas reserves lie closer to the Spratly Islands.<ref name=\"Owen2012a\"/><ref name=\"Blanche1997a\">Blanche, J.

Under the influence of the dominant wind direction, which changes seasonally, these sediments move around the island to change the shape and size of the island. For example, Spratly Island is larger during the northeast monsoon (about 700 \u00d7 300 meters), and smaller during the southwest monsoon (approximately 650 \u00d7 320 meters).<ref>{{cite web |author=Tran Duc Thanh |date=May 1994 |title=\u0110\u1ed9ng l\u1ef1c b\u1ed3i t\u1ee5, x\u00f3i l\u1edf b\u1edd v\u00e0 s\u1ef1 thay \u0111\u1ed5i h\u00ecnh d\u1ea1ng \u0111\u1ea3o san h\u00f4 Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa |trans-title=Deposition and erosion dynamics and shape change of the Spratly coral island |publisher=ResearchGate |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258736867 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome islands may contain fresh groundwater fed by rain.

Scientists have focused their research on the marine environment, while the ecology of the terrestrial environment remains relatively unknown.<ref name=\"ECO\" />\n\n=== Ecological hazards ===\nPolitical instability, tourism and the increasing industrialisation of neighbouring countries has led to serious disruption of native flora and fauna, [[over-exploitation]] of natural resources, and [[environmental pollution]]. Disruption of nesting areas by human activity and/or by introduced animals, such as dogs, has reduced the number of turtles nesting on the islands. Sea turtles are also slaughtered for food on a significant scale. The sea turtle is a symbol of longevity in Chinese culture and at times the military personnel are given orders to protect the turtles.<ref name=\"ECO\" />\n\nHeavy commercial fishing in the region incurs other problems. Although it has been outlawed, fishing methods continue to include the use of [[bottom trawling|bottom trawlers]] fitted with chain rollers. In 1994 a routine patrol by Taiwan's marine navy confiscated more than 200&nbsp;kg of [[potassium cyanide]] solution from fishermen who had been using it for [[cyanide fishing]]. These activities have a devastating impact on local marine organisms and coral reefs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=I-Jiunn|title=Sea Turtles at Dungsha Tao, South China Sea|journal=Marine Turtle Newslatter|date=July 1995|volume=70|pages=13\u201314|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/mtn/archives/mtn70/mtn70p13.shtml|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome interest has been taken{{by whom|date=July 2014}} in regard to conservation of these{{which|date=July 2014}} island ecosystems.

These accumulations of biogenic carbonate lie upon the higher crests of major submarine ridges that are uplifted [[fault block]]s known by geologists as [[Horst (geology)|horsts]]. These horsts are part of a series of parallel and en echelon, half-grabens and rotated fault-blocks. The long axes of the horsts, rotated fault blocks and half-[[grabens]] form well-defined linear trends that lie parallel to [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]] exhibited by the [[oceanic crust]] of the adjacent South China Sea. The horsts, rotated fault blocks, and the rock forming the bottoms of associated grabens consist of stretched and subsided [[continental crust]] that is composed of [[Triassic]], [[Jurassic]], and [[Cretaceous]] [[strata]] that include [[Calc-alkaline magma series|calc-alkalic]] [[extrusive]] [[igneous]] rocks, intermediate to acid [[Intrusion|intrusive]] igneous rocks, [[sandstone]]s, [[siltstone]]s, dark-green [[claystone]]s, and [[metamorphic rocks]] that include [[biotite]]&ndash;[[muscovite]]&ndash;[[feldspar]]&ndash;[[quartz]] [[migmatites]] and [[garnet]]&ndash;[[mica]] [[schists]].<ref name=\"Hutchison2010a\">Hutchison, C.

They occurred as the result of the tectonic stretching of continental crust along underlying deeply rooted detachment faults. During the Late Cretaceous and Early [[Oligocene]], the earliest period of tectonic stretching of continental crust and formation of horsts, half-grabens, and rotated fault-blocks occurred in association the rifting and later sea-floor spreading that created the South China Sea. During the Late Oligocene-Early [[Miocene]] additional stretching and block faulting of continental crust occurred within the Spratly Islands and adjacent Dangerous Ground. During and after this period of tectonic activity, corals and other marine life colonised the crests of the horsts and other ridges that lay in shallow water. The remains of these organisms accumulated over time as biogenic carbonates that comprise the current day reefs, shoals and cays of the Spratly Islands. Starting with their formation in Late Cretaceous, fine-grained organic-rich marine sediments accumulated within the numerous submarine half-grabens that underlie sea bottom within the Dangerous Ground region.<ref name=\"Hutchison2010a\"/><ref name=\"Wei2011a\"/><ref name=\"Zhen2013a\"/>\n\nThe geological surveys show localised areas within the Spratly Islands region are favourable for the accumulation of economic oil and gas reserves. They include thick sequences of [[Cenozoic]] sediments east of the Spratly Islands. Southeast and west of them, there also exist thick accumulations of sediments that possibly might contain economic oil and gas reserves lie closer to the Spratly Islands.<ref name=\"Owen2012a\"/><ref name=\"Blanche1997a\">Blanche, J.

Under the influence of the dominant wind direction, which changes seasonally, these sediments move around the island to change the shape and size of the island. For example, Spratly Island is larger during the northeast monsoon (about 700 \u00d7 300 meters), and smaller during the southwest monsoon (approximately 650 \u00d7 320 meters).<ref>{{cite web |author=Tran Duc Thanh |date=May 1994 |title=\u0110\u1ed9ng l\u1ef1c b\u1ed3i t\u1ee5, x\u00f3i l\u1edf b\u1edd v\u00e0 s\u1ef1 thay \u0111\u1ed5i h\u00ecnh d\u1ea1ng \u0111\u1ea3o san h\u00f4 Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Sa |trans-title=Deposition and erosion dynamics and shape change of the Spratly coral island |publisher=ResearchGate |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258736867 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nSome islands may contain fresh groundwater fed by rain.

Scientists have focused their research on the marine environment, while the ecology of the terrestrial environment remains relatively unknown.<ref name=\"ECO\" />\n\n=== Ecological hazards ===\nPolitical instability, tourism and the increasing industrialisation of neighbouring countries has led to serious disruption of native flora and fauna, [[over-exploitation]] of natural resources, and [[environmental pollution]]. Disruption of nesting areas by human activity and/or by introduced animals, such as dogs, has reduced the number of turtles nesting on the islands. Sea turtles are also slaughtered for food on a significant scale. The sea turtle is a symbol of longevity in Chinese culture and at times the military personnel are given orders to protect the turtles.<ref name=\"ECO\" />\n\nHeavy commercial fishing in the region incurs other problems. Although it has been outlawed, fishing methods continue to include the use of [[bottom trawling|bottom trawlers]] fitted with chain rollers. In 1994 a routine patrol by Taiwan's marine navy confiscated more than 200&nbsp;kg of [[potassium cyanide]] solution from fishermen who had been using it for [[cyanide fishing]]. These activities have a devastating impact on local marine organisms and coral reefs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=I-Jiunn|title=Sea Turtles at Dungsha Tao, South China Sea|journal=Marine Turtle Newslatter|date=July 1995|volume=70|pages=13\u201314|url=http://www.seaturtle.org/mtn/archives/mtn70/mtn70p13.shtml|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome interest has been taken{{by whom|date=July 2014}} in regard to conservation of these{{which|date=July 2014}} island ecosystems.

Once freed, Cage becomes a \"[[Heroes for Hire|hero for hire]]\" and teams up with fellow superhero [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] as part of the duo, [[Power Man and Iron Fist]]. He later marries the super-powered private investigator [[Jessica Jones]], with whom he has a [[Danielle Cage|daughter]]. In 2005, writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] added Luke Cage to the lineup of [[The New Avengers (comics)|the New Avengers]], and he has since appeared in various ''Avengers'' titles, and became the leader of a group of reformed [[supervillain]]s called the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].\n\nActor [[Mike Colter]] played the character in the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', a [[live-action]] television series set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and headlined his [[Luke Cage (TV series)|own series]], which premiered in September 2016, along with a [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]], which released in June 2018.

The series' final writer, [[James Owsley]], attempted to shed Cage's blaxploitation roots by giving him a larger vocabulary and reducing usage of his [[catchphrase]], \"Sweet Christmas!\"<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Cage was relaunched in a new series simply titled ''Cage'', set primarily in Chicago. The revived series updated the character, with Cage symbolically destroying his original costume on the cover of the first issue. The series, written by [[Marcus McLaurin|Marc McLaurin]], ran 20 issues. Cage received exposure in other books at the time, including his own serial in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]''. In the aftermath of the \"[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]\" and \"[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]\" companywide storylines, Cage was included in the series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'', written by [[John Ostrander]], which lasted 19 issues.\n\nSubsequently, Cage was featured in the [[Brian Michael Bendis]]-written series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'', ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'', ''[[The Pulse (comics)|The Pulse]]'', ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'', and ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]''.\n\nIn 2010, Cage became a regular character in ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'', starting with issue #144,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Arrant |first1=Chris |title=Luke Cage Powers Into Thunderbolts as Heroic Age Leader |url= http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Thunderbolts-Luke-Cage-100209.html |website=Newsarama |accessdate=29 July 2014 |date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> and continued as leader of the team when the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175.

He seeks to better himself as an adult by finding legitimate employment. Meanwhile, Stryker rises through the ranks of crime, but the two men remain friends. When Stryker's activities anger the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] crime syndicate, he is badly beaten in a mob hit, saved only by Lucas's intervention. When Stryker's girlfriend, Reva Connors, breaks up with him in fear of his violent work, she seeks solace with Lucas. Stryker is convinced that Lucas is responsible for the breakup, so he plants heroin in Lucas's apartment and tips off the police. Lucas is arrested and sent to prison where contact with his family is sparse due to the resentment of his brother James Jr., who intercepts Lucas's letters to their father [[James Lucas (comics)|James]] and eventually leads each to believe the other is dead.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nLucas is consumed by rage over Stryker's betrayal and his father's supposed death, engaging in frequent brawls and escape attempts. Eventually transferred to Seagate Prison off the coast of Georgia, he becomes the favorite target of racist corrections officer Albert \"Billy Bob\" Rackham, whose sadistic brutality ultimately leads to a demotion that he blames on Lucas. Research scientist Dr. [[Noah Burstein]] recruits Lucas as a volunteer for a [[Regeneration (biology)|cellular regeneration]] experiment based on a variant of the Super-Soldier process he had previously used to empower [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members#Warhawk|Warhawk]].

He uses his new power to escape Seagate and makes his way back to New York, where a chance encounter with criminals inspires him to use his new powers for profit.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nAdopting the alias Luke Cage and donning a distinctive costume, he launches a career as a Hero for Hire, helping anyone who can meet his price.

Cage's efforts lead to a fight with Knight's boyfriend, the martial artist [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], who had spent most of his life in the extra-dimensional city of [[K'un-L'un]] and was unfamiliar with Earth society.

The majority of the rest of the game is a flashback taking place a few days before the invasion, which begins with Spider-Man's fight with [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], that leaves Mary Jane severely injured. After following her to a hospital, Spider-Man witnesses two rival gangs, the Rolling Sevens and the Park Avenues, having a violent shootout in front of the hospital, but he manages to defeat them with the help of Luke Cage, who has been trying to stop the war between the two gangs for the past few days, as it threatens the safety of the civilians in Harlem. Spider-Man and Luke Cage then begin working together to stop the gang war, and Cage becomes an ally that the player can summon at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Spider-Man eventually convinces the gangs' respective leaders to have a peaceful meeting with Luke Cage in the Harlem Park, which is ambushed by mercenaries working for [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], but Spider-Man is able to stop them and finds evidence that they are secretly responsible for the gang war. When the meeting goes sour, Spider-Man is given the choice of either showing the leaders the evidence and convince them to stop fighting, or let all the remaining members from both gangs have a violent shootout in the park, before intervening and defeating them all. Regardless the choice, the gang war is over, but the latter would cause Luke Cage to be furious with Spider-Man (although the two remain close allies and the player can still summon Cage for help). Later, during the symbiote invasion, Luke Cage is seen with Mary Jane in the Harlem Park, trying to evacuate the last remaining civilians in Harlem to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base, which is located in the other side of the city. While Spider-Man helps escort the convoy to Fisk Tower, Luke Cage and Mary Jane go on their own, which eventually leads to the beginning of the game. If the player chooses to activate the device meant to destroy all the symbiotes and stop the invasion, Luke Cage is seen in the final mission of the game, helping the other hero allies fight the symbiotes aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, while Spider-Man plants bombs to destroy the Helicarrier and stop Venom for good. \n**In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions, Luke Cage appears as a [[Non-player character|NPC]] whom Spider-Man helps fight people infected by symbiotes across the city, in the fifth level of the game. He serves as the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the level, attacking Spider-Man either after being infected by a symbiote, or in the hopes of getting the symbiote black suit off him, if the player has switched the train tracks to the location where Cage was fighting symbiotes. Regardless the scenario, Spider-Man defeats Luke Cage, who then becomes an assist character who uses his super strength on enemies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n* Luke Cage appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]].

Carl Lucas uses his newfound power to crash through the prison's cement barricades, he symbolically breaks through barriers that were once closed to him, similar to other black people of his era. Luke Cage's story has a distinct connection to unethical medical experiments; his comics presumably enhanced awareness of the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]]s that made ''[[New York Times]]'' headlines in the very same month and year that Luke Cage debuted. Dr. Altman published a book on self-experimentation ethics, one of many texts discussing ethical breaches in medical experiments at that time, meaning that the Luke Cage stories likely picked up on the rhetoric on prison experiments during that time and tapped into opprobrium about ethics. Since his comics were released at the same time that the news broke about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on black men in Alabama, an event which caused public outrage and swayed public opinion against non-consenting or coercive human experimentation, it can be inferred that Luke Cage's story influenced some of the aforementioned public opinion.<ref name=ethics>{{cite web|url=http://www.priory.com/history_of_medicine/ethics_Luke_Cage.htm|title=ethics_Luke_Cage|website=www.priory.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\n* ''Essential Luke Cage, Power Man'' Vol. 1 (''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1\u201316; ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #17\u201327)\n* ''Essential Luke Cage, Power Man'' Vol. 2 (''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #28\u201349, Annual #1)\n* ''Essential Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 1 (''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50\u201372, #74\u201375)\n* ''Essential Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 2 (''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #76\u2013100)\n* ''Luke Cage: Second Chances Vol. 1'' (''Cage'' #1\u201312, material from ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #82)\n* ''Luke Cage: Second Chances Vol. 2'' (''Cage'' #13\u201320, ''Terror Inc.'' #11\u201312, material from ''Silver Sable & the Wild Pack'' #13\u201314)\n* ''Cage'' ([[Max (comics)|Marvel MAX]]: ''Cage'' Vol. 2 #1\u20135)\n* ''Luke Cage Noir'' (''Luke Cage Noir'' #1\u20134)\n* ''[[Marvel Masterworks]]: Luke Cage, Hero For Hire Vol. 1'' (''Luke Cage, Hero For Hire'' #1\u201316)\n* ''Marvel Masterworks: Luke Cage, Hero For Hire Vol. 2'' (''Luke Cage, Hero For Hire'' #17\u201331)\n* ''Marvel Masterworks: Luke Cage, Hero For Hire Vol. 3'' (''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #32\u201347, Annual #1)\n* ''Power Man and Iron Fist Epic Collection Vol. 1: Heroes For Hire'' (''Power Man'' #48\u201349; ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50\u201370)\n* ''Power Man and Iron Fist Epic Collection Vol. 2: Revenge!''

The majority of the rest of the game is a flashback taking place a few days before the invasion, which begins with Spider-Man's fight with [[Eddie Brock|Venom]], that leaves Mary Jane severely injured. After following her to a hospital, Spider-Man witnesses two rival gangs, the Rolling Sevens and the Park Avenues, having a violent shootout in front of the hospital, but he manages to defeat them with the help of Luke Cage, who has been trying to stop the war between the two gangs for the past few days, as it threatens the safety of the civilians in Harlem. Spider-Man and Luke Cage then begin working together to stop the gang war, and Cage becomes an ally that the player can summon at any time during gameplay to help them fight enemies. Spider-Man eventually convinces the gangs' respective leaders to have a peaceful meeting with Luke Cage in the Harlem Park, which is ambushed by mercenaries working for [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], but Spider-Man is able to stop them and finds evidence that they are secretly responsible for the gang war. When the meeting goes sour, Spider-Man is given the choice of either showing the leaders the evidence and convince them to stop fighting, or let all the remaining members from both gangs have a violent shootout in the park, before intervening and defeating them all. Regardless the choice, the gang war is over, but the latter would cause Luke Cage to be furious with Spider-Man (although the two remain close allies and the player can still summon Cage for help). Later, during the symbiote invasion, Luke Cage is seen with Mary Jane in the Harlem Park, trying to evacuate the last remaining civilians in Harlem to the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base, which is located in the other side of the city. While Spider-Man helps escort the convoy to Fisk Tower, Luke Cage and Mary Jane go on their own, which eventually leads to the beginning of the game. If the player chooses to activate the device meant to destroy all the symbiotes and stop the invasion, Luke Cage is seen in the final mission of the game, helping the other hero allies fight the symbiotes aboard the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, while Spider-Man plants bombs to destroy the Helicarrier and stop Venom for good. \n**In the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] versions, Luke Cage appears as a [[Non-player character|NPC]] whom Spider-Man helps fight people infected by symbiotes across the city, in the fifth level of the game. He serves as the [[Boss (video games)|boss]] at the end of the level, attacking Spider-Man either after being infected by a symbiote, or in the hopes of getting the symbiote black suit off him, if the player has switched the train tracks to the location where Cage was fighting symbiotes. Regardless the scenario, Spider-Man defeats Luke Cage, who then becomes an assist character who uses his super strength on enemies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n* Luke Cage appears as a playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]].

Carl Lucas uses his newfound power to crash through the prison's cement barricades, he symbolically breaks through barriers that were once closed to him, similar to other black people of his era. Luke Cage's story has a distinct connection to unethical medical experiments; his comics presumably enhanced awareness of the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]]s that made ''[[New York Times]]'' headlines in the very same month and year that Luke Cage debuted. Dr. Altman published a book on self-experimentation ethics, one of many texts discussing ethical breaches in medical experiments at that time, meaning that the Luke Cage stories likely picked up on the rhetoric on prison experiments during that time and tapped into opprobrium about ethics. Since his comics were released at the same time that the news broke about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments on black men in Alabama, an event which caused public outrage and swayed public opinion against non-consenting or coercive human experimentation, it can be inferred that Luke Cage's story influenced some of the aforementioned public opinion.<ref name=ethics>{{cite web|url=http://www.priory.com/history_of_medicine/ethics_Luke_Cage.htm|title=ethics_Luke_Cage|website=www.priory.com|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\n* ''Essential Luke Cage, Power Man'' Vol. 1 (''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #1\u201316; ''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #17\u201327)\n* ''Essential Luke Cage, Power Man'' Vol. 2 (''Luke Cage, Power Man'' #28\u201349, Annual #1)\n* ''Essential Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 1 (''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50\u201372, #74\u201375)\n* ''Essential Power Man and Iron Fist'' Vol. 2 (''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #76\u2013100)\n* ''Luke Cage: Second Chances Vol. 1'' (''Cage'' #1\u201312, material from ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #82)\n* ''Luke Cage: Second Chances Vol. 2'' (''Cage'' #13\u201320, ''Terror Inc.'' #11\u201312, material from ''Silver Sable & the Wild Pack #13\u201314)\n* ''Cage'' ([[Max (comics)|Marvel MAX]]: ''Cage'' Vol. 2 #1\u20135)\n* ''Luke Cage Noir'' (''Luke Cage Noir'' #1\u20134)\n* ''[[Marvel Masterworks]]: Luke Cage, Hero For Hire Vol. 1'' (''Luke Cage, Hero For Hire'' #1\u201316)\n* ''Marvel Masterworks: Luke Cage, Hero For Hire Vol. 2'' (''Luke Cage, Hero For Hire'' #17\u201331)\n* ''Marvel Masterworks: Luke Cage, Hero For Hire Vol. 3'' (''Luke Cage, Hero for Hire'' #32\u201347, Annual #1)\n* ''Power Man and Iron Fist Epic Collection Vol. 1: Heroes For Hire'' (''Power Man'' #48\u201349; ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #50\u201370)\n* ''Power Man and Iron Fist Epic Collection Vol. 2: Revenge!''

It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a [[syncytium]].\n[[File:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|left|thumb|''D. melanogaster'' [[oogenesis]]]]\nDuring oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.\n\nAfter fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or [[syncytium|syncytial embryo]]) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, [[gastrulation]] starts.<ref name=\"flymove\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigmann K, Klapper R, Strasser T, Rickert C, Technau G, J\u00e4ckle H, Janning W, Kl\u00e4mbt C | display-authors = 6 | title = FlyMove--a new way to look at development of Drosophila | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 310\u20131 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801722 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00050-7 }}</ref>\n\nNuclear division in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their [[centrosome]]s and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.\n\nThe gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under [[Morphogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|morphogenesis]]).<ref name=\"flymove\"/>\n\nThe embryo undergoes well-characterized [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.\n\nDuring larval development, tissues known as [[imaginal disc]]s grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a [[pupa]], inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.\n\n=== Developmental plasticity ===\nAs in most insects,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abram PK, Boivin G, Moiroux J, Brodeur J | title = Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1859\u20131876 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28980433 | doi = 10.1111/brv.12312 }}</ref> environmental factors such as temperature can influence development in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibert P, Huey RB, Gilchrist GW | title = Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11263741 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zamudio|first=Kelly R.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Crill|first3=Wayne D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1995|title=Bigger isn't always better: body size, developmental and parental temperature and male territorial success in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=671\u2013677|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80200-2|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> For example, temperature can lead to [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation, such as larger or smaller body sizes, via [[developmental plasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West-Eberhard MJ | title = Developmental plasticity and the origin of species differences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = 6543\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851679 | pmc = 1131862 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501844102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6543W }}</ref> Temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Crill|first=Wayne D.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Gilchrist|first3=George W.|date=1996|title=Within- and Between-Generation Effects of Temperature on the Morphology and Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410661|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1205\u20131218|doi=10.2307/2410661|issn=0014-3820}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=David|first=J.

These are ''sex-lethal, sisterless'', and ''deadpan''. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits ''sex-lethal'', while ''sisterless'' is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of ''deadpan''. An AAX cell has twice as much ''deadpan'' as ''sisterless'', so ''sex-lethal'' will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough ''sisterless'' to inhibit the action of ''deadpan'', allowing the ''sex-lethal'' gene to be transcribed to create a female.\n\nLater, control by ''deadpan'' and ''sisterless'' disappears and what becomes important is the form of the ''sex-lethal'' gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the [[cDNA]] has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. ''Sex-lethal'' has been shown to affect the [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of its own [[mRNA]]. In males, the third [[exon]] is included which encodes a [[stop codon]], causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of ''sex-lethal'' causes this exon to be missed out; the other seven [[amino acids]] are produced as a full [[peptide]] chain, again giving a difference between males and females.<ref name=Sin_2000>{{cite book | vauthors = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/developmentalbio00gilb | url-access = registration | edition = 6th | location = Sunderland (MA) | publisher = Sinauer Associates; 2000 |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nPresence or absence of functional sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 (DSX-M[ale]), while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F[emale]).

The ''D. melanogaster'' immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' and [[Imd pathway|''Imd'']] pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The ''Toll'' pathway in ''Drosophila'' is known as the homologue of ''Toll-like'' pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the ''Toll'' pathway in flies, is produced in response to [[Gram-positive bacteria]], parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by the protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the ''Toll'' receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerizes for activation of downstream [[NF-\u03baB]] signaling pathways. It has been proposed that a second SPE-like enzyme similarly acts to activate Spatzle, as loss of SPE does not completely reduce the activity of Toll signalling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto-Hino M, Goto S | title = Sp\u00e4tzle-Processing Enzyme-independent Activation of the Toll Pathway in Drosophila Innate Immunity | journal = Cell Structure and Function | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201360 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26843333 | doi = 10.1247/csf.16002 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Dudzic2019\"/> The [[Imd pathway]] is instead triggered by [[Gram-negative bacteria]] through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). ''D. melanogaster'' has a [[fat body]], which is [[Homology (biology)#Homology vs analogy|analogous]] to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces [[antimicrobial peptides]]. These peptides are secreted into the [[hemolymph]] and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their [[cell wall]]s. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in ''Drosophila'', are analogous to mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in mediating immune responses.\n\nIt is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear. The response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, ''Drosophila'' differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria. This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response, stress response, secretion, neuron-like, reproduction, and metabolism among others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Troha K, Im JH, Revah J, Lazzaro BP, Buchon N | title = Comparative transcriptomics reveals CrebA as a novel regulator of infection tolerance in D. melanogaster | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = e1006847 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29394281 | pmc = 5812652 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006847 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Gregorio |first1=E |last2=Spellman |first2=PT |last3=Tzou |first3=P |last4=Rubin |first4=GM |last5=Lemaitre |first5=B |title=The Toll and Imd pathways are the major regulators of the immune response in Drosophila |journal=EMBO |date=2002 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2568\u20132579 |doi=10.1093/emboj/21.11.2568 |pmid=12032070|pmc=126042 }}</ref> ''Drosophila'' also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli.

They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms, as well as broken rhythms\u2014flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and others like them) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]]. This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly's central brain.\n\nSince then, Benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision, olfaction, audition, learning/memory, courtship, pain, and other processes, such as longevity.\n\nFollowing the pioneering work of [[Alfred Sturtevant|Alfred Henry Sturtevant]] <ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Sturtevant AH | date = 1929 | title = The claret mutant type of Drosophila simulans: a study of chromosome elimination and cell-lineage|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliche Zoologie|volume=135|pages=323\u2013356|via=}}</ref> and others, Benzer and colleagues<ref name=\"Hotta_1972\" /> used sexual mosaics to develop a novel [[fate mapping]] technique.

It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a [[syncytium]].\n[[File:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|left|thumb|''D. melanogaster'' [[oogenesis]]]]\nDuring oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.\n\nAfter fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or [[syncytium|syncytial embryo]]) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, [[gastrulation]] starts.<ref name=\"flymove\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigmann K, Klapper R, Strasser T, Rickert C, Technau G, J\u00e4ckle H, Janning W, Kl\u00e4mbt C | display-authors = 6 | title = FlyMove--a new way to look at development of Drosophila | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 310\u20131 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801722 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00050-7 }}</ref>\n\nNuclear division in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their [[centrosome]]s and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.\n\nThe gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under [[Morphogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|morphogenesis]]).<ref name=\"flymove\"/>\n\nThe embryo undergoes well-characterized [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.\n\nDuring larval development, tissues known as [[imaginal disc]]s grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a [[pupa]], inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.\n\n=== Developmental plasticity ===\nAs in most insects,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abram PK, Boivin G, Moiroux J, Brodeur J | title = Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1859\u20131876 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28980433 | doi = 10.1111/brv.12312 }}</ref> environmental factors such as temperature can influence development in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibert P, Huey RB, Gilchrist GW | title = Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11263741 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zamudio|first=Kelly R.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Crill|first3=Wayne D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1995|title=Bigger isn't always better: body size, developmental and parental temperature and male territorial success in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=671\u2013677|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80200-2|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> For example, temperature can lead to [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation, such as larger or smaller body sizes, via [[developmental plasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West-Eberhard MJ | title = Developmental plasticity and the origin of species differences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = 6543\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851679 | pmc = 1131862 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501844102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6543W }}</ref> Temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Crill|first=Wayne D.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Gilchrist|first3=George W.|date=1996|title=Within- and Between-Generation Effects of Temperature on the Morphology and Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410661|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1205\u20131218|doi=10.2307/2410661|issn=0014-3820}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=David|first=J.

These are ''sex-lethal, sisterless'', and ''deadpan''. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits ''sex-lethal'', while ''sisterless'' is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of ''deadpan''. An AAX cell has twice as much ''deadpan'' as ''sisterless'', so ''sex-lethal'' will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough ''sisterless'' to inhibit the action of ''deadpan'', allowing the ''sex-lethal'' gene to be transcribed to create a female.\n\nLater, control by ''deadpan'' and ''sisterless'' disappears and what becomes important is the form of the ''sex-lethal'' gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the [[cDNA]] has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. ''Sex-lethal'' has been shown to affect the [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of its own [[mRNA]]. In males, the third [[exon]] is included which encodes a [[stop codon]], causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of ''sex-lethal'' causes this exon to be missed out; the other seven [[amino acids]] are produced as a full [[peptide]] chain, again giving a difference between males and females.<ref name=Sin_2000>{{cite book | vauthors = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/developmentalbio00gilb | url-access = registration | edition = 6th | location = Sunderland (MA) | publisher = Sinauer Associates; 2000 |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nPresence or absence of functional sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 (DSX-M[ale]), while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F[emale]).

The ''D. melanogaster'' immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' and [[Imd pathway|''Imd'']] pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The ''Toll'' pathway in ''Drosophila'' is known as the homologue of ''Toll-like'' pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the ''Toll'' pathway in flies, is produced in response to [[Gram-positive bacteria]], parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by the protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the ''Toll'' receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerizes for activation of downstream [[NF-\u03baB]] signaling pathways. It has been proposed that a second SPE-like enzyme similarly acts to activate Spatzle, as loss of SPE does not completely reduce the activity of Toll signalling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto-Hino M, Goto S | title = Sp\u00e4tzle-Processing Enzyme-independent Activation of the Toll Pathway in Drosophila Innate Immunity | journal = Cell Structure and Function | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201360 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26843333 | doi = 10.1247/csf.16002 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Dudzic2019\"/> The [[Imd pathway]] is instead triggered by [[Gram-negative bacteria]] through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). ''D. melanogaster'' has a [[fat body]], which is [[Homology (biology)#Homology vs analogy|analogous]] to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces [[antimicrobial peptides]]. These peptides are secreted into the [[hemolymph]] and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their [[cell wall]]s. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in ''Drosophila'', are analogous to mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in mediating immune responses.\n\nIt is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear. The response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, ''Drosophila'' differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria. This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response, stress response, secretion, neuron-like, reproduction, and metabolism among others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Troha K, Im JH, Revah J, Lazzaro BP, Buchon N | title = Comparative transcriptomics reveals CrebA as a novel regulator of infection tolerance in D. melanogaster | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = e1006847 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29394281 | pmc = 5812652 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006847 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Gregorio |first1=E |last2=Spellman |first2=PT |last3=Tzou |first3=P |last4=Rubin |first4=GM |last5=Lemaitre |first5=B |title=The Toll and Imd pathways are the major regulators of the immune response in Drosophila |journal=EMBO |date=2002 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2568\u20132579 |doi=10.1093/emboj/21.11.2568 |pmid=12032070|pmc=126042 }}</ref> ''Drosophila'' also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli.

They found mutants with faster and slower rhythms, as well as broken rhythms\u2014flies that move and rest in random spurts. Work over the following 30 years has shown that these mutations (and others like them) affect a group of genes and their products that form a biochemical or [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]]. This clock is found in a wide range of fly cells, but the clock-bearing cells that control activity are several dozen neurons in the fly's central brain.\n\nSince then, Benzer and others have used behavioral screens to isolate genes involved in vision, olfaction, audition, learning/memory, courtship, pain, and other processes, such as longevity.\n\nFollowing the pioneering work of [[Alfred Sturtevant|Alfred Henry Sturtevant]] <ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Sturtevant AH | date = 1929 | title = The claret mutant type of Drosophila simulans: a study of chromosome elimination and cell-lineage|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Wissenschaftliche Zoologie|volume=135|pages=323\u2013356|via=}}</ref> and others, Benzer and colleagues<ref name=\"Hotta_1972\" /> used sexual mosaics to develop a novel [[fate mapping]] technique.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]].

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state.

Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.
