The award was first given at the [[36th British Academy Film Awards]], recognising the films of 1982, and until 1990 was known as the '''Best Foreign Language Film'''. Prior to this, films recorded in a language other than English were often recognised in the category [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]], known between 1949 and 1969 as Best Film from any Source, also, in the 1980s there were only [[Europe]]an films that the language originally recorded spoken in the film is not English, except [[Ran (film)|Ran]], between winners and nominees films in this category.\n\nIn the following lists, the titles and names in '''bold''' with a dark grey background are the winners and recipients respectively; those not in bold are the nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.\n\n==1980s==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:26%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Director(s)\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Producer(s)\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ffdead;

Television Arts]] and presented at the [[British Academy Film Awards]]. The award was first given at the [[36th British Academy Film Awards]], recognising the films of 1982, and until 1990 was known as the '''Best Foreign Language Film'''. Prior to this, films recorded in a language other than English were often recognised in the category [[BAFTA Award for Best Film]], known between 1949 and 1969 as Best Film from any Source, also, in the 1980s there were only [[Europe]]an films that the language originally recorded spoken in the film is not English, except [[Ran (film)|Ran]], between winners and nominees films in this category.\n\nIn the following lists, the titles and names in '''bold''' with a dark grey background are the winners and recipients respectively; those not in bold are the nominees. The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.\n\n==1980s==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\" cellpadding=\"5\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:26%;\"| Film\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Director(s)\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Producer(s)\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ffdead;

Conceived as a commission by Atari Corp.'s [[United Kingdom|UK]] division in an effort to incite independent developers to work with the Jaguar, development of ''Zero 5'' began in January [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] and went almost unreleased after Atari discontinued the system until it was eventually picked up by Telegames.\n\nLike the original game, ''Zero 5'' was well received by [[video game magazines]] and dedicated outlets that reviewed it, despite its very late release on the [[Video game#Platforms|platform]]. Critics praised the graphics, sound design and gameplay but was criticized for its high level of difficulty and steep learning curve. The remake was the last project developed by Caspian Software before the company was disbanded prior to release and plans for a [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[Port (video gaming)|port]] were ultimately scrapped after an unsuccessful attempt with a publisher.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{multiple image\n|align     = left\n|direction = vertical\n|image1    = JAG Zero 5 (BamBam).png\n|image2    = JAG Zero 5 (Hit-Pak).png\n|image3    = JAG Zero 5 (Trench).png\n|caption3  = '''Top:''' BamBam mode gameplay.<br>'''Middle:''' Hit-Pak mode gameplay.<br>'''Bottom:''' Trench mode gameplay.\n}}\nZero 5 is a shooter game where the player assume the role of a recruited Space Hound by DEFCON to take command of both the BamBam space fighter craft and the Hit-Pak space cruiser in a battle to defend Earth from the invading forces of the Morphon alien race, who are set to eradicate the human race after their signal was picked up signal by the now-destroyed Europa III satellite across 15 missions, each one featuring a different scenario and gameplay styles, with later missions increasing in difficulty and introducing new enemies as the player progress further.<ref name=\"Z5manual\">''Zero 5'' game manual (Atari Jaguar, US)</ref> By pressing the Option button at the title screen, the player has access to the setup menu where various settings can be adjusted such as controls and sound configurations, in addition of selecting the last mission reached on the main game to resume progress and choosing any of the three levels of difficulty, each one applying a different stipulation during gameplay, with the highest one featuring missions that are longer in length compared to the other two difficulty levels.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/>\n\nThe game is based around three types of gameplay styles depending on the mission.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/> The first mode is a [[shoot 'em up]] where it involves the BamBam space fighter and the player is given full control of their ship in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] environment featuring [[six degrees of freedom]] on [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]]. The main objective is to survive against incoming enemies across all directions to finish this mode, while collecting energy pods left by them after destroying a wave of enemy crafts to increase either the ship's [[firepower]], [[Force field (fiction)|shield]] or the score by pressing 1, 2 or 3 on the keypad, and pressing 6 will activate a homing [[laser]] beam to destroy enemies but can only be used up to three times. The ship can also be rotated left and right with the C or A buttons.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/>\n\nThe second mode is an [[on rails]] shooter segment that takes place in a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], where involves the player controlling the Hit-Pak space cruiser and its [[gun turret]]s in environments of [[360\u00b0]]. Like the first mode, the objective is to survive multiple waves of enemies that appear in all directions or destroying [[space debris]] to protect the ship, however there are no energy pods to be collected to regenerate shields and the player must keep focused on the radar, which displays the ship's shields and enemies.

The remake was the last project developed by Caspian Software before the company was disbanded prior to release and plans for a [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] [[Port (video gaming)|port]] were ultimately scrapped after an unsuccessful attempt with a publisher.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{multiple image\n|align     = left\n|direction = vertical\n|image1    = JAG Zero 5 (BamBam).png\n|image2    = JAG Zero 5 (Hit-Pak).png\n|image3    = JAG Zero 5 (Trench).png\n|caption3  = '''Top:''' BamBam mode gameplay.<br>'''Middle:''' Hit-Pak mode gameplay.<br>'''Bottom:''' Trench mode gameplay.\n}}\nZero 5 is a shooter game where the player assume the role of a recruited Space Hound by DEFCON to take command of both the BamBam space fighter craft and the Hit-Pak space cruiser in a battle to defend Earth from the invading forces of the Morphon alien race, who are set to eradicate the human race after their signal was picked up signal by the now-destroyed Europa III satellite across 15 missions, each one featuring a different scenario and gameplay styles, with later missions increasing in difficulty and introducing new enemies as the player progress further.<ref name=\"Z5manual\">''Zero 5'' game manual (Atari Jaguar, US)</ref> By pressing the Option button at the title screen, the player has access to the setup menu where various settings can be adjusted such as controls and sound configurations, in addition of selecting the last mission reached on the main game to resume progress and choosing any of the three levels of difficulty, each one applying a different stipulation during gameplay, with the highest one featuring missions that are longer in length compared to the other two difficulty levels.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/>\n\nThe game is based around three types of gameplay styles depending on the mission.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/> The first mode is a [[shoot 'em up]] where it involves the BamBam space fighter and the player is given full control of their ship in a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] environment featuring [[six degrees of freedom]] on [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]]. The main objective is to survive against incoming enemies across all directions to finish this mode, while collecting energy pods left by them after destroying a wave of enemy crafts to increase either the ship's [[firepower]], [[Force field (fiction)|shield]] or the score by pressing 1, 2 or 3 on the keypad, and pressing 6 will activate a homing [[laser]] beam to destroy enemies but can only be used up to three times. The ship can also be rotated left and right with the C or A buttons.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/>\n\nThe second mode is an [[on rails]] shooter segment that takes place in a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], where involves the player controlling the Hit-Pak space cruiser and its [[gun turret]]s in environments of [[360\u00b0]]. Like the first mode, the objective is to survive multiple waves of enemies that appear in all directions or destroying [[space debris]] to protect the ship, however there are no energy pods to be collected to regenerate shields and the player must keep focused on the radar, which displays the ship's shields and enemies. The missions involving Hit-Pak are broken into different segments, with some alternating between different playstyles.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/>\n\nThe third and last mode revolves around flying BamBam through a confined space at high-speed inside of an alien ship and destroy its reactors, while collecting power-ups by passing through a flashing panel. [[Sound]] plays a key role during this mode, as the player's shots can determine which walls are indestructible to avoid crashing against them.<ref name=\"Z5manual\"/>\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:Atari-Jaguar-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|Along with ''[[Attack of the Mutant Penguins]]'' by Sunrise Games, ''Zero 5'' was part of an effort by Atari UK to incite independent developers to work with the Jaguar.]]\n''Zero 5'' is a remake of the 1994 Atari STe title of the same name, which was one of the last official releases for the Atari ST platform after being discontinued in 1993 by Atari Corporation, who would later commission Caspian Software to work alongside them as part of Atari Corp.'s European center of development, which was established in January 1995 with the aim of working alongside small game developers around the region to create titles for the Atari Jaguar.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Still|first=Darryl|url=https://archive.org/stream/Edge_UK_027#page/n16/mode/1up|title=Letters|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=27|publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]]|date=December 1995|pages=17\u201318|access-date=February 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104230341/https://archive.org/stream/Edge_UK_027#page/n16/mode/1up#page/n16/mode/1up|archive-date=January 4, 2019|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Z5d\">{{cite web|author=gisbya|url=https://www.atarilegend.com/games/games_detail.php?game_id=3575|title=Games - Zero-5 - Comments|website=atarilegend.com|date=July 2, 2006|accessdate=2019-02-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808104536/https://www.atarilegend.com/games/games_detail.php?game_id=3575|archive-date=August 8, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Z5e\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=https://ataricrypt.blogspot.com/2016/03/operation-zero-5.html|title=Operation: Zero-5|website=ataricrypt.blogspot.com|date=March 25, 2016|accessdate=2019-02-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205143102/https://ataricrypt.blogspot.com/2016/03/operation-zero-5.html|archivedate=5 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Z5f\">{{cite web|author=zapiy|url=http://www.retrovideogamer.co.uk/rvg-interviews-darryl-still/|title=RVG Interviews \u2013 Darryl Still|publisher=Retro Video Gamer UK|date=September 8, 2016|accessdate=2019-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213184735/http://www.retrovideogamer.co.uk/rvg-interviews-darryl-still/|archive-date=13 February 2019|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> Development of the project started during the same month as Atari established their center of development in Europe and was created by a small team at Caspian Software consisting of Chris Dillon as [[Video game producer|producer]], [[lead programmer]] Matthew Gosling with assistance from [[Video game programmer|programmer]]s Dave Pratt and Sean Baggaley (who previously wrote ''Rock 'n' Roll Clams'' on Atari ST), while David Philbedge and Mark Bloomfield were involved as [[Video game artist|artist]]s..<ref name=\"Z5g\">{{cite magazine|last=Powell|first=Wes|url=http://www.atarihq.com/jeo/archive.htm|title=Matthew Gosling Interview - The programmer of Zero 5 rolls over|magazine=Jaguar Explorer Online|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=White Space Publishers|date=March 27, 1997|accessdate=2020-01-02}}</ref> Andrew T.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) was the first to assemble many carriers into a single task force, known as ''[[Kido Butai]]''.  This task force was used with devastating effect in the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].  [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]].  In contrast, the [[United States Navy]] deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own [[cruiser]] and [[destroyer]] escorts.  These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway.  By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers.  These groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle unit of the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]].\n\nWith the construction of the large \"[[supercarrier]]s\" of the [[Cold War era]], the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived.  During the Cold War, the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect [[Atlantic]] supply routes between the [[United States]] and its allies in [[NATO]] [[Europe]], while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task.  Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely.  However, a primary mission of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s [[attack submarine]]s was to track every allied battle group and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers.  Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.\n\n== Carrier battle groups in crises ==\nIn the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|centuries]], most uses of carrier battle groups by the United States as well as that of other Western nations have been in situations where their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces.  During the Cold War, an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using numerous [[antiship missile]]s.\n\n===1956 Suez Crisis===\nBritish and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan war===\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]], India used its carrier strike group centered on {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}} to impose a naval blockade upon East Pakistan. Air strikes were carried out initially on shipping in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbors, sinking or incapacitating most ships there. Further strikes were carried out on Cox's Bazar from 60 nautical miles (110&nbsp;km) offshore. On the evening of 4 December, the air group struck Chittagong Harbour. Later strikes targeted Khulna and the Port of Mongla. Air strikes continued until 10 December 1971.\n\n===1982 Falklands War===\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Both {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} took part in the [[Falklands War]].\n|total_width = 450\n\n|image1 = PALVdeMayoV-2.jpg\n|width1 = 1024\n|height1 = 718\n|alt1 = ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo''\n\n|image2 = HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg\n|width2 = 2820\n|height2 = 1850\n|alt2 = HMS ''Invincible''\n}}\n\nThe first attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier battle group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]]. This was the last conflict so far in which opposing belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], originally built in the [[United Kingdom]] as HMS Venerable and later served with the [[Netherlands]] (1948-1968).\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].\n\n===Gulf of Sidra===\nCarrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the \"[[Line of Death]]\" proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].\n\n===2011 military intervention in Libya===\nDuring the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[French Navy]] deployed its aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, off [[Libya]]. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' was accompanied by several frigates as {{ship|French frigate|Forbin|D620|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Dupleix|D641|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Aconit|F 713|2}}, the replenishment tanker ''[[Durance-class tanker|Meuse]]'' and two {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} nuclear attack submarines.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=6007194&c=EUR&s=AIR</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy Battle Groups==\n===Carrier strike group===\n[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|USS ''George Washington'' [[Carrier Strike Group]] sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006.

The commanding officer of the air group (usually a {{lang|fr|capitaine de fr\u00e9gate}}\u2014equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains.\n\nFrance also operates three {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|2}}s. While incapable of operating fixed-winged aircraft, they function as helicopter carriers and form the backbone of France's amphibious force. These ships are typically escorted by the same escorts the ''Charles De Gaulle'' uses.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Indian Navy flotilla of Western Fleet escort INS Vikramaditya (R33) and INS Viraat (R22) in the Arabian Sea.jpg|thumb|A flotilla from the Indian Navy's [[Western Naval Command|Western Fleet]] escorts the aircraft carriers [[INS Viraat (R22)|INS ''Viraat'']] and [[INS Vikramaditya (R33)|INS ''Vikramaditya'']] through the Arabian Sea in 2014.]] \nThe [[Indian Navy]] has been operating carrier battle groups since 1961, with its first carrier battle group formed around the now decommissioned {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}}.<ref name=ht9j14>{{cite news|title=INS Vikramaditya will create waves for India |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |accessdate=9 January 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=9 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109051144/http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2014 }}</ref> As of 2017, the Indian Navy operates one carrier battle group centered on {{INS|Vikramaditya}}.

Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fueling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.\n\n==Debate on future viability==\nThere is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched firepower and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] or even hypersonic flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/are-the-us-navy-supercarriers-useless-1484497670|title=The future of naval warfare: Are US supercarriers useless?|first=Jesus|last=Diaz|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as [[Cooperative Engagement Capability]] (CEC), DEW technology and missile technology.\n\nHowever, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations, whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.\n\nThe [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) was the first to assemble many carriers into a single task force, known as ''[[Kido Butai]]''.  This task force was used with devastating effect in the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].  [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]].  In contrast, the [[United States Navy]] deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own [[cruiser]] and [[destroyer]] escorts.  These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway.  By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers.  These groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle unit of the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]].\n\nWith the construction of the large \"[[supercarrier]]s\" of the [[Cold War era]], the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived.  During the Cold War, the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect [[Atlantic]] supply routes between the [[United States]] and its allies in [[NATO]] [[Europe]], while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task.  Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely.  However, a primary mission of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s [[attack submarine]]s was to track every allied battle group and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers.  Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.\n\n== Carrier battle groups in crises ==\nIn the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|centuries]], most uses of carrier battle groups by the United States as well as that of other Western nations have been in situations where their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces.  During the Cold War, an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using numerous [[antiship missile]]s.\n\n===1956 Suez Crisis===\nBritish and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan war===\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]], India used its carrier strike group centered on {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}} to impose a naval blockade upon East Pakistan. Air strikes were carried out initially on shipping in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbors, sinking or incapacitating most ships there. Further strikes were carried out on Cox's Bazar from 60 nautical miles (110&nbsp;km) offshore. On the evening of 4 December, the air group struck Chittagong Harbour. Later strikes targeted Khulna and the Port of Mongla. Air strikes continued until 10 December 1971.\n\n===1982 Falklands War===\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Both {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} took part in the [[Falklands War]].\n|total_width = 450\n\n|image1 = PALVdeMayoV-2.jpg\n|width1 = 1024\n|height1 = 718\n|alt1 = ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo''\n\n|image2 = HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg\n|width2 = 2820\n|height2 = 1850\n|alt2 = HMS ''Invincible''\n}}\n\nThe first attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier battle group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]]. This was the last conflict so far in which opposing belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], originally built in the [[United Kingdom]] as HMS Venerable and later served with the [[Netherlands]] (1948-1968).\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].\n\n===Gulf of Sidra===\nCarrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the \"[[Line of Death]]\" proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].\n\n===2011 military intervention in Libya===\nDuring the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[French Navy]] deployed its aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, off [[Libya]]. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' was accompanied by several frigates as {{ship|French frigate|Forbin|D620|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Dupleix|D641|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Aconit|F 713|2}}, the replenishment tanker ''[[Durance-class tanker|Meuse]]'' and two {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} nuclear attack submarines.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=6007194&c=EUR&s=AIR</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy Battle Groups==\n===Carrier strike group===\n[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|USS ''George Washington'' [[Carrier Strike Group]] sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006.

The commanding officer of the air group (usually a {{lang|fr|capitaine de fr\u00e9gate}}\u2014equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains.\n\nFrance also operates three {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|2}}s. While incapable of operating fixed-winged aircraft, they function as helicopter carriers and form the backbone of France's amphibious force. These ships are typically escorted by the same escorts the ''Charles De Gaulle'' uses.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Indian Navy flotilla of Western Fleet escort INS Vikramaditya (R33) and INS Viraat (R22) in the Arabian Sea.jpg|thumb|A flotilla from the Indian Navy's [[Western Naval Command|Western Fleet]] escorts the aircraft carriers [[INS Viraat (R22)|INS ''Viraat'']] and [[INS Vikramaditya (R33)|INS ''Vikramaditya'']] through the Arabian Sea in 2014.]] \nThe [[Indian Navy]] has been operating carrier battle groups since 1961, with its first carrier battle group formed around the now decommissioned {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}}.<ref name=ht9j14>{{cite news|title=INS Vikramaditya will create waves for India |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |accessdate=9 January 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=9 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109051144/http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2014 }}</ref> As of 2017, the Indian Navy operates one carrier battle group centered on {{INS|Vikramaditya}}.

Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fueling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.\n\n==Debate on future viability==\nThere is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched firepower and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] or even hypersonic flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/are-the-us-navy-supercarriers-useless-1484497670|title=The future of naval warfare: Are US supercarriers useless?|first=Jesus|last=Diaz|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as [[Cooperative Engagement Capability]] (CEC), DEW technology and missile technology.\n\nHowever, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations, whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.\n\nThe [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed. This precedent was established during [[World War II]] in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].\n\nRegardless of the debate over viability, the United States has made a major investment in the development of a new carrier class\u2014the {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier|}}s (formerly designated CVN-X, or the X Carrier)\u2014to replace the existing {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier}}s. The new ''Ford''-class carriers are designed to be modular and are easily adaptable as technology and equipment needed on board changes.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvx.htm CVX Next Generation Aircraft Carrier], globalsecurity.org</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Amphibious ready group]]\n*[[Expeditionary Strike Group]]\n*[[Naval tactics]]\n*[[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal |last= Morua |first= Michael L. |date= 21 March 2000 |title= The Carrier Battle Group Force: An Operator's Perspective |journal= Engineering the Total Ship (ETS) 2000 Symposium |publisher= [[National Institute of Standards & Technology]]|location= [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]] |id= ADA376409 |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA376409&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2010-10-28 |quote=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Naval units}}\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/batgru.htm Carrier Battle Group] \u2013 GlobalSecurity.org\n* [http://gonavy.jp/CVLocation.html Current global location of active, proposed, and decommissioned carriers]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carrier Battle Group}}\n[[Category:Escort ships| ]]\n[[Category:Aircraft carriers]]\n[[Category:Naval warfare]]\n[[Category:Naval units and formations by size]]\n[[Category:Naval units and formations]]\n", "name_user": "TheArmchairSoldier", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnited Kingdom", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_battle_group"}

In French the name was written Meyer de Haan.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born into a successful Jewish family of biscuit manufacturers, close to the study of religion, music and art. He had already had some success in the Netherlands as a painter of Jewish genre works. In Amsterdam de Haan painted portraits and took on several pupils, including [[Joseph Jacob Isaacson]], Louis Hartz and [[Baruch Lopes Le\u00e3o de Laguna]].\n\nHis interest in fine art brought him to take lessons with the painter [[Petrus Franciscus Greive]]. In 1874, he was accepted into the [[Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten|Rijksacademie van beeldende kunsten]] at Amsterdam, but performed poorly. In 1880, one of his works was exhibited at the Paris Salon of that year. That same year, an illustration of de Haan's picture ''Een moeilijke plaats in de Talmoed'' appeared in the newspaper ''Eigen Haard'', which generated much published discussion (not so much aesthetic as theological).\n\nDe Haan remained in Amsterdam until 1888, where he produced chiefly portraiture, and representations of working class Jews. His early work was inspired above all by the maters of the Dutch school, such as Rembrandt. The example of 17th century painting appears in his history painting ''Uriel Acosta''. The critic I.N. Stemming (nom de plume of the painting Maurits van der Valk) disparaged the painting as \"nothing more than a desiccated memory of Rembrandt and Munkaczy.\" De Haan had toiled for ten years on this magnum opus, which showed the rabbinical judgment against the 17th century Jewish philosopher [[Uriel da Costa|Uriel Acosta]] over his opinion about the eternal life of the soul.\n\nIn the winter of 1888, accompanied by his pupil, Isaacson, De Haan went to Paris to continue his studies. There he met [[Pissarro|Camille Pissarro]], [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]], and [[Paul Gauguin]], recently returned from Arles, and whom De Haan accompanied to [[Brittany|Brittany&nbsp;]]\u2013 first to [[Pont-Aven School|Pont-Aven]], and later to Le Pouldu, on the coast of the province.\n\nTheo introduced De Haan to his brother [[Vincent van Gogh]], and Meijer de Haan exchanged several letters with Vincent. In Brittany, De Haan conducted a liaison with Marie Henry, the owner of the seaside hotel-caf\u00e9 ''Buvette de la plage'', where De Haan and Gauguin lodged in 1890\u20131891. They covered the walls of the dining area with impressionist murals, papered over in the 1920s. Since their rediscovery, the murals have been restored and sold.\n\nMarie Henry gave birth to a daughter, Ida, but De Haan left Le Pouldu and returned to Amsterdam. There are several stories why he left; though some say that Gauguin was jealous, it was probably simply due to his brother's cancelling his stipend, so he could no longer afford staying there. Though he never saw Marie Henry again, he later left all of his French paintings to her.\n\nToday, the bar ''Buvette de la plage'' has been restored to its former appearance, with modern reproductions installed to replace the original wall paintings.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]] staged an exhibition of De Haan's work, called ''A Master Revealed: Meijer de Haan''.\n\n==Paintings==\n<center><gallery heights=\"145\" widths=\"145\">\nMeyer_de_Haan,_Marie_Henry_allaitant_son_enfant..jpg|''Maternity: Mary Henry Breastfeeding,'' in his post-impressionist style, 1890.\nMeijerDeHaan-MoeilijkeVraag.jpg|Before his trip south:''The difficult question'', 1880\nMeijerDeHaan-JoodseVrouw.jpg|Portrait of a young Jewish woman, 1886\nMeijer de Haan - Still life with a profile of Mimi - Google Art Project.jpg|Still-life with Profile\n</gallery></center>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commonscat|Meijer de Haan}}\n* Welsh-Ovcharov, Bogomila: ''Vincent van Gogh and the Birth of Cloisonism'' (!), Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 24 January\u201322 March 1981 and Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, Amsterdam, 9 April\u201314 June 1989  {{ISBN|0-919876-66-8}}\n* [http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=153921&lang=nl Van Gogh museum with one of the original wall paintings of a spinning Breton girl]\n* [http://www.jhm.nl/tentoonstellingen.aspx?ID=171 Article (Dutch) on Meijer de Haan in the Amsterdam Joodshistorischmuseum]\n\n{{Paul Gauguin}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haan, Meijer de}}\n[[Category:1852 births]]\n[[Category:1895 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century Dutch painters]]\n[[Category:Dutch male painters]]\n[[Category:Artists from Amsterdam]]\n[[Category:Pont-Aven painters]]\n[[Category:Dutch Jews]]\n", "text_old": "{{No footnotes|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Meyer-de-haans-autoportrait-circa-1889--91.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait, 1889\u20131891.

The people of the princely states were \"state subjects\", not British colonial subjects.{{sfnp|Robinson, Body of Victim, Body of Warrior|2013|p=31}} In the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the political movements in the state in the early 20th century led to the emergence of \"hereditary state subject\" as a political identity for the State's people. In particular, the [[Kashmiri Pandit|Pandit community]] had launched a \"Kashmir for the Kashmiris\" movement demanding that only Kashmiris should be employed in state government jobs. Legal provisions for the recognition of the status were enacted by the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]] between 1912 and 1932. The 1927 Hereditary State Subject Order  granted to the state subjects the right to government office and the right to land use and ownership, which were not available to non-state subjects.{{sfnp|Robinson, Body of Victim, Body of Warrior|2013|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=54}}\n\nFollowing the [[accession of Jammu and Kashmir]] to the Indian Union on 26 October 1947, The Maharaja ceded control over defence, external affairs and communications (the 'ceded subjects') to the Government of India . The [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India and the concomitant Constitutional Order of 1950 formalised this relationship. Discussions for furthering the relationship between the State and the Union continued, culminating in the [[1952 Delhi Agreement]], whereby the governments of the State and the Union agreed that Indian citizenship would be extended to all the residents of the state but the state would be empowered to legislate over the rights and privileges of the state subjects, who would now be called ''permanent residents''.{{sfnp|Constantin &amp; K\u00f6ssler, Jammu and Kashmir: A case of eroded autonomy |2014|pp=126\u2013127}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|pp=198,&nbsp;211}}\n\nIn his statement to the [[Lok Sabha]] on the Delhi agreement, Nehru has said:<ref name=Noorani /><blockquote>The question of citizenship arose obviously. Full citizenship applies there. But our friends from Kashmir were very apprehensive about one or two matters. For a long time past, in the Maharaja's time, there had been laws there preventing any outsider, that is, any person from outside Kashmir, from acquiring or holding land in Kashmir. If I mention it, in the old days the Maharaja was very much afraid of a large number of Englishmen coming and settling down there, because the climate is delectable, and acquiring property. So although most of their rights were taken away from the Maharaja under the British rule, the Maharaja stuck to this that nobody from outside should acquire land there. And that continues. So the present Government of Kashmir is very anxious to preserve that right because they are afraid, and I think rightly afraid, that Kashmir would be overrun by people whose sole qualification might be the possession of too much money and nothing else, who might buy up, and get the delectable places. Now they want to vary the old Maharaja\u2019s laws to liberalise it, but nevertheless to have checks on the acquisition of lands by persons from outside. However, we agree that this should be cleared up. The old state\u2019s subjects definition gave certain privileges regarding this acquisition of land, the services, and other minor things, I think, State scholarships and the rest.\n\nSo, we agreed and noted this down: 'The State legislature shall have power to define and regulate the rights and privileges of the permanent residents of the State, more especially in regard to the acquisition of immovable property, appointments to services and like matters. Till then the existing State law should apply.'\n</blockquote>\nFollowing the adoption of the provisions of the Delhi Agreement by the [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]], the President of India issued [[The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954]], through which Indian citizenship was extended to the residents of the state, and simultaneously the Article 35A was inserted into the Indian constitution enabling the State legislature to define the privileges of the permanent residents.{{sfnp|Constantin &amp; K\u00f6ssler, Jammu and Kashmir: A case of eroded autonomy |2014|pp=126\u2013127}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|pp=198,&nbsp;211}}\n\n== Text of the Article 35A ==\n\"Saving of laws with respect to permanent residents and their rights. \u2014 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution, no existing law in force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and no law hereafter enacted by the Legislature of the State:<ref name=\"1954 Order\"/>\n\n(a) defining the classes of persons who are, or shall be, permanent residents of the State of Jammu and Kashmir; or\n\n(b) conferring on such permanent residents any special rights and privileges or imposing upon other persons any restrictions as respects\u2014 \n:(i) employment under the State Government;\n:(ii) acquisition of immovable property in the State; \n:(iii) settlement in the State; or \n:(iv) right to scholarships and such other forms of aid as the State Government may provide, \n\nshall be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any rights conferred on the other citizens of India by any provision of this part.\"\n\n== Enactment ==\nThe Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954 was issued by President [[Rajendra Prasad]] under [[Article 370]], with the advice of the Union Government headed by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=ready>{{Cite news |title=JK ready to defend Article 35-A in Supreme Court |newspaper=[[Greater Kashmir]] |date=5 November 2015 |url=http://m.greaterkashmir.com/news/kashmir/jk-ready-to-defend-article-35-a-in-supreme-court/200761.html}}</ref><ref name=Noorani /> It was enacted as a subsequent to the '1952 Delhi agreement', reached between Nehru and the then Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir [[Sheikh Abdullah]], which dealt with the extension of Indian citizenship to the Jammu and Kashmir \"state subjects\".<ref name=ready /><ref name=Noorani /><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kashmirreader.com/2016/09/22/what-delhi-agreement-of-1952-is-all-about/ |title=What Delhi Agreement of 1952 is all about |date=2016-09-22 |website=[[Kashmir Reader]]}}</ref>\n\nThe state is empowered, both in the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] and the Article 370, to decree exceptions to any extension of the Indian Constitution to the state, other than in the matter of ceded subjects.

G. Noorani|A.G. Noorani]], all the legal arguments against the article are groundless, and are raised with \"communal-minded majoritarian\" intentions. He refers to the various Articles in the Constitution, that similarly provide special rights to other Indian states, and remarks that no objections were raised on them. Since Article 370 was enacted on 26 November 1949 as part of the Constitution of India by the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] which was a sovereign body, he remarks, Article 35A \"flows inexorably\" from it. He recalls the [[Sheikh Abdullah]]'s report to [[Constituent Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir|Kashmir's Constituent Assembly]] on 11 August 1952, which said, \u201cit was agreed that the State legislature shall have power to define and regulate the rights and privileges of the permanent residents of the State more especially in regard to acquisition of immovable property, appointments to services and like matters. There are historic reasons which necessitate such constitutional safeguards as for centuries past, the people of the State have been victims of exploitation at the hands of their well-to-do neighbours.\"<ref name=Noorani>{{Cite web |url=http://m.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/article-35a-is-beyond-challenge/194167.html |title=Article 35A is beyond challenge |last=Noorani |first=A.G. |date=14 August 2015 |website=[[Greater Kashmir]]}}</ref>\n\nArticle 35 A protects the demographic status of the Jammu and Kashmir state in its prescribed constitutional form.

He further says that the state's autonomy has been gradually eroded by various governments of Delhi through misuse of the provisions of Article 370, and remarks: \"Kashmiris have come to regard the rights of permanent settlement as the only remaining piece of any meaningful autonomy.\" Former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, [[Mufti Mohammad Sayeed]], while speaking about the issue of West Pakistani refugees, has said, \"before we do anything on this, we need to allay genuine fears that there is an attempt to change the demographics of the state.\u201d<ref name=Raghavan/><ref name=demography>{{Cite web |last=Iqbal |first=Javid |title=JK Demography, Article 35 A, and PDP Alarm Bells! |date=21 February 2015 |website=Greater Kashmir |url=http://m.greaterkashmir.com/news/opinion/jk-demography-article-35-a-and-pdp-alarm-bells/1341.html}}</ref>\n\nNoorani also points to the observations made by the [[Jammu and Kashmir High Court|High Court of Jammu & Kashmir]] in this regard, while delivering a judgement on 16 July 2015:<ref name=Noorani /><ref>{{Cite web |title=In The High Court Of Jammu And ... vs S.Mubarik Shah Naqishbandi V. ... on 16 July, 2015 |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/50935954/ |website=indiankanoon.org |access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref> <blockquote>\"The Parliament has no power to legislate law about the subject's administration of justice, the land & the other immovable properties. [...] </blockquote><blockquote>Article 35(A) of the Constitution of India, which has been applied to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, not only recognizes but clarifies the already existing constitutional and legal position and does not extend something new to state of Jammu and Kashmir. This article, on its own, does not give anything new to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as has been made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, thus, gave equal protection of laws to the State subjects/citizens as a class apart. Similarly, article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution of India, which has been made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir and till date continues to be in force in the State, recognizes the right to own, hold and dispose of property, which right otherwise is inherent in the State subjects/citizens of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, who stand defined in terms of Elans/Orders of His Highness and the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. </blockquote><blockquote>Laws have their own universe. They operate in matter and not in vacuum. The laws are located in time and space. In the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the immovable property of a State subject/citizen, cannot be permitted to be transferred to a non State subject. This legal and constitutional protection is inherent in the State subjects of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and this fundamental and basic inherent right cannot be taken away in view of peculiar and special constitutional position occupied by State of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 35-A is clarificatory provision to clear the issue of constitutional position obtaining in rest of country in contrast to State of Jammu and Kashmir. This provision clears the constitutional relationship between people of rest of country with people of Jammu and Kashmir.\" </blockquote>As an amendment to, or modification of, the 1954 order, 41 subsequent Presidential orders have been passed afterwards. According to the report of the State Autonomy Committee, the central government, through these Presidential orders, extended 94 out of 97 entries in the [[Union List]] to Jammu and Kashmir, and made applicable to the state 260 out of 395 articles of the Indian Constitution. They have been used to issue provisions and make changes, which include - replacing the elected Sadr-e-Riyasat (President of the State) with a Governor chosen by the Centre; changing the \u2018Prime Minister\u2019 of the state to Chief Minister; extending the powers of the Supreme Court and Election Commission to Jammu and Kashmir; and preventing the state Assembly from making any amendment to the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution. Jammu and Kashmir advocate Zaffar Shah says, Article 35A has been added in the Constitutional Application Order 1954 and by questioning it, the entire Constitutional Application Order will have to be questioned. If the Court rules that Constitutional Application Orders are invalid, such a judgment will have to be made applicable to all the Constitutional Application Orders from 1950 till date. The Constitutional link between the Union and the State will be snapped and the position of the State will be same as it was before constitutional arrangements were worked out. So, if the order of 1954 is snapped, Jammu and Kashmir can, in theory, return to the pre-1954 constitutional arrangement, where the Centre's powers were restricted to Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communications alone, according to the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]].

The people of the princely states were \"state subjects\", not British colonial subjects.{{sfnp|Robinson, Body of Victim, Body of Warrior|2013|p=31}} In the case of Jammu and Kashmir, the political movements in the state in the early 20th century led to the emergence of \"hereditary state subject\" as a political identity for the State's people. In particular, the [[Kashmiri Pandit|Pandit community]] had launched a \"Kashmir for the Kashmiris\" movement demanding that only Kashmiris should be employed in state government jobs. Legal provisions for the recognition of the status were enacted by the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]] between 1912 and 1932. The 1927 Hereditary State Subject Order  granted to the state subjects the right to government office and the right to land use and ownership, which were not available to non-state subjects.{{sfnp|Robinson, Body of Victim, Body of Warrior|2013|pp=34\u201335}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|p=54}}\n\nFollowing the [[accession of Jammu and Kashmir]] to the Indian Union on 26 October 1947, The Maharaja ceded control over defence, external affairs and communications (the 'ceded subjects') to the Government of India . The [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India and the concomitant Constitutional Order of 1950 formalised this relationship. Discussions for furthering the relationship between the State and the Union continued, culminating in the [[1952 Delhi Agreement]], whereby the governments of the State and the Union agreed that Indian citizenship would be extended to all the residents of the state but the state would be empowered to legislate over the rights and privileges of the state subjects, who would now be called ''permanent residents''.{{sfnp|Constantin &amp; K\u00f6ssler, Jammu and Kashmir: A case of eroded autonomy |2014|pp=126\u2013127}}{{sfnp|Das Gupta, Jammu and Kashmir|2012|pp=198,&nbsp;211}}\n\nIn his statement to the [[Lok Sabha]] on the Delhi agreement, Nehru has said:<ref name=Noorani /><blockquote>The question of citizenship arose obviously. Full citizenship applies there. But our friends from Kashmir were very apprehensive about one or two matters. For a long time past, in the Maharaja's time, there had been laws there preventing any outsider, that is, any person from outside Kashmir, from acquiring or holding land in Kashmir. If I mention it, in the old days the Maharaja was very much afraid of a large number of Englishmen coming and settling down there, because the climate is delectable, and acquiring property. So although most of their rights were taken away from the Maharaja under the British rule, the Maharaja stuck to this that nobody from outside should acquire land there. And that continues. So the present Government of Kashmir is very anxious to preserve that right because they are afraid, and I think rightly afraid, that Kashmir would be overrun by people whose sole qualification might be the possession of too much money and nothing else, who might buy up, and get the delectable places. Now they want to vary the old Maharaja\u2019s laws to liberalise it, but nevertheless to have checks on the acquisition of lands by persons from outside. However, we agree that this should be cleared up. The old state\u2019s subjects definition gave certain privileges regarding this acquisition of land, the services, and other minor things, I think, State scholarships and the rest.\n\nSo, we agreed and noted this down: 'The State legislature shall have power to define and regulate the rights and privileges of the permanent residents of the State, more especially in regard to the acquisition of immovable property, appointments to services and like matters.

This article, on its own, does not give anything new to the State of Jammu and Kashmir.  Article 14 of the Constitution of India, as has been made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, thus, gave equal protection of laws to the State subjects/citizens as a class apart. Similarly, article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution of India, which has been made applicable to the State of Jammu and Kashmir and till date continues to be in force in the State, recognizes the right to own, hold and dispose of property, which right otherwise is inherent in the State subjects/citizens of the State of Jammu and Kashmir, who stand defined in terms of Elans/Orders of His Highness and the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. </blockquote><blockquote>Laws have their own universe. They operate in matter and not in vacuum. The laws are located in time and space. In the State of Jammu and Kashmir, the immovable property of a State subject/citizen, cannot be permitted to be transferred to a non State subject. This legal and constitutional protection is inherent in the State subjects of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and this fundamental and basic inherent right cannot be taken away in view of peculiar and special constitutional position occupied by State of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 35-A is clarificatory provision to clear the issue of constitutional position obtaining in rest of country in contrast to State of Jammu and Kashmir. This provision clears the constitutional relationship between people of rest of country with people of Jammu and Kashmir.\" </blockquote>As an amendment to, or modification of, the 1954 order, 41 subsequent Presidential orders have been passed afterwards. According to the report of the State Autonomy Committee, the central government, through these Presidential orders, extended 94 out of 97 entries in the [[Union List]] to Jammu and Kashmir, and made applicable to the state 260 out of 395 articles of the Indian Constitution. They have been used to issue provisions and make changes, which include - replacing the elected Sadr-e-Riyasat (President of the State) with a Governor chosen by the Centre; changing the \u2018Prime Minister\u2019 of the state to Chief Minister; extending the powers of the Supreme Court and Election Commission to Jammu and Kashmir; and preventing the state Assembly from making any amendment to the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution. Jammu and Kashmir advocate Zaffar Shah says, Article 35A has been added in the Constitutional Application Order 1954 and by questioning it, the entire Constitutional Application Order will have to be questioned. If the Court rules that Constitutional Application Orders are invalid, such a judgment will have to be made applicable to all the Constitutional Application Orders from 1950 till date. The Constitutional link between the Union and the State will be snapped and the position of the State will be same as it was before constitutional arrangements were worked out. So, if the order of 1954 is snapped, Jammu and Kashmir can, in theory, return to the pre-1954 constitutional arrangement, where the Centre's powers were restricted to Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communications alone, according to the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]].

Vishesh Films is one of the most successful Indian film production houses. The production company is named after [[Vishesh Bhatt]], the son of Mukesh Bhatt.\n\n==Mukesh Bhatt and early Vishesh Films==\nIn 1987 Mukesh Bhatt turned producer when he set up his own banner, \"Vishesh Films\", naming it after his son Vishesh Bhatt. He went on to become one of the most recognised banners of the Indian film industry in the coming decade, giving both serious productions (along with his brother Mahesh who directed these films) \u2013 like ''[[Daddy (1989 film)|Daddy]]'' (1989), launching his niece [[Pooja Bhatt]] as a movie actress, \u2014 as well as commercial romantic hits like ''[[Kabza]]'' (1987), ''[[Aashiqui]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin]]'' (1991), in which he cast Pooja with actor [[Aamir Khan]]. He next produced ''[[Sadak]]'' (1991) which remains his highest grossing work which was also directed by his brother Mahesh Bhatt under his banner Vishesh Films. He won critical acclaim for ''[[Sir (film)|Sir]]'' (1993), which saw Pooja Bhatt acting with Naseeruddin Shah along with the hit ''[[Criminal (1995 film)|Criminal]]'' (1995) it. \n\nHe went on to produce the film  ''[[Tadipaar]]''. Following this, he produced dramas like ''[[Dastak (1996 film)|Dastak]]'' (1996), the debut film of [[Miss Universe 1994]]-turned-actress [[Sushmita Sen]], and ''[[Tamanna (1997 film)|Tamanna]]'' (1997),. In 1998 his brother Mahesh Bhatt directed his last directorial venture ''[[Zakhm]]'' (1998) returned to the [[Central Board of Film Certification|censor board]] because of right-wing pressure critical of its references to the [[Mumbai riots]] of 1993 and joined Mukesh Bhatt's production house as a full-time creative head of \"Vishesh Films\". Thereafter,  the Bhatt brothers joined hands and churned out stories and screenplays for over twenty films, many of which were box-office successes, like ''[[Dushman (1998 film)|Dushman]]'', ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', ''[[Murder (2004 film)|Murder]]'' (2004), ''[[Gangster (2006 film)|Gangster]]'' (2006), ''[[Woh Lamhe]]'' (2006), ''[[Murder 2]]'' (2011), ''[[Jism 2]]'' (2012) and ''[[Murder 3]]'' (2013).\n\n==Recent phase==\nVishesh Films is known for producing small budget commercially successful films.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vishesh-Films Regular coverage of Vishesh Films in ''The Times of India'']</ref>\nThey produced thrillers like ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', ''[[Jism (2003 film)|Jism]]'', ''Murder'' and ''Gangster ''all of which were major commercial successes.\nThey further produced [[Zeher]], [[Awarapan]] and [[Jannat]]. While the first two were moderate successes, the latter emerged a Super Hit. They den began producing quasi sequels and have given the maximum number of franchises to Indian Cinema.<ref>[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/india/vishesh-films-fox-star-studios-announce-3-film-deal-646827.html \"Vishesh Films, Fox Star Studios announce 3 film deal\" (IBN Live, 24 October 2013)]</ref>\nFirst of them was ''[[Raaz \u2013 The Mystery Continues]]'' which was a hit movie venture. Then came ''[[Murder 2]]'' which did phenomenal business and was eventually declared a 'blockbuster'. It was followed by ''[[Jannat 2]]'' and ''[[Jism 2]]'', which were commercial successes. They produced ''[[Raaz 3]]'' which made more than {{INR}} 100&nbsp;million on its opening day and was a 'Super Hit'. It was followed by ''[[Murder 3]]'' which was a profitable venture . Their latest release was ''[[Aashiqui 2]]'' which created history by earning more than {{INR}} 1&nbsp;billion and was declared a 'blockbuster'. It emerged as the best trending film of the century after ''[[3 Idiots]]''.\n\n==Films distributed under Vishesh Films==\n[[Gumrah (1993 film)]]Gumraah,\n[[Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke]],\n[[Darr (1993 film)]],\n[[Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki]]\n\n==Filmography==\nThe following is a list of films produced under the banner Vishesh Films India PVT.

Vishesh Films is one of the most successful Indian film production houses. The production company is named after [[Vishesh Bhatt]], the son of Mukesh Bhatt.\n\n==Mukesh Bhatt and early Vishesh Films==\nIn 1987 Mukesh Bhatt turned producer when he set up his own banner, \"Vishesh Films\", naming it after his son Vishesh Bhatt. He went on to become one of the most recognised banners of the Indian film industry in the coming decade, giving both serious productions (along with his brother Mahesh who directed these films) \u2013 like ''[[Daddy (1989 film)|Daddy]]'' (1989), launching his niece [[Pooja Bhatt]] as a movie actress, \u2014 as well as commercial romantic hits like ''[[Kabza]]'' (1987), ''[[Aashiqui]]'' (1990) and ''[[Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahin]]'' (1991), in which he cast Pooja with actor [[Aamir Khan]]. He next produced ''[[Sadak]]'' (1991) which remains his highest grossing work which was also directed by his brother Mahesh Bhatt under his banner Vishesh Films. He won critical acclaim for ''[[Sir (film)|Sir]]'' (1993), which saw Pooja Bhatt acting with Naseeruddin Shah along with the hit ''[[Criminal (1995 film)|Criminal]]'' (1995) it. \n\nHe went on to produce the film  ''[[Tadipaar]]''. Following this, he produced dramas like ''[[Dastak (1996 film)|Dastak]]'' (1996), the debut film of [[Miss Universe 1994]]-turned-actress [[Sushmita Sen]], and ''[[Tamanna (1997 film)|Tamanna]]'' (1997),. In 1998 his brother Mahesh Bhatt directed his last directorial venture ''[[Zakhm]]'' (1998) returned to the [[Central Board of Film Certification|censor board]] because of right-wing pressure critical of its references to the [[Mumbai riots]] of 1993 and joined Mukesh Bhatt's production house as a full time creative head of \"Vishesh Films\". Thereafter,  the Bhatt brothers joined hands and churned out stories and screenplays for over twenty films, many of which were box-office successes, like ''[[Dushman (1998 film)|Dushman]]'', ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', ''[[Murder (2004 film)|Murder]]'' (2004), ''[[Gangster (2006 film)|Gangster]]'' (2006), ''[[Woh Lamhe]]'' (2006), ''[[Murder 2]]'' (2011), ''[[Jism 2]]'' (2012) and ''[[Murder 3]]'' (2013).\n\n==Recent phase==\nVishesh Films is known for producing small budget commercially successful films.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Vishesh-Films Regular coverage of Vishesh Films in ''The Times of India'']</ref>\nThey produced thrillers like ''[[Raaz (2002 film)|Raaz]]'', ''[[Jism (2003 film)|Jism]]'', ''Murder'' and ''Gangster ''all of which were major commercial successes.\nThey further produced [[Zeher]], [[Awarapan]] and [[Jannat]]. While the first two were moderate successes, the latter emerged a Super Hit.

Then came ''[[Murder 2]]'' which did phenomenal business and was eventually declared a 'blockbuster'. It was followed by ''[[Jannat 2]]'' and ''[[Jism 2]]'', which were commercial successes. They produced ''[[Raaz 3]]'' which made more than {{INR}} 100&nbsp;million on its opening day and was a 'Super Hit'. It was followed by ''[[Murder 3]]'' which was a profitable venture .

Its remains are known from [[Belgium]] ([[Bernissart]]), [[England]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]]. The [[type species|type]] and only species is '''''M. atherfieldensis'''''. Formerly known as ''[[Iguanodon]] atherfieldensis'', the new genus ''Mantellisaurus'' was erected for the species by [[Gregory Paul]] in 2007. According to Paul, ''Mantellisaurus'' was more lightly built than ''Iguanodon'' and more closely related to ''[[Ouranosaurus]]'', making ''Iguanodon'' in its traditional sense [[paraphyletic]]. It is known from many complete and almost complete skeletons. The genus name honours [[Gideon Mantell]], the discoverer of ''Iguanodon''.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis Steveoc.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration based on the holotype specimen, NHMUK R5764.]] \n''Mantellisaurus'' was a lightly constructed [[iguanodont]]. Compared to ''Iguanodon bernissartensis'', ''Mantellisaurus '' was smaller,  estimated at {{convert|750|kg|lbs}} in weight. Its forelimbs were proportionally shorter than those of ''I. bernissartensis''. In ''Mantellisaurus '' the forelimbs were about half the length of the hindlimbs whereas they were about 70 percent the length of the hindlimbs in ''I. bernissartensis''. Due to the short length of its forelimbs and the shortness of its body, Paul proposed that it was primarily [[bipedalism|bipedal]], only going on all fours when standing still or moving slowly.<ref name=GSP08>{{cite journal |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |year=2008 |title=A revised taxonomy of the iguanodont dinosaur genera and species |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=192\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2007.04.009}}</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\n===Discovery and naming of the holotype===\n[[File:Mantellisaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of the holotype skull from Hooley's original description]] \nThe [[holotype]] fossil, NHMUK R5764, was originally discovered by [[Reginald Walter Hooley]] in 1914 in the upper [[Vectis Formation]] of southern England and reported upon in 1917.  He posthumously named it ''Iguanodon atherfieldensis'' in 1925.  [[Atherfield]] is the name of a village on the southwest shore of the [[Isle of Wight]] where the fossil was found.<ref name=McDonald2012 />\n\n===The Maidstone specimen and \"''Mantellodon''\"===\n[[File:Mantell's Iguanodon restoration.jpg|left|thumb|Mantell's \"Iguanodon\" restoration based on the Maidstone ''Mantellodon'' remains]]\nThe Maidstone specimen was discovered in a quarry in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]], owned by William Harding Bensted, in February 1834 (lower [[Lower Greensand]] Formation). In June 1834 it was acquired for \u00a325 by scientist [[Gideon Mantell]].<ref>Norman, D.B., 1993, \"Gideon Mantell\u2019s \u201cMantel-piece\u201d: the earliest well-preserved ornithischian dinosaur\", ''Modern Geology'' '''18''': 225-245</ref> He was led to identify it as an ''[[Iguanodon]]'' based on its distinctive teeth. The Maidstone slab was utilized in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of ''Iguanodon'', but due to its incompleteness, Mantell made some mistakes, the most famous of which was the placement of what he thought was a [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] on the nose.<ref name=GM34>{{cite journal |last= Mantell|first=Gideon A. |year=1834|title= Discovery of the bones of the ''Iguanodon'' in a quarry of Kentish Rag (a limestone belonging to the Lower Greensand Formation) near Maidstone, Kent |journal=Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal |volume=17 |pages=200\u2013201 }}</ref>\n\nShortly after the discovery, tension began to build between Mantell and [[Richard Owen]], an ambitious scientist with much better funding and society connections in the turbulent worlds of [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]]\u2013era British politics and science. Owen, at the time a firm [[creationism|creationist]], opposed the early versions of [[evolution|evolutionary science]] (\"[[transmutation of species|transmutationism]]\") then being debated and used what he would soon coin as dinosaurs as a weapon in this conflict. With the paper describing Dinosauria, he scaled down dinosaurs from lengths of over 61&nbsp;metres (200&nbsp;ft), determined that they were not simply giant lizards, and put forward that they were advanced and mammal-like, characteristics given to them by [[God]]; according to the understanding of the time, they could not have been \"transmuted\" from reptiles to mammal-like creatures.<ref name=HT97>Torrens, Hugh. \"Politics and Paleontology\".

Its remains are known from [[Belgium]] ([[Bernissart]]), [[England]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]]. The [[type species|type]] and only species is '''''M. atherfieldensis'''''. Formerly known as ''[[Iguanodon]] atherfieldensis'', the new genus ''Mantellisaurus'' was erected for the species by [[Gregory Paul]] in 2007. According to Paul, ''Mantellisaurus'' was more lightly built than ''Iguanodon'' and more closely related to ''[[Ouranosaurus]]'', making ''Iguanodon'' in its traditional sense [[paraphyletic]]. It is known from many complete and almost complete skeletons. The genus name honours [[Gideon Mantell]], the discoverer of ''Iguanodon''.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis Steveoc.jpg|thumb|left|Restoration based on the holotype specimen, NHMUK R5764.]] \n''Mantellisaurus'' was a lightly constructed [[iguanodont]]. Compared to ''Iguanodon bernissartensis'', ''Mantellisaurus '' was smaller,  estimated at {{convert|750|kg|lbs}} in weight. Its forelimbs were proportionally shorter than those of ''I. bernissartensis''. In ''Mantellisaurus '' the forelimbs were about half the length of the hindlimbs whereas they were about 70 percent the length of the hindlimbs in ''I. bernissartensis''. Due to the short length of its forelimbs and the shortness of its body, Paul proposed that it was primarily [[bipedalism|bipedal]], only going on all fours when standing still or moving slowly.<ref name=GSP08>{{cite journal |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |year=2008 |title=A revised taxonomy of the iguanodont dinosaur genera and species |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=192\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2007.04.009}}</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\n===Discovery and naming of the holotype===\n[[File:Mantellisaurus.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of the holotype skull from Hooley's original description]] \nThe [[holotype]] fossil, NHMUK R5764, was originally discovered by [[Reginald Walter Hooley]] in 1914 in the upper [[Vectis Formation]] of southern England and reported upon in 1917.

This specimen was originally assigned to ''[[Iguanodon mantelli]]'' by [[George Albert Boulenger]] in 1881, but was in 1986 thought to pertain to ''Iguanodon atherfieldensis'' by [[David B. Norman|David Bruce Norman]]. The specimen was assigned to its own genus and species, ''Dollodon bampingi'', by [[Gregory S. Paul]] in 2008. The genus was named after Dollo, who first described the remains, and the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] was in honour of popular science writer Daniel Bamping, who assisted Paul in his investigations.\n\nPaul noted several differences between the ''Mantellisaurus'' type (NHMUK R5764) and IRSNB 1551. The ''Mantellisaurus'' type had proportionally shorter forelimbs with a larger pelvis and he argued it was probably more bipedal, whereas IRSNB 1551 was more likely to be quadrupedal. Paul also noted that the [[Rostrum (anatomy)#Vertebrates|snout]] and [[Torso|trunk]] of IRSNB 1551 were proportionally longer than the ''Mantellisaurus'' type specimen.<ref name=GSP08/>\n\nThe validity of ''Dollodon'' has since been disputed.

His father was from a prominent New England family and a successful businessman. His firm, J. B. Swasey Commission Company, had offices in Boston, London, and [[Melbourne]], Australia. Although the family was normally resident in Boston, William Albert was born in Melbourne where his parents were temporarily sojourning. He was educated at [[Boston Latin School]], followed by a brief stint at a military boarding school in Paris before enrolling at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he studied architecture. He graduated in 1882 and began working for C. C. Height in New York before moving to Chicago where he worked for [[Burnham and Root]] and [[Henry Ives Cobb]].<ref name=\"Garrison\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"ESL\" />\n\nSwasey moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1885 where he entered into an architectural partnership Charles K. Ramsey. Two years later, Swasey opened his own firm. From 1890 he was one of the chief architects of the residential development of Westminster Place and [[Portland and Westmoreland Places]] and is credited with introducing the city to [[Colonial Revival]] architecture. However, several of the houses he designed for Westmoreland Place, such as the mansion for the banker Jacob Craig Van Blarcom, were in the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Italian Renaissance Revival]] style. Between 1890 and 1904, Swasey's other work included apartment and office buildings in St. Louis and New Orleans, a church in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and privately commissioned houses in Pennsylvania and Missouri. In 1890, Swasey married Irene McNeal of Memphis Tennessee. She was the daughter of Albert McNeal, a prominent jurist, and the  great granddaughter of [[President James K. Polk]]. The couple had one son, McNeal Swasey (1891\u20131946) who also became an architect with a career largely based in California. The couple later divorced. Swasey remarried in 1914 to Eleanor Hinton.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /><ref name=\"PCAD\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"NRHP1\" />\n\nIn 1904 Swasey received a contract from the developers of [[Parkview, St. Louis|Parkview]] in St. Louis for the design of 20 new houses. However, before the development began, Swasey abruptly cancelled the contract and moved his practice to New York City. Two young associates in his St. Louis practice took it over and implemented some of his designs, all of which were in the Colonial Revival style. Once established in New York, Swasey began designing new theatres or remodelling existing ones for the [[Shubert family]]. He also designed the rebuilding of  George C. Tillou's [[Steeplechase Park|Steeplechase Amusement Park]] at [[Coney Island]] in 1907 and the Lido Club Hotel at [[Lido Beach, New York|Lido Beach]] during the same period.<ref name=\"Gass\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" />\n\nWith the [[Great Depression]], new commissions dried up and Swasey found himself in financial difficulty. An article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' of 6 December 1932 recounted how Swasey had fallen seriously in arrears with the alimony payments to his ex-wife, Irene McNeal Swasey. He claimed that he and his son were living on less than $1 a day. Nevertheless, the court ordered his property to be sequestered. His collection of architectural books were sold at an auction in 1932, and many of his designs and records from his time in New York were lost in his frequent changes of residence during the Depression. Swasey spent part of his later years in Florida where he designed a few houses in the [[Mission Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial style]]. He died of cancer at the [[Calvary Hospital (Bronx)|Calvary Hospital]] in New York City in 1940, survived by his second wife, Eleanor, and his sons, McNeal Swasey from his first marriage, and Albert Swasey from his second. He was buried in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]].<ref name=\"NYT1\" /><ref name=\"Toft\" /><ref name=\"NYC1\" />\n\n==Domestic architecture in St. Louis==\nSwasey designed fourteen houses for [[Joseph Scott Fullerton]]'s real estate development in Westminster Place, including his own Colonial Revival-style residence at 4384 Westminster Place. He also designed the ornamental gates to the development. For Fullerton's development of Portland and Westmoreland Places and their adjoining streets he designed a further six houses, including a mansion on Lindell Boulevard for the industrialist James Green, and another for [[William K. Bixby]] at 13 Portland Place.<ref name=\"NRHP1\" /><ref name=\"Hunter\" /><ref name=\"Gass\" />\n<gallery class= mode=\"packed\" widths=150px heights=160px caption = >\nFile:James Green Residence.
