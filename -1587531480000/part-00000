He spent several years at [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]], then taught at several universities in North America, including [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]]. He was Professor of Religion at [[Temple University]], where he founded and chaired the [[Islamic Studies]] program. Al-Faruqi was also the founder of the [[International Institute of Islamic Thought]]. He wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloquium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the [[American Islamic College]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nAl-Faruqi and his wife, [[Lois Lamya al-Faruqi]], were stabbed to death in their home in [[Wyncote, Pennsylvania|Wyncote]], [[Pennsylvania]] on May 27, 1986.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAl-Faruqi was born in [[Jaffa]], in British-mandate [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (now part of occupied  [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]])<ref>https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/135000404/ismail-raji-al_faruqi</ref>. His father, 'Abd al-Huda al-Faruqi, was an Islamic judge (''[[qadi]]'') and a religious man well-versed in Islamic scholarship. Faruqi received his religious education at home from his father and in the local mosque. He began to attend the French Dominican [[Coll\u00e8ge des Fr\u00e8res de Jaffa]] in 1936.\n\nHis first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government in [[Jerusalem]], which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of [[Galilee]]. Subsequent to the partition plan of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and the creation of the independent [[Jewish]] state of [[Israel]] in 1948, al-Faruqi at first emigrated to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], where he studied at the [[American University of Beirut]], then enrolled the next year at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]'s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.A. in [[philosophy]] in 1949. He was then accepted for entry into [[Harvard University]]'s department of philosophy and was awarded his second M.A. in philosophy there in March 1951, with a thesis entitled ''Justifying the Good: [[Metaphysics]] and [[Epistemology]] of Value'' (1952).  \n\nHis dissertation was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of [[Max Scheler]] (1874\u20131928), particularly the latter's notion of [[axiological intuitionism]]. Al-Faruqi argued that Scheler's axiological intuitionism privileged feeling as knowing, thus recognizing the logic of the heart as an ''a priori'' emotional intuition of value. Such recognition could justify carving out a conceptual as well as practical space for the emergence of a critique of post-Enlightenment Reason from the standpoint of a non-Western philosopher. However, he decided to return to Indiana University; he submitted his thesis to the Department of Philosophy and received his PhD in September 1952. By then he had a background in classical philosophy and the developing thought of the western tradition. At the beginning of 1953, he and his wife were in [[Syria]]. He then moved to [[Egypt]], where he studied at Al-Azhar University (1954\u20131958) again with a view to acquiring another PhD.\n\nIn 1958, al-Faruqi was offered a position as a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Divinity at [[McGill University]] in [[Canada]]. During his two-year tenure at McGill, he studied Christian theology and Judaism, and became acquainted with the famous Pakistani Muslim philosopher [[Fazlur Rahman]]. During these years, al-Faruqi was preoccupied with his anti-Zionist Arab identity. Rahman reminisced in 1986 that al-Faruqi's blunt anti-Zionism and his refusal to play the detached scholar \"frightened\" his McGill colleagues. Although he was soft-spoken with unfailing smiles, at McGill he was considered to be, in Rahman's words, \"an angry young Muslim Palestinian\". In order to challenge al-Faruqi's Arabocentric views of Islam, and to broaden his scope of understanding the [[ummah]], in 1961, Rahman arranged a two-year appointment for him in Pakistan at the Central Institute of Islamic Research. Rahman intended to expose al-Faruqi to the cultural diversity of Muslims and their contributions to Islam. \"Except\", Rahman (1986) later recalled, \"it was his Arabism which drew a great deal of fire both inside and outside the Institute, as well as his academic preference for Cairo\".\n\n==From Arabism to Islamism==\n\nIn 1963, after returning to the United States, he was hired as a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago|University of Chicago's]] [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]]. Between 1964 and 1968, al-Faruqi established himself as an associate professor at the Department of Religion at [[Syracuse University]], where he initiated its programme in Islamic Studies. In 1968, he accepted a position at [[Temple University]] as a professor of religion, where he also founded the Islamic Studies Programme. He held that position until his death in 1986.\n\nMuch of al-Faruqi's early thought is associated with what he called ''urubah'' (Arabism). In his 1962 book, ''On Arabism: Urubah and Religion'', he argued that urubah comprises the core identity and set of values which embrace all Muslims, a single community of believers ([[ummah]]). Al-Faruqi formulated the notion of ''urubah'' in contradistinction to two other hegemonic ideologies: [[Arab nationalism]] and non-Arab [[Islamic revivalism]]. Adopting an overtly essentialist position, he argued that more than merely the language of the [[Qur'an]], Arabic provided the only possible linguistic structure within which the Islamic conception of the world could be apprehended. Therefore, he asserted that ''urubah'' captured the core of Muslim consciousness, its values and faith \u2013 it was inseparable from the identity of all Muslims (al-Faruqi, 1962: 2\u201330).\n\nHe also maintained that ''urubah'' was the only context within which the non-Muslim Arabs countries could integrate into their larger societies. Even non-Muslim Arabs, according to al-Faruqi, could identify with ''urubah'' expressed in the Qur'an. In effect, ''urubah'' left non-Muslim Arabs and non-Arab Muslims at the mercy of combined linguistic and religious essentialisms. Any other form of consciousness and identity was a distortion created by colonial penetration (al-Faruqi, 1962: 211).\n\nThough few would question Arab influence on non-Arab Muslim faith and culture or Arab Muslim influence on non-Muslim Arabs, the implication that they both find their ultimate expression and fulfilment in al-Faruqi's interpretation of Arabism might be regarded by some as an attempt to establish the hegemony of Arab Islam or, more precisely, Arab Muslim culture. Both Arab nationalists and non-Arab Muslim intellectuals shunned al-Faruqi's agenda to bring non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Arabs together through ''urubah''. While many Muslim intellectuals such as Fazlur Rahman agreed with al-Faruqi's assertion that the Qur'an could not achieve the same eloquence and expressiveness in any other languages except Arabic, they were critical of al-Faruqi's blatant Arab chauvinism. Al-Faruqi's sojourn in Pakistan did little to alter his doctrine of ''urubah''.\n\nIt was in the United States several years later that he began to question the foundations of his earlier position. In 1968, for the first time he encountered members of the Muslim Students' Association (MSA) at Temple University. The convergence of Muslim students from diverse cultural backgrounds dramatically swayed his perception of Arab versus Islamic identity. In the spring of 1968, while a patient at the Johns Hopkins Ophthalmology Centre, al-Faruqi confided in one of the active members of the MSA, Ilyas Ba-Yunus, \"Until a few months ago, I was a Palestinian, an Arab, and a Muslim. Now I am a Muslim who happens to be an Arab from Palestine\" (Ba-Yunus, 1988: 14).\n\n==Scholarly Achievements==\n[[Image:Faruqi signature.png|thumb|right|Al-Faruqi's signature]]\n\nAl-Faruqi's early emphasis was on [[Arabism]] as the vehicle of [[Islam]] and Muslim identity. He was also one of those who proposed the idea of [[Islamization of knowledge]] and founded the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) together with [[Taha Jabir Alalwani]], [[Abdul Hamid AbuSulayman]], former Rector of [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] (IIUM), and [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1980.\n\nDuring his years as a visiting professor of Islamic studies and scholar-in-residence at [[McGill University]], a professor of Islamic studies at [[Karachi]]'s Central Institute of Islamic Research as well as a visiting professor at various universities in Northern America, he wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the [[American Academy of Religion]] and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloqium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the [[American Islamic College]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nAl-Faruqi viewed the existence of [[Israel]] as an affront towards [[Judaism]] due to its state ideology of [[Religious anti-Zionism#In Islam|Zionism]]. He said that the injustice caused by Zionism is such as to necessitate war. He proposed a resolution in which Israel is dismantled and its institutions de-Zionised, and that former Israeli Jews who have renounced Zionism would live as an \"ummatic community\" and move freely throughout the Muslim world:{{quote|[Islam] requires the Jews to set up their own rabbinic courts and put its whole executive power at its disposal. The ''shari'ah'', the law of Islam, demands of all Jews to submit themselves to the precepts of Jewish law as interpreted by the rabbinic courts, and treats defiance or contempt of the rabbinic court as rebellion against the Islamic state itself, on a par with like action on the part of a Muslim vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic court.\"<ref>Ismail R. al-Faruqi, \"Islam and Zionism,\" in John L. Esposito, ed., Voices of Resurgent Islam ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1983), 265.</ref>}}\n\n==Death==\nIn May 1986, Al-Faruqi and his wife were murdered in their Pennsylvania home, in a knife attack committed by a Black Muslim, Joseph Louis Young, who was also known by the Muslim name, Yusuf Ali. Young confessed to the crime and was sentenced to the death penalty and died in prison of natural causes in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/us/black-muslim-charges-in-slaying-of-islamic-scholar-and-his-wife.html|title=Black Muslim Charged in Slaying of Islamic Scholar and His Wife|date=January 18, 1987|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1987-07-08/news/2595065_1_confession-young-knife|title=Confession Details Stalking, Slaying Of Islamic Scholars|last=O'Bryan|first=Ruth|date=July 8, 1987|website=The Morning Call}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pointdebasculecanada.ca/inside-the-capitol-joseph-louis-young-dies-of-natural-causes-on-death-row/|title=Inside the Capitol (Joseph Louis Young dies of natural causes on death row)|last=Bell|first=Adam|date=March 11, 1996|website=The Patriot News}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\nA list of publications by Ismail R. al-Faruqi follows.\n\n===Books===\n* (1953) ''From Here We Start'', tr. from the Arabic of K.M.

Faruqi received his religious education at home from his father and in the local mosque. He began to attend the French Dominican [[Coll\u00e8ge des Fr\u00e8res de Jaffa]] in 1936.\n\nHis first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government in [[Jerusalem]], which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of [[Galilee]]. Subsequent to the partition plan of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and the creation of the independent [[Jewish]] state of [[Israel]] in 1948, al-Faruqi at first emigrated to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], where he studied at the [[American University of Beirut]], then enrolled the next year at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]'s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.A. in [[philosophy]] in 1949. He was then accepted for entry into [[Harvard University]]'s department of philosophy and was awarded his second M.A. in philosophy there in March 1951, with a thesis entitled ''Justifying the Good: [[Metaphysics]] and [[Epistemology]] of Value'' (1952).  \n\nHis dissertation was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of [[Max Scheler]] (1874\u20131928), particularly the latter's notion of [[axiological intuitionism]]. Al-Faruqi argued that Scheler's axiological intuitionism privileged feeling as knowing, thus recognizing the logic of the heart as an ''a priori'' emotional intuition of value. Such recognition could justify carving out a conceptual as well as practical space for the emergence of a critique of post-Enlightenment Reason from the standpoint of a non-Western philosopher. However, he decided to return to Indiana University; he submitted his thesis to the Department of Philosophy and received his PhD in September 1952. By then he had a background in classical philosophy and the developing thought of the western tradition. At the beginning of 1953, he and his wife were in [[Syria]]. He then moved to [[Egypt]], where he studied at Al-Azhar University (1954\u20131958) again with a view to acquiring another PhD.\n\nIn 1958, al-Faruqi was offered a position as a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Divinity at [[McGill University]] in [[Canada]]. During his two-year tenure at McGill, he studied Christian theology and Judaism, and became acquainted with the famous Pakistani Muslim philosopher [[Fazlur Rahman]]. During these years, al-Faruqi was preoccupied with his anti-Zionist Arab identity. Rahman reminisced in 1986 that al-Faruqi's blunt anti-Zionism and his refusal to play the detached scholar \"frightened\" his McGill colleagues. Although he was soft-spoken with unfailing smiles, at McGill he was considered to be, in Rahman's words, \"an angry young Muslim Palestinian\". In order to challenge al-Faruqi's Arabocentric views of Islam, and to broaden his scope of understanding the [[ummah]], in 1961, Rahman arranged a two-year appointment for him in Pakistan at the Central Institute of Islamic Research. Rahman intended to expose al-Faruqi to the cultural diversity of Muslims and their contributions to Islam. \"Except\", Rahman (1986) later recalled, \"it was his Arabism which drew a great deal of fire both inside and outside the Institute, as well as his academic preference for Cairo\".\n\n==From Arabism to Islamism==\n\nIn 1963, after returning to the United States, he was hired as a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago|University of Chicago's]] [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]]. Between 1964 and 1968, al-Faruqi established himself as an associate professor at the Department of Religion at [[Syracuse University]], where he initiated its programme in Islamic Studies. In 1968, he accepted a position at [[Temple University]] as a professor of religion, where he also founded the Islamic Studies Programme. He held that position until his death in 1986.\n\nMuch of al-Faruqi's early thought is associated with what he called ''urubah'' (Arabism). In his 1962 book, ''On Arabism: Urubah and Religion'', he argued that urubah comprises the core identity and set of values which embrace all Muslims, a single community of believers ([[ummah]]). Al-Faruqi formulated the notion of ''urubah'' in contradistinction to two other hegemonic ideologies: [[Arab nationalism]] and non-Arab [[Islamic revivalism]]. Adopting an overtly essentialist position, he argued that more than merely the language of the [[Qur'an]], Arabic provided the only possible linguistic structure within which the Islamic conception of the world could be apprehended. Therefore, he asserted that ''urubah'' captured the core of Muslim consciousness, its values and faith \u2013 it was inseparable from the identity of all Muslims (al-Faruqi, 1962: 2\u201330).\n\nHe also maintained that ''urubah'' was the only context within which the non-Muslim Arabs countries could integrate into their larger societies. Even non-Muslim Arabs, according to al-Faruqi, could identify with ''urubah'' expressed in the Qur'an. In effect, ''urubah'' left non-Muslim Arabs and non-Arab Muslims at the mercy of combined linguistic and religious essentialisms. Any other form of consciousness and identity was a distortion created by colonial penetration (al-Faruqi, 1962: 211).\n\nThough few would question Arab influence on non-Arab Muslim faith and culture or Arab Muslim influence on non-Muslim Arabs, the implication that they both find their ultimate expression and fulfilment in al-Faruqi's interpretation of Arabism might be regarded by some as an attempt to establish the hegemony of Arab Islam or, more precisely, Arab Muslim culture. Both Arab nationalists and non-Arab Muslim intellectuals shunned al-Faruqi's agenda to bring non-Arab Muslims and non-Muslim Arabs together through ''urubah''. While many Muslim intellectuals such as Fazlur Rahman agreed with al-Faruqi's assertion that the Qur'an could not achieve the same eloquence and expressiveness in any other languages except Arabic, they were critical of al-Faruqi's blatant Arab chauvinism. Al-Faruqi's sojourn in Pakistan did little to alter his doctrine of ''urubah''.\n\nIt was in the United States several years later that he began to question the foundations of his earlier position. In 1968, for the first time he encountered members of the Muslim Students' Association (MSA) at Temple University. The convergence of Muslim students from diverse cultural backgrounds dramatically swayed his perception of Arab versus Islamic identity. In the spring of 1968, while a patient at the Johns Hopkins Ophthalmology Centre, al-Faruqi confided in one of the active members of the MSA, Ilyas Ba-Yunus, \"Until a few months ago, I was a Palestinian, an Arab, and a Muslim. Now I am a Muslim who happens to be an Arab from Palestine\" (Ba-Yunus, 1988: 14).\n\n==Scholarly Achievements==\n[[Image:Faruqi signature.png|thumb|right|Al-Faruqi's signature]]\n\nAl-Faruqi's early emphasis was on [[Arabism]] as the vehicle of [[Islam]] and Muslim identity. He was also one of those who proposed the idea of [[Islamization of knowledge]] and founded the International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) together with [[Taha Jabir Alalwani]], [[Abdul Hamid AbuSulayman]], former Rector of [[International Islamic University Malaysia]] (IIUM), and [[Anwar Ibrahim]], in 1980.\n\nDuring his years as a visiting professor of Islamic studies and scholar-in-residence at [[McGill University]], a professor of Islamic studies at [[Karachi]]'s Central Institute of Islamic Research as well as a visiting professor at various universities in Northern America, he wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being ''Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas''. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the [[American Academy of Religion]] and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloqium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the [[American Islamic College]] in [[Chicago]].\n\nAl-Faruqi viewed the existence of [[Israel]] as an affront towards [[Judaism]] due to its state ideology of [[Religious anti-Zionism#In Islam|Zionism]]. He said that the injustice caused by Zionism is such as to necessitate war. He proposed a resolution in which Israel is dismantled and its institutions de-Zionised, and that former Israeli Jews who have renounced Zionism would live as an \"ummatic community\" and move freely throughout the Muslim world:{{quote|[Islam] requires the Jews to set up their own rabbinic courts and put its whole executive power at its disposal. The ''shari'ah'', the law of Islam, demands of all Jews to submit themselves to the precepts of Jewish law as interpreted by the rabbinic courts, and treats defiance or contempt of the rabbinic court as rebellion against the Islamic state itself, on a par with like action on the part of a Muslim vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic court.\"<ref>Ismail R. al-Faruqi, \"Islam and Zionism,\" in John L. Esposito, ed., Voices of Resurgent Islam ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 1983), 265.</ref>}}\n\n==Death==\nIn May 1986, Al-Faruqi and his wife were murdered in their Pennsylvania home, in a knife attack committed by a Black Muslim, Joseph Louis Young, who was also known by the Muslim name, Yusuf Ali. Young confessed to the crime and was sentenced to the death penalty and died in prison of natural causes in 1996.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/us/black-muslim-charges-in-slaying-of-islamic-scholar-and-his-wife.html|title=Black Muslim Charged in Slaying of Islamic Scholar and His Wife|date=January 18, 1987|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1987-07-08/news/2595065_1_confession-young-knife|title=Confession Details Stalking, Slaying Of Islamic Scholars|last=O'Bryan|first=Ruth|date=July 8, 1987|website=The Morning Call}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pointdebasculecanada.ca/inside-the-capitol-joseph-louis-young-dies-of-natural-causes-on-death-row/|title=Inside the Capitol (Joseph Louis Young dies of natural causes on death row)|last=Bell|first=Adam|date=March 11, 1996|website=The Patriot News}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\nA list of publications by Ismail R. al-Faruqi follows.\n\n===Books===\n* (1953) ''From Here We Start'', tr. from the Arabic of K.M.

He also plays bass guitar in the rock band Quayleaf [https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020027/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile].\n\n==Biography==\nDamian McDonald was born in Canberra and raised by his single mother until she married his stepfather when McDonald was five. His one sibling, a sister, was born in 1974. McDonald's stepfather was an alcoholic and abusive, and McDonald and his sister endured years of poverty and violence. This experience would be a theme portrayed in McDonald's writing. In late primary school and early high school McDonald discovered rock music such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[AC/DC]], [[Iron Maiden]], and [[Sex Pistols]]. McDonald bought a guitar and began jamming with like-minded friends and found an outlet for the frustration he was experiencing in his unhappy home life. However, because of his passion for music, McDonald didn't fit in with the mainstream students, and subsequently took out his frustrations on other pupils, mirroring his father's behaviour as he became a school bully, recruiting friends to beat up weaker kids. No doubt he would feel deep shame and remorse in later life, thinking about the violence he dished out to others. In 1986, at age 16, McDonald left school and home, and moved to Sydney, where a musician friend had moved several months earlier. His plan was to become a professional rock musician.\n\nYears of toiling in factories and warehouses while rehearsing and playing gigs with Sydney hard rock bands such as Warspite, Detriment and Money Tree Seeds began to take a toll on McDonald, who was seeing his dream of becoming a successful musician eaten away by a lack of support, overindulgence in drugs and alcohol and destructive relationships. In 1996 he made the decision to give music a break for a while. But despairing at the thought of becoming a full-time permanent factory worker led him back to school. McDonald began a Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the [[University of Canberra]] after quitting work and returning to the ACT. Without a job, McDonald found accommodation in Canberra's notorious (now demolished) Burnie Court ACT Housing Trust estate. There McDonald met many of the characters that would feature in his work. Growing frustrated with Canberra, McDonald moved back to Sydney and completed a Bachelor of Arts with a double major in [[English Literature]] at the [[University of Western Sydney]]. Having discovered a passion for reading and writing literature. McDonald then completed a Master of Arts in Creative Writing at the [[University of Western Sydney]], topping his year.\n\nMcDonald now lives in Sydney, works as a curator at the [[Powerhouse Museum]], writes for and plays bass in his band Quayleaf [https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020027/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile], and writes literature. He has one daughter.\n\n==Fiction==\nMcDonald's first novel ''Luck in the Greater West'' was published in October 2007 after winning the 2007 ABC Fiction Award [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914140206/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/abcfictionaward/winner.htm]. ''Luck in the Greater West'' is a dissection of the lives of a diverse range of people living in twenty-first-century Western Sydney. Through well developed characterisation and strongly evoked setting, the manuscript is a realism piece that explores the themes of multiculturalism, unemployment, employment, drug use and abuse, racism, rape, relationships, sexuality, love, and the diverse socioeconomic milieu of the western suburbs of Sydney. Most fiction novels about Western Sydney don't get much past the inner-west, dealing with a more fashionable grunge/bohemian existence. ''Luck in the Greater West'', however, deals with that vast accumulation of lives that go virtually voiceless as far as literature is concerned.\n\nFor the [[audiobook]] version of ''Luck in the Greater West'', read by actor [[Damon Herriman]], McDonald composed and performed all the musical cuts.\n\nThe novel received good critical review; however, controversy has surrounded aspects of the novel that are quite obviously inspired by the infamous [[Mohammed Skaf]] gang rape case in Sydney in which male youths of Middle Eastern backgrounds assaulted and gang raped several young Anglo women in Sydney's south-west in 2000.\n\nThe central character of the novel is Patrick White; he is in his early twenties, unemployed, he sells drugs to friends, and lets life tow him along with little questioning. He is intelligent, although a little perplexed by what life offers him. Life soon tows Patrick into trouble with the Western Plateau Local Patrol and the subsequent processes of the law. Patrick is sentenced to do some jail time for possession of drugs, but he deals with it the only way he knows how to: as just another \u2013 albeit dark \u2013 chapter in his life. Patrick's frank and grounded take on life makes him, despite his uninformed life choices, a character who is thoroughly easy to empathise with.\n\nSenior Sergeant Testafiglia runs the Western Plateau Local Patrol. His strong European values \u2013 that have always been his ally \u2013 must sustain an equally strong battering when his life, and more poignantly, the lives of his family become complicated by a rape issue he is dealing with at work. Testafiglia's teenage daughter is becoming a woman; and fears that he hadn't fully considered begin to flood into his reality. However, they become the catalyst that sees the humanisation of his character, and a regrowth of the Testafiglia family dynamic.\n\nSonja Marmeladova migrated to Australia with her family from Russia five years ago. She is in year nine at the local high school, but is quite bored by the students and the curriculum. She is beyond her years in intelligence, and feels she is yet to find a place in her adopted community. The Marmeladovas live in a Housing Commission flat where, by a random incident, Sonja meets a young man who has recently moved into the same block of flats: Patrick White\u2013back out from his completed jail sentence. The two are immediately attracted to each other and become lovers\u2013complicating their already confused lives, and further complicating the cultural shock her family is suffering in Western Sydney. Sonja and Patrick's relationship is deep and devouring but, like a narcotic, has side-effects, and for Sonja, after so much indulgence, a moment of clarity.\n\nAbdullah Najib and his mates love driving through the suburbs in the Subaru WRX, looking for chicks they can all have a lash at. Abdullah is proud to be Lebanese, although he has an increasing dislike for his immediate family who seem to have sunk into the Aussie way of life. He is outwardly very sure of himself, and finds it easy to make people see things his way. But his attitude \u2013 like his hormones \u2013 is getting out of control. Abdullah's character is a particularly clear example of the way none of the characters in Luck in the Greater West are simply good or bad, but are all complex combinations of qualities.\n\nThe lives of all the characters and their situations interweave through the text, and all become involved \u2013 with differing perspectives \u2013 in the central issues of the manuscript. Each of the narratives of the piece have a conclusion. However, as it is a work of realism, not everything concludes as the narrative trajectory would suggest. Testafiglia, despite his growing hate and disappointment, becomes a better father to his now pregnant teenage daughter. Abdullah, who receives a long jail term for the rapes he and his mates inflicted on numerous young women, becomes enlightened after becoming the victim of a serious assault, and then receiving a visit from the young mother of his soon-to-be-born child\u2013Testafiglia's daughter. Patrick, who has had to deal with the break-up of his relationship with Sonja, begins to put his life back together\u2013in his own way\u2013and moves in with his previous girlfriend, and the reader is witness to the bitter-sweet way this slice of Patrick's life has turned out.\n\nThe piece comments not only on contemporary life in Western Sydney, but life in the greater Western world. It deals with dark issues, but is also peppered with humour and intertextuality. The target readership for this piece is young, relatively well-read adults, and those with an interest in contemporary Australian literature; and, of course, anyone who enjoys reading. The book would also be appropriate for study by tertiary literature students as an example of topical, contemporary Australian literature and intertextuality, and also to latter secondary school students as an example of literature that deals with contemporary Western issues.\n\nMcDonald has two subsequent works yet to be published: one is a semi auto-biographic novel about life as a struggling rock musician in Sydney's underground; the other is a literature novel concerning a young Middle Eastern woman trying to make a career in the entertainment industry despite the conflicts it causes in her family.\n\nMcDonald also has poetry and short stories published in the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[Hermes]] journal, and several independent literary journals published by UWS Press.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914140206/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/abcfictionaward/winner.htm]\n* [http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=164621]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080204054502/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1866099.htm]\n* [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21336413-662,00.html]\n* [http://blogs.smh.com.au/sit/archives/2007/03/rockin_the_suburbs.html]\n* [http://www.freewillblog.com/index.php/archives/2007/03/]\n* [http://pommygranate.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McDonald, Damian}}\n[[Category:21st-century Australian novelists]]\n[[Category:Australian male novelists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:Western Sydney University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Canberra alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name = Damian McDonald\n| image = Damian McDonald (writer).jpg\n| imagesize =\n| caption =\n| pseudonym =\n| birth_name =\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1969|9|11}}\n| birth_place = [[Canberra]], Australia\n| death_date =\n| death_place =\n| occupation = Novelist\n| residence = Sydney \n| notableworks = [[Luck in the Greater West]]\n| genre = Literature, novel\n| movement = [[Modernism]], [[Post Modernism]]\n}}\n\n'''Damian McDonald''' (born [[Canberra]], Australia, 11 September 1969) is a contemporary Australian [[novelists|novelist]], who won the 2007 ABC Fiction Award [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914140206/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/abcfictionaward/winner.htm] for his novel ''Luck in the Greater West''.

Through well developed characterisation and strongly evoked setting, the manuscript is a realism piece that explores the themes of multiculturalism, unemployment, employment, drug use and abuse, racism, rape, relationships, sexuality, love, and the diverse socioeconomic milieu of the western suburbs of Sydney. Most fiction novels about Western Sydney don't get much past the inner-west, dealing with a more fashionable grunge/bohemian existence. ''Luck in the Greater West'', however, deals with that vast accumulation of lives that go virtually voiceless as far as literature is concerned.\n\nFor the [[audiobook]] version of ''Luck in the Greater West'', read by actor [[Damon Herriman]], McDonald composed and performed all the musical cuts.\n\nThe novel received good critical review; however, controversy has surrounded aspects of the novel that are quite obviously inspired by the infamous [[Mohammed Skaf]] gang rape case in Sydney in which male youths of Middle Eastern backgrounds assaulted and gang raped several young Anglo women in Sydney's south-west in 2000.\n\nThe central character of the novel is Patrick White; he is in his early twenties, unemployed, he sells drugs to friends, and lets life tow him along with little questioning. He is intelligent, although a little perplexed by what life offers him. Life soon tows Patrick into trouble with the Western Plateau Local Patrol and the subsequent processes of the law. Patrick is sentenced to do some jail time for possession of drugs, but he deals with it the only way he knows how to: as just another \u2013 albeit dark \u2013 chapter in his life. Patrick's frank and grounded take on life makes him, despite his uninformed life choices, a character who is thoroughly easy to empathise with.\n\nSenior Sergeant Testafiglia runs the Western Plateau Local Patrol. His strong European values \u2013 that have always been his ally \u2013 must sustain an equally strong battering when his life, and more poignantly, the lives of his family become complicated by a rape issue he is dealing with at work. Testafiglia's teenage daughter is becoming a woman; and fears that he hadn't fully considered begin to flood into his reality. However, they become the catalyst that sees the humanisation of his character, and a regrowth of the Testafiglia family dynamic.\n\nSonja Marmeladova migrated to Australia with her family from Russia five years ago. She is in year nine at the local high school, but is quite bored by the students and the curriculum. She is beyond her years in intelligence, and feels she is yet to find a place in her adopted community. The Marmeladovas live in a Housing Commission flat where, by a random incident, Sonja meets a young man who has recently moved into the same block of flats: Patrick White\u2013back out from his completed jail sentence. The two are immediately attracted to each other and become lovers\u2013complicating their already confused lives, and further complicating the cultural shock her family is suffering in Western Sydney. Sonja and Patrick's relationship is deep and devouring but, like a narcotic, has side-effects, and for Sonja, after so much indulgence, a moment of clarity.\n\nAbdullah Najib and his mates love driving through the suburbs in the Subaru WRX, looking for chicks they can all have a lash at. Abdullah is proud to be Lebanese, although he has an increasing dislike for his immediate family who seem to have sunk into the Aussie way of life. He is outwardly very sure of himself, and finds it easy to make people see things his way. But his attitude \u2013 like his hormones \u2013 is getting out of control. Abdullah's character is a particularly clear example of the way none of the characters in Luck in the Greater West are simply good or bad, but are all complex combinations of qualities.\n\nThe lives of all the characters and their situations interweave through the text, and all become involved \u2013 with differing perspectives \u2013 in the central issues of the manuscript. Each of the narratives of the piece have a conclusion. However, as it is a work of realism, not everything concludes as the narrative trajectory would suggest. Testafiglia, despite his growing hate and disappointment, becomes a better father to his now pregnant teenage daughter. Abdullah, who receives a long jail term for the rapes he and his mates inflicted on numerous young women, becomes enlightened after becoming the victim of a serious assault, and then receiving a visit from the young mother of his soon-to-be-born child\u2013Testafiglia's daughter. Patrick, who has had to deal with the break-up of his relationship with Sonja, begins to put his life back together\u2013in his own way\u2013and moves in with his previous girlfriend, and the reader is witness to the bitter-sweet way this slice of Patrick's life has turned out.\n\nThe piece comments not only on contemporary life in Western Sydney, but life in the greater Western world. It deals with dark issues, but is also peppered with humour and intertextuality. The target readership for this piece is young, relatively well-read adults, and those with an interest in contemporary Australian literature; and, of course, anyone who enjoys reading. The book would also be appropriate for study by tertiary literature students as an example of topical, contemporary Australian literature and intertextuality, and also to latter secondary school students as an example of literature that deals with contemporary Western issues.\n\nMcDonald has two subsequent works yet to be published: one is a semi auto-biographic novel about life as a struggling rock musician in Sydney's underground; the other is a literature novel concerning a young Middle Eastern woman trying to make a career in the entertainment industry despite the conflicts it causes in her family.\n\nMcDonald also has poetry and short stories published in the [[University of Sydney]]'s [[Hermes]] journal, and several independent literary journals published by UWS Press.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070914140206/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/abcfictionaward/winner.htm]\n* [http://shop.abc.net.au/browse/product.asp?productid=164621]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080204054502/http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s1866099.htm]\n* [http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21336413-662,00.html]\n* [http://blogs.smh.com.au/sit/archives/2007/03/rockin_the_suburbs.html]\n* [http://www.freewillblog.com/index.php/archives/2007/03/]\n* [http://pommygranate.blogspot.com/2007_03_01_archive.html]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McDonald, Damian}}\n[[Category:21st-century Australian novelists]]\n[[Category:Australian male novelists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:Western Sydney University alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Canberra alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century Australian male writers]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBiography:replaced: moved to Sydney \u2192 moved to Sydney,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_McDonald_(writer)"}

Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal. Redesigned models are not listed on their own.\n\n== Map key ==\nThere are a total of '''{{#expr:{{table row counter|id=2gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=3gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=4gencon|ignore=5}}+{{table row counter|id=5gencon|ignore=1}}+{{table row counter|id=6gencon|ignore=3}}+{{table row counter|id=7gencon|ignore=2}}+{{table row counter|id=8gencon|ignore=1}}}}''' video game platforms released since the second generation, and '''10''' canceled platforms.\n\nThis list only counts the first iteration of each console's hardware, because several systems have had slim, enhanced or other hardware revisions, but they aren't individually listed here. The list also includes unreleased systems. If a series of home video game consoles begins in a generation and lasts to another generation, it is listed in the generation the series began.

Some eras are referred to based on how many bits a major console could process. The \"128-bit era\" ([[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth generation]]) was the final era in which this practice was widespread.\n\nThis list does not include other types of [[video game console]]s such as [[handheld game console]]s, which are usually of lower computational power than [[home console]]s due to their smaller size, [[microconsoles]], which are usually low-cost Android-based devices that rely on downloading, or [[dedicated console]]s past the first generation, which have games built in and do not use any form of physical media. Consoles have been redesigned from time to time to improve their market appeal.

The area came under the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Kalachuris]] from the 9th to the end of the 12th century. In the 13th century, [[Ulugh Khan]], brother of Sultan Alauddin, drove the Baghela king east into the area, where he founded the [[Rewa (princely state)|Princely State of Rewa]].  This dynasty continued until the last successor, [[Martand Singh]], abdicated and acceded rule to the [[Dominion of India]] in 1947. The present Rewa district came into existence in 1950 when the Provinces and States Order (transfer of enclaves) was put into effect.

{"title_page": "Carrier current", "text_new": "{{short description|Transmission of low-power radio signals through electrical conductors}}\n'''Carrier current''' transmission, originally called '''wired wireless''', employs guided low-power [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] signals, which are transmitted along electrical conductors. The transmissions are picked up by receivers that are either connected to the conductors, or a short distance from them. Carrier current transmission is used to send audio and [[telemetry]] to selected locations, and also for [[low-power broadcasting]] that covers a small geographical area, such as a college campus. The most common form of carrier current uses [[longwave]] or [[medium wave]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring, although other conductors can be used, such as telephone lines.\n\n== Technology ==\nCarrier current generally uses low-power transmissions. In cases where the signals are being carried over electrical wires, special preparations must be made for distant transmissions, as the signals cannot pass through standard utility [[transformer]]s. Signals can bridge transformers if the utility company has installed [[high-pass filter]]s, which typically has already been done when carrier current-based data systems are in operation. Signals can also be impressed onto the neutral leg of the [[three-phase electric power]] system, a practice known as \"neutral loading\", in order to reduce or eliminate [[mains hum]] (60 [[hertz]] in North American installations), and to extend effective transmission line distance.\n\nFor a broadcasting installation, a typical carrier current transmitter has an output in the range 5 to 30 watts. However, electrical wiring is a very inefficient antenna, and this results in a transmitted [[effective radiated power]] of less than one watt, and the distance over which signals can be picked up is usually less than 60 meters (200 feet) from the wires. Transmission sound quality can be good, although it sometimes includes the low-frequency mains hum interference produced by the alternating current. However, not all listeners notice this hum, nor is it reproduced well by all receivers.\n\nExtensive systems can include multiple unit installations with [[linear amplifier]]s and splitters to increase the coupling points to a large electrical grid (whether a campus, a high-rise apartment or a community). These systems would typically require coaxial cable interconnection from a transmitter to the linear amplifiers. In the 1990s, LPB, Inc., possibly the largest manufacturer of these transmission systems, designed and supplied several extensive campus-based systems that included fiber-optic links between linear amplifiers to prevent heterodyne interference.\n\n==Initial development==\nThe ability for electrical conductors to act as waveguides for radio signals was noted in the earliest days of radio experimentation, and [[Heinrich Hertz]] published the first review of the phenomenon in 1889.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EYRNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&dq=%22On+the+Propagation+of+Electric+Waves+along+Wires%22&source=bl&ots=9-J4_YX0r1&sig=Dontsl4dn9M-un7jqoFFJ_kOtAM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV9I-0nfLRAhUI4CYKHVMJAjYQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&q=%22On%20the%20Propagation%20of%20Electric%20Waves%20along%20Wires%22&f=false \"Heinrich Hertz\"], ''The Electrician'', July 20, 1894, page 333. Hertz's paper was titled \"On the Propagation of Electric Waves along Wires\".</ref> By 1911, Major General [[George Owen Squier]] was conducting some of the earliest studies designed to put carrier current transmissions, which he called \"wired wireless\", to practical use.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d00118867a&view=1up&seq=1151 \"Multiplex Telephony and Telegraphy by Means of Electric Waves Guided by Wires\"] by George O. Squier, ''Proceedings of the American Institute of American Engineers'', May, 1911, pages 857-862. Squier assigned ownership of his U.S. patents to \"the American People\". He later unsuccessfully tried to claim that this had not exempted commercial concerns from paying royalties on his patents.</ref> To be effective, the radio transmitter must be capable of generating pure continuous-wave AM transmissions. Thus, the technology needed to set up carrier current transmissions would not be readily available until the late 1910s, with the development of [[vacuum tube]] transmitters and amplifiers.\n\n==Long-distance communication==\n{{Main|Power-line communication}}\nThe first commercial applications of carrier current technology included the setting up of long-distance telegraph, telemetry, and telephone communication by electrical companies over their high-voltage distribution lines. This approach had a major advantage over standard telegraph and telephone lines, because radio signals can readily jump over any small gaps in cases when there is a line break. In May 1918, the Imperial Japanese Electro-Technical Laboratory of Tokyo successfully tested \"wave telephony\" over the Kinogawa Hydro-Electric Company's 144-kilometer (90 mile) long power line.<ref name=\"schwartz\">[https://ethw.org/Telephony_over_Power_Lines_%28Early_History%29 \"Telephony over Power Lines (Early History)\"] by Mischa Schwartz, \"Presented IEEE History Conference, Newark, New Jersey, August 2007 and annotated since\". (ethw.org)</ref> In the summer of 1920, a successful test transmission over 19.2 kilometers (12 miles) of high-tension wires was reported from New Jersey,<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015080024006&view=1up&seq=169 \"Interplant Telephonic Communications Established Over High-Tension Lines\"], ''Electrical World'', July 17, 1920, page 141.</ref> and by 1929 one thousand installations had been made in the United States and Europe.<ref name=\"schwartz\" /> The majority of power line communication installations use transmissions in the longwave band, to avoid interference to and from standard AM stations.\n\n==Home entertainment services==\n===United States===\nIn 1923, the Wired Radio Service Company, a subsidiary of the local electric company, set up a subscription news and entertainment service at Staten Island, New York that used carrier current transmissions over the electrical power lines. To receive the transmissions, subscribers had to lease a receiver costing between two and five dollars a month.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013717379&view=1up&seq=493 \"Giving the Public a Light-Socket Broadcasting Service\"] by William Harris, Jr., ''Radio Broadcast'', October 1923, pages 465-470.</ref> However, despite the power company's optimism that the system would eventually be installed nationally, the effort proved unable to compete with the free offerings provided by standard radio stations. General Squier continued to unsuccessfully promote the technology for home entertainment, until 1934, when he helped found the [[Muzak]] company, which focused on the business market.\n\n===Europe===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\nCarrier current home entertainment services would prove to be more popular in Europe. Previously, there had been a few successful [[telephone newspaper]] services, which sent entertainment to subscribers over standard telephone lines. However, carrier current transmissions had the ability to provide programs over telephone lines without affecting the regular telephone service, and could also send multiple programs simultaneously.\n\nIn Germany, the carrier current service was called ''Drahtfunk'', and in Switzerland ''Telefonrundspruch''. In the [[Soviet Union]], this approach was very common beginning in the 1930s because of its low cost and accessibility, and because it made reception of uncensored over-the-air transmissions more difficult. In Norway radiation from power lines was used, provided by the ''[[Linjesender]]'' facility. In Britain such systems were used for a time in areas where reception from conventional BBC radio transmitters was poor.\n\nIn these systems programs were fed by special transformers into the lines. To prevent uncontrolled propagation, filters for the service's carrier frequencies were installed in substations and at line branches. Systems using telephone wires were incompatible with [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] which required the same bandwidth to transmit digital data. Although the Swiss and German systems have been discontinued, the Italian ''[[:it:Filodiffusione]]'' still has several hundred thousand subscribers.\n\nPrograms formerly carried by \"wire broadcasting\" in Switzerland included:\n* 175&nbsp;kHz [[Swissinfo|Swiss Radio International]]\n* 208&nbsp;kHz RSR1 \"la premi\u00e8re\" (French)\n* 241&nbsp;kHz \"classical music\"\n* 274&nbsp;kHz [[Radiotelevisione svizzera|RSI1]] \"rete UNO\" (Italian)\n* 307&nbsp;kHz [[Radio SRF 1|DRS 1]] (German)\n* 340&nbsp;kHz \"easy music\"\n\n==Low-power broadcasting stations==\n{{See also|Low-power broadcasting}}\nCarrier current technology is also used for broadcasting radio programs that can be received over a small area by standard AM radios. This is most often associated with [[Campus radio|college radio]] and [[high school radio]], but also has applications for [[hospital radio]] stations and at military bases, sports stadiums, convention halls, mental and penal institutions, trailer parks, summer camps, office buildings, and drive-in movie theaters. Transmitters that use carrier current are very simple, making them an effective option for students interested in radio.\n\nCarrier current broadcasting began in 1936, when students at [[Brown University]] in Providence, Rhode Island developed a carrier current station initially called [[WBRU|\"The Brown Network\"]]. This station was founded by George Abraham<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170204141707/http://www.collegebroadcasters.us/content/about/gabraham.html \"Dr. George Abraham, Ph.D\"] (collegebroadcasters.us)</ref> and David W. Borst,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170313042328/http://www.collegebroadcasters.us/content/about/dborst.html \"David W. Borst\"] (collegebroadcasters.us)</ref> who had originally installed an [[intercom]] system between their dormitory rooms. The intercom links were first expanded to additional locations, and then the system was replaced by distributed low-powered radio transmitters, which fed their signals into various buildings' electrical wires, allowing nearby radio receivers to receive the transmissions.<ref>''The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946'' by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 11-13.</ref>\n\nThe carrier current station idea soon spread to other college campuses, especially in the northeastern United States. The [[Intercollegiate Broadcasting System]] (IBS) was formed in February 1940, to coordinate activities between twelve college carrier current stations and to solicit advertisers interested in sponsoring programs geared toward their student audiences.<ref>Bloch (1980) pages 102-103.</ref> The innovation received a major publicity boost by a complimentary article that appeared in the May 24, 1941 issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/the-saturday-evening-post-1941-05-24/page/n37/mode/1up \"Radiator-Pipe Broadcasters\"] by Erik Barnouw, ''The Saturday Evening Post'', May 24, 1941, pages 36, 79-80.</ref> and eventually hundreds of college stations were established. Responding to the growing phenomenon, a 1941 release issued by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) stated that because of the stations' very limited ranges, it had \"not promulgated any rule governing their operation.\"<ref>Bloch (1980) page 45.</ref> Therefore, to operate legally, U.S. carrier current station broadcast emissions must adhere to the FCC's [[Title 47 CFR Part 15]] Rules for unlicensed transmissions.<ref>[https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/low-power-radio-general-information \"Low Power Radio\"] (FCC.gov)</ref>\n\n===Educational institution carrier current and cablecast stations===\nMany college stations that went on to obtain FM broadcasting licenses started out as carrier current stations because of the low cost and relative ease of starting one up. Although college-based carrier current stations have existed for over 80 years, their numbers are steadily declining, becoming supplemented, or replaced, by other transmission methods, including low-power FM ([[Low-power broadcasting|LPFM]]), [[closed-circuit radio|closed circuit]] over cable TV channels, and Internet [[Streaming media#Consumerization of streaming|streaming audio and video]], along with simple [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] presentations of college campus news and information being streamed using low-cost consumer televisions and monitors. As with most other student-run facilities, these stations often operate on sporadic schedules.\n\nIn the United States, unlike educational FM stations, carrier current stations can carry a full range of advertising. Due to their low power, these stations do not require an FCC license, and are not assigned an official [[call sign]]. However, in keeping with standard radio industry practice, they commonly adopt their own call sign-like identifiers.\n\n====Existing stations====\n{{Expand list|date=February 2017}}\n*Bulls Radio 1620&nbsp;\u2014 [[University of South Florida]], also heard on licensed [[WMNF]]-[[HD Radio|HD2]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bullsradio.org/|title=Welcome to BullsRadio.org|author=|date=|website=Bullsradio.org}}</ref>\n*Radio Laurier Macdonald 560 AM at [[Laurier Macdonald High School]] in [[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Leonard, Montreal, Quebec]], Canada\n*Radio SNHU 1620 at [[Southern New Hampshire University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://radio.snhu.edu/|title=RadioSNHU|last=RadioSNHU|date=|website=radio.snhu.edu}}</ref>\n*UMSLRadio \"The U\" 1620 AM.

The transmissions are picked up by receivers that are either connected to the conductors, or a short distance from them. Carrier current transmission is used to send audio and [[telemetry]] to selected locations, and also for [[low-power broadcasting]] that covers a small geographical area, such as a college campus. The most common form of carrier current uses [[longwave]] or [[medium wave]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring, although other conductors can be used, such as telephone lines.\n\n== Technology ==\nCarrier current generally uses low-power transmissions. In cases where the signals are being carried over electrical wires, special preparations must be made for distant transmissions, as the signals cannot pass through standard utility [[transformer]]s. Signals can bridge transformers if the utility company has installed [[high-pass filter]]s, which typically has already been done when carrier current-based data systems are in operation. Signals can also be impressed onto the neutral leg of the [[three-phase electric power]] system, a practice known as \"neutral loading\", in order to reduce or eliminate [[mains hum]] (60 [[hertz]] in North American installations), and to extend effective transmission line distance.\n\nFor a broadcasting installation, a typical carrier current transmitter has an output in the range 5 to 30 watts. However, electrical wiring is a very inefficient antenna, and this results in a transmitted [[effective radiated power]] of less than one watt, and the distance over which signals can be picked up is usually less than 60 meters (200 feet) from the wires. Transmission sound quality can be good, although it sometimes includes the low-frequency mains hum interference produced by the alternating current. However, not all listeners notice this hum, nor is it reproduced well by all receivers.\n\nExtensive systems can include multiple unit installations with [[linear amplifier]]s and splitters to increase the coupling points to a large electrical grid (whether a campus, a high-rise apartment or a community). These systems would typically require coaxial cable interconnection from a transmitter to the linear amplifiers. In the 1990s, LPB, Inc., possibly the largest manufacturer of these transmission systems, designed and supplied several extensive campus-based systems that included fiber-optic links between linear amplifiers to prevent heterodyne interference.\n\n==Initial development==\nThe ability for electrical conductors to act as waveguides for radio signals was noted in the earliest days of radio experimentation, and [[Heinrich Hertz]] published the first review of the phenomenon in 1889.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EYRNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&dq=%22On+the+Propagation+of+Electric+Waves+along+Wires%22&source=bl&ots=9-J4_YX0r1&sig=Dontsl4dn9M-un7jqoFFJ_kOtAM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV9I-0nfLRAhUI4CYKHVMJAjYQ6AEIFDAA#v=onepage&q=%22On%20the%20Propagation%20of%20Electric%20Waves%20along%20Wires%22&f=false \"Heinrich Hertz\"], ''The Electrician'', July 20, 1894, page 333. Hertz's paper was titled \"On the Propagation of Electric Waves along Wires\".</ref> By 1911, Major General [[George Owen Squier]] was conducting some of the earliest studies designed to put carrier current transmissions, which he called \"wired wireless\", to practical use.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d00118867a&view=1up&seq=1151 \"Multiplex Telephony and Telegraphy by Means of Electric Waves Guided by Wires\"] by George O.

He later unsuccessfully tried to claim that this had not exempted commercial concerns from paying royalties on his patents.</ref> To be effective, the radio transmitter must be capable of generating pure continuous-wave AM transmissions. Thus, the technology needed to set up carrier current transmissions would not be readily available until the late 1910s, with the development of [[vacuum tube]] transmitters and amplifiers.\n\n==Long-distance communication==\n{{Main|Power-line communication}}\nThe first commercial applications of carrier current technology included the setting up of long-distance telegraph, telemetry, and telephone communication by electrical companies over their high-voltage distribution lines. This approach had a major advantage over standard telegraph and telephone lines, because radio signals can readily jump over any small gaps in cases when there is a line break. In May 1918, the Imperial Japanese Electro-Technical Laboratory of Tokyo successfully tested \"wave telephony\" over the Kinogawa Hydro-Electric Company's 144-kilometer (90 mile) long power line.<ref name=\"schwartz\">[https://ethw.org/Telephony_over_Power_Lines_%28Early_History%29 \"Telephony over Power Lines (Early History)\"] by Mischa Schwartz, \"Presented IEEE History Conference, Newark, New Jersey, August 2007 and annotated since\". (ethw.org)</ref> In the summer of 1920, a successful test transmission over 19.2 kilometers (12 miles) of high-tension wires was reported from New Jersey,<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015080024006&view=1up&seq=169 \"Interplant Telephonic Communications Established Over High-Tension Lines\"], ''Electrical World'', July 17, 1920, page 141.</ref> and by 1929 one thousand installations had been made in the United States and Europe.<ref name=\"schwartz\" /> The majority of power line communication installations use transmissions in the longwave band, to avoid interference to and from standard AM stations.\n\n==Home entertainment services==\n===United States===\nIn 1923, the Wired Radio Service Company, a subsidiary of the local electric company, set up a subscription news and entertainment service at Staten Island, New York that used carrier current transmissions over the electrical power lines. To receive the transmissions, subscribers had to lease a receiver costing between two and five dollars a month.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015013717379&view=1up&seq=493 \"Giving the Public a Light-Socket Broadcasting Service\"] by William Harris, Jr., ''Radio Broadcast'', October 1923, pages 465-470.</ref> However, despite the power company's optimism that the system would eventually be installed nationally, the effort proved unable to compete with the free offerings provided by standard radio stations. General Squier continued to unsuccessfully promote the technology for home entertainment, until 1934, when he helped found the [[Muzak]] company, which focused on the business market.\n\n===Europe===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\nCarrier current home entertainment services would prove to be more popular in Europe. Previously, there had been a few successful [[telephone newspaper]] services, which sent entertainment to subscribers over standard telephone lines. However, carrier current transmissions had the ability to provide programs over telephone lines without affecting the regular telephone service, and could also send multiple programs simultaneously.\n\nIn Germany, the carrier current service was called ''Drahtfunk'', and in Switzerland ''Telefonrundspruch''. In the [[Soviet Union]], this approach was very common beginning in the 1930s because of its low cost and accessibility, and because it made reception of uncensored over-the-air transmissions more difficult. In Norway radiation from power lines was used, provided by the ''[[Linjesender]]'' facility. In Britain such systems were used for a time in areas where reception from conventional BBC radio transmitters was poor.\n\nIn these systems programs were fed by special transformers into the lines. To prevent uncontrolled propagation, filters for the service's carrier frequencies were installed in substations and at line branches. Systems using telephone wires were incompatible with [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] which required the same bandwidth to transmit digital data. Although the Swiss and German systems have been discontinued, the Italian ''[[:it:Filodiffusione]]'' still has several hundred thousand subscribers.\n\nPrograms formerly carried by \"wire broadcasting\" in Switzerland included:\n* 175&nbsp;kHz [[Swissinfo|Swiss Radio International]]\n* 208&nbsp;kHz RSR1 \"la premi\u00e8re\" (French)\n* 241&nbsp;kHz \"classical music\"\n* 274&nbsp;kHz [[Radiotelevisione svizzera|RSI1]] \"rete UNO\" (Italian)\n* 307&nbsp;kHz [[Radio SRF 1|DRS 1]] (German)\n* 340&nbsp;kHz \"easy music\"\n\n==Low-power broadcasting stations==\n{{See also|Low-power broadcasting}}\nCarrier current technology is also used for broadcasting radio programs that can be received over a small area by standard AM radios. This is most often associated with [[Campus radio|college radio]] and [[high school radio]], but also has applications for [[hospital radio]] stations and at military bases, sports stadiums, convention halls, mental and penal institutions, trailer parks, summer camps, office buildings, and drive-in movie theaters. Transmitters that use carrier current are very simple, making them an effective option for students interested in radio.\n\nCarrier current broadcasting began in 1936, when students at [[Brown University]] in Providence, Rhode Island developed a carrier current station initially called [[WBRU|\"The Brown Network\"]]. This station was founded by George Abraham<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170204141707/http://www.collegebroadcasters.us/content/about/gabraham.html \"Dr. George Abraham, Ph.D\"] (collegebroadcasters.us)</ref> and David W. Borst,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170313042328/http://www.collegebroadcasters.us/content/about/dborst.html \"David W. Borst\"] (collegebroadcasters.us)</ref> who had originally installed an [[intercom]] system between their dormitory rooms. The intercom links were first expanded to additional locations, and then the system was replaced by distributed low-powered radio transmitters, which fed their signals into various buildings' electrical wires, allowing nearby radio receivers to receive the transmissions.<ref>''The Gas Pipe Networks: A History of College Radio 1936-1946'' by Louis M. Bloch, Jr., 1980, pages 11-13.</ref>\n\nThe carrier current station idea soon spread to other college campuses, especially in the northeastern United States. The [[Intercollegiate Broadcasting System]] (IBS) was formed in February 1940, to coordinate activities between twelve college carrier current stations and to solicit advertisers interested in sponsoring programs geared toward their student audiences.<ref>Bloch (1980) pages 102-103.</ref> The innovation received a major publicity boost by a complimentary article that appeared in the May 24, 1941 issue of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/the-saturday-evening-post-1941-05-24/page/n37/mode/1up \"Radiator-Pipe Broadcasters\"] by Erik Barnouw, ''The Saturday Evening Post'', May 24, 1941, pages 36, 79-80.</ref> and eventually hundreds of college stations were established. Responding to the growing phenomenon, a 1941 release issued by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) stated that because of the stations' very limited ranges, it had \"not promulgated any rule governing their operation.\"<ref>Bloch (1980) page 45.</ref> Therefore, to operate legally, U.S. carrier current station broadcast emissions must adhere to the FCC's [[Title 47 CFR Part 15]] Rules for unlicensed transmissions.<ref>[https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/low-power-radio-general-information \"Low Power Radio\"] (FCC.gov)</ref>\n\n===Educational institution carrier current and cablecast stations===\nMany college stations that went on to obtain FM broadcasting licenses started out as carrier current stations because of the low cost and relative ease of starting one up. Although college-based carrier current stations have existed for over 80 years, their numbers are steadily declining, becoming supplemented, or replaced, by other transmission methods, including low-power FM ([[Low-power broadcasting|LPFM]]), [[closed-circuit radio|closed circuit]] over cable TV channels, and Internet [[Streaming media#Consumerization of streaming|streaming audio]]. As with most other student-run facilities, these stations often operate on sporadic schedules.\n\nIn the United States, unlike educational FM stations, carrier current stations can carry a full range of advertising. Due to their low power, these stations do not require an FCC license, and are not assigned an official [[call sign]]. However, in keeping with standard radio industry practice, they commonly adopt their own call sign-like identifiers.\n\n====Existing stations====\n{{Expand list|date=February 2017}}\n*Bulls Radio 1620&nbsp;\u2014 [[University of South Florida]], also heard on licensed [[WMNF]]-[[HD Radio|HD2]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bullsradio.org/|title=Welcome to BullsRadio.org|author=|date=|website=Bullsradio.org}}</ref>\n*Radio Laurier Macdonald 560 AM at [[Laurier Macdonald High School]] in [[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Leonard, Montreal, Quebec]], Canada\n*Radio SNHU 1620 at [[Southern New Hampshire University]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://radio.snhu.edu/|title=RadioSNHU|last=RadioSNHU|date=|website=radio.snhu.edu}}</ref>\n*UMSLRadio \"The U\" 1620 AM.
