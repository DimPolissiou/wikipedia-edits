Shush is identified as Shushan, mentioned in the [[Book of Esther]] and other Biblical books.\n\n== Name ==\n\nIn [[Elamite language|Elamite]], the name of the city was written variously ''\u015cu\u015dan'', ''\u015cu\u015dun'', etc. The origin of the word ''Susa'' is from the local city deity ''[[Inshushinak]]''.\n\n== Literary references ==\n\n[[File:Elam Map-en.svg|300px|thumb|left|Map showing the area of the Elamite kingdom (in orange) and the neighboring areas.

In [[Historiography|historic literature]], Susa appears in the very earliest Sumerian records: for example, it is described as one of the places obedient to [[Inanna]], patron deity of [[Uruk]], in ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''.\n\n=== Biblical texts ===\n\nSusa is also mentioned in the [[Ketuvim]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the name Shushan, mainly in [[Book of Esther|Esther]], but also once each in [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. According to these texts, Nehemiah also lived in Susa during the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] of the 6th century BCE (Daniel mentions it in a prophetic vision), while [[Esther]] became queen there, married to [[Ahasuerus|King Ahasuerus]], and saved the Jews from genocide. A tomb presumed to be that of Daniel is located in the area, known as ''Shush-Daniel''. However, a large portion of the current structure is actually a much later construction dated to the late nineteenth century, ca. 1871.<ref>Kriwaczek, Paul.

Based on C14 dating, the foundation of a settlement there occurred as early as 4395&nbsp;BCE (a calibrated radio-carbon date).<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 46.</ref> At this stage it was already very large for the time,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} about 15 hectares.\n\nThe founding of Susa corresponded with the abandonment of nearby villages. Potts suggests that the settlement may have been founded to try to reestablish the previously destroyed settlement at [[Chogha Mish]].<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\">Potts: ''Elam''.</ref> Previously, Chogha Mish was also a very large settlement, and it featured a similar massive platform that was later built at Susa.\n\nAnother important settlement in the area is [[Chogha Bonut]], that was discovered in 1976.\n\n=== Susa I period ===\n\nShortly after Susa was first settled over 6000&nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape.<ref>[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/saoc63.pdf] Hole, Frank. \"A Monumental Failure: The Collapse of Susa\".

Two settlements named by archaeologists ''Acropolis'' (7 ha) and ''Apadana'' (6.3 ha), would later merge to form Susa proper (18 ha).<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\"/> The ''Apadana'' was enclosed by 6m thick walls of [[rammed earth]] (this particular place is named [[Apadana]] because it also contains a late [[Achaemenid]] structure of this type).\n\n[[File:Iran \u00e9poque d'Obeid S\u00e8vres.jpg|thumb|320px|Goblet and cup, Iran, Susa I style, 4th millennium BC \u2013 [[Ubaid period]]; goblet height c. 12&nbsp;cm; [[S\u00e8vres \u2013 Cit\u00e9 de la c\u00e9ramique]], France]]\n\nNearly two thousand pots of ''Susa I'' style were recovered from the cemetery, most of them now in the [[Louvre]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\">{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}</ref>\nPainted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium BC.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\"/> Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types\u2014a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar\u2014implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}</ref> The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.\n\nCopper metallurgy is also attested during this period, which was contemporary with metalwork at some highland Iranian sites such as [[Tepe Sialk]].\n\n=== Susa II and Uruk influence ===\n\n[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|Globular envelope with the accounting tokens. Clay, Uruk period (c. 3500 BCE). From the Tell of the Acropolis in Susa. [[The Louvre]]]]\n\nSusa came within the Uruk cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture is found at Susa. According to some scholars, Susa may have been a colony of Uruk.\n\nThere is some dispute about the comparative [[periodization]] of Susa and Uruk at this time, as well as about the extent of Uruk influence in Susa. Recent research indicates that Early Uruk period corresponds to Susa II period.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} p58</ref>\n\nD. T. Potts, argue that the influence from the highland Iranian [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]] area in Susa was more significant at the early period, and also continued later on. Thus, Susa combined the influence of two cultures, from the highland area and from the [[alluvial plains]]. Also, Potts stresses the fact that the writing and numerical systems of Uruk were not simply borrowed in Susa wholesale. Rather, only partial and selective borrowing took place, that was adapted to Susa's needs. Despite the fact that Uruk was far larger than Susa at the time, Susa was not its colony, but still maintained some independence for a long time, according to Potts.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} pp 58\u201361</ref> An architectural link has also been suggested between Susa, Tal-i Malyan, and [[Godin Tepe]] at this time, in support of the idea of the parallel development of the protocuneiform and protoelamite scripts.<ref>F.

Holly Pittman, an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says,  \"they [Susanians] are participating entirely in an Uruk way of life.  They are not culturally distinct; the material culture of Susa is a regional variation of that on the Mesopotamian plain\". Gilbert Stein, director of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, says that \"An expansion once thought to have lasted less than 200 years now apparently went on for 700 years. It is hard to think of any colonial system lasting that long. The spread of Uruk material is not evidence of Uruk domination; it could be local choice\".<ref>Lawler, Andrew.  2003.

Also, he was the last from the [[Awan dynasty]] according to the Susa kinglist.<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 122.</ref> He unified the neighbouring territories and became the king of [[Elam]]. He encouraged the use of the [[Linear Elamite]] script, that remains undeciphered.\n\nThe city was subsequently conquered by the neo-Sumerian [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] and held until Ur finally collapsed at the hands of the Elamites under Kindattu in ca. 2004&nbsp;BCE. At this time, Susa became an Elamite capital under the Epartid dynasty.\n\n==== Middle Elamite period ====\nAround 1500 BCE, the Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties. Their rule was characterized by an \"Elamisation\" of Susa, and the kings took the title \"king of Anshan and Susa\". While, previously, the Akkadian language was frequently used in inscriptions, the succeeding kings, such as the Igihalkid dynasty of c. 1400&nbsp;BCE, tried to use Elamite. Thus, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana.<ref name=\"The history of Elam\"/>\n\nThis was also the period when the Elamite pantheon was being imposed in Susiana. This policy reached its height with the construction of the political and religious complex at [[Chogha Zanbil]], {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of Susa.\n\nIn ca. 1175&nbsp;BCE, the Elamites under [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] plundered the original [[stele]] bearing the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' and took it to Susa.

Coins also continued to be minted in the city. The city had a Christian community in a separate district with a Nestorian bishop, whose last representative is attested to in 1265. Archaeologically a stucco panel with the image of a Christian saint has been found.\n\nDuring the reign of Shapur II after Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 312, and the identification of Christians as possible collaborators with the enemy Christians living in the Sasanian Empire were persecuted from 339 onwards.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Neusner |first= Jacob |title=  Babylonian Jewry And Shapur Ii's Persecution of Christianity From 339 to 379&nbsp;CE |journal= Hebrew Union College Annual |volume= 43 |pages=  77\u2013102 |publisher=  Hebrew Union College Press |year = 1972 }}</ref> Shapur II also imposed a double tax on the Christians during his war campaign against the Romans.

A place of military importance, it also held the tomb of the Jewish prophet [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]].\n[[File:1977 Susa conference-Iran.jpg|thumb|A group of Western and Iranian Archaeologists at a conference held in Susa, Khuzestan, Iran in 1977.

In the first, a Persian priest proclaimed from the walls that only a ''dajjal'' was fated to capture the city. A ''dajjal'' is an Islamic term for an ''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'', a false messiah, compatible to the [[Antichrist]] in Christianity. In everyday use, it also means \"deceiver\" or \"imposter\". Siyah, a Persian general who had defected to Muslim side, claimed that by converting to Islam he had turned his back on Zoroastrianism and was thus a ''dajjal''. Abu Musa agreed to Siyah's plan. Soon after as the sun came up one morning, the sentries on the walls saw a man in a Persian officer's uniform covered in blood lying on the ground before the main gate. Thinking it he had been left out overnight after a conflict the previous day, they opened the gate and some came out to collect him. As they approached, Siyah jumped up and killed them. Before the other sentries had time to react, Siyah and a small group of Muslim soldiers hidden nearby charged through the open gate. They held the gate open long enough for Muslim reinforcements to arrive and passing through the gate to take the city.<ref name= Crawford>{{cite book |last= Crawford |first= Peter |title= The War of the Three Gods: Romans, Persians and the Rise of Islam |location= Barnsley |publisher= Pen & Sword Military |year= 2013 | pages= 183\u2013184 |isbn= 978-1-84884-612-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the other story, once again the Muslims were taunted from the city wall that only an ''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'' could capture the city, and since there were none in the besieging army then they may as well give up and go home.

They then broke open the silver coffin and carried off the mummified corpse, removing from the corpse a signet ring, which carried an image of a man between two lions. However, upon hearing what had happened, the caliph [[Umar]] ordered the ring to be returned and the body reburied under the river bed.<ref name= Kennedy /> In time, Daniel became a Muslim cult figure and they as well as Christians began making pilgrimages to the site, despite several other places claiming to be the site of Daniel's grave.<ref name= Kennedy />\n\nFollowing the capture of Susa, the Muslims moved on to besiege [[Gundeshapur]].<ref name= Crawford/>\n\nSusa recovered following its capture and remained a regional center of more than 400 hectares in size.<ref>{{cite book |last= Amiet |first= Pierre |title= M\u00e9moires de la D\u00e9l\u00e9gation arch\u00e9ologique en Iran: Glyptique susienne des origines \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des Perses ach\u00e9m\u00e9nides: cachets, sceaux-cylindres et empreintes antiques d\u00e9couverts \u00e0 Suse de 1913 \u00e0 1967 |location= Paris |publisher= P.

Shush is identified as Shushan, mentioned in the [[Book of Esther]] and other Biblical books.\n\n== Name ==\n\nIn [[Elamite language|Elamite]], the name of the city was written variously ''\u015cu\u015dan'', ''\u015cu\u015dun'', etc. The origin of the word ''Susa'' is from the local city deity ''[[Inshushinak]]''.\n\n== Literary references ==\n\n[[File:Elam Map-en.svg|300px|thumb|left|Map showing the area of the Elamite kingdom (in orange) and the neighboring areas.

In [[Historiography|historic literature]], Susa appears in the very earliest Sumerian records: for example, it is described as one of the places obedient to [[Inanna]], patron deity of [[Uruk]], in ''[[Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta]]''.\n\n=== Biblical texts ===\n\nSusa is also mentioned in the [[Ketuvim]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the name Shushan, mainly in [[Book of Esther|Esther]], but also once each in [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] and [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]]. According to these texts, Nehemiah also lived in Susa during the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian captivity]] of the 6th century BCE (Daniel mentions it in a prophetic vision), while [[Esther]] became queen there, married to [[Ahasuerus|King Ahasuerus]], and saved the Jews from genocide. A tomb presumed to be that of Daniel is located in the area, known as ''Shush-Daniel''. However, a large portion of the current structure is actually a much later construction dated to the late nineteenth century, ca. 1871.<ref>Kriwaczek, Paul. ''Babylon: Mesopotamia and the Birth of Civilization'', St. Martin's Press, 2010, p. 5</ref> Susa is further mentioned in the ''[[Book of Jubilees]]'' (8:21 & 9:2) as one of the places within the inheritance of [[Shem]] and his eldest son Elam; and in 8:1, \"Susan\" is also named as the son (or daughter, in some translations) of Elam.\n\n== Excavation history ==\n\n[[File:Susa map.jpg|thumb|Site of Susa]]\n[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2344.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria.

Based on C14 dating, the foundation of a settlement there occurred as early as 4395&nbsp;BCE (a calibrated radio-carbon date).<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 46.</ref> At this stage it was already very large for the time,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} about 15 hectares.\n\nThe founding of Susa corresponded with the abandonment of nearby villages. Potts suggests that the settlement may have been founded to try to reestablish the previously destroyed settlement at [[Chogha Mish]].<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\">Potts: ''Elam''.</ref> Previously, Chogha Mish was also a very large settlement, and it featured a similar massive platform that was later built at Susa.\n\nAnother important settlement in the area is [[Chogha Bonut]], that was discovered in 1976.\n\n=== Susa I period ===\n\nShortly after Susa was first settled over 6000&nbsp;years ago, its inhabitants erected a monumental platform that rose over the flat surrounding landscape.<ref>[https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/saoc63.pdf] Hole, Frank. \"A Monumental Failure: The Collapse of Susa\".

Two settlements named by archaeologists ''Acropolis'' (7 ha) and ''Apadana'' (6.3 ha), would later merge to form Susa proper (18 ha).<ref name=\"Potts: Elam\"/> The ''Apadana'' was enclosed by 6m thick walls of [[rammed earth]] (this particular place is named [[Apadana]] because it also contains a late [[Achaemenid]] structure of this type).\n\n[[File:Iran \u00e9poque d'Obeid S\u00e8vres.jpg|thumb|320px|Goblet and cup, Iran, Susa I style, 4th millennium BC \u2013 [[Ubaid period]]; goblet height c. 12&nbsp;cm; [[S\u00e8vres \u2013 Cit\u00e9 de la c\u00e9ramique]], France]]\n\nNearly two thousand pots of ''Susa I'' style were recovered from the cemetery, most of them now in the [[Louvre]]. The vessels found are eloquent testimony to the artistic and technical achievements of their makers, and they hold clues about the organization of the society that commissioned them.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\">{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=26}}</ref>\nPainted ceramic vessels from Susa in the earliest first style are a late, regional version of the Mesopotamian [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] ceramic tradition that spread across the Near East during the fifth millennium BC.<ref name=\"Aruz 1992 26\"/> Susa I style was very much a product of the past and of influences from contemporary ceramic industries in the mountains of western Iran. The recurrence in close association of vessels of three types\u2014a drinking goblet or beaker, a serving dish, and a small jar\u2014implies the consumption of three types of food, apparently thought to be as necessary for life in the afterworld as it is in this one. Ceramics of these shapes, which were painted, constitute a large proportion of the vessels from the cemetery. Others are coarse cooking-type jars and bowls with simple bands painted on them and were probably the grave goods of the sites of humbler citizens as well as adolescents and, perhaps, children.<ref>{{cite book|last=Aruz|first=Joan|title=The Royal City of Susa: Ancient Near Eastern Treasures in the Louvre|year=1992|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=29}}</ref> The pottery is carefully made by hand. Although a slow wheel may have been employed, the asymmetry of the vessels and the irregularity of the drawing of encircling lines and bands indicate that most of the work was done freehand.\n\nCopper metallurgy is also attested during this period, which was contemporary with metalwork at some highland Iranian sites such as [[Tepe Sialk]].\n\n=== Susa II and Uruk influence ===\n\n[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|Globular envelope with the accounting tokens. Clay, Uruk period (c. 3500 BCE). From the Tell of the Acropolis in Susa. [[The Louvre]]]]\n\nSusa came within the Uruk cultural sphere during the [[Uruk period]]. An imitation of the entire state apparatus of Uruk, [[proto-writing]], [[cylinder seal]]s with Sumerian motifs, and monumental architecture is found at Susa. According to some scholars, Susa may have been a colony of Uruk.\n\nThere is some dispute about the comparative [[periodization]] of Susa and Uruk at this time, as well as about the extent of Uruk influence in Susa. Recent research indicates that Early Uruk period corresponds to Susa II period.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} p58</ref>\n\nD. T. Potts, argue that the influence from the highland Iranian [[Khuzestan province|Khuzestan]] area in Susa was more significant at the early period, and also continued later on. Thus, Susa combined the influence of two cultures, from the highland area and from the [[alluvial plains]]. Also, Potts stresses the fact that the writing and numerical systems of Uruk were not simply borrowed in Susa wholesale. Rather, only partial and selective borrowing took place, that was adapted to Susa's needs. Despite the fact that Uruk was far larger than Susa at the time, Susa was not its colony, but still maintained some independence for a long time, according to Potts.<ref>D. T. Potts, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WE62CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA58 ''The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State.''] Cambridge World Archaeology. Cambridge University Press, 2015 {{ISBN|1107094690}} pp 58\u201361</ref> An architectural link has also been suggested between Susa, Tal-i Malyan, and [[Godin Tepe]] at this time, in support of the idea of the parallel development of the protocuneiform and protoelamite scripts.<ref>F. Desset, An Architectural Pattern in Late Fourth-Millennium BC Western Iran: A New Link Between Susa, Tal-I Malyan, and Godin Tepe, Iran, vol. 52, iss. 1, pp. 1\u201318, 2014</ref>\n\nSome scholars believe that Susa was part of the greater Uruk culture. Holly Pittman, an art historian at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia says,  \"they [Susanians] are participating entirely in an Uruk way of life.  They are not culturally distinct; the material culture of Susa is a regional variation of that on the Mesopotamian plain\". Gilbert Stein, director of the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute, says that \"An expansion once thought to have lasted less than 200 years now apparently went on for 700 years. It is hard to think of any colonial system lasting that long. The spread of Uruk material is not evidence of Uruk domination; it could be local choice\".<ref>Lawler, Andrew.  2003.

Also, he was the last from the [[Awan dynasty]] according to the Susa kinglist.<ref>Potts: ''Elam'', pp. 122.</ref> He unified the neighbouring territories and became the king of [[Elam]]. He encouraged the use of the [[Linear Elamite]] script, that remains undeciphered.\n\nThe city was subsequently conquered by the neo-Sumerian [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] and held until Ur finally collapsed at the hands of the Elamites under Kindattu in ca. 2004&nbsp;BCE. At this time, Susa became an Elamite capital under the Epartid dynasty.\n\n==== Middle Elamite period ====\nAround 1500 BCE, the Middle Elamite period began with the rise of the Anshanite dynasties. Their rule was characterized by an \"Elamisation\" of Susa, and the kings took the title \"king of Anshan and Susa\". While, previously, the Akkadian language was frequently used in inscriptions, the succeeding kings, such as the Igihalkid dynasty of c. 1400&nbsp;BCE, tried to use Elamite. Thus, Elamite language and culture grew in importance in Susiana.<ref name=\"The history of Elam\"/>\n\nThis was also the period when the Elamite pantheon was being imposed in Susiana. This policy reached its height with the construction of the political and religious complex at [[Chogha Zanbil]], {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south-east of Susa.\n\nIn ca. 1175&nbsp;BCE, the Elamites under [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]] plundered the original [[stele]] bearing the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' and took it to Susa. Archeologists found it in 1901.

Archaeologically a stucco panel with the image of a Christian saint has been found.\n\nDuring the reign of Shapur II after Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire in 312, and the identification of Christians as possible collaborators with the enemy Christians living in the Sasanian Empire were persecuted from 339 onwards.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Neusner |first= Jacob |title=  Babylonian Jewry And Shapur Ii's Persecution of Christianity From 339 to 379&nbsp;CE |journal= Hebrew Union College Annual |volume= 43 |pages=  77\u2013102 |publisher=  Hebrew Union College Press |year = 1972 }}</ref> Shapur II also imposed a double tax on the Christians during his war campaign against the Romans.

In the first, a Persian priest proclaimed from the walls that only a ''dajjal'' was fated to capture the city. A ''dajjal'' is an Islamic term for an ''[[Al-Masih ad-Dajjal]]'', a false messiah, compatible to the [[Antichrist]] in Christianity. In everyday use, it also means \"deceiver\" or \"imposter\". Siyah, a Persian general who had defected to Muslim side, claimed that by converting to Islam he had turned his back on Zoroastrianism and was thus a ''dajjal''. Abu Musa agreed to Siyah's plan. Soon after as the sun came up one morning, the sentries on the walls saw a man in a Persian officer's uniform covered in blood lying on the ground before the main gate. Thinking it he had been left out overnight after a conflict the previous day, they opened the gate and some came out to collect him. As they approached, Siyah jumped up and killed them. Before the other sentries had time to react, Siyah and a small group of Muslim soldiers hidden nearby charged through the open gate.

Maimoona's brother Baseerat Hussain ([[Behroze Sabzwari]]) is wealthy and married to Farida ([[Atiqa Odho]]); they have a son named Ashar ([[Fawad Khan]]). After the doctors inform  Maimoona that she is in the last stage of cancer & that she will die soon, Maimoona seeks her brother's help in arranging Khirad's marriage. Feeling guilty for not taking better care of Maimoona, Baseerat compensates by promising that Ashar will marry Khirad, unbeknownst to both Ashar & Farida. This irks Farida, who has always wanted Ashar to marry his cousin Sara ([[Naveen Waqar]]), the daughter of Farida's sister Zarina Ajmal ([[Hina Khawaja Bayat]]). Khirad is the last to find out about the engagement & begs her mother not go through with it, as she does not know Ashar nor does she love him. In spite of their reluctance, Ashar and Khirad are married moments before Maimoona passes away. Sara, who is in love with Ashar, is heartbroken upon learning this and attempts suicide. Both Ashar and Khirad are standoffish towards each other and feel uncomfortable in the forced marriage. Ashar still promises Khirad that he will attempt to maintain a stable & civil relationship. Khirad feels that by marrying a man who is financially superior, she has lost her self-respect. With the encouragement of Sara, Ashar avoids going home by staying out late with friends. After overhearing Khirad vent her fustrastions about the marriage arrangement to Baseerat, Ashar becomes more considerate towards Khirad's feelings & needs. Gradually, the duo fall deeply in love with each other. Ashar admires Khirad's innocence, simplicity and purity of heart; his admiration is reciprocated by Khirad, who is in awe of his caring personality. While he develops a strong and loving relationship with his wife, Ashar remains friends with Sara. Noticing Ashar's bond with Khirad is getting stronger, Sara attempts to interfere in their relationship. When Sara humiliates Khirad at a party, Ashar reprimands her for her callousness. Farida pretends to desire a mother-daughter bond with Khirad and displays false affection for her after Baseerat threatens her with divorce. Soon, Baseerat falls ill and on his death-bed, he reminds his son that it is important for him to always protect and love Khirad.\n\nEncouraged by Ashar, Khirad enrolls in university for graduate studies. She meets Khizar, Sara's paternal cousin, who has strong feelings for Sara. In order to win her affection, he agrees to a conspiracy hatched by Farida. To create misunderstandings between Khirad and Ashar, he begins to visit their house, while praising and flirting with Khirad; this makes Ashar increasingly jealous. Farida offers Khizar a deal; to receive money and Sara's hand in marriage, he must convince Ashar that he is having an affair with Khirad. In the meantime, Khirad discovers that she is pregnant with Ashar's child and plans to surprise him. After finding out about Khirad's pregnancy, Farida invites Khirad to a dinner at a family friend's house. However unbeknownst to Khirad the house is actually Khizar's. Farida successfully causes Ashar to witness what appears to be Khizar and Khirad's intimacy. Farida pretends to be outraged at Khirad's supposed adultery, and insults her while Ashar listens tearfully. Khirad protests and calls Khizar, who continuously insists that they are having an affair. After Farida, Zarina & Ashar leave, Khizar explains to Khirad why he lied. Hurt and enraged Ashar drives around & strolls the beach all night. Leaving no chance for Ashar to speak to her, Farida exiles Khirad from the house. Before taking refuge with her mother's old friend Batool Bano in Hyderabad, Khirad leaves a note for Ashar in which she proclaims her innocence, Fareeda's set up & reveals her pregnancy. Jamaal, the house servant, gives Ashar the letter but he never reads it. Khirad desperately attempts to contact Ashar, however he refuses to listen to her. A few months later, Khirad goes into premature labour while attempting to contact Ashar one last time, who ignores her phone call. Khirad gives birth to a baby girl and names her Hareem; she vows that she will never forgive Ashar for what he did to her.\n\nFour years later, Khirad reluctantly returns to Karachi, where she visits Ashar to seek financial assistance for Hareem, who needs open heart surgery. He initially refuses to help and fails to believe that Hareem is his daughter, but relents after he sees Hareem. Ashar begins making arrangements for Hareem to see a specialist and dictates to Khirad that they will live with him, while Farida is out of town. During Khirad's stay Ashar displays an attitude of disdain for her but spoils Harreem. When Sara discovers that Khirad has returned, she confronts Ashar and informs Farida, who returns early from a trip to America and threatens to exile Khirad once again. In retaliation, Khirad threatens to tell Ashar the truth about her being framed. After Sara confesses her love, Ashar informs Sara that he has never loved her and suggests that she should stop pursuing him. Khizar arrives from America and blackmails Farida by threatening to reveal Khirad's innocence if Sara does not marry him. Farida urges Sara to marry Khizar, but Sara and her mother Zarina refuse and blames Farida for ruining Sara's life. Meanwhile, Hareem's operation is successful and Ashar finds that his feelings for Khirad have rekindled.\n\nZarina is disturbed by Sara's everlasting depression, which stems from Ashar's rejection and Fareeda's betrayal. Ashar attempts to reconcile with Khirad, citing love of their daughter, but she rejects him and decides to leave Hareem in his care. Having realized that Sara will never marry him, Khizar visits Ashar to reveal the truth but an angered Ashar has him escorted out by security. The incident sparks the memories of Ashar's past with his wife and in his sorrow, he accidentally discovers the letter that Khirad left for him, which he had thrown aside. Ashar then overhears his mother's conversation with Khizar, and finally learns of their collaboration. Sara commits suicide and her mother blames Farida for her misery. With the pretense that Hareem is missing her and not eating anything, Ashar asks Khirad to return from Hyderabad who is living with her mother's old friend Batool Bano. He then confronts Farida, accusing her of destroying his life, and simultaneously blames himself for failing to trust his wife. Farida loses her sanity when she realizes what she has done to Ashar and Sara. Ashar begs for Khirad's forgiveness and asks her to return to his life; she finally forgives him and they reconcile. Three months later, the two are shown to be living a happy life with their daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Ashar Hussainn\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Khirad Ashar Hussain \n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Sara Ajmal\n* [[Atiqa Odho]] as Farida Hussain\n* [[Behroze Sabzwari]] as Baseerat Hussain\n* Sara Kashif as Hareem Hussain (child)\n* [[Hina Khawaja Bayat]] as Zarina Ajmal\n* [[Noor Hassan Rizvi]] as Khizar \n* Saba Faisal as Maimoona Ahsaan\n*[[Shahbaz Wolf Rajput]] as Ali\n* Qaiser Naqvi as Batool Bano\n\n===Guest Appearances===\n* [[Khalid Anam]] as Khirad's father\n* [[Mansha Pasha]] as the wife of Ashar's friend\n* [[Kanwar Arsalan]] as Raza, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Kanwar Atiq ur Rehman]] as Umar, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Dr. Idrees, Khirad's Professor\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = [[Woh Humsafar Tha]]\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   =\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Theme song]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=39|s=47}}\n| language   = [[Urdu language|Urdu]]\n| label      =\n| producer   = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe show's theme song ''Woh Humsafar Tha'' was composed by [[Waqar Ali]] and sung by [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]].

Maimoona's brother Baseerat Hussain ([[Behroze Sabzwari]]) is wealthy and married to Farida ([[Atiqa Odho]]); they have a son named Ashar ([[Fawad Khan]]). After the doctors inform  Maimoona that she is in the last stage of cancer & that she will die soon, Maimoona seeks her brother's help in arranging Khirad's marriage. Feeling guilty for not taking better care of Maimoona, Baseerat compensates by promising that Ashar will marry Khirad, unbeknownst to both Ashar & Farida. This irks Farida, who has always wanted Ashar to marry his cousin Sara ([[Naveen Waqar]]), the daughter of Farida's sister Zarina Ajmal ([[Hina Khawaja Bayat]]). Khirad is the last to find out about the engagement & begs her mother not go through with it, as she does not know Ashar nor does she love him. In spite of their reluctance, Ashar and Khirad are married moments before Maimoona passes away. Sara, who is in love with Ashar, is heartbroken upon learning this and attempts suicide. Both Ashar and Khirad are standoffish towards each other and feel uncomfortable in the forced marriage. Ashar still promises Khirad that he will attempt to maintain a stable & civil relationship. Khirad feels that by marrying a man who is financially superior, she has lost her self-respect. With the encouragement of Sara, Ashar avoids going home by staying out late with friends. After overhearing Khirad vent her fustrastions about the marriage arrangement to Baseerat, Ashar becomes more considerate towards Khirad's feelings & needs. Gradually, the duo fall deeply in love with each other. Ashar admires Khirad's innocence, simplicity and purity of heart; his admiration is reciprocated by Khirad, who is in awe of his caring personality. While he develops a strong and loving relationship with his wife, Ashar remains friends with Sara. Noticing Ashar's bond with Khirad is getting stronger, Sara attempts to interfere in their relationship. When Sara humiliates Khirad at a party, Ashar reprimands her for her callousness. Farida pretends to desire a mother-daughter bond with Khirad and displays false affection for her after Baseerat threatens her with divorce. Soon, Baseerat falls ill and on his death-bed, he reminds his son that it is important for him to always protect and love Khirad.\n\nEncouraged by Ashar, Khirad enrolls in university for graduate studies. She meets Khizar, Sara's paternal cousin, who has strong feelings for Sara. In order to win her affection, he agrees to a conspiracy hatched by Farida. To create misunderstandings between Khirad and Ashar, he begins to visit their house, while praising and flirting with Khirad; this makes Ashar increasingly jealous. Farida offers Khizar a deal; to receive money and Sara's hand in marriage, he must convince Ashar that he is having an affair with Khirad. In the meantime, Khirad discovers that she is pregnant with Ashar's child and plans to surprise him. After finding out about Khirad's pregnancy, Farida invites Khirad to a dinner at a family friend's house. However unbeknownst to Khirad the house is actually Khizar's. Farida successfully causes Ashar to witness what appears to be Khizar and Khirad's intimacy. Farida pretends to be outraged at Khirad's supposed adultery, and insults her while Ashar listens tearfully. Khirad protests and calls Khizar, who continuously insists that they are having an affair. After Farida, Zarina & Ashar leave, Khizar explains to Khirad why he lied. Hurt and enraged Ashar drives around & strolls the beach all night. Leaving no chance for Ashar to speak to her, Farida exiles Khirad from the house. Before taking refuge with her mother's old friend Batool Bano in Hyderabad, Khirad leaves a note for Ashar in which she proclaims her innocence, Fareeda's set up & reveals her pregnancy. Jamaal, the house servant, gives Ashar the letter but he never reads it. Khirad desperately attempts to contact Ashar, however he refuses to listen to her. A few months later, Khirad goes into premature labour while attempting to contact Ashar one last time, who ignores her phone call. Khirad gives birth to a baby girl and names her Hareem; she vows that she will never forgive Ashar for what he did to her.\n\nFour years later, Khirad reluctantly returns to Karachi, where she visits Ashar to seek financial assistance for Hareem, who needs open heart surgery. He initially refuses to help and fails to believe that Hareem is his daughter, but relents after he sees Hareem. Ashar begins making arrangements for Hareem to see a specialist and dictates to Khirad that they will live with him, while Farida is out of town. During Khirad's stay Ashar displays an attitude of disdain for her but spoils Harreem. When Sara discovers that Khirad has returned, she confronts Ashar and informs Farida, who returns early from a trip to America and threatens to exile Khirad once again. In retaliation, Khirad threatens to tell Ashar the truth about her being framed. After Sara confesses her love, Ashar informs Sara that he has never loved her and suggests that she should stop pursuing him. Khizar arrives from America and blackmails Farida by threatening to reveal Khirad's innocence if Sara does not marry him. Farida urges Sara to marry Khizar, but Sara and her mother Zarina refuse and blames Farida for ruining Sara's life. Meanwhile, Hareem's operation is successful and Ashar finds that his feelings for Khirad have rekindled.\n\nZarina is disturbed by Sara's everlasting depression, which stems from Ashar's rejection and Fareeda's betrayal. Ashar attempts to reconcile with Khirad, citing love of their daughter, but she rejects him and decides to leave Hareem in his care. Having realized that Sara will never marry him, Khizar visits Ashar to reveal the truth but an angered Ashar has him escorted out by security. The incident sparks the memories of Ashar's past with his wife and in his sorrow, he accidentally discovers the letter that Khirad left for him, which he had thrown aside. Ashar then overhears his mother's conversation with Khizar, and finally learns of their collaboration. Sara commits suicide and her mother blames Farida for her misery. With the pretense that Hareem is missing her and not eating anything, Ashar asks Khirad to return from Hyderabad who is living with her mother's old friend Batool Bano. He then confronts Farida, accusing her of destroying his life, and simultaneously blames himself for failing to trust his wife. Farida loses her sanity when she realizes what she has done to Ashar and Sara. Ashar begs for Khirad's forgiveness and asks her to return to his life; she finally forgives him and they reconcile. Three months later, the two are shown to be living a happy life with their daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fawad Khan]] as Ashar Hussainn\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Khirad Ashar Hussain \n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Sara Ajmal\n* [[Atiqa Odho]] as Farida Hussain\n* [[Behroze Sabzwari]] as Baseerat Hussain\n* Sara Kashif as Hareem Hussain (child)\n* [[Hina Khawaja Bayat]] as Zarina Ajmal\n* [[Noor Hassan Rizvi]] as Khizar \n* Saba Faisal as Maimoona Ahsaan\n*[[Shahbaz Wolf Rajput]] as Ali\n* Qaiser Naqvi as Batool Bano\n\n===Guest Appearances===\n* [[Khalid Anam]] as Khirad's father\n* [[Mansha Pasha]] as the wife of Ashar's friend\n* [[Kanwar Arsalan]] as Raza, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Kanwar Atiq ur Rehman]] as Umar, Ashar's colleague\n* [[Sarmad Khoosat]] as Dr. Idrees, Khirad's Professor\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = [[Woh Humsafar Tha]]\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   =\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Theme song]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=39|s=47}}\n| language   = [[Urdu language|Urdu]]\n| label      =\n| producer   = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n\nThe show's theme song ''Woh Humsafar Tha'' was composed by [[Waqar Ali]] and sung by [[Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch]].

[[Selective breeding]] of plants and animals has led to varieties that differ dramatically from their original wild-type ancestors. Examples are the [[cabbage]] varieties, [[maize]], or the large number of different [[dog]] breeds. The power of human breeding to create varieties with extreme differences from a single species was already recognized by [[Charles Darwin]]. In fact, he started out his book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' with a chapter on variation in domestic animals. In this chapter, Darwin discussed in particular the pigeon.\n{{quotation|Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him.\n(...) I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (''Columba livia''), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects.|[[Charles Darwin]]|The Origin of Species}}\n\n=== Early ===\n[[File:Dallinger Incubator J.R.Microscop.Soc.1887p193.png|thumb|upright|Drawing of the incubator used by Dallinger in his evolution experiments.]]\nOne of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment was [[William Dallinger]]. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small [[unicellular organism]]s in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880\u20131886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60&nbsp;\u00b0F up to 158&nbsp;\u00b0F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73&nbsp;\u00b0F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158&nbsp;\u00b0F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158&nbsp;\u00b0F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60&nbsp;\u00b0F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Dallinger's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hass|first=J.

[[Selective breeding]] of plants and animals has led to varieties that differ dramatically from their original wild-type ancestors. Examples are the [[cabbage]] varieties, [[maize]], or the large number of different [[dog]] breeds. The power of human breeding to create varieties with extreme differences from a single species was already recognized by [[Charles Darwin]]. In fact, he started out his book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' with a chapter on variation in domestic animals. In this chapter, Darwin discussed in particular the pigeon.\n{{quotation|Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him.\n(...) I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (''Columba livia''), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects.|[[Charles Darwin]]|The Origin of Species}}\n\n=== Early ===\n[[File:Dallinger Incubator J.R.Microscop.Soc.1887p193.png|thumb|upright|Drawing of the incubator used by Dallinger in his evolution experiments.]]\nOne of the first to carry out a controlled evolution experiment was [[William Dallinger]]. In the late 19th century, he cultivated small [[unicellular organism]]s in a custom-built incubator over a time period of seven years (1880\u20131886). Dallinger slowly increased the temperature of the incubator from an initial 60&nbsp;\u00b0F up to 158&nbsp;\u00b0F. The early cultures had shown clear signs of distress at a temperature of 73&nbsp;\u00b0F, and were certainly not capable of surviving at 158&nbsp;\u00b0F. The organisms Dallinger had in his incubator at the end of the experiment, on the other hand, were perfectly fine at 158&nbsp;\u00b0F. However, these organisms would no longer grow at the initial 60&nbsp;\u00b0F. Dallinger concluded that he had found evidence for Darwinian adaptation in his incubator, and that the organisms had adapted to live in a high-temperature environment. Dallinger's incubator was accidentally destroyed in 1886, and Dallinger could not continue this line of research.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hass|first=J.
