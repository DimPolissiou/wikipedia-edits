Starting his political career in the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], he [[party switching|switched]] to the Labour Party around the turn of the 20th century. He represented that party in the [[B\u00e6rum]] municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of [[Stortinget|Parliament]], but served nonetheless as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1935 to 1940, as part of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government-in-exile]] following [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Germany's invasion of Norway]]. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, a decision that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to his academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs an academic he was a professor of history at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo) from 1910 to 1935, having become a [[research fellow]] in 1900 and [[docent]] in 1908. Among many honors, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long academic career. He wrote several biographies; his works on [[Johan Sverdrup]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]] spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian [[nation]]. He was also interested in the [[United States]] and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.\n\nKoht's views on the [[Norwegian language]] also gave him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the [[Norwegian language#Danish to Norwegian|Samnorsk]] language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led to the failure of this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was a founding member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]] and an ordinary member of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic person, who nurtured a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Paul_Koht_by_L_Szacinski.jpg|left|thumb|Koht's father [[Paul Steenstrup Koht]] (1844\u20131892)|alt=photograph of elderly man with glasses|199x199px]]\nHalvdan Koht was born on 7 August 1873 in [[Troms\u00f8]], one of the larger cities in Northern Norway.

Gi\u00e6ver who voiced his dislike for the name. He was then christened Halfdan, changed to Halvdan some years later.<ref>Koht, 1951: pp. 7\u20138.</ref> The family lived in Troms\u00f8, where Paul Steenstrup Koht was a headmaster and mayor. The family moved to Skien when Halvdan was twelve years old, where his father again immersed himself in politics: he served as mayor as well as parliamentarian for the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]]. Koht finished school here, taking his [[examen artium]] in 1890.<ref name=nbl/> His father was among his teachers for a while in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 20.</ref> In 1893, one year after the death of Koht's father, the family moved to [[Bekkelaget]], a borough in [[Aker, Norway|Aker]]. Koht studied at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo).<ref name=nbl/>\n\nIn September 1898 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]], Koht married [[Karen Grude Koht|Karen Elisabeth Grude]] (1871\u20131960), an essay writer and women's rights activist one and a half years his senior; she bore him three children. One child died in infancy, but the remaining two had distinguished careers: [[\u00c5se Gruda Skard]] (n\u00e9e Koht) became a child psychologist and [[Paul Koht]] an ambassador. Through \u00c5sa, Halvdan Koht was a father-in-law of literary scholar [[Sigmund Skard]] and a grandfather of politician and academic [[Torild Skard]], psychologist and ombud [[M\u00e5lfrid Grude Flekk\u00f8y]]<ref name=nbl/> and politician and organisational leader [[Halvdan Skard]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halvdan Skard|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Skard|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 January 2010}}</ref> In the late 1920s, Karen's declining health and Halvdan's preoccupation with his work placed a strain on their relationship.

He rarely had responsibility for any teaching of the students, and since he was often busy with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'' he remained a research fellow until 1907. In 1908 he took his [[dr.philos.]] degree on the thesis ''Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-D\u00e4nischen Konflikt 1863\u20131864''.<ref name=innleiing7/> Opponents at the dissertation were [[Ebbe Hertzberg]] and [[Yngvar Nielsen]].<ref name=p119>Koht, 1951: pp. 119\u2013122.</ref>\n\nKoht was then hired as a [[docent]] at the University in 1908. Because Koht had internal opponents at the university, the docenture was designated to cover \"cultural history\" instead of \"history\". A while later the university changed it to \"history\". The [[L\u00f8vland's Cabinet|cabinet]] changed it back to \"cultural history\", before the Parliament finally decided on \"history\".<ref name=p119/> Koht was going to start his tenure as a docent, but argued with [[Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger (geologist)|Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger]] that he deserved to travel abroad first.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 124.</ref> From 1908 to 1909 Koht travelled around in the United States, England and Sweden, visiting the peace conferences in London (1908), [[Chicago]] (1909) and Stockholm (1910).<ref name=innleiing7/> During these years, his wife, daughter and her nanny lived in Eidsvoll.<ref>Skard, 1974: p. 123.</ref> Koht then returned to Norway and the university, and remained docent until being promoted to professor in 1910. He remained professor until 1935, and also served as the [[dean (education)|dean]] of his Faculty from 1912 to 1917.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n===Fields of research===\nKoht faced considerable skepticism among academics when announcing his intentions to study [[social history]] from the farmers' perspective. Gustav Storm claimed that farmers in Norway had \"done no effort of their own\".<ref name=p35/> [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]] exclaimed that a person whom Koht wanted to study, the farmer-politician [[John G. Neergaard]], was a \"crook&nbsp;... oh well, trahit sua quemque voluptas\".<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 34.</ref> Koht was given {{NOK|100}} to do research in [[Nordm\u00f8re]] on Neergaard.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 104.</ref> In 1896 professor [[Cathrinus Bang]] replied to Koht's wish to study social history: \"Yes, do not go out and become a socialist!\"<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 106.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, Koht completed the dissertation ''Bonde mot borgar i nynorsk historie'', in which he further developed his theories on the role of the farmers in history.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 152.</ref> Published in the journal ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Oslo)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' in 1912, it featured an elaboration on Koht's theory about class and the nation. According to Koht, the community of the nation was expanded in a democratic way when the agrarian movement, then the labour movement, both rose from political passivity to demand a place in the political and national sphere.<ref name=nbl/> He wrote about this in the 1910 article ''Norsk folkesamling'' as well.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 153.</ref> The book ''Norsk bondereisning'', published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht's presented material in his university lectures, represented the culmination of Koht's work on the topic of [[class conflict]] between the agrarian and the urban population. Koht argued that the peasant movement had abandoned the cause of [[class interest]] in favour of universal rights and social reforms. The same perspective had to be applied to the struggle of the labour movement, Koht maintained.<ref name=nbl/> An economic background for the farmers' rising was presented in 1912, in ''Priser og politikk i norsk historie'', originally a lecture for the second Norwegian conference of historians.<ref name=p155>Koht, 1951: pp. 154\u2013155.</ref> This lecture was also where his [[historical materialism]] came to fruition.<ref name=nbl/> In 1951 he stated that he \"has never thought that the theories could be foundational for a political or social uprising\".<ref name=p155/>\n\nKoht's stay in the United States affected his historical views and adaptation of historical materialism,<ref name=nbl/> and he also tried to encourage the study of [[History of the United States|American history]] in Norway.<ref name=p150>Koht, 1951: pp. 150\u2013151.</ref> American culture did not have a particularly high standing in Norway at the time. In school, Koht did not learn proper English.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 58.</ref> Before he embarked to the US, some historian colleagues insinuated that the country \"barely had any history\" and was not worth visiting.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 123.</ref> Koht's first writing on the subject came in 1910 with the lecture ''Genesis of American Independence''. He followed with ''Pengemakt og arbeid i Amerika'' (\"Monetary Power and Labor in America\", 1910), which was based on \"People's Academy\" lectures,<ref name=p150/> then ''Amerikansk kultur'' (\"American Culture\", 1912) and ''Den amerikanske nasjonen'' (\"The American Nation\", 1920).<ref name=nsd/> He would return briefly to American academia during his career, for instance in the autumn of 1930 to hold a course at [[Harvard University]].<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 165.</ref>\n\nWishing to unite materialism and idealism, Koht became interested in psychology and the role of individuals in history. The latter focus led to his becoming, in the words of his biographer [[\u00c5smund Svendsen]], \"one of the greatest biographers of the 20th century\".<ref name=nbl/> Inspired by the work with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'', he wrote a life of the author [[Henrik Wergeland]] in 1908. Later he published biographies both of Norwegians and foreigners: [[Otto von Bismarck]] (1911), [[Ivar Aasen]] (1913), [[Johan Sverdrup]] in three volumes between 1916 and 1925, [[Marcus Thrane]] in 1917, [[Henrik Ibsen]] in two volumes in 1928 and 1929, and [[Haakon VII of Norway]] in 1943.<ref name=nsd/> He also wrote about 400 pieces in the first edition of ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'', a [[biographical dictionary]] which would become a preeminent source on important figures in Norwegian history.<ref name=nbl/> Between 1909 and 1932 he published letters and original writings of Henrik Ibsen, [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]] and Henrik Wergeland. He chaired ''Kjeldeskriftfondet'' from 1918 to 1927 and ''Norsk historisk kjeldeskriftr\u00e5d'' from 1923 to 1928, two institutions that dealt with publishing of source texts.<ref name=nsd/> He also chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]] from 1912 to 1927 and 1932 to 1936,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155500/http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]] from 1928 to 1940 and the [[Comit\u00e9 International des Sciences Historiques]] from 1926 to 1933.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=innleiing7/>\n\n===Honorary positions===\nKoht became a fellow of the learned society [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] in 1908.

Koht's first political arena was the [[Norwegian Students' Society]], where he vehemently argued that the [[flag of Norway]] should not contain the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden|union badge]] (the \"flag case\").<ref>Koht, 1951: pp. 63\u201364.</ref> In 1893 he left this forum, co-founded a new students' association called ''Den Frisinnede Studenterforening'', and, as the students' association collectively entered the Liberal Party, became a board member of the local party branch in Kristiania.<ref name=p65/> He continued his fight against the union badge, and the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union]] as a whole. In 1905, when the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|union was dissolved altogether]], he agitated for the establishment of a republic, but [[1905 Norwegian monarchy plebiscite|a plebiscite]] decided to keep the monarchy.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nThough he never adhered to Christianity in his adolescent or adult life,<ref name=p58/> Koht valued the faith in the perfectability of human beings, as prompted \"the greatest religions\",<ref>See a lecture showing his attitude toward religion:\"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1931 \u2013 Presentation Speech]\", by Halvdan Koht.

Koht teamed up with the conservative politician [[C. J. Hambro]], who had edited ''Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift'' to which Koht had contributed. The negotiations led to an agreement on Norwegian trade rights in the area, but a question of sovereignty over Eastern Greenland remained unsolved. In 1931, forces in and outside of the then-[[Centre Party (Norway)|Agrarian]] [[Kolstad's Cabinet|government]] annexed \"[[Erik the Red's Land]]\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2001|title=C J Hambro|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Paul|last=Thyness|authorlink=Paul Thyness|editor-first=Knut|editor-last=Helle|editor-link=Knut Helle|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|volume=4|edition=2nd|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/C_J_Hambro/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s Koht became the foremost international politician of the Labour Party. He positioned himself in the Labour Party as the prospective [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] should the party form a government. He did so because fellow historian and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1928, [[Edvard Bull Sr.]], had died, making Koht the \"Foreign Minister-designate\". The Labour Party also polled well in the [[1933 Norwegian parliamentary election]], leading them to prepare for office.<ref>\u00d8rvik, 1960.</ref> The Labour government was formed on 20 March 1935.

Koht is the third from left, standing between [[Fredrik Monsen]] and [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].]]\nAfter the League of Nations failed as an effective international body, Koht again favoured the strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] policy to which Norway had adhered before the League of Nations membership. For many years, he was reluctant to an expansion of a Norwegian military defense capacity.<ref name=nbl/> He did not vehemently and principally oppose such an expansion, and [[#Peace activism|had been]] quite friendly to the principle of a national defense in the past. His neutrality policy nonetheless put him on the \"defense-skeptical\" side together with Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet. Among the more \"defense-friendly\" in and around the cabinet, not the least from 1936, were [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Haakon Lie]], [[Finn Moe]], [[Trygve Lie]], [[Oscar Torp]], [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]] and Minister of Defense [[Fredrik Monsen]].<ref>Pryser, 1988: pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> In 1936 Koht expressed great concern for the consequences of the arms race taking place in Europe, which he felt could easily lead to war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 38.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1936 outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] in the conflict between [[Second Spanish Republic|the Spanish government]] and rebels led by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government for the duration of the civil war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;28\u201329.</ref> The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]], a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'', led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranm\u00e6l and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;39\u201341.</ref> Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the [[International Brigades]].<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;92\u201394.</ref> On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 164.</ref>\n\nFor Koht personally the civil war in Spain came close to ending his cabinet career on several occasions. On 9 April 1937, following a series of incidents where Francoist warships intercepted Norwegian vessels sailing on Spanish ports and confiscated both cargoes and ships, and Norwegian protests failing to gain results, Koht made a formal proposal to dispatch the Norwegian minelayer [[HNoMS Olav Tryggvason|''Olav Tryggvason'']] to Spain to protect Norwegian shipping. After the proposal met opposition in parliament and was set to fail, Koht offered to resign. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold refused to accept Koht's resignation, stating that he \"would rather be shot than lose Koht\". The case came close to causing the whole cabinet's fall in parliament, before it was agreed that it would be dropped.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;170\u201381.</ref> When Koht in 1938 attempted to establish a trade agreement with Franco, he was blocked by his own party and the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]]. Again requesting to be allowed to resign, Koht stayed after months of debating ended with the party giving the cabinet free rein to do what it saw as best with regards to trade with Franco. By October 1938 Koht had negotiated a trade agreement with Franco. The formal Norwegian recognition of the Franco government as the representative of Spain followed on 31 March 1939, three days after the [[Siege of Madrid|fall of Madrid]] to the nationalist forces.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;199\u2013208, 260, 271.</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n\n====Pre-war phase====\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's neutrality, provided that she protect her neutrality against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that it was on the side of the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 2, 4.</ref>\n\nOver the first months of the Second World War Norwegian neutrality was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February [[Altmark Incident]] in [[J\u00f8ssingfjorden]]. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;26\u201332.</ref> Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April the Allies sent notes to both Norway and Sweden warning that they would take any action necessary if the Germans were allowed to use the neutral countries' territory to their advantage. Koht responded with a speech in which he said that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanes\u2014the British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans. The next day the Allies decided to launch [[Operation Wilfred|a mining operation]] on the Norwegian coast, and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway. Shortly before the mining was carried out, Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated, and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;37\u201339.</ref> The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality, and, following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader [[Vidkun Quisling]] to Hitler in December 1939, began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway. Following the Altmark Incident, Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;54\u201366.</ref> In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940, the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments, while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost. Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war. The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 97, 222.</ref>\n\n====German invasion and war====\nAt the advent of the Nazi German [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940, Germany sent the envoy [[Curt Br\u00e4uer]] to present demands of capitulation. Koht personally met with Br\u00e4uer, and rejected his demands and threats of war, stating that \"war had already started\". Koht and the cabinet fled Norway's capital in the morning of 9 April. Even though Koht rejected Br\u00e4uer's initial contact, he did convince the cabinet to listen to further German proposals for negotiations later the same day. All Norwegian negotiations with the Germans ended after a failed attempt to capture the Norwegian king and government [[Battle of Midtskogen|in Midtskogen]] early on 10 April.<ref name=nbl/><ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 226\u2013229.</ref> Koht was willing to take up the fight against the invaders. He wrote several key speeches, some of which were delivered by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], to convey staunch resistance to the German demands.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nVital to the Norwegian effort to try to halt the German advance was assistance from the Allies, which Koht requested in the early hours of 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 223, 227.</ref> When the rest of the government fled from [[Molde]] to [[Troms\u00f8]], landing on 1 May, Koht and [[Birger Ljungberg|Ljungberg]] (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']] to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives ([[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Philips]]) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met [[Reynaud]], [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin]] and [[Daladier]] in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=innstillbilag2&sideid=149&innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 298\u2013299 }}</ref> The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front.

Swedish troops were planned to occupy Narvik. The plan was named the Mowinckel plan, after its initiator, the former prime minister [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, [[Christian G\u00fcnther]], who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation to the plan, Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although G\u00fcnther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 518\u2013519.</ref>\n\n====In exile====\nThe cabinet eventually fled the country on 7 June. Koht landed in London on 19 June 1940, now heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile.<ref name=nbl/> Norway was now a close ally of the United Kingdom, but Koht was seen as clinging somewhat to his neutrality policy, and not embracing the alliance with the United Kingdom enough.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halvdan Koht|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Koht|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> From the autumn of 1940, Trygve Lie championed a change in policy which meant seeking lasting allies in the western world. Koht viewed this as \"distrust\". A schism between him and the rest of the cabinet grew as it also became known that Koht's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received reports of a possible forthcoming assault on Norway, without Koht having informed the cabinet thoroughly. Furthermore, there was discontent over Koht's decision to establish the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile in [[Bracknell]], several miles west of the cabinet headquarters.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nKoht was granted leave of absence on 19 November 1940, and ultimately left the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs on 20 February 1941,<ref name=nygaardsvold/> being succeeded by Trygve Lie.<ref name=nkl/> Koht decided to travel to Canada and then the United States.

He had relatively little contact with other politicians, kept to himself to study in peace, and spent much time on his extensive writing. Koht reportedly preferred to solve a problem by himself instead of involving co-workers and employees, even the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His way of thinking was logical and rational, but he allegedly nurtured an \"exaggerated belief in paragraphs\" and a \"dogmatic belief in international law\", and wrongly thought that other countries would obey formal regulations at most times.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 68\u201369.</ref> Koht had few or no alternatives to his neutrality policy, and in many ways he based his entire career in foreign affairs on that policy. Trygve Lie claimed that before the Second World War, the neutrality policy had \"become a religion\" for Koht.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nKoht's role in the weak and unorganised defense against Operation Weser\u00fcbung was debated during and after the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation]]. After the World War, a commission named ''[[Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen av 1945]]'' (\"Scrutiny Commission of 1945\") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions.<ref name=snl/> After receiving ''Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen''{{'s}} analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an [[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.<ref name=snl/>\n\nSince Koht lived in Lysaker, B\u00e6rum Municipality wanted to honor him by naming a street after him. When the street was named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. The street was therefore named ''Professor Kohts vei'' (\"Professor Koht's Road\") to emphasise his academic, rather than his political career.<ref name=basbl>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|title=Professor Kohts vei.|encyclopedia=Budstikkas store Asker og B\u00e6rum-leksikon|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Bakken, Tor Chr.|url=http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|access-date=4 May 2011|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-573-1534-4|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322091434/http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|archive-date=22 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Language views==\nHailing from Troms\u00f8, Koht spoke a [[Northern Norway|Northern Norwegian]] dialect in his early life. In Skien his dialect provoked negative reactions from his peers. He was inspired by the dialects of Skien's surroundings ([[Telemark]]); from 1891 he wrote the \"rural\" [[Norwegian language conflict|language form]] [[Landsm\u00e5l]] with strong tinges of [[B\u00f8, Telemark|B\u00f8]] dialect.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=p43/> Before this he had attempted to write both \"[[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knudsen]] [[Riksm\u00e5l]]\" and \"[[Ivar Aasen|Aasen]] Landsm\u00e5l\", but neither stuck.<ref name=p58>Koht, 1951: pp. 58\u201359.</ref> Early publications on the [[Norwegian language struggle|Norwegian language controversy]] were ''Det norske m\u00e5lstr\u00e6vs historie'' (1898) and ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' (1900).<ref name=nsd/> He became a board member of the Landsm\u00e5l-based publishing house [[Det Norske Samlaget]], and edited the Landsm\u00e5l periodical ''Syn og Segn'' from 1901 to 1908, until 1905 together with [[Rasmus Flo]].<ref name=\"p43\"/> He chaired [[Noregs M\u00e5llag]], an association the propagation of Landsm\u00e5l, from 1921 to 1925.<ref name=nbl/> In 1929, Landsm\u00e5l was renamed [[Nynorsk]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=nynorsk|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|url=http://www.snl.no/nynorsk|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nKoht spoke of language in a social context in general and of the [[class struggle]] in particular. He eventually used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his language activism, especially after being asked by the party to write ''Arbeidarreising og m\u00e5lsp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l'' in 1921. In it, he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway, and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language.<ref name=nbl/> Koht became a member of ''Rettskrivingsnemnda'' in 1934,<ref name=nsd/> and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out, moving the two language forms [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and Nynorsk closer to one another. The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the [[Samnorsk]] ideal.<ref name=nbl/> The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule; the original changes were reinstated after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=\u00d8ystein|authorlink=\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|editor-first=Hans Fredrik|editor-last=Dahl|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=rettskrivningsreformen av 1941|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|access-date=16 December 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231073302/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|archive-date=31 December 2009}}</ref> According to historian [[K\u00e5re Lunden]], Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms, which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language. His ideals were dubbed \"det kohtske knot\", i.e. \"the Kohtian mishmash\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Det kohtske knot|last=Hustad|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Hustad|date=15 January 2005|work=[[Klassekampen]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> For his own part, Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l. The [[definite article]], which is formally the suffix \"-et\", was substituted with the suffix \"-e\", such as in the titles of his publications ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' and ''Sosialdemokratie''.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Peace activism==\nKoht's first travel abroad was in 1890, when he accompanied his father as well as [[Hans Jacob Horst]] and [[John Theodor Lund]] to an interparliamentary peace conference in London.<ref name=p58/> In 1895 he was a founding member and board member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]], serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902.<ref name=nbl/> From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named ''Fredstidende'' (\"Peace Times\").<ref name=nsd/>\n\nThe Peace Association was dominated by Liberal Party politicians\u2014from a Marxist perspective, \"[[bourgeois]]\" people. Historian [[Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y]] had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement\u2014the most prominent being Koht, [[Adam Egede-Nissen]] and [[Carl Bonnevie]]\u2014were \"radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie\". This meant that they were \"capable of asserting themselves among the ship-owners and county governors in the board\" of the Norwegian Peace Association. Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman. He wanted to tie the \"apolitical\" peace movement closer to the labour movement, to create \"economic justice\" and to employ the use of [[arbitration]] in labour conflicts. These goals were not embraced by all of the members, particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral. A larger problem, however, was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism. He had thus carried out his [[compulsory military service]] \"with fervor\", notes Ag\u00f8y. Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the \"fatherland\". The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle, and Koht therefore resigned his membership.<ref>Ag\u00f8y, 2000: pp. 86\u201387.</ref> He was followed by others, as a result of a schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists.

His books on the subject include ''Histoire du mouvement de la paix en Norv\u00e8ge'' (\"History of the Peace Movement in Norway\", 1900) and ''Fredstanken i Noregs-sogo'' (\"The Notion of Peace in the History of Norway\", 1906).<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Post-political life==\nHaving stepped down from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the remainder of the war. There he continued his literary production;<ref name=snl/> however, the books ''Norway Neutral and Invaded'' (1941) and ''The Voice of Norway'' (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nUpon returning to Norway, Koht published three books on the war-time events in Norway: ''For fred og fridom i krigstid 1939\u20131940'', ''Fr\u00e5 skanse til skanse. Minne fr\u00e5 krigsm\u00e5nadene i Noreg 1940'' and ''Norsk utanrikspolitikk fram til 9. april 1940. Synspunkt fr\u00e5 hendingstida'', all of which were released in 1947. These memoir-like books have been analysed as putting a self-apologetic message forth.<ref name=nbl/> His political career was effectively ended, but some of his ideas had prevailed. For instance, his analysis of the class situation in Norway became a part of the general social-democratic ideology of the post-war years.<ref name=snl/>\n\nDespite not holding the professor chair any longer, Koht continued his academic writing; his principal work from the post-war epoch was the six-volume ''Krise\u00e5r i norsk historie''. The six volumes each describe a decisive moment in Norwegian history. The first volume, released in 1950, centers on \"[[Vincens Lunge]] contra [[Henrik Krummedige]]\". The second volume (1951) describes [[Olav Engelbriktsson]] and Norway's descent into dependency to Denmark in 1537. The third and fourth volumes, released in 1952 and 1955, are about medieval kings: [[Sverre I of Norway|Sverre I]] and [[Harald I of Norway|Harald I]]. The fifth volume (1956) focuses on \"[[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret]] and the [[Kalmar Union]]\". The sixth and final volume (1960) chronicles the years from 1657 to 1661, when Denmark (and thus Norway) transitioned into an [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=nbl/>\n\nKoht died on 12 December 1965 in B\u00e6rum.<ref name=nbl/> He was buried at [[Nordre gravlund]] in Oslo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/index.php?language=engelsk|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> Two works by Koht have been released posthumously: the memoirs ''Minne fr\u00e5 unge \u00e5r'' in 1968 and the diary ''Rikspolitisk dagbok 1933\u20131940'' in 1985.<ref name=innleiing12>Kj\u00e6rheim, 1985: p. 12.</ref> His son-in-law Sigmund Skard wrote a biography of him, ''Mennesket Halvdan Koht'' (\"Halvdan Koht the Man\") in 1982.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n== References and notes ==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite journal|last=Ag\u00f8y|first=Nils Ivar|authorlink=Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y|year=2000|title=Et floket partnerskap.

Starting his political career in the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]], he [[party switching|switched]] to the Labour Party around the turn of the 20th century. He represented that party in the [[B\u00e6rum]] municipal council for parts of the interwar period. He was never elected a member of [[Stortinget|Parliament]], but served nonetheless as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1935 to 1940, as part of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|government-in-exile]] following [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|Germany's invasion of Norway]]. In the latter capacity he sought to preserve Norway's neutrality in the Second World War, a decision that garnered him political infamy. Growing discontentment with Koht's political decisions ultimately led to his exit from the cabinet. After the war, however, he returned to his academic career track and wrote major works in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nAs an academic he was a professor of history at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] (now the University of Oslo) from 1910 to 1935, having become a [[research fellow]] in 1900 and [[docent]] in 1908. Among many honors, he held an [[honorary degree]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was a prolific writer, and touched on numerous subjects during his long academic career. He wrote several biographies; his works on [[Johan Sverdrup]] and [[Henrik Ibsen]] spanned several volumes each. He became known for syntheses on Norwegian history, and emphasised the roles of peasants and wage labourers as historical agents who found their place in an expanding notion of the Norwegian [[nation]]. He was also interested in the [[United States]] and its history, and was a pioneer in Norway in this respect.\n\nKoht's views on the [[Norwegian language]] also gave him nationwide academic recognition. He championed the [[Norwegian language#Danish to Norwegian|Samnorsk]] language reform, the declared aim of which was to consolidate the two standards of written Norwegian. A reform pushing the formal written language in this direction was indeed implemented in 1938, but historical events led to the failure of this policy. A pertinacious and unyielding advocate of international peace, Koht was a founding member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]] and an ordinary member of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. As an activist and politician he was described as a strong-willed and individualistic person, who nurtured a strong belief in taking an academic and legal perspective on political problems.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Paul_Koht_by_L_Szacinski.jpg|left|thumb|Koht's father [[Paul Steenstrup Koht]] (1844\u20131892)|alt=photograph of elderly man with glasses|199x199px]]\nHalvdan Koht was born on 7 August 1873 in [[Troms\u00f8]], one of the larger cities in Northern Norway.

He rarely had responsibility for any teaching of the students, and since he was often busy with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'' he remained a research fellow until 1907. In 1908 he took his [[dr.philos.]] degree on the thesis ''Die Stellung Norwegens und Schwedens im Deutsch-D\u00e4nischen Konflikt 1863\u20131864''.<ref name=innleiing7/> Opponents at the dissertation were [[Ebbe Hertzberg]] and [[Yngvar Nielsen]].<ref name=p119>Koht, 1951: pp. 119\u2013122.</ref>\n\nKoht was then hired as a [[docent]] at the University in 1908. Because Koht had internal opponents at the university, the docenture was designated to cover \"cultural history\" instead of \"history\". A while later the university changed it to \"history\". The [[L\u00f8vland's Cabinet|cabinet]] changed it back to \"cultural history\", before the Parliament finally decided on \"history\".<ref name=p119/> Koht was going to start his tenure as a docent, but argued with [[Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger (geologist)|Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger]] that he deserved to travel abroad first.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 124.</ref> From 1908 to 1909 Koht travelled around in the United States, England and Sweden, visiting the peace conferences in London (1908), [[Chicago]] (1909) and Stockholm (1910).<ref name=innleiing7/> During these years, his wife, daughter and her nanny lived in Eidsvoll.<ref>Skard, 1974: p. 123.</ref> Koht then returned to Norway and the university, and remained docent until being promoted to professor in 1910. He remained professor until 1935, and also served as the [[dean (education)|dean]] of his Faculty from 1912 to 1917.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n===Fields of research===\nKoht faced considerable skepticism among academics when announcing his intentions to study [[social history]] from the farmers' perspective. Gustav Storm claimed that farmers in Norway had \"done no effort of their own\".<ref name=p35/> [[Ludvig Ludvigsen Daae]] exclaimed that a person whom Koht wanted to study, the farmer-politician [[John G. Neergaard]], was a \"crook&nbsp;... oh well, trahit sua quemque voluptas\".<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 34.</ref> Koht was given {{NOK|100}} to do research in [[Nordm\u00f8re]] on Neergaard.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 104.</ref> In 1896 professor [[Cathrinus Bang]] replied to Koht's wish to study social history: \"Yes, do not go out and become a socialist!\"<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 106.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, Koht completed the dissertation ''Bonde mot borgar i nynorsk historie'', in which he further developed his theories on the role of the farmers in history.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 152.</ref> Published in the journal ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Oslo)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' in 1912, it featured an elaboration on Koht's theory about class and the nation. According to Koht, the community of the nation was expanded in a democratic way when the agrarian movement, then the labour movement, both rose from political passivity to demand a place in the political and national sphere.<ref name=nbl/> He wrote about this in the 1910 article ''Norsk folkesamling'' as well.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 153.</ref> The book ''Norsk bondereisning'', published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht's presented material in his university lectures, represented the culmination of Koht's work on the topic of [[class conflict]] between the agrarian and the urban population. Koht argued that the peasant movement had abandoned the cause of [[class interest]] in favour of universal rights and social reforms. The same perspective had to be applied to the struggle of the labour movement, Koht maintained.<ref name=nbl/> An economic background for the farmers' rising was presented in 1912, in ''Priser og politikk i norsk historie'', originally a lecture for the second Norwegian conference of historians.<ref name=p155>Koht, 1951: pp. 154\u2013155.</ref> This lecture was also where his [[historical materialism]] came to fruition.<ref name=nbl/> In 1951 he stated that he \"has never thought that the theories could be foundational for a political or social uprising\".<ref name=p155/>\n\nKoht's stay in the United States affected his historical views and adaptation of historical materialism,<ref name=nbl/> and he also tried to encourage the study of [[History of the United States|American history]] in Norway.<ref name=p150>Koht, 1951: pp. 150\u2013151.</ref> American culture did not have a particularly high standing in Norway at the time. In school, Koht did not learn proper English.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 58.</ref> Before he embarked to the US, some historian colleagues insinuated that the country \"barely had any history\" and was not worth visiting.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 123.</ref> Koht's first writing on the subject came in 1910 with the lecture ''Genesis of American Independence''. He followed with ''Pengemakt og arbeid i Amerika'' (\"Monetary Power and Labor in America\", 1910), which was based on \"People's Academy\" lectures,<ref name=p150/> then ''Amerikansk kultur'' (\"American Culture\", 1912) and ''Den amerikanske nasjonen'' (\"The American Nation\", 1920).<ref name=nsd/> He would return briefly to American academia during his career, for instance in the autumn of 1930 to hold a course at [[Harvard University]].<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 165.</ref>\n\nWishing to unite materialism and idealism, Koht became interested in psychology and the role of individuals in history. The latter focus led to his becoming, in the words of his biographer [[\u00c5smund Svendsen]], \"one of the greatest biographers of the 20th century\".<ref name=nbl/> Inspired by the work with ''Norsk Forfatter-lexikon'', he wrote a life of the author [[Henrik Wergeland]] in 1908. Later he published biographies both of Norwegians and foreigners: [[Otto von Bismarck]] (1911), [[Ivar Aasen]] (1913), [[Johan Sverdrup]] in three volumes between 1916 and 1925, [[Marcus Thrane]] in 1917, [[Henrik Ibsen]] in two volumes in 1928 and 1929, and [[Haakon VII of Norway]] in 1943.<ref name=nsd/> He also wrote about 400 pieces in the first edition of ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]'', a [[biographical dictionary]] which would become a preeminent source on important figures in Norwegian history.<ref name=nbl/> Between 1909 and 1932 he published letters and original writings of Henrik Ibsen, [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje]] and Henrik Wergeland. He chaired ''Kjeldeskriftfondet'' from 1918 to 1927 and ''Norsk historisk kjeldeskriftr\u00e5d'' from 1923 to 1928, two institutions that dealt with publishing of source texts.<ref name=nsd/> He also chaired the [[Norwegian Historical Association]] from 1912 to 1927 and 1932 to 1936,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|title=Historikk|publisher=[[Norwegian Historical Association]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=28 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413155500/http://hifo.b.uib.no/om-hifo/historikk/|archive-date=13 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]] from 1928 to 1940 and the [[Comit\u00e9 International des Sciences Historiques]] from 1926 to 1933.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=innleiing7/>\n\n===Honorary positions===\nKoht became a fellow of the learned society [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] in 1908.

Koht's first political arena was the [[Norwegian Students' Society]], where he vehemently argued that the [[flag of Norway]] should not contain the [[Union badge of Norway and Sweden|union badge]] (the \"flag case\").<ref>Koht, 1951: pp. 63\u201364.</ref> In 1893 he left this forum, co-founded a new students' association called ''Den Frisinnede Studenterforening'', and, as the students' association collectively entered the Liberal Party, became a board member of the local party branch in Kristiania.<ref name=p65/> He continued his fight against the union badge, and the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union]] as a whole. In 1905, when the [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|union was dissolved altogether]], he agitated for the establishment of a republic, but [[1905 Norwegian monarchy plebiscite|a plebiscite]] decided to keep the monarchy.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nThough he never adhered to Christianity in his adolescent or adult life,<ref name=p58/> Koht valued the faith in the perfectability of human beings, as prompted \"the greatest religions\",<ref>See a lecture showing his attitude toward religion:\"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1931/press.html The Nobel Peace Prize 1931 \u2013 Presentation Speech]\", by Halvdan Koht.

It is a faith which has provided the foundation for some of our greatest religions and one which has inspired much of the best work for progress. It was proclaimed by [[Jesus Christ]]; it inspired the work of men like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Henrik Wergeland|Wergeland]].\"</ref> and he started to feel solidarity with the labour movement and the working classes, leading to the [[Political radicalism|radicalisation]] of his views: from 1900 he voted for the [[Norwegian Labour Party]],<ref name=nbl/> and had four years prior to that began to consider himself a [[socialist]].<ref name=innleiing7>Kj\u00e6rheim, 1985: p. 7.</ref> While living in the United States, he developed a form of historical materialism, which led to a fusion of history scholarship and political views. He viewed the Liberal Party as an important agent in Norwegian history, since it pronounced the rights of the farmers, but he now viewed the [[working class]] as the next class to be included in the political life, and specifically through the Labor Party.<ref name=nbl/> In Koht's Liberal Party period, he cooperated with some of their more radical members, among them [[Carl Jeppesen]], who later would join the Labour Party.<ref name=p65/> He joined the Labour Party when he returned from the United States and moved to [[B\u00e6rum]] in 1909.<ref>Koht, 1951: p. 159.</ref> He lived with his family in [[Stabekk]], but commissioned a house in [[Lysaker]] in 1910.

He positioned himself in the Labour Party as the prospective [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] should the party form a government. He did so because fellow historian and Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1928, [[Edvard Bull Sr.]], had died, making Koht the \"Foreign Minister-designate\". The Labour Party also polled well in the [[1933 Norwegian parliamentary election]], leading them to prepare for office.<ref>\u00d8rvik, 1960.</ref> The Labour government was formed on 20 March 1935.

Koht is the third from left, standing between [[Fredrik Monsen]] and [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].]]\nAfter the League of Nations failed as an effective international body, Koht again favoured the strict [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] policy to which Norway had adhered before the League of Nations membership. For many years, he was reluctant to an expansion of a Norwegian military defense capacity.<ref name=nbl/> He did not vehemently and principally oppose such an expansion, and [[#Peace activism|had been]] quite friendly to the principle of a national defense in the past. His neutrality policy nonetheless put him on the \"defense-skeptical\" side together with Johan Nygaardsvold and most of his cabinet. Among the more \"defense-friendly\" in and around the cabinet, not the least from 1936, were [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Haakon Lie]], [[Finn Moe]], [[Trygve Lie]], [[Oscar Torp]], [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]] and Minister of Defense [[Fredrik Monsen]].<ref>Pryser, 1988: pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> In 1936 Koht expressed great concern for the consequences of the arms race taking place in Europe, which he felt could easily lead to war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 38.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1936 outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], the Nygaardsvold Cabinet followed a policy of [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention]] in the conflict between [[Second Spanish Republic|the Spanish government]] and rebels led by [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]. Koht's view of the matter was that Norway should not be involved in the conflict in any way; this became the policy of the government for the duration of the civil war.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;28\u201329.</ref> The government soon banned the sale or transfer of Norwegian arms, aircraft and ships to Spain. Koht himself promoted a ban on the use of Norwegian ships to transport arms, ammunition and aircraft to foreign countries in general, to ensure that there could be no Norwegian connection to any such items that were delivered to Spain. The strict non-intervention policy promoted by Koht and Prime Minister Nygaardsvold was heavily criticised by forces within the Labour Party. [[Martin Tranm\u00e6l]], a central figure in the apparatus of the Labour Party and the editor of the party newspaper ''[[Arbeiderbladet]]'', led the critics of the policy towards the conflict in Spain. Tranm\u00e6l and other critics saw the non-intervention policy of the government as giving equal standing to both the elected government of Spain and the rebels.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;39\u201341.</ref> Koht went to great lengths to avoid any direct Norwegian involvement in the conflict, especially trying to block Norwegians from travelling to Spain to join the [[International Brigades]].<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;92\u201394.</ref> On 19 September 1936, Koht attempted to have the League of Nations impose a ceasefire in Spain, to be followed by a popular referendum on the country's constitution. Koht's proposal received little support and failed.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: p. 164.</ref>\n\nFor Koht personally the civil war in Spain came close to ending his cabinet career on several occasions. On 9 April 1937, following a series of incidents where Francoist warships intercepted Norwegian vessels sailing on Spanish ports and confiscated both cargoes and ships, and Norwegian protests failing to gain results, Koht made a formal proposal to dispatch the Norwegian minelayer [[HNoMS Olav Tryggvason|''Olav Tryggvason'']] to Spain to protect Norwegian shipping. After the proposal met opposition in parliament and was set to fail, Koht offered to resign. Prime Minister Nygaardsvold refused to accept Koht's resignation, stating that he \"would rather be shot than lose Koht\". The case came close to causing the whole cabinet's fall in parliament, before it was agreed that it would be dropped.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;170\u201381.</ref> When Koht in 1938 attempted to establish a trade agreement with Franco, he was blocked by his own party and the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions]]. Again requesting to be allowed to resign, Koht stayed after months of debating ended with the party giving the cabinet free rein to do what it saw as best with regards to trade with Franco. By October 1938 Koht had negotiated a trade agreement with Franco. The formal Norwegian recognition of the Franco government as the representative of Spain followed on 31 March 1939, three days after the [[Siege of Madrid|fall of Madrid]] to the nationalist forces.<ref>Moen and S\u00e6ther, 2009: pp.&nbsp;199\u2013208, 260, 271.</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n\n====Pre-war phase====\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's neutrality, provided that she protect her neutrality against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that it was on the side of the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 2, 4.</ref>\n\nOver the first months of the Second World War Norwegian neutrality was violated repeatedly in the air and at sea by both warring parties, most dramatically with the 16 February [[Altmark Incident]] in [[J\u00f8ssingfjorden]]. This, along with other incidents, and the lack of a firm Norwegian response, led the warring parties to the impression that Norway could or would not effectively protect her neutrality.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;26\u201332.</ref> Initially the German view of Norwegian neutrality had been one of it being positive for the German war effort, allowing German merchant ships to transport cargo via Norwegian territorial waters without interference from the British.<ref>Lunde, 2009: p. 49.</ref>\n\nOn 5 April the Allies sent notes to both Norway and Sweden warning that they would take any action necessary if the Germans were allowed to use the neutral countries' territory to their advantage. Koht responded with a speech in which he said that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanes\u2014the British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans. The next day the Allies decided to launch [[Operation Wilfred|a mining operation]] on the Norwegian coast, and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway. Shortly before the mining was carried out, Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated, and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;37\u201339.</ref> The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality, and, following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader [[Vidkun Quisling]] to Hitler in December 1939, began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway. Following the Altmark Incident, Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp.&nbsp;54\u201366.</ref> In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940, the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments, while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost. Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war. The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 97, 222.</ref>\n\n====German invasion and war====\nAt the advent of the Nazi German [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway of 9 April 1940, Germany sent the envoy [[Curt Br\u00e4uer]] to present demands of capitulation. Koht personally met with Br\u00e4uer, and rejected his demands and threats of war, stating that \"war had already started\". Koht and the cabinet fled Norway's capital in the morning of 9 April. Even though Koht rejected Br\u00e4uer's initial contact, he did convince the cabinet to listen to further German proposals for negotiations later the same day. All Norwegian negotiations with the Germans ended after a failed attempt to capture the Norwegian king and government [[Battle of Midtskogen|in Midtskogen]] early on 10 April.<ref name=nbl/><ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 226\u2013229.</ref> Koht was willing to take up the fight against the invaders. He wrote several key speeches, some of which were delivered by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]], to convey staunch resistance to the German demands.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nVital to the Norwegian effort to try to halt the German advance was assistance from the Allies, which Koht requested in the early hours of 9 April, although skeptical of the potential of Allied aid.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 223, 227.</ref> When the rest of the government fled from [[Molde]] to [[Troms\u00f8]], landing on 1 May, Koht and [[Birger Ljungberg|Ljungberg]] (Minister of Defense) continued from there with the cruiser [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']] to London. Here, from 5 May they negotiated with British government representatives ([[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] and [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Philips]]) on British aid to Norway. Koht also made a radio speech from London on the BBC, broadcasting to Norway, and a speech on American radio. On 8 and 9 May he met [[Reynaud]], [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin]] and [[Daladier]] in Paris. The Norwegian Ministers departed from London on 11 May, arriving back in Norway on 17 May.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesside&bokid=innstillbilag2&sideid=149&innhaldid=4 |author=Parliament of Norway 1947 |title=pp. 298\u2013299 }}</ref> The talks with the Allies resulted in concrete promises and plans for large French reinforcements for the Norwegian front.

Swedish troops were planned to occupy Narvik. The plan was named the Mowinckel plan, after its initiator, the former prime minister [[Johan Ludwig Mowinckel]]. During a meeting with the Swedish minister of foreign affairs, [[Christian G\u00fcnther]], who was to act as a middle man with Germans in relation to the plan, Koht revealed that the Allies were about to evacuate Norway. Although G\u00fcnther never revealed the evacuation plans to the Germans, Koht was heavily criticised for doing so by his colleagues upon his return to Norway.<ref>Lunde, 2009: pp. 518\u2013519.</ref>\n\n====In exile====\nThe cabinet eventually fled the country on 7 June. Koht landed in London on 19 June 1940, now heading the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile.<ref name=nbl/> Norway was now a close ally of the United Kingdom, but Koht was seen as clinging somewhat to his neutrality policy, and not embracing the alliance with the United Kingdom enough.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Halvdan Koht|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Halvdan_Koht|language=Norwegian|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> From the autumn of 1940, Trygve Lie championed a change in policy which meant seeking lasting allies in the western world. Koht viewed this as \"distrust\". A schism between him and the rest of the cabinet grew as it also became known that Koht's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had received reports of a possible forthcoming assault on Norway, without Koht having informed the cabinet thoroughly. Furthermore, there was discontent over Koht's decision to establish the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in exile in [[Bracknell]], several miles west of the cabinet headquarters.<ref name=nkl/>\n\nKoht was granted leave of absence on 19 November 1940, and ultimately left the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs on 20 February 1941,<ref name=nygaardsvold/> being succeeded by Trygve Lie.<ref name=nkl/> Koht decided to travel to Canada and then the United States. He lived with his daughter \u00c5sa and her family in [[Washington, DC]], returning to Norway after the end of the Second World War.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n===Political legacy===\n[[File:Professor Kohts vei og Gamle Drammensvei - 2012-03-11 at 12-16-31.jpg|thumb|Professor Kohts vei (lit. \"Professor Koht's street\") in [[B\u00e6rum]] was named after Halvdan Koht in 1967.]]\nTrygve Lie, who after the war had become the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations#List of Secretaries-General|first Secretary-General]] of the [[United Nations]], characterised Koht in his memoirs as an expert on foreign affairs, but introverted. He had relatively little contact with other politicians, kept to himself to study in peace, and spent much time on his extensive writing. Koht reportedly preferred to solve a problem by himself instead of involving co-workers and employees, even the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His way of thinking was logical and rational, but he allegedly nurtured an \"exaggerated belief in paragraphs\" and a \"dogmatic belief in international law\", and wrongly thought that other countries would obey formal regulations at most times.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 68\u201369.</ref> Koht had few or no alternatives to his neutrality policy, and in many ways he based his entire career in foreign affairs on that policy. Trygve Lie claimed that before the Second World War, the neutrality policy had \"become a religion\" for Koht.<ref>Lie, 1955: pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nKoht's role in the weak and unorganised defense against Operation Weser\u00fcbung was debated during and after the [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation]]. After the World War, a commission named ''[[Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen av 1945]]'' (\"Scrutiny Commission of 1945\") was set to scrutinise the actions of the Norwegian government in 1940. It concluded with a partial criticism of Koht's dispositions.<ref name=snl/> After receiving ''Unders\u00f8kelseskommisjonen''{{'s}} analysis, Koht volunteered to undergo an [[Impeachment (Norway)|Impeachment]] trial. The Parliament of Norway did not find it necessary, and no such trial took place.<ref name=snl/>\n\nSince Koht lived in Lysaker, B\u00e6rum Municipality wanted to honor him by naming a street after him. When the street was named in 1967, Koht was still controversial. The street was therefore named ''Professor Kohts vei'' (\"Professor Koht's Road\") to emphasise his academic, rather than his political career.<ref name=basbl>{{cite encyclopedia|year=2008|title=Professor Kohts vei.|encyclopedia=Budstikkas store Asker og B\u00e6rum-leksikon|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|editor=Bakken, Tor Chr.|url=http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|access-date=4 May 2011|language=Norwegian|isbn=978-82-573-1534-4|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322091434/http://www.ableksikon.no/Professor_Kohts_vei|archive-date=22 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Language views==\nHailing from Troms\u00f8, Koht spoke a [[Northern Norway|Northern Norwegian]] dialect in his early life. In Skien his dialect provoked negative reactions from his peers. He was inspired by the dialects of Skien's surroundings ([[Telemark]]); from 1891 he wrote the \"rural\" [[Norwegian language conflict|language form]] [[Landsm\u00e5l]] with strong tinges of [[B\u00f8, Telemark|B\u00f8]] dialect.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=p43/> Before this he had attempted to write both \"[[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knudsen]] [[Riksm\u00e5l]]\" and \"[[Ivar Aasen|Aasen]] Landsm\u00e5l\", but neither stuck.<ref name=p58>Koht, 1951: pp. 58\u201359.</ref> Early publications on the [[Norwegian language struggle|Norwegian language controversy]] were ''Det norske m\u00e5lstr\u00e6vs historie'' (1898) and ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' (1900).<ref name=nsd/> He became a board member of the Landsm\u00e5l-based publishing house [[Det Norske Samlaget]], and edited the Landsm\u00e5l periodical ''Syn og Segn'' from 1901 to 1908, until 1905 together with [[Rasmus Flo]].<ref name=\"p43\"/> He chaired [[Noregs M\u00e5llag]], an association the propagation of Landsm\u00e5l, from 1921 to 1925.<ref name=nbl/> In 1929, Landsm\u00e5l was renamed [[Nynorsk]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=nynorsk|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|url=http://www.snl.no/nynorsk|language=Norwegian|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nKoht spoke of language in a social context in general and of the [[class struggle]] in particular. He eventually used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his language activism, especially after being asked by the party to write ''Arbeidarreising og m\u00e5lsp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l'' in 1921. In it, he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway, and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language.<ref name=nbl/> Koht became a member of ''Rettskrivingsnemnda'' in 1934,<ref name=nsd/> and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out, moving the two language forms [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and Nynorsk closer to one another. The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the [[Samnorsk]] ideal.<ref name=nbl/> The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule; the original changes were reinstated after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=\u00d8ystein|authorlink=\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|editor-first=Hans Fredrik|editor-last=Dahl|editor-link=Hans Fredrik Dahl|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]]|title=rettskrivningsreformen av 1941|url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|access-date=16 December 2010|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231073302/http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/r/r2.html#rettskrivningsreformen-av|archive-date=31 December 2009}}</ref> According to historian [[K\u00e5re Lunden]], Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms, which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language. His ideals were dubbed \"det kohtske knot\", i.e. \"the Kohtian mishmash\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Det kohtske knot|last=Hustad|first=Jon|authorlink=Jon Hustad|date=15 January 2005|work=[[Klassekampen]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> For his own part, Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokm\u00e5l. The [[definite article]], which is formally the suffix \"-et\", was substituted with the suffix \"-e\", such as in the titles of his publications ''Det vitskapelege grunnlage for m\u00e5lstr\u00e6ve'' and ''Sosialdemokratie''.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Peace activism==\nKoht's first travel abroad was in 1890, when he accompanied his father as well as [[Hans Jacob Horst]] and [[John Theodor Lund]] to an interparliamentary peace conference in London.<ref name=p58/> In 1895 he was a founding member and board member of the [[Norwegian Peace Association]], serving as chairman from 1900 to 1902.<ref name=nbl/> From 1901 to 1902 he edited his own monthly periodical named ''Fredstidende'' (\"Peace Times\").<ref name=nsd/>\n\nThe Peace Association was dominated by Liberal Party politicians\u2014from a Marxist perspective, \"[[bourgeois]]\" people. Historian [[Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y]] had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement\u2014the most prominent being Koht, [[Adam Egede-Nissen]] and [[Carl Bonnevie]]\u2014were \"radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie\". This meant that they were \"capable of asserting themselves among the ship-owners and county governors in the board\" of the Norwegian Peace Association. Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman. He wanted to tie the \"apolitical\" peace movement closer to the labour movement, to create \"economic justice\" and to employ the use of [[arbitration]] in labour conflicts. These goals were not embraced by all of the members, particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral. A larger problem, however, was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism. He had thus carried out his [[compulsory military service]] \"with fervor\", notes Ag\u00f8y. Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the \"fatherland\". The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle, and Koht therefore resigned his membership.<ref>Ag\u00f8y, 2000: pp. 86\u201387.</ref> He was followed by others, as a result of a schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists. Koht has also been assessed as an ineffective organisational leader.<ref name=ringsp52>R\u00f8nning and Ringsby, 2010: p. 52.</ref> The defense question more or less solved itself when the Swedish-Norwegian union was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905|peacefully dissolved in 1905]]. Koht later returned to the Peace Association to serve as a board member from 1910 to 1912.<ref name=nsd/>\n\nHe became a member of [[Institut International de la Paix]] in 1913.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bio \u2013 Halvdan Koht |publisher=Nobelprize.org |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/bios/koht.html |accessdate=9 October 2010 }}</ref> He was a consultant for the [[Norwegian Nobel Institute]] from 1904 to 1913,<ref name=nsd/> with the task of examining proposed candidates for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940,<ref>{{cite book|title=Aarsberetninger fra Det Norske Stortings Nobelkomit\u00e9 1931\u20131945|author=[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]|publisher=[[Parliament of Norway]]|language=Norwegian}}</ref> but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.<ref>{{cite web | title = All Nobel Peace Prize Laureates | publisher = Nobel Foundation| url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/ |accessdate=9 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nKoht's academic writing also encompassed the peace issue. His books on the subject include ''Histoire du mouvement de la paix en Norv\u00e8ge'' (\"History of the Peace Movement in Norway\", 1900) and ''Fredstanken i Noregs-sogo'' (\"The Notion of Peace in the History of Norway\", 1906).<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Post-political life==\nHaving stepped down from the exiled cabinet in 1941, Koht lived in the United States for the remainder of the war. There he continued his literary production;<ref name=snl/> however, the books ''Norway Neutral and Invaded'' (1941) and ''The Voice of Norway'' (1944) were both released in London. The first book dealt directly with the advent of war in Norway, and was released in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] in the same year. The second book, written together with his son-in-law Sigmund Skard, dealt more with older history and the literature of Norway. It was released in Swedish in 1944 and Norwegian in 1948. Koht returned to Norway at the end of war.<ref name=nbl/>\n\nUpon returning to Norway, Koht published three books on the war-time events in Norway: ''For fred og fridom i krigstid 1939\u20131940'', ''Fr\u00e5 skanse til skanse. Minne fr\u00e5 krigsm\u00e5nadene i Noreg 1940'' and ''Norsk utanrikspolitikk fram til 9. april 1940. Synspunkt fr\u00e5 hendingstida'', all of which were released in 1947. These memoir-like books have been analysed as putting a self-apologetic message forth.<ref name=nbl/> His political career was effectively ended, but some of his ideas had prevailed. For instance, his analysis of the class situation in Norway became a part of the general social-democratic ideology of the post-war years.<ref name=snl/>\n\nDespite not holding the professor chair any longer, Koht continued his academic writing; his principal work from the post-war epoch was the six-volume ''Krise\u00e5r i norsk historie''. The six volumes each describe a decisive moment in Norwegian history. The first volume, released in 1950, centers on \"[[Vincens Lunge]] contra [[Henrik Krummedige]]\". The second volume (1951) describes [[Olav Engelbriktsson]] and Norway's descent into dependency to Denmark in 1537. The third and fourth volumes, released in 1952 and 1955, are about medieval kings: [[Sverre I of Norway|Sverre I]] and [[Harald I of Norway|Harald I]]. The fifth volume (1956) focuses on \"[[Margaret I of Denmark|Queen Margaret]] and the [[Kalmar Union]]\". The sixth and final volume (1960) chronicles the years from 1657 to 1661, when Denmark (and thus Norway) transitioned into an [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=nbl/>\n\nKoht died on 12 December 1965 in B\u00e6rum.<ref name=nbl/> He was buried at [[Nordre gravlund]] in Oslo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/index.php?language=engelsk|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> Two works by Koht have been released posthumously: the memoirs ''Minne fr\u00e5 unge \u00e5r'' in 1968 and the diary ''Rikspolitisk dagbok 1933\u20131940'' in 1985.<ref name=innleiing12>Kj\u00e6rheim, 1985: p. 12.</ref> His son-in-law Sigmund Skard wrote a biography of him, ''Mennesket Halvdan Koht'' (\"Halvdan Koht the Man\") in 1982.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n== References and notes ==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite journal|last=Ag\u00f8y|first=Nils Ivar|authorlink=Nils Ivar Ag\u00f8y|year=2000|title=Et floket partnerskap.

It is the main component of [[nervous tissue]] in all [[Animalia|animals]] except [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]. [[Plant]]s and [[fungi]] do not have nerve cells. \n\nNeurons are typically classified into three types based on their function. [[Sensory neuron]]s respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the [[Sense|sensory organs]], and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain. [[Motor neuron]]s receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from [[muscle contraction]]s to [[gland|glandular output]]. [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. A group of connected neurons is called a [[neural circuit]].\n\nA typical neuron consists of a cell body ([[Soma (biology)|soma]]), [[dendrite]]s, and a single [[axon]]. The soma is usually compact. The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the [[axon hillock]], and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are [[axon terminals]], where the neuron can transmit a signal across the [[synapse]] to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon. The term [[neurite]] is used to describe either a dendrite or an [[axon]], particularly when the cell is [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]].\n\nMost neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.\n\nThe signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of [[voltage]] gradients across their [[Cell membrane|membranes]]. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an [[All-or-none law|all-or-nothing]] [[electrochemical]] pulse called an [[action potential]]. This potential travels rapidly along the axon, and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them.

[[Neurogenesis]] largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain.

The relationship between the brain, spinal cord, and rest of the nerves in the body is demonstrated.]]\nNeurons are the primary components of the nervous system, along with the  [[glial cells]] that give them structural and metabolic support. The nervous system is made up of the [[central nervous system]], which includes the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]], and the [[peripheral nervous system]], which includes the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] and [[somatic nervous system]]s. In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the [[central nervous system]], but some reside in peripheral [[ganglion|ganglia]], and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the [[retina]] and [[cochlea]].\n\nAxons may bundle into [[nerve fascicle|fascicle]]s that make up the [[nerve]]s in the [[peripheral nervous system]] (like strands of wire make up cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called [[nerve tract|tracts]].\n\n== Anatomy and histology ==\n{{Neuron map|Neuron ([[peripheral nervous system]])}}\nNeurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 [[Micrometre|micrometers]] in diameter.<ref>{{cite web |first = Melissa |last = Davies |title = The Neuron: size comparison |url = https://www.ualberta.ca/~neuro/OnlineIntro/NeuronExample.htm |work = Neuroscience: A journey through the brain |date = 2002-04-09 |access-date = 2009-06-20}}</ref>\n\n*The '''[[Soma (biology)|soma]]''' is the body of the neuron. As it contains the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], most [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.<ref>{{cite web  |first = Eric H. |last = Chudler | name-list-format = vanc |title = Brain Facts and Figures |url = http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html |work = Neuroscience for Kids |access-date = 2009-06-20 }}</ref>\n*The '''[[dendrites]]''' of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the [[dendritic spine]].\n*The '''[[axon]]''' is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries [[nerve signal]]s away from the soma, and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may\u2014and usually will\u2014undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the '''[[axon hillock]]'''. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has the greatest density of [[voltage-dependent sodium channels]]. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative [[threshold potential]].\n**While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.\n*The '''[[axon terminal]]''' is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains [[synapses]]. Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where [[neurotransmitter]] chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal, a neuron may have ''en passant'' boutons, which are located along the length of the axon.\n\n[[File:Neuron Cell Body.png|thumb|Neuron cell body]]\n\nThe accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.\n\n[[File:Complete neuron cell diagram en.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron]]\n\nAxons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10\u201325 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human [[motor neuron]] can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.\n\nSensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the [[posterior column]] of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. [[Giraffe]]s have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the [[squid giant axon]], an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5\u20131 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).\n\nFully differentiated neurons are permanently [[G0 phase|postmitotic]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrup K, Yang Y | title = Cell cycle regulation in the postmitotic neuron: oxymoron or new biology? | journal = Nature Reviews.

[[Astrocyte]]s are star-shaped [[glial cell]]s. They have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like characteristic of [[pluripotency]].\n\n===Membrane===\nLike all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a [[plasma membrane]], a bilayer of [[lipid]] molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]], but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage gated]], meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The [[ion]] materials include [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[chloride]], and [[calcium]]. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.\n\n===Histology and internal structure===\n[[File:Gyrus Dentatus 40x.jpg|thumb|250px|Golgi-stained neurons in human hippocampal tissue]]\n\n[[Image:SUM 110913 Cort Neurons 2.5d in vitro 488 Phalloidin no perm 4 cmle-2.png|thumb|300px|Actin filaments in a mouse cortical neuron in culture]]\n\nNumerous microscopic clumps called [[Nissl body|Nissl bodies]] (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (\"base-loving\") dye.

Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal [[motor neurons]], consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a [[myelin sheath]]. The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching terminals ([[axon terminals|axon terminal]]) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the [[synaptic cleft]] between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.\n\n===Structural classification===\n\n====Polarity====\n[[File:Neurons uni bi multi pseudouni.svg|thumb|Different kinds of neurons:<br />1 [[Unipolar neuron]]<br />2 [[Bipolar neuron]]<br />3 [[Multipolar neuron]]<br />4 [[Pseudounipolar neuron]] ]]\nMost neurons can be anatomically characterized as:\n\n*[[Unipolar neuron|Unipolar]]: single process\n*[[Bipolar cell|Bipolar]]: 1 axon and 1 dendrite\n*[[Multipolar neuron|Multipolar]]: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites\n**[[Golgi I]]: neurons with projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells\n**[[Golgi II]]: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule cell\n*[[Anaxonic neuron|Anaxonic]]: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s)\n*[[Pseudounipolar cells|Pseudounipolar]]: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite\n\n====Other====\nSome unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples are:\n\n*[[Basket cell]]s, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and [[cerebellum]]\n*[[Betz cell]]s, large motor neurons\n*[[Lugaro cell]]s, interneurons of the cerebellum\n*[[Medium spiny neuron]]s, most neurons in the [[corpus striatum]]\n*[[Purkinje cell]]s, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron\n*[[Pyramidal cell]]s, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I\n*[[Renshaw cell]]s, neurons with both ends linked to [[alpha motor neuron]]s\n*[[Unipolar brush cell]]s, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft\n*[[Granule cell]]s, a type of Golgi II neuron\n*[[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|Anterior horn]] cells, [[motoneurons]] located in the spinal cord\n*[[Spindle cell]]s, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain\n\n===Functional classification===\n\n====Direction====\n\n*[[Afferent neuron]]s convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called [[sensory neurons]].\n*[[Efferent neuron]]s (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells.\n*[[Interneuron]]s connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.\n\nAfferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain.\n\n====Action on other neurons====\nA neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to [[receptor (biochemistry)|chemical receptor]]s. The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors. Receptors can be classified broadly as ''excitatory'' (causing an increase in firing rate), ''inhibitory'' (causing a decrease in firing rate), or ''modulatory'' (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).\n\nThe two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, [[glutamate]] and [[GABA]], have largely consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors, and has effects that are excitatory at [[ionotropic receptor]]s and a modulatory effect at [[metabotropic receptor]]s. Similarly, GABA acts on several types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as \"excitatory neurons\", and cells that release GABA as \"inhibitory neurons\". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects, for example, \"excitatory\" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release [[acetylcholine]], and \"inhibitory\" [[spinal neuron]]s that release [[glycine]].\n\nThe distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF [[retinal bipolar cells|bipolar cells]] are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical [[ionotropic receptor|ionotropic]] [[glutamate receptors]] and instead express a class of inhibitory [[metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]] glutamate receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerber U | title = Metabotropic glutamate receptors in vertebrate retina | journal = Documenta Ophthalmologica.

[[Acetylcholine]] is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a [[ligand]] for both ligand-gated ion channels and [[Metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]] (GPCRs) [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]]. [[Nicotinic receptors]] are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind [[nicotine]]. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of [[Sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from [[choline]] and [[acetyl coenzyme A]].\n*GABAergic neurons\u2014[[gamma aminobutyric acid]]. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to [[Acetylcholine|ACh]], gating anion channels that allow [[Chlorine|Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]] ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme [[glutamate decarboxylase]].\n*Glutamatergic neurons\u2014glutamate. [[Glutamate]] is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, along with [[Aspartic acid|aspartate]]. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).\n\n:#[[AMPA]] and [[Kainic acid|Kainate]] receptors function as [[Ion|cation]] channels permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.\n:#[[N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]] receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to [[Calcium in biology|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]. The function of NMDA receptors depend on glycine receptor binding as a co-[[agonist]] within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.\n:#Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability.\n::Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in [[brain damage]]. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme [[Glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase|glutamate synthase]].\n\n*Dopaminergic neurons\u2014[[dopamine]]. [[Dopamine]] is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid [[tyrosine]]. Tyrosine is catalyzed into levadopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) by [[Tyrosine hydroxylase|tyrosine hydroxlase]], and levadopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid [[Carboxy-lyases|decarboxylase]].\n*Serotonergic neurons\u2014[[serotonin]]. [[Serotonin]] (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from [[tryptophan]] by [[tryptophan hydroxylase]], and then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic [[serotonin transporter]] are used for treatment, such as [[Prozac]] and [[Zoloft]].\n*Histaminergic neurons\u2014[[histamine]].  [[Histamine]] is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] and [[neuromodulator]].

In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder sound, does not produce a stronger signal, but can increase firing frequency.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|31}} Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or [[tonic (physiology)|tonic receptors]] respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more photons, as the photons can't become \"stronger\" for a specific frequency.\n\nOther receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with steady stimulus; examples include [[Human skin|skin]] which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.\n\nThe [[pacinian corpuscle]] is one such structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, stimulus ends; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Roger | last2 = Randall | first2 = David | name-list-format = vanc | title = Animal physiology: mechanisms and adaptations | year = 1983 | publisher = W.H.

Secondary symptoms may include high level [[cognitive dysfunction]] and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.\n\n'''[[Myasthenia gravis]]''' is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating [[muscle weakness]] and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating [[antibodies]] that block [[acetylcholine receptors]] at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with [[immunosuppressants]], [[cholinesterase]] inhibitors and, in selected cases, [[thymectomy]].\n\n===Demyelination===\n{{Further|Demyelinating disease}}\n[[File:Guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome - Nerve Damage.gif|thumb|Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome \u2013 demyelination]]\n[[Demyelination]] is the act of demyelinating, or the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]].\n\n===Axonal degeneration===\nAlthough most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the [[axolemma]], and eventually leads to bead like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal [[cytoskeleton]] and inner [[organelle]]s occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of [[mitochondria]] in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on [[ubiquitin]] and [[calpain]] [[proteases]] (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.\n\n==Neurogenesis==\n{{Main|Neurogenesis}}\nNeurons are born through the process of neurogenesis, in which [[neural stem cell]]s divide to produce differentiated neurons.

It is the main component of [[nervous tissue]] in all [[Animalia|animals]] except [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]. [[Plant]]s and [[fungi]] do not have nerve cells. \n\nNeurons are typically classified into three types based on their function. [[Sensory neuron]]s respond to [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] such as touch, sound, or light that affect the cells of the [[Sense|sensory organs]], and they send signals to the spinal cord or brain. [[Motor neuron]]s receive signals from the brain and spinal cord to control everything from [[muscle contraction]]s to [[gland|glandular output]]. [[Interneuron]]s connect neurons to other neurons within the same region of the brain or spinal cord. A group of connected neurons is called a [[neural circuit]].\n\nA typical neuron consists of a cell body ([[Soma (biology)|soma]]), [[dendrite]]s, and a single [[axon]]. The soma is usually compact. The axon and dendrites are filaments that extrude from it. Dendrites typically branch profusely and extend a few hundred micrometers from the soma. The axon leaves the soma at a swelling called the [[axon hillock]], and travels for as far as 1 meter in humans or more in other species. It branches but usually maintains a constant diameter. At the farthest tip of the axon's branches are [[axon terminals]], where the neuron can transmit a signal across the [[synapse]] to another cell. Neurons may lack dendrites or have no axon. The term [[neurite]] is used to describe either a dendrite or an [[axon]], particularly when the cell is [[Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated]].\n\nMost neurons receive signals via the dendrites and soma and send out signals down the axon. At the majority of synapses, signals cross from the axon of one neuron to a dendrite of another. However, synapses can connect an axon to another axon or a dendrite to another dendrite.\n\nThe signaling process is partly electrical and partly chemical. Neurons are electrically excitable, due to maintenance of [[voltage]] gradients across their [[Cell membrane|membranes]]. If the voltage changes by a large enough amount over a short interval, the neuron generates an [[All-or-none law|all-or-nothing]] [[electrochemical]] pulse called an [[action potential]]. This potential travels rapidly along the axon, and activates synaptic connections as it reaches them. Synaptic signals may be [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|excitatory]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|inhibitory]], increasing or reducing the net voltage that reaches the soma.\n\nIn most cases, neurons are generated by [[neural stem cell]]s during brain development and childhood. [[Neurogenesis]] largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain. However, strong evidence supports generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in the [[hippocampus]] and [[olfactory bulb]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/15/us/brain-may-grow-new-cells-daily.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nicholas | last=Wade | title=Brain may grow new cells daily| date=1999-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\"r1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nowakowski RS | title = Stable neuron numbers from cradle to grave | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 33 | pages = 12219\u201320 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16894140 | pmc = 1567859 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0605605103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..10312219N }}</ref>\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== Nervous system ==\n[[File:Nervous system diagram-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of the human nervous system. The relationship between the brain, spinal cord, and rest of the nerves in the body is demonstrated.]]\nNeurons are the primary components of the nervous system, along with the  [[glial cells]] that give them structural and metabolic support. The nervous system is made up of the [[central nervous system]], which includes the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]], and the [[peripheral nervous system]], which includes the [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] and [[somatic nervous system]]s. In vertebrates, the majority of neurons belong to the [[central nervous system]], but some reside in peripheral [[ganglion|ganglia]], and many sensory neurons are situated in sensory organs such as the [[retina]] and [[cochlea]].\n\nAxons may bundle into [[nerve fascicle|fascicle]]s that make up the [[nerve]]s in the [[peripheral nervous system]] (like strands of wire make up cables). Bundles of axons in the central nervous system are called [[nerve tract|tracts]].\n\n== Anatomy and histology ==\n{{Neuron map|Neuron ([[peripheral nervous system]])}}\nNeurons are highly specialized for the processing and transmission of cellular signals. Given their diversity of functions performed in different parts of the nervous system, there is a wide variety in their shape, size, and electrochemical properties. For instance, the soma of a neuron can vary from 4 to 100 [[Micrometre|micrometers]] in diameter.<ref>{{cite web |first = Melissa |last = Davies |title = The Neuron: size comparison |url = https://www.ualberta.ca/~neuro/OnlineIntro/NeuronExample.htm |work = Neuroscience: A journey through the brain |date = 2002-04-09 |access-date = 2009-06-20}}</ref>\n\n*The '''[[Soma (biology)|soma]]''' is the body of the neuron. As it contains the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], most [[protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]] occurs here. The nucleus can range from 3 to 18 micrometers in diameter.<ref>{{cite web  |first = Eric H. |last = Chudler | name-list-format = vanc |title = Brain Facts and Figures |url = http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/facts.html |work = Neuroscience for Kids |access-date = 2009-06-20 }}</ref>\n*The '''[[dendrites]]''' of a neuron are cellular extensions with many branches. This overall shape and structure is referred to metaphorically as a dendritic tree. This is where the majority of input to the neuron occurs via the [[dendritic spine]].\n*The '''[[axon]]''' is a finer, cable-like projection that can extend tens, hundreds, or even tens of thousands of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon primarily carries [[nerve signal]]s away from the soma, and carries some types of information back to it. Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may\u2014and usually will\u2014undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the '''[[axon hillock]]'''. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock also has the greatest density of [[voltage-dependent sodium channels]]. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon. In electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative [[threshold potential]].\n**While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.\n*The '''[[axon terminal]]''' is found at the end of the axon farthest from the soma and contains [[synapses]]. Synaptic boutons are specialized structures where [[neurotransmitter]] chemicals are released to communicate with target neurons. In addition to synaptic boutons at the axon terminal, a neuron may have ''en passant'' boutons, which are located along the length of the axon.\n\n[[File:Neuron Cell Body.png|thumb|Neuron cell body]]\n\nThe accepted view of the neuron attributes dedicated functions to its various anatomical components; however, dendrites and axons often act in ways contrary to their so-called main function.\n\n[[File:Complete neuron cell diagram en.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a typical myelinated vertebrate motor neuron]]\n\nAxons and dendrites in the central nervous system are typically only about one micrometer thick, while some in the peripheral nervous system are much thicker. The soma is usually about 10\u201325 micrometers in diameter and often is not much larger than the cell nucleus it contains. The longest axon of a human [[motor neuron]] can be over a meter long, reaching from the base of the spine to the toes.\n\nSensory neurons can have axons that run from the toes to the [[posterior column]] of the spinal cord, over 1.5 meters in adults. [[Giraffe]]s have single axons several meters in length running along the entire length of their necks. Much of what is known about axonal function comes from studying the [[squid giant axon]], an ideal experimental preparation because of its relatively immense size (0.5\u20131 millimeters thick, several centimeters long).\n\nFully differentiated neurons are permanently [[G0 phase|postmitotic]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrup K, Yang Y | title = Cell cycle regulation in the postmitotic neuron: oxymoron or new biology? | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 368\u201378 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17453017 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2124 }}</ref> however, stem cells present in the adult brain may regenerate functional neurons throughout the life of an organism (see [[neurogenesis]]).  [[Astrocyte]]s are star-shaped [[glial cell]]s. They have been observed to turn into neurons by virtue of their stem cell-like characteristic of [[pluripotency]].\n\n===Membrane===\nLike all animal cells, the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a [[plasma membrane]], a bilayer of [[lipid]] molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical [[Insulator (electricity)|insulator]], but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that chemically transport ions from one side of the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage gated]], meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The [[ion]] materials include [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[chloride]], and [[calcium]]. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at baseline. This voltage has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.\n\n===Histology and internal structure===\n[[File:Gyrus Dentatus 40x.jpg|thumb|250px|Golgi-stained neurons in human hippocampal tissue]]\n\n[[Image:SUM 110913 Cort Neurons 2.5d in vitro 488 Phalloidin no perm 4 cmle-2.png|thumb|300px|Actin filaments in a mouse cortical neuron in culture]]\n\nNumerous microscopic clumps called [[Nissl body|Nissl bodies]] (or Nissl substance) are seen when nerve cell bodies are stained with a basophilic (\"base-loving\") dye.

Type I cells can be further classified by the location of the soma. The basic morphology of type I neurons, represented by spinal [[motor neurons]], consists of a cell body called the soma and a long thin axon covered by a [[myelin sheath]]. The dendritic tree wraps around the cell body and receives signals from other neurons. The end of the axon has branching terminals ([[axon terminals|axon terminal]]) that release neurotransmitters into a gap called the [[synaptic cleft]] between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron.\n\n===Structural classification===\n\n====Polarity====\n[[File:Neurons uni bi multi pseudouni.svg|thumb|Different kinds of neurons:<br />1 [[Unipolar neuron]]<br />2 [[Bipolar neuron]]<br />3 [[Multipolar neuron]]<br />4 [[Pseudounipolar neuron]] ]]\nMost neurons can be anatomically characterized as:\n\n*[[Unipolar neuron|Unipolar]]: single process\n*[[Bipolar cell|Bipolar]]: 1 axon and 1 dendrite\n*[[Multipolar neuron|Multipolar]]: 1 axon and 2 or more dendrites\n**[[Golgi I]]: neurons with projecting axonal processes; examples are pyramidal cells, Purkinje cells, and anterior horn cells\n**[[Golgi II]]: neurons whose axonal process projects locally; the best example is the granule cell\n*[[Anaxonic neuron|Anaxonic]]: where the axon cannot be distinguished from the dendrite(s)\n*[[Pseudounipolar cells|Pseudounipolar]]: 1 process which then serves as both an axon and a dendrite\n\n====Other====\nSome unique neuronal types can be identified according to their location in the nervous system and distinct shape. Some examples are:\n\n*[[Basket cell]]s, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and [[cerebellum]]\n*[[Betz cell]]s, large motor neurons\n*[[Lugaro cell]]s, interneurons of the cerebellum\n*[[Medium spiny neuron]]s, most neurons in the [[corpus striatum]]\n*[[Purkinje cell]]s, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron\n*[[Pyramidal cell]]s, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I\n*[[Renshaw cell]]s, neurons with both ends linked to [[alpha motor neuron]]s\n*[[Unipolar brush cell]]s, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft\n*[[Granule cell]]s, a type of Golgi II neuron\n*[[Anterior horn (spinal cord)|Anterior horn]] cells, [[motoneurons]] located in the spinal cord\n*[[Spindle cell]]s, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain\n\n===Functional classification===\n\n====Direction====\n\n*[[Afferent neuron]]s convey information from tissues and organs into the central nervous system and are also called [[sensory neurons]].\n*[[Efferent neuron]]s (motor neurons) transmit signals from the central nervous system to the effector cells.\n*[[Interneuron]]s connect neurons within specific regions of the central nervous system.\n\nAfferent and efferent also refer generally to neurons that, respectively, bring information to or send information from the brain.\n\n====Action on other neurons====\nA neuron affects other neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that binds to [[receptor (biochemistry)|chemical receptor]]s. The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined by the type of receptor that is activated, not by the presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter. A neurotransmitter can be thought of as a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same neurotransmitter can activate multiple types of receptors. Receptors can be classified broadly as ''excitatory'' (causing an increase in firing rate), ''inhibitory'' (causing a decrease in firing rate), or ''modulatory'' (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to firing rate).\n\nThe two most common (90%+) neurotransmitters in the brain, [[glutamate]] and [[GABA]], have largely consistent actions. Glutamate acts on several types of receptors, and has effects that are excitatory at [[ionotropic receptor]]s and a modulatory effect at [[metabotropic receptor]]s. Similarly, GABA acts on several types of receptors, but all of them have inhibitory effects (in adult animals, at least). Because of this consistency, it is common for neuroscientists to refer to cells that release glutamate as \"excitatory neurons\", and cells that release GABA as \"inhibitory neurons\". Some other types of neurons have consistent effects, for example, \"excitatory\" motor neurons in the spinal cord that release [[acetylcholine]], and \"inhibitory\" [[spinal neuron]]s that release [[glycine]].\n\nThe distinction between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is not absolute. Rather, it depends on the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, inhibitory effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF [[retinal bipolar cells|bipolar cells]] are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack typical [[ionotropic receptor|ionotropic]] [[glutamate receptors]] and instead express a class of inhibitory [[metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]] glutamate receptors.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerber U | title = Metabotropic glutamate receptors in vertebrate retina | journal = Documenta Ophthalmologica.

Neurons that fire in bursts are called phasic.\n*Fast spiking.

[[Acetylcholine]] is released from presynaptic neurons into the synaptic cleft. It acts as a [[ligand]] for both ligand-gated ion channels and [[Metabotropic receptor|metabotropic]] (GPCRs) [[Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor|muscarinic receptors]]. [[Nicotinic receptors]] are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of alpha and beta subunits that bind [[nicotine]]. Ligand binding opens the channel causing influx of [[Sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] depolarization and increases the probability of presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Acetylcholine is synthesized from [[choline]] and [[acetyl coenzyme A]].\n*GABAergic neurons\u2014[[gamma aminobutyric acid]]. GABA is one of two neuroinhibitors in the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), along with glycine. GABA has a homologous function to [[Acetylcholine|ACh]], gating anion channels that allow [[Chlorine|Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]] ions to enter the post synaptic neuron. Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> causes hyperpolarization within the neuron, decreasing the probability of an action potential firing as the voltage becomes more negative (for an action potential to fire, a positive voltage threshold must be reached). GABA is synthesized from glutamate neurotransmitters by the enzyme [[glutamate decarboxylase]].\n*Glutamatergic neurons\u2014glutamate. [[Glutamate]] is one of two primary excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, along with [[Aspartic acid|aspartate]]. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a G-protein coupled receptor (often referred to as GPCR).\n\n:#[[AMPA]] and [[Kainic acid|Kainate]] receptors function as [[Ion|cation]] channels permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> cation channels mediating fast excitatory synaptic transmission.\n:#[[N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid|NMDA]] receptors are another cation channel that is more permeable to [[Calcium in biology|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]. The function of NMDA receptors depend on glycine receptor binding as a co-[[agonist]] within the channel pore. NMDA receptors do not function without both ligands present.\n:#Metabotropic receptors, GPCRs modulate synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability.\n::Glutamate can cause excitotoxicity when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, resulting in [[brain damage]]. When blood flow is suppressed, glutamate is released from presynaptic neurons, causing greater NMDA and AMPA receptor activation than normal outside of stress conditions, leading to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> entering the post synaptic neuron and cell damage. Glutamate is synthesized from the amino acid glutamine by the enzyme [[Glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase|glutamate synthase]].\n\n*Dopaminergic neurons\u2014[[dopamine]]. [[Dopamine]] is a neurotransmitter that acts on D1 type (D1 and D5) Gs-coupled receptors, which increase cAMP and PKA, and D2 type (D2, D3, and D4) receptors, which activate Gi-coupled receptors that decrease cAMP and PKA. Dopamine is connected to mood and behavior and modulates both pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmission. Loss of dopamine neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] has been linked to [[Parkinson's disease]]. Dopamine is synthesized from the amino acid [[tyrosine]]. Tyrosine is catalyzed into levadopa (or [[L-DOPA]]) by [[Tyrosine hydroxylase|tyrosine hydroxlase]], and levadopa is then converted into dopamine by the aromatic amino acid [[Carboxy-lyases|decarboxylase]].\n*Serotonergic neurons\u2014[[serotonin]]. [[Serotonin]] (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can act as excitatory or inhibitory. Of its four 5-HT receptor classes, 3 are GPCR and 1 is a ligand-gated cation channel. Serotonin is synthesized from [[tryptophan]] by [[tryptophan hydroxylase]], and then further by decarboxylase. A lack of 5-HT at postsynaptic neurons has been linked to depression. Drugs that block the presynaptic [[serotonin transporter]] are used for treatment, such as [[Prozac]] and [[Zoloft]].\n*Histaminergic neurons\u2014[[histamine]].  [[Histamine]] is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] and [[neuromodulator]].  Histamine-producing neurons are found in the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] of the [[hypothalamus]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Scammell |first1=Thomas E |last2=Jackson |first2=Alexander C |last3=Franks |first3=Nicholas P |last4=Wisden |first4=William |last5=Dauvilliers |first5=Yves |title=Histamine: neural circuits and new medications |journal=Sleep |date=January 2019 |volume=42 |issue=1 |doi=10.1093/sleep/zsy183 |pmid=30239935 |pmc=6335869 |url=https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/1/zsy183/5099478}}</ref>  Histamine is involved in [[arousal]] and regulating sleep/wake behaviors.\n\n==Connectivity==\n{{Main|Synapse|Chemical synapse}}\n[[File:Chemical synapse schema cropped.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A signal propagating down an axon to the cell body and dendrites of the next cell]]\n[[File:Neuro Muscular Junction.png|thumb|Chemical synapse|left]]\nNeurons communicate with each another via [[synapses]], where either the [[axon terminal]] of one cell contacts another neuron's dendrite, soma or, less commonly, axon. Neurons such as Purkinje cells in the cerebellum can have over 1000 dendritic branches, making connections with tens of thousands of other cells; other neurons, such as the magnocellular neurons of the [[supraoptic nucleus]], have only one or two dendrites, each of which receives thousands of synapses.\n\nSynapses can be [[EPSP|excitatory]] or [[IPSP|inhibitory]], either increasing or decreasing activity in the target neuron, respectively.

To minimize metabolic expense while maintaining rapid conduction, many neurons have insulating sheaths of [[myelin]] around their axons. The sheaths are formed by [[glia]]l cells: [[oligodendrocyte]]s in the central nervous system and [[Schwann cell]]s in the peripheral nervous system. The sheath enables action potentials to travel [[saltatory conduction|faster]] than in unmyelinated axons of the same diameter, whilst using less energy. The myelin sheath in peripheral nerves normally runs along the axon in sections about 1&nbsp;mm long, punctuated by unsheathed [[node of Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]], which contain a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. [[Multiple sclerosis]] is a neurological disorder that results from demyelination of axons in the central nervous system.\n\nSome neurons do not generate action potentials, but instead generate a [[graded potential|graded electrical signal]], which in turn causes graded neurotransmitter release.

In other words, if a neuron responds at all, then it must respond completely. Greater intensity of stimulation, like brighter image/louder sound, does not produce a stronger signal, but can increase firing frequency.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|31}} Receptors respond in different ways to stimuli. Slowly adapting or [[tonic (physiology)|tonic receptors]] respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. Tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their firing frequency, usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second. This can be likened to an intrinsic property of light where greater intensity of a specific frequency (color) requires more photons, as the photons can't become \"stronger\" for a specific frequency.\n\nOther receptor types include quickly adapting or phasic receptors, where firing decreases or stops with steady stimulus; examples include [[Human skin|skin]] which, when touched causes neurons to fire, but if the object maintains even pressure, the neurons stop firing. The neurons of the skin and muscles that are responsive to pressure and vibration have filtering accessory structures that aid their function.\n\nThe [[pacinian corpuscle]] is one such structure. It has concentric layers like an onion, which form around the axon terminal. When pressure is applied and the corpuscle is deformed, mechanical stimulus is transferred to the axon, which fires. If the pressure is steady, stimulus ends; thus, typically these neurons respond with a transient depolarization during the initial deformation and again when the pressure is removed, which causes the corpuscle to change shape again. Other types of adaptation are important in extending the function of a number of other neurons.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Roger | last2 = Randall | first2 = David | name-list-format = vanc | title = Animal physiology: mechanisms and adaptations | year = 1983 | publisher = W.H.

The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the [[motor cortex]] by the [[basal ganglia]], normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary symptoms may include high level [[cognitive dysfunction]] and subtle language problems. PD is both chronic and progressive.\n\n'''[[Myasthenia gravis]]''' is a neuromuscular disease leading to fluctuating [[muscle weakness]] and fatigability during simple activities. Weakness is typically caused by circulating [[antibodies]] that block [[acetylcholine receptors]] at the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the stimulative effect of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Myasthenia is treated with [[immunosuppressants]], [[cholinesterase]] inhibitors and, in selected cases, [[thymectomy]].\n\n===Demyelination===\n{{Further|Demyelinating disease}}\n[[File:Guillain-barr\u00e9 syndrome - Nerve Damage.gif|thumb|Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome \u2013 demyelination]]\n[[Demyelination]] is the act of demyelinating, or the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves. When myelin degrades, conduction of signals along the nerve can be impaired or lost, and the nerve eventually withers. This leads to certain neurodegenerative disorders like [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy]].\n\n===Axonal degeneration===\nAlthough most injury responses include a calcium influx signaling to promote resealing of severed parts, axonal injuries initially lead to acute axonal degeneration, which is rapid separation of the proximal and distal ends within 30 minutes of injury. Degeneration follows with swelling of the [[axolemma]], and eventually leads to bead like formation. Granular disintegration of the axonal [[cytoskeleton]] and inner [[organelle]]s occurs after axolemma degradation. Early changes include accumulation of [[mitochondria]] in the paranodal regions at the site of injury. Endoplasmic reticulum degrades and mitochondria swell up and eventually disintegrate. The disintegration is dependent on [[ubiquitin]] and [[calpain]] [[proteases]] (caused by influx of calcium ion), suggesting that axonal degeneration is an active process that produces complete fragmentation. The process takes about roughly 24 hrs in the PNS and longer in the CNS. The signaling pathways leading to axolemma degeneration are unknown.\n\n==Neurogenesis==\n{{Main|Neurogenesis}}\nNeurons are born through the process of neurogenesis, in which [[neural stem cell]]s divide to produce differentiated neurons. Once fully differentiated neurons are formed, they are no longer capable of undergoing [[mitosis]].

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]] was also brought in to produce ''Rocky Horror''.

When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims.

A humorous tribute to the [[Science fiction film|science fiction]] and [[Horror film|horror]] [[B movie]]s of the 1930s through to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad [[transvestite]] scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, a sort of [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein-style monster]] in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect [[Strongman (strength athlete)|muscle man]] named Rocky, complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by [[Jim Sharman]]. The original London production of the musical premiered at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Theatre Awards#The Ned Award for Best Musical|''Evening Standard'' Theatre Award]] for Best Musical. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut at the [[Belasco Theatre]] lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one [[Tony Award|Tony]] nomination and three [[Drama Desk Award|Drama Desk]] nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as [[West End theatre|West End]] and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. Actor [[Tim Curry]], who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 [[film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'', starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the [[television film]] ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again]]''. The musical was ranked eighth in a [[BBC Radio 2]] listener [[Opinion poll|poll]] of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/shows/paige/essentialvote.shtml Nation's Number One Essential Musical] from a [[BBC]] website</ref> ''The Rocky Horror Show'' was one of eight UK musicals featured on [[Royal Mail]] stamps, issued in February 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Royal Mail musicals stamps set to rock you! |url=https://www.royalmailgroup.com/en/press-centre/press-releases/royal-mail/royal-mail-musicals-stamps-set-to-rock-you/ |accessdate=27 April 2019 |agency=Royal Mail group}}</ref>\n\nBeyond its cult status, ''The Rocky Horror Show'' is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flavorwire.com/539534/we-live-in-the-world-rocky-horror-created|title=We Live in the World 'Rocky Horror' Created|date=25 September 2015 |work=Flavorwire|accessdate=22 May 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rocky Horror London programme.jpg|thumb|left|Original programme of the musical from the Theatre Upstairs]]\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote ''The Rocky Horror Show'' to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for [[science fiction]] and [[B movies|B horror movies]]; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, [[Steve Reeves]] muscle films, and fifties [[rock and roll]] into ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=AmericanMusical>{{cite book |title = The American Musical and the Performance of Personal Identity |last=Knapp |first=Raymond |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2 March 2009 |pages=240 |isbn=978-0-691-14105-3}}</ref> A major theme running throughout the musical is [[transvestism]], which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;<ref>{{cite book |last1=Auslander |first1=Philip |title=Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music |date=2006 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |page=49}}</ref> he has stated \"[[glam rock]] allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.<ref name=\"Glam era\">{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |title=Shock and Awe: Glam Rock and Its Legacy, from the Seventies to the Twenty-First Century |date=2016 |publisher=Faber & Faber}}</ref>\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished ''Rocky Horror'' to Australian director [[Jim Sharman]], who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the [[Royal Court Theatre]], [[Sloane Square]], [[Chelsea, London]], which was used as a project space for new work.<ref name=Miller /> Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of ''Superstar'', during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians [[Nell Campbell]] and long-time scenic designer partner [[Brian Thomson (scenic designer)|Brian Thomson]] into the production.\n\nStar [[Tim Curry]] recalled his first encounter with the script:\n{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew |title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[United Media|NEA]] newspaper syndicate |authorlink=Frank Lovece |first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer [[Sue Blane]] and musical director [[Richard Hartley (composer)|Richard Hartley]], although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. [[Michael White (producer)|Michael White]] was also brought in to produce ''Rocky Horror''. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title for it became ''They Came from Denton High'', but it was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to ''The Rocky Horror Show''.<ref name=Miller>{{cite book |title = Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll, and Musicals | last=Miller | first=Scott | publisher = Northeastern |date=11 October 2011 |page = 114 | isbn=978-1-55553-743-2}}</ref><ref>Thomson, Brian, ed.

The show received critical praise and won the 1973 [[Evening Standard Award|''Evening Standard'' Award]] for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Rocky Horror'' in 1974 [[Robert Longden (actor)|Robert Longden]] took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the [[Harold Pinter Theatre]]) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, ''Rocky Horror'' required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional [[proscenium]] arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n===Act I===\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"[[Dammit Janet]]\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"[[Over at the Frankenstein Place]]\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"[[Time Warp (song)|Time Warp]]\"*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[cross-dressing]] [[mad scientist]], arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"[[Sweet Transvestite]]\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them [[White coat|laboratory coats]] to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"[[Hot Patootie (Whatever Happened to Saturday Night?)|Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul]]\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n===Act II===\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"[[Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me]]\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the [[FBI]]. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ([[Rose Tint My World|\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"]]). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in [[Orgy|orgiastic sex]] (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying [[ray gun]]s. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"[[I'm Going Home (Rocky Horror song)|I'm Going Home]]\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\n* In the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|film version]] and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 [[West End theatre|West End]] revival.\n* \"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\n==Other productions==\n\n===Original Los Angeles production (American premiere)===\n[[Lou Adler]] had made millions with risky ventures such as [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]].

Miller]] produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]]. It starred [[Reg Livermore]] as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, [[Kate Fitzpatrick]] as Usherette and Magenta, [[Arthur Dignam]] as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with [[Bob Hudson (singer)|Bob Hudson]] and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\n===Original Melbourne/Adelaide production===\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with [[Max Phipps]] taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.<ref>''The Rocky Horror Show'', Regent Place Theatre, 1975.[https://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/67975 www.ausstage.edu.au]</ref>\n\nThe Melbourne production included [[Max Phipps]] - Frank N Furter; [[Gregory Apps]] - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); [[Tommy Dysart]] - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); [[Graham Matters]] - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).<ref name=\"auto\" />  When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. \nIt was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked-up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. \nThe show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production \u2013 which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with [[Clive Hale]]: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two-years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - had Max Phipps not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, [[Jon Finlayson]] replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; [[Keith Reid]] (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and [[Shane Bourne]] as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were\nsavage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much.\"  It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.\n\n<ref name=\"auto\">''The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the Campy Cult Classic'' (2016) by Dave Thompson; Applause Theatre & Cinema Books</ref><ref>Adelaide Programme 1977.</ref>\n\n===Original New York City (Broadway) production===\n[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster]]\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] after a ten-month run.

Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy [Garland], Barbra [Streisand] and Rog\u00e9ria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.\"{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims.
