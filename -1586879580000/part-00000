A novel of the Goncourts is made up of an infinite number of details, set side by side, every detail equally prominent.

The soul, to them, is a series of moods, which succeed one another, certainly without any of the too arbitrary logic of the novelist who has conceived of character as a solid or consistent thing.

The Sc\u00e9nic was mechanically identical to the M\u00e9gane hatchback (itself based on the older [[Renault 19|R19]]). The 1.4&nbsp;L, 1.6&nbsp;L \"Energy\", 1.8&nbsp;L \"F Type\" petrol and 1.9&nbsp;L diesel engines were shared with the hatchback range.\n\nThe Sc\u00e9nic was marketed as a [[minivan|multi-purpose vehicle]], in a smaller size lower price of such vehicles as Renault's own [[Renault Espace|Espace]]. It was launched in November 1996.\n\nRenault underestimated the market demand that the Sc\u00e9nic would have \u2014 predicting that it would be a niche model with only 450 produced a day. Production at the company's Douai plant would eventually peak at nearly 2,500 cars a day.\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:Renault Sc\u00e9nic I Phase II silver.JPG|thumb|left|Facelifted Renault Sc\u00e9nic]] \n[[File:Renault Sc\u00e9nic 002.JPG|thumb|left|Facelifted Renault Sc\u00e9nic]]\nAlong with the M\u00e9gane hatchback, the Sc\u00e9nic underwent a major frontal restyle in September 1999, and the newer 16 valve engines were introduced. The front end was quite a bit different from the M\u00e9gane counterpart, and there were also redesigned rear lights.\n\nFrom the time of this restyle, it became officially known as the '''Renault Sc\u00e9nic''', although a small \"M\u00e9gane\" badge still appeared on the rear door signifying the car's origin. This model was built in [[Brazil]] with [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible fuel engines]]. Production ended in June 2003.\n\nThe Phase 2 allowed the Sc\u00e9nic to be separate from the M\u00e9gane and its predecessor by introducing improvements, such as a storage compartment on the dashboard, and a separate opening rear window on the tailgate. Another small improvement with the Sc\u00e9nic were the rear head restraints, which were fixed over the back of the seat rather than being upright. This increased rear visibility.\n\n===Sc\u00e9nic RX4===\n[[File:2001 Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (J64 Phase 2) Privilege hatchback (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (2000\u20132003)]]\n[[File:2001 Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (J64 Phase 2) Privilege hatchback (2015-07-03) 02.jpg|left|thumb|Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (2000\u20132003)]]\nRenault developed a [[four-wheel drive]] derivative of the original Sc\u00e9nic, the '''Sc\u00e9nic RX4''', launched in 2000 in both LHD and RHD format. Featuring a viscous, multi disc central differential designed by Austrian specialists [[Steyr Daimler Puch]], it offered part time four wheel drive. The rear suspension was re engineered and the suspension was strengthened. \n\nIt also used five wheel nuts, as opposed to four on the standard Sc\u00e8nic.\n\nThe new rear suspension now occupied part of the space that was used for the spare wheel well and led to the spare tyre being placed on the rear hatch. The RX4 rode higher with increased suspension travel and larger wheels.\n\nWhile these changes provided better ground clearance, the RX4 was offered with 2.0 litre petrol and 1.9 dci diesel engines, both already known from the M\u00e9gane. Production of the RX4 ceased in 2003, with no direct successor, until the arrival of the ''Sc\u00e9nic Conquest'' in 2007.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"| 1996\u20132003\n|-\n!

There was also a seven seater [[Compact MPV]] '''Grand Sc\u00e9nic''', with a longer [[wheelbase]] and rear [[overhang (automotive)|overhang]], which has two small child sized seats in the enlarged [[luggage]] area. The '''Grand Sc\u00e9nic''' was officially launched in April 2004.\n\nAs with the M\u00e9gane, the new car employs corporate styling cues and new technology, including the \"Renault Card\" [[remote keyless system|keyless immobiliser]] and an [[parking brake|automatic parking brake]] on certain [[car model|trim levels]]. It integrates [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] on all trims since 2006. As with the Sc\u00e9nic I Phase 2, a raised \"M\u00e9gane\" logo appears on the C pillar. \n\nThe car received a different dashboard design to that of the M\u00e9gane, and featured a fully digital [[electroluminescence]] instrument display.\n\nThe Sc\u00e9nic II includes folding rear passenger seats, each separately adjustable and removable. With integrated [[table (furniture)|table]], a folding front passenger seat (on certain trim levels), [[headlamp|automatic headlights]] and [[windscreen wiper]]s, 'Child minder' [[mirror]], as well as front and rear electric windows.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the Sc\u00e9nic II was not available at any [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]] dealerships, as Yanase had ended its import rights for Renault after Renault had acquired a stake in Nissan when the Sc\u00e9nic I was still in production.

The Sc\u00e9nic was mechanically identical to the M\u00e9gane hatchback (itself based on the older [[Renault 19|R19]]). The 1.4&nbsp;L, 1.6&nbsp;L \"Energy\", 1.8&nbsp;L \"F Type\" petrol and 1.9&nbsp;L diesel engines were shared with the hatchback range.\n\nThe Sc\u00e9nic was marketed as a [[minivan|multi-purpose vehicle]], in a smaller size lower price of such vehicles as Renault's own [[Renault Espace|Espace]]. It was launched in November 1996.\n\nRenault underestimated the market demand that the Sc\u00e9nic would have \u2014 predicting that it would be a niche model with only 450 produced a day. Production at the company's Douai plant would eventually peak at nearly 2,500 cars a day.\n\n===Facelift===\n[[File:Renault Sc\u00e9nic I Phase II silver.JPG|thumb|left|Facelifted Renault Sc\u00e9nic]] \n[[File:Renault Sc\u00e9nic 002.JPG|thumb|left|Facelifted Renault Sc\u00e9nic]]\nAlong with the M\u00e9gane hatchback, the Sc\u00e9nic underwent a major frontal restyle in September 1999, and the newer 16 valve engines were introduced. The front end was quite a bit different from the M\u00e9gane counterpart, and there were also redesigned rear lights.\n\nFrom the time of this restyle, it became officially known as the '''Renault Sc\u00e9nic''', although a small \"M\u00e9gane\" badge still appeared on the rear door signifying the car's origin. This model was built in [[Brazil]] with [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flexible fuel engines]]. Production ended in June 2003.\n\nThe Phase 2 allowed the Sc\u00e9nic to be separate from the M\u00e9gane and its predecessor by introducing improvements, such as a storage compartment on the dashboard, and a separate opening rear window on the tailgate. Another small improvement with the Sc\u00e9nic were the rear head restraints, which were fixed over the back of the seat rather than being upright. This increased rear visibility.\n\n===Sc\u00e9nic RX4===\n[[File:2001 Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (J64 Phase 2) Privilege hatchback (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (2000\u20132003)]]\n[[File:2001 Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (J64 Phase 2) Privilege hatchback (2015-07-03) 02.jpg|left|thumb|Renault Sc\u00e9nic RX4 (2000\u20132003)]]\nRenault developed a [[four-wheel drive]] derivative of the original Sc\u00e9nic, the '''Sc\u00e9nic RX4''', launched in 2000 in both LHD and RHD format. Featuring a viscous, multi disc central differential designed by Austrian specialists [[Steyr Daimler Puch]], it offered part time four wheel drive. The rear suspension was re engineered and the suspension was strengthened. \n\nIt also used five wheel nuts, as opposed to four on the standard Sc\u00e8nic.\n\nThe new rear suspension now occupied part of the space that was used for the spare wheel well and led to the spare tyre being placed on the rear hatch. The RX4 rode higher with increased suspension travel and larger wheels.\n\nWhile these changes provided better ground clearance, the RX4 was offered with 2.0 litre petrol and 1.9 dci diesel engines, both already known from the M\u00e9gane.

There was also a seven seater [[Compact MPV]] '''Grand Sc\u00e9nic''', with a longer [[wheelbase]] and rear [[overhang (automotive)|overhang]], which has two small child sized seats in the enlarged [[luggage]] area. The '''Grand Sc\u00e9nic''' was officially launched in April 2004.\n\nAs with the M\u00e9gane, the new car employs corporate styling cues and new technology, including the \"Renault Card\" [[remote keyless system|keyless immobiliser]] and an [[parking brake|automatic parking brake]] on certain [[car model|trim levels]]. It integrates [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] on all trims since 2006. As with the Sc\u00e9nic I Phase 2, a raised \"M\u00e9gane\" logo appears on the C pillar. \n\nThe car received a different dashboard design to that of the M\u00e9gane, and featured a fully digital [[electroluminescence]] instrument display.\n\nThe Sc\u00e9nic II includes folding rear passenger seats, each separately adjustable and removable. With integrated [[table (furniture)|table]], a folding front passenger seat (on certain trim levels), [[headlamp|automatic headlights]] and [[windscreen wiper]]s, 'Child minder' [[mirror]], as well as front and rear electric windows.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the Sc\u00e9nic II was not available at any [[Yanase (car dealership)|Yanase Co., Ltd.]] dealerships, as Yanase had ended its import rights for Renault after Renault had acquired a stake in Nissan when the Sc\u00e9nic I was still in production.

The series, starring [[Stephanie Zimbalist]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]], was produced by [[MTM Enterprises]] and first broadcast on the [[NBC]] network from October 10, [[1982 in television|1982]] to February 17, [[1987 in television|1987]]. The series blended the genres of romantic comedy, drama, detective procedural and (towards the end of the series) international political intrigue and espionage.\n\n''Remington Steele's'' premise is that Laura Holt, a licensed [[private investigator]] played by Stephanie Zimbalist, opened a detective agency under her own name but found potential clients refused to hire a woman, no matter how qualified. To solve the problem, Laura invents a fictitious male superior she names Remington Steele. Through a series of events in the first episode, \"License to Steele\", Pierce Brosnan's character, a former thief and con man (whose real name even ''he'' proves not to know and is never revealed), assumes the identity of Remington Steele. Behind the scenes, a power struggle ensues between Laura and Steele as to who is really in charge, while the two carry on a casual romantic relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Stephanie Zimbalist]] as Laura Holt\n*[[Pierce Brosnan]] as Special Agent Ben Pearson/Remington Steele\n*[[Doris Roberts]] as Mildred Krebs (from Season 2 onward) \n*[[Janet DeMay]] as Bernice Foxe (Season 1)\n*[[James Read]] as Murphy Michaels (Season 1)\n*[[Jack Scalia]] as Tony Roselli (Season 5)\nOther recurring actors included: \n*[[Cassandra Harris]] (late wife of Pierce Brosnan) as Felicia, one of Steele's old flames (3 episodes), and Anna, a mysterious woman from Steele's past (1 episode)\n*[[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as Daniel Chalmers, a charming con man who was Steele's mentor and later revealed to be his biological father\n*[[Beverly Garland]] as Abigail Holt, Laura's mother\n*[[Gary Frank (actor)|Gary Frank]] as Detective James Jarvis, a less-than-competent police detective who more often than not falsely accused the principal characters and their clients of murder\n*[[Michael Constantine]] as George Edward Mulch, a businessman with far-fetched ideas looking only for fame and fortune\n*[[James Tolkan]] as Norman Keyes, an insurance investigator bent on proving Steele to be a fraud\n*[[Blake Clark]] as Fred, the Chauffeur\nGuest stars included:\n*[[Louie Anderson]], \"Steele Spawning\", Season 4\n*[[Tom Baker]] \"Hounded Steele\" Season 2\n*[[Judith Barsi]], \"Suburban Steele\", Season 4\n*[[Thom Bray]], \"Signed, Steeled and Delivered\", Season 1\n*[[Delta Burke]], \"Altared Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Daniel Davis]], \"Gourmet Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Geena Davis]], \"Steele in the Chips\", Season 3\n*[[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], \"Steele Hanging In There\", Season 5\n*[[Whitey Ford]] and [[Mickey Mantle]], \"Second Base Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Conrad Janis]], \"Stronger Than Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Jeffrey Jones]], \"A Steele at Any Price\", Season 2\n*[[Jane Kaczmarek]], \"Altared Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Dorothy Lamour]], \"Cast in Steele\", Season 3\n*[[John Larroquette]], \"Breath of Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Judith Light]], \"Dreams of Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Rose Marie]], \"Steele in the Spotlight\", Season 4\n*[[A Martinez]], \"High Flying Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Virginia Mayo]], \"Cast of Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Beverlee McKinsey]], \"Vintage Steele\", Season 1\n*[[Lloyd Nolan]], \"Cast in Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Annie Potts]], \"Steele Crazy After All These Years\", Season 1\n*[[Faith Prince]], \"Scene Steelers\", Season 2\n*[[Ford Rainey]], \u201dSmall Town Steele\u201d, Season 2\n*[[Paul Reiser]], \"A Good Night's Steele\", Season 1\n*[[Peter Scolari]], \"Steele Waters Run Deep\", Season 1\n*[[Jean Smart]], \"Steele in the Chips\", Season 3\n*[[Sharon Stone]], \"Steele Crazy After All These Years\", Season 1\n*[[John van Dreelen]], \u201dSteele Threads, Season 2\n*[[Barry Van Dyke]], \"Steele Belted\", Season 1\n*[[Guy Boyd (actor)|Guy Boyd]], \"Hearts of Steele\", \"Steele Framed\", \"Elegy of Steele\", Season 1 & 2\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Remington Steele episodes}}\n{{:List of Remington Steele episodes}}\n\n==Significance and influence==\n''Remington Steele'' is best known for having launched the career of [[Pierce Brosnan]]<ref>Mark Murphy and Frank Swertlow, \"Why Would I Do a Poster?

Butler pitched the idea to [[Grant Tinker]] before he was head of [[MTM Enterprises|MTM]], but Tinker felt the series was ahead of its time. In January 1980, following the success of several sitcoms featuring working women, including the groundbreaking ''Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' Butler and Tinker, now head of MTM, revived the concept.<ref>''Steele Loved After All These Years: A Remington Steele Retrospective'', Judith A.

This pilot was produced in February and March 1982 and was eventually aired with revisions as \"Tempered Steele\". NBC had some concerns about audience confusion over this episode, but ultimately agreed to schedule the series for the 1982-83 season.<ref>''Steele Loved After All These Years: A Remington Steele Retrospective,'' Judith A.

Both Murphy and Bernice knew that Remington Steele was a fraud. Episodes in the first season set in motion the slow evolution of the romantic relationship between Laura and \"Mr. Steele\" (she never called him \"Remington\" until the show's fifth season after they were \"married\") while revealing elements of the characters' backstory. The first season established the pattern where each episode made direct reference to an old movie (for example, ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which would be remade in 1999, with Pierce Brosnan in the lead role of Thomas Crown). Key episodes include \"Thou Shalt Not Steele\", which introduced Laura's mother and Felicia, a woman from Steele's past; \"Sting of Steele\", which introduced Daniel Chalmers ([[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]], the real-life father of Stephanie) as Steele's former mentor; and \"Vintage Steele\", a fan favorite that focused on Laura's past.<ref>Susan Baskin, \"Vintage Steele: An Episode She'd Written Had Become Something of a Classic\", ''Los Angeles Times'', August 27, 2006.</ref> Additionally, writer Joel Steiger won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for his script for the first-season episode \"In The Steele of the Night\".<ref>Mystery Writers of America, [http://www.mysterywriters.org/ Mysterywriters.org]</ref> ''Remington Steele'' also received strong critical reviews in the first season, noting its intelligence and stylish sophistication.<ref>John J. O'Connor, \"A Stylish Success\", ''The New York Times'', May 15, 1983.</ref>\n\n===Season 2===\nAt the end of season one, James Read made Michael Gleason aware that he was unhappy with the direction of his character.<ref>Michael Gleason, Doris Roberts audio commentary, \"Diced Steele\", ''Remington Steele'', season 3, disc 3, DVD.</ref> Gleason released him from the series and also let Janet DeMay go, thinking that the detective/investigator and secretary characters could be combined into one character. Gleason originally wrote the replacement character, Mildred Krebs, as an attractive 35-year-old woman who was a rival for Steele's affections. [[Doris Roberts]], an established character actress who had recently won an Emmy for a guest role on ''St. Elsewhere'', asked to read for the part. Although Roberts was not the right age for the character Gleason originally conceived, she won him over with her audition. Gleason then changed the character of Mildred Krebs to reflect the casting.<ref>Michael Gleason, Doris Roberts, \"Steele Mildred\" special feature, ''Remington Steele'', season 3, disc 2, DVD.</ref>\n\nNBC moved the series from Friday to Tuesday nights at 9pm following ''The A-Team'', increasing its budget and prominence on the network schedule. The second season continued the slow evolution of the relationship between Laura and Steele as he became a more competent detective. Key episodes include the two-hour season premiere, \"Steele Away With Me\", filmed on location in Mexico; \"Red Holt Steele\", a fan-favorite dramatic episode in which Laura's house is destroyed in an explosion; and \"Love Among the Steele\", another fan-favorite episode in which the agency acquires a 1936 [[Auburn Automobile|Auburn]] Boattail [[Auburn Speedster|Speedster]], which was used symbolically in several subsequent episodes.\n\n===Season 3===\n''Remington Steele'' achieved its greatest ratings success in the third season, finishing the year in the top 25.<ref>Richard Corliss, \"With class, smarts and luck, NBC has become the Cinderella network of '85\", ''Time Magazine'', March 4, 1985</ref> Key third-season episodes included the premiere, \"Steele At It\", shot on location in Cannes; \"Steele Your Heart Away\", shot on location in Ireland; and \"Maltese Steele\", shot on location in Malta.

Michael Gleason explained to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"We want to pull the relationship apart and bring it back together again with a little bit different attitude.\"<ref>Lee Margulies, \"Steele: He's Gone But Not Forgotten\", ''Los Angeles Times'' May 10, 1985</ref>\n\n===Season 4===\nSeason four was the final full season of the series. In the two-part season opener, \"Steele Searching\", filmed on location in London, Mildred Krebs learned of Steele's secret, changing the dynamics of the trio. Other key episodes, including \"Forged Steele\", \"Steele in the Spotlight\", and \"Sensitive Steele\", continued the slow evolution of the romantic relationship between the main characters. Facing a possible cancellation by NBC (whose fortunes had now changed to become the number-one network) Gleason contrived a phony marriage between the characters in the final episode of season four, \"Bonds of Steele\", as an attempt to garner additional interest and provoke NBC to pick up the series for a fifth season.<ref>Michael Gleason, Jeff Melvoin audio commentary, \"Bonds of Steele\", ''Remington Steele'' season 4, disc 4, DVD.</ref>\n\n===Proposals for season 5===\nGleason originally wanted the characters to have a real marriage at the end of season four and had plans for how to change the series in season five to accommodate the change, but both Brosnan and Zimbalist rejected the idea.<ref>Michael Gleason audio commentary, \"Diced Steele\", ''Remington Steele'' season 3, disc 3, DVD.

Moose (Bear Manor Media, 2007) 503-513.</ref>\n\n====Brief cancellation====\nThe series was cancelled at the end of the 1985&ndash;86 television season, although it still had a 28% share of the audience in its time slot. According to Michael Gleason, Brandon Tartikoff's decision to give an early pick-up to the [[Stephen J. Cannell]] series ''[[Hunter (1984 U.S. TV series)|Hunter]]'' left no room on the NBC schedule for ''Remington Steele''.<ref>Michael Gleason audio commentary, \"Bonds of Steele\", ''Remington Steele'', season 4, disc 4, DVD.</ref> Two months after the cancellation, NBC executive [[Warren Littlefield]] reversed the decision, responding to an outpouring of support from fans and a sharp upswing in the show's ratings during the summer of 1986.<ref>Stephen Farber, \"'Remington Steele' Gets Reprieve\", ''The New York Times'', July 24, 1986</ref>\n\nThe cancellation and reversal affected film role opportunities for Brosnan and Zimbalist, as both had received firm offers to do films in the interim. [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] offered Brosnan the part of [[James Bond]] for the film ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. Following NBC's reversal, Broccoli stated he did not want Bond to be identified with a current TV series and instead gave the role to [[Timothy Dalton]].<ref>\"Take This Job & Shove it\", ''People Magazine'', August 11, 1986</ref> Brosnan became 007 in 1995, making his debut in the film ''[[GoldenEye|Goldeneye]]''.<ref>Kimberly Last, \"Pierce Brosnan's Long and Winding Road To Bond\", ''Goldeneye Magazine'', Spring 1996, [http://www.klast.net/bond/pb_road.html Klast.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009210203/http://www.klast.net/bond/pb_road.html |date=2006-10-09 }}</ref> Zimbalist had accepted the role of Officer Anne Lewis in the science-fiction movie ''[[RoboCop]]'' and was forced to pull out of that production, to be replaced by [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]].<ref>Alexandra Jacobs interview with Stephanie Zimbalist, \"Actress Roles Over 40?

The final abbreviated season consisted of six hours of made-for-TV films broadcast in early 1987, including installments filmed on location in Mexico, London, and Ireland.

Subsequently, a sticker saying \"Also starring Stephanie Zimbalist\" was added to the packaging as an afterthought. This omission was corrected with the release of the second season which gave Zimbalist star billing with her photograph appearing on the box. Additionally, Zimbalist is featured on the behind-the-scenes featurettes contained therein. The first-season boxed set also has a picture of Doris Roberts on the back cover, even though she didn't join the show until the second season.\n\nSeason 1 has also been released in Region 2 & 4.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

The series, starring [[Stephanie Zimbalist]] and [[Pierce Brosnan]], was produced by [[MTM Enterprises]] and first broadcast on the [[NBC]] network from October 10, [[1982 in television|1982]] to February 17, [[1987 in television|1987]]. The series blended the genres of romantic comedy, drama, detective procedural and (towards the end of the series) international political intrigue and espionage.\n\n''Remington Steele's'' premise is that Laura Holt, a licensed [[private investigator]] played by Stephanie Zimbalist, opened a detective agency under her own name but found potential clients refused to hire a woman, no matter how qualified. To solve the problem, Laura invents a fictitious male superior she names Remington Steele. Through a series of events in the first episode, \"License to Steele\", Pierce Brosnan's character, a former thief and con man (whose real name even ''he'' proves not to know and is never revealed), assumes the identity of Remington Steele. Behind the scenes, a power struggle ensues between Laura and Steele as to who is really in charge, while the two carry on a casual romantic relationship.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Stephanie Zimbalist]] as Laura Holt\n*[[Pierce Brosnan]] as Special Agent Ben Pearson/Remington Steele\n*[[Doris Roberts]] as Mildred Krebs (from Season 2 onward) \n*[[Janet DeMay]] as Bernice Foxe (Season 1)\n*[[James Read]] as Murphy Michaels (Season 1)\n*[[Jack Scalia]] as Tony Roselli (Season 5)\nOther recurring actors included: \n*[[Cassandra Harris]] (late wife of Pierce Brosnan) as Felicia, one of Steele's old flames (3 episodes), and Anna, a mysterious woman from Steele's past (1 episode)\n*[[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]] as Daniel Chalmers, a charming con man who was Steele's mentor and later revealed to be his biological father\n*[[Beverly Garland]] as Abigail Holt, Laura's mother\n*[[Gary Frank (actor)|Gary Frank]] as Detective James Jarvis, a less-than-competent police detective who more often than not falsely accused the principal characters and their clients of murder\n*[[Michael Constantine]] as George Edward Mulch, a businessman with far-fetched ideas looking only for fame and fortune\n*[[James Tolkan]] as Norman Keyes, an insurance investigator bent on proving Steele to be a fraud\n*[[Blake Clark]] as Fred, the Chauffeur\nGuest stars included:\n*[[Louie Anderson]], \"Steele Spawning\", Season 4\n*[[Tom Baker]] \"Hounded Steele\" Season 2\n*[[Judith Barsi]], \"Suburban Steele\", Season 4\n*[[Thom Bray]], \"Signed, Steeled and Delivered\", Season 1\n*[[Delta Burke]], \"Altared Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Daniel Davis]], \"Gourmet Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Geena Davis]], \"Steele in the Chips\", Season 3\n*[[Sarah Douglas (actress)|Sarah Douglas]], \"Steele Hanging In There\", Season 5\n*[[Whitey Ford]] and [[Mickey Mantle]], \"Second Base Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Conrad Janis]], \"Stronger Than Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Jeffrey Jones]], \"A Steele at Any Price\", Season 2\n*[[Jane Kaczmarek]], \"Altared Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Dorothy Lamour]], \"Cast in Steele\", Season 3\n*[[John Larroquette]], \"Breath of Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Judith Light]], \"Dreams of Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Rose Marie]], \"Steele in the Spotlight\", Season 4\n*[[A Martinez]], \"High Flying Steele\", Season 2\n*[[Virginia Mayo]], \"Cast of Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Beverlee McKinsey]], \"Vintage Steele\", Season 1\n*[[Lloyd Nolan]], \"Cast in Steele\", Season 3\n*[[Annie Potts]], \"Steele Crazy After All These Years\", Season 1\n*[[Faith Prince]], \"Scene Steelers\", Season 2\n*[[Ford Rainey]], \u201dSmall Town Steele\u201d, Season 2\n*[[Paul Reiser]], \"A Good Night's Steele\", Season 1\n*[[Peter Scolari]], \"Steele Waters Run Deep\", Season 1\n*[[Jean Smart]], \"Steele in the Chips\", Season 3\n*[[Sharon Stone]], \"Steele Crazy After All These Years\", Season 1\n*[[John van Dreelen]], \u201dSteele Threads, Season 2\n*[[Barry Van Dyke]], \"Steele Belted\", Season 1\n*[[Guy Boyd]], \"Hearts of Steele\", \"Steele Framed\", \"Elegy of Steele\", Season 1 & 2\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Remington Steele episodes}}\n{{:List of Remington Steele episodes}}\n\n==Significance and influence==\n''Remington Steele'' is best known for having launched the career of [[Pierce Brosnan]]<ref>Mark Murphy and Frank Swertlow, \"Why Would I Do a Poster?

Butler pitched the idea to [[Grant Tinker]] before he was head of [[MTM Enterprises|MTM]], but Tinker felt the series was ahead of its time.

Both Murphy and Bernice knew that Remington Steele was a fraud. Episodes in the first season set in motion the slow evolution of the romantic relationship between Laura and \"Mr. Steele\" (she never called him \"Remington\" until the show's fifth season after they were \"married\") while revealing elements of the characters' backstory. The first season established the pattern where each episode made direct reference to an old movie (for example, ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which would be remade in 1999, with Pierce Brosnan in the lead role of Thomas Crown). Key episodes include \"Thou Shalt Not Steele\", which introduced Laura's mother and Felicia, a woman from Steele's past; \"Sting of Steele\", which introduced Daniel Chalmers ([[Efrem Zimbalist Jr.]], the real-life father of Stephanie) as Steele's former mentor; and \"Vintage Steele\", a fan favorite that focused on Laura's past.<ref>Susan Baskin, \"Vintage Steele: An Episode She'd Written Had Become Something of a Classic\", ''Los Angeles Times'', August 27, 2006.</ref> Additionally, writer Joel Steiger won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for his script for the first-season episode \"In The Steele of the Night\".<ref>Mystery Writers of America, [http://www.mysterywriters.org/ Mysterywriters.org]</ref> ''Remington Steele'' also received strong critical reviews in the first season, noting its intelligence and stylish sophistication.<ref>John J.

Gleason originally wrote the replacement character, Mildred Krebs, as an attractive 35-year-old woman who was a rival for Steele's affections. [[Doris Roberts]], an established character actress who had recently won an Emmy for a guest role on ''St. Elsewhere'', asked to read for the part. Although Roberts was not the right age for the character Gleason originally conceived, she won him over with her audition. Gleason then changed the character of Mildred Krebs to reflect the casting.<ref>Michael Gleason, Doris Roberts, \"Steele Mildred\" special feature, ''Remington Steele'', season 3, disc 2, DVD.</ref>\n\nNBC moved the series from Friday to Tuesday nights at 9pm following ''The A-Team'', increasing its budget and prominence on the network schedule. The second season continued the slow evolution of the relationship between Laura and Steele as he became a more competent detective. Key episodes include the two-hour season premiere, \"Steele Away With Me\", filmed on location in Mexico; \"Red Holt Steele\", a fan-favorite dramatic episode in which Laura's house is destroyed in an explosion; and \"Love Among the Steele\", another fan-favorite episode in which the agency acquires a 1936 [[Auburn Automobile|Auburn]] Boattail [[Auburn Speedster|Speedster]], which was used symbolically in several subsequent episodes.\n\n===Season 3===\n''Remington Steele'' achieved its greatest ratings success in the third season, finishing the year in the top 25.<ref>Richard Corliss, \"With class, smarts and luck, NBC has become the Cinderella network of '85\", ''Time Magazine'', March 4, 1985</ref> Key third-season episodes included the premiere, \"Steele At It\", shot on location in Cannes; \"Steele Your Heart Away\", shot on location in Ireland; and \"Maltese Steele\", shot on location in Malta.

In the two-part season opener, \"Steele Searching\", filmed on location in London, Mildred Krebs learned of Steele's secret, changing the dynamics of the trio. Other key episodes, including \"Forged Steele\", \"Steele in the Spotlight\", and \"Sensitive Steele\", continued the slow evolution of the romantic relationship between the main characters. Facing a possible cancellation by NBC (whose fortunes had now changed to become the number-one network) Gleason contrived a phony marriage between the characters in the final episode of season four, \"Bonds of Steele\", as an attempt to garner additional interest and provoke NBC to pick up the series for a fifth season.<ref>Michael Gleason, Jeff Melvoin audio commentary, \"Bonds of Steele\", ''Remington Steele'' season 4, disc 4, DVD.</ref>\n\n===Proposals for season 5===\nGleason originally wanted the characters to have a real marriage at the end of season four and had plans for how to change the series in season five to accommodate the change, but both Brosnan and Zimbalist rejected the idea.<ref>Michael Gleason audio commentary, \"Diced Steele\", ''Remington Steele'' season 3, disc 3, DVD.

Moose (Bear Manor Media, 2007) 503-513.</ref>\n\n====Brief cancellation====\nThe series was cancelled at the end of the 1985&ndash;86 television season, although it still had a 28% share of the audience in its time slot. According to Michael Gleason, Brandon Tartikoff's decision to give an early pick-up to the [[Stephen J.

Subsequently, a sticker saying \"Also starring Stephanie Zimbalist\" was added to the packaging as an afterthought. This omission was corrected with the release of the second season which gave Zimbalist star billing with her photograph appearing on the box. Additionally, Zimbalist is featured on the behind-the-scenes featurettes contained therein. The first-season boxed set also has a picture of Doris Roberts on the back cover, even though she didn't join the show until the second season.\n\nSeason 1 has also been released in Region 2 & 4.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n!
