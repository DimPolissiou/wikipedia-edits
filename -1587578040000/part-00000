It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]], or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]], or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

The release date of the new game is currently unannounced. \n\n==Development==\nThe BETA version of Football Superstars was released in November 2008, with community members providing feedback to the overall gameplay elements. The \u201crelease\u201d version of the game was launched in the Spring of 2009. Since then, there have been several updates and patches to the game, improving stability and gameplay.

The game allows players to play completely for free of charge.\n\n== PMC ==\nPlayer Managed Clubs (PMC) are the FS equivalent of guilds, allowing players to create their own teams, recruit their own players and compete in online events and tournaments against other user generated PMCs. Within the PMC hierarchy, the manager can nominate a Captain, Scouts, a Coach, Members and recruits. Each of these roles has a varied level of responsibility.\n\n== Superstar Management ==\nReleased in August 2010, Superstar Management allows players to improve their players stats through the official website. Players can train their gym points, increase their Fame and XP levels and improve their football abilities too.\n\n== Fame ==\nFame is another reward earned by playing competitive matches. It can also be earned by purchasing drinks or even by purchasing certain clothing. Fame points (FP) can be used to upgrade your fame level. There are 28 fame levels, starting at Local Newcomer and ending at International Syperstar. Once you have enough FP, you may be interviewed by newspaper, radio, and TV.

(''Qu'Est-ce Que le Spiritisme'' in French) is a brief introduction to [[Spiritism]] written by [[Allan Kardec]] in 1859, which is about a quarter of the length of [[The Spirits Book]]. Modern editions are augmented by a brief [[biography]] of the author, written by [[Henri Sausse]], in 1896 which is mostly focused on his role in the [[History of Spiritism]].\n\nThe book is structured as a series of [[:wikt:conference|conference]]s about Spiritism, intended to quench the public curiosity and dismiss false notions about the doctrine.

Its central subjects are the following.\n\n==Criticism of Spiritism==\nKardec tries to address the most common theses argued against [[Spiritism]] regarding it as a form of [[charlatan]]ism. He counters the critics with the following:\n\n* Spiritism is not a religion and is not interested on [[proselitism|proselitising]].\n* Spiritism is not for everyone, only for those who are ready to accept it.\n* Spiritism will survive religion because it is not based on blind faith.\n* Spiritism does not extort money from followers, everything is taught for free.\n* Charges of [[charlatan]]ism will not affect Spiritism because charlatans are moved by selfishness and usually want to make a stash, so they expose themselves by their own deeds. The public will eventually learn to tell the ''black sheep'' apart.\n\n==Skepticism==\nKardec tries to address [[skeptic]]al views of Spiritism, regarding its doctrinary uniformity and validity, its scientific character and the novelty of its concepts.\n\n* The terms Spiritism and Spiritist are necessary to differ them from generic [[Spiritualism]]. They are not vain [[neologism]]s.\n* The existing of offshoot Spiritist groups is not undesirable, but a consequence of the spreading of the doctrine. Kardec does not claim any form of leadership, except on moral grounds (as the author of the books that first established Spiritism as a coherent doctrine), and does not expect Spiritism to survive him as \"Kardecism\".

It is a rational explanation of natural phenomena which [[science]] cannot assess.\n* Spiritism is not [[witchcraft]].\n* Spiritism is not inherently dangerous for mental sanity, not if one is aware of the risks and acts with responsibility.\n\n==Opposition of the Church==\nConfronting the criticism wielded by the [[Catholic Church]], Kardec argues that religious diversity is important and that the existence of only one religion in the [[Middle Ages]] was a fertile ground for the [[Inquisition]] and [[culture|cultural]] backwardness.\n\nDiversity is also important because the coexistence of different doctrines may help people who disagree with one specific doctrine to find one that suits them better.

The jacking, snarly house tracks are wild. 'Apocoloppola', a lysergic, obsessive collage of film dialogue and weirdness, is stunning. And the hip hop tracks are unforgettable.\" Chris Johnston in [[The Age]] newspaper in 2001, writing about ''Action Hero''.<ref>''Action Hero Review'', Chris Johnston. ''[[The Age]]'', 23 March 2001.</ref>\n\n\"Sample-heavy Australian record that if we were being terribly lazy we might describe as 'a bit like a more left field Avalanches, only better'. Generally quite old skool industrial in sound, this periodically throws some incongruous acid/filter house party shapes, which is a bit like [[Gordon Brown]] breaking off from talking about monetary policy to dance the can-can. And we all know how great that is.\" Duncan Bell, reviewing the same album for [[Muzik]] magazine in the UK, in 2001.<ref>''Action Hero Review'', Duncan Bell. [[Muzik]], 2001.</ref>\n\n\"A playful sensibility prevails in the music - the 15 tracks here oscillating between wall-of-sound big beat ('Nobody Plays Guitar') and an abrasive minimalism ('Track 28') reminiscent of [[Autechre]], between dubby ambience and classic acid house.

Since 3 March 2013 the official name of the party is Partia Zieloni (The Greens), while Greens 2004 is a historical name and can still be used.\n\n== Election results ==\n\n=== European Parliament election of 2004 ===\nIn the [[2004 European Parliament election]], the Greens received 0.27% of the votes.\n\n=== Polish presidential election of 2005 ===\nIn the [[2005 Polish presidential election|2005 presidential election]], the Greens supported [[Marek Borowski]], the chairman of the SDPL, who received 10.33% of the votes.\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2006 ===\nIn the [[2006 Polish local elections|2006 local elections]], the Greens structured themselves decided on the formula for the start of elections (because the party's national authorities rejected the invitation to the alliance of the [[Left and Democrats]]). The independent list of the Greens in Warsaw received 11 210 votes (1.68%) and 7th place out of 14. Less than 1% of support was obtained in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] and [[Gda\u0144sk]] by the local committees co-created by the Greens with [[Young Socialists (Poland)|Young Socialists]]. In other cities, people associated with the party were candidates from local, mainly non-party lists or the Left and Democrats coalition.\n\n=== Polish parliamentary election of 2007 ===\nIn the [[2007 Polish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the Greens contested one district in the [[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senate]].\n\n=== European Parliament election of 2009 ===\nIn February 2009, the Greens formed a coalition called [[Alliance for the Future (Poland)|Alliance for the Future]] ''(Porozumienie dla Przysz\u0142o\u015bci - CentroLewica)'' with the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] [[Democratic Party - demokraci.pl|Democratic Party]] and the [[Social democracy|social democratic]] [[Social Democracy of Poland|SDPL]], forming a common list for the [[2009 European Parliament election in Poland|2009 European Parliament election]].\n\n=== Polish presidential election of 2010 ===\nIn the [[2010 Polish presidential election|2010 presidential election]], the Greens supported [[Grzegorz Napieralski]] based on the analysis of the programs of the most important candidates. The [[Democratic Left Alliance|SLD]] candidate obtained the highest score in the Green Index ranking: 78 on a scale from -200 to +200 points. In the second round, the party members encouraged to vote, but they did not support any of the candidates, pointing to their [[conservatism]] and economic [[neoliberalism]].\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2010 ===\nIn the [[2010 Polish local elections|2010 local elections]], members of the Greens ran in most cases from the lists of [[Democratic Left Alliance]]. In these elections, the Greens won five seats in local councils and regional parliaments.\n\n=== Polish parliamentary election of 2011 ===\nIn the [[2011 Polish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], representatives of the party again found themselves on the lists of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]], but they did not obtain any seats in the [[Sejm]]. The Green candidates themselves gained 23 421 votes, which gave 0.16% of the votes. The only one of the Greens was their chairman [[Dariusz Szwed]] opening the list in the [[Chrzan\u00f3w]] constituency, in which he obtained 3 842 votes.\n\n=== European Parliament election of 2014 ===\nIn the [[2014 European Parliament election in Poland|2014 European Parliament election]], the Greens formed their own Election Committee of the Greens. The representatives of the [[Feminist Initiative (Poland)|Women's Party]], the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and [[Young Socialists (Poland)|Young Socialists]] have announced the start of the Green Committee's lists. The Committee registered lists in five districts. The Committee of the Greens obtained 22 221 votes (0.32%) in the elections, taking the 10th place (ahead of, among others, the Direct Democracy committee, whose lists were registered in six districts).\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2014 ===\nIn the [[2014 Polish local elections|2014 local elections]], the Greens issued their own letters to the city council in [[Warsaw]] and [[Wroc\u0142aw]], in Warsaw, issuing [[Joanna Erbel]] as their own candidate for the city's presidency, and in Wroc\u0142aw supporting the SLD candidate. In [[Krak\u00f3w]], together with trade unions and city movements, they co-founded the [[Krak\u00f3w Against the Olympic Committee]]. In [[Opole]], the current councilor of the Greens, [[Beata Kubica]] (elected in 2010 from the SLD list) ran for the city council from the list of [[German Minority Electoral Committee|German Minorities]]. In the [[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubuskie voivodeship]], the Greens together with the [[Social Justice Movement]], trade unions and civic movements, co-founded the [[Nowy \u0141ad Committee]] in the elections to the regional council. The Greens also issued a dozen or so candidates in the One-National Electoral Circumscriptions in Poland.\n\nAs a result of the elections, the independent lists of the Green Party in Warsaw received 2.55% of votes to the city council. A similar result (2.48%) was received by the candidate for the mayor of the city, Joanna Erbel. The Wroc\u0142aw Green list received 1.97% of the votes to the city council. In Krak\u00f3w, the Krak\u00f3w Against the Olympic Committee, co-created by the Greens, received 6.7% of the votes, which did not translate into mandates, with [[Tomasz Le\u015bniak]] receiving 4.84% of the votes in the elections for the city president. The [[Electoral Committee New Deal]], co-created by the Greens, received 0.62% of support in the elections to the [[Lubusz Regional Assembly]] (it was the 10th result from among 11 committees). No Green candidate for a councilor in the [[single-member district]] has obtained a seat.\n\n=== Polish presidential election of 2015 ===\nIn the [[2015 Polish presidential election|2015 presidential election]], the candidate for the party was the deputy [[Anna Grodzka]], who, however, did not collect the required number of 100 000 signatures.\n\n=== Polish parliamentary election of 2015 ===\nGreens joined the [[United Left (Poland)|Zjednoczona Lewica]] (United Left) [[electoral alliance]] for the [[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]] in July 2015. In the election the alliance received 7.6% of the vote, below the 8% electoral threshold leaving the alliance with no parliamentary representation. It was officially dissolved in February 2016.\n\n=== Polish local elections of 2018 ===\nIn the [[2018 Polish local elections|2018 local elections]], the Greens, without any [[electoral alliance]], managed to obtain the highest ever result in their party history of 1.15% of the votes,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/partiazieloni/photos/a.348895927694/10156109039242695/?type=3&theater|title=Partia Zieloni|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}</ref> with their highest result as a percentage in [[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz voivodeship]] (2.62%), and the highest local [[Gmina]] result being in [[Gmina \u017bary]] (10.0%).\n\nThis concludes that the Greens achieved better overall results in [[Western Poland]] areas which are near to the [[Germany\u2013Poland border|borders of Germany]].\n\n=== Sejm and European Parliament elections of 2019 ===\nOn 6 November 2018, at a press conference, the Greens officially announced preparations for the 2019 elections both at the national and European level.

{"title_page": "The Spirits Book", "text_new": "{{italic title}}\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Introlivredesesprits.jpg|thumb|First edition of the book, published in 1857.]]\n'''''The Spirits Book''''' ('''''Le Livre des Esprits''''' in original [[French language|French]]) is part of the [[Spiritist Codification]], and is regarded as one of the five fundamental works of [[Spiritism]]. It was published by the [[France|French]] educator [[Allan Kardec]] on April 18, 1857. It was the first and remains the most important spiritist book, because it addresses in first hand all questions developed subsequently by Allan Kardec.\n\nThe book is structured as a collection of questions regarding the origin of the spirits, the purpose of the life, the order of the universe, evil and good and the [[afterlife]]. Its answers, according to Kardec, were given to him by a group of spirits who identified themselves as \"The Spirit of Truth\", with whom he communicated in several [[Spiritist]] sessions during the 1850s.  Kardec, who considered himself an \"organizer\" rather than an author, grouped the questions and their answers by theme, occasionally including lengthier digressions the spirits had dictated to him on specific subjects, some signed by philosophers such as [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and writers including [[Voltaire]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe basic concepts presented by the book are:\n\n* [[Monotheism]] (i.e. there is only one Supreme Being, the source of all [[Good and evil|good]] and [[evil]] alike)\n* [[Creationism]] (i.e. God created the principle of everything, not things as they are now)\n* validity of [[Jesus]]' ethics and moral teachings\n* survival of the [[soul]] (spirit) after [[death]] (disincarnation)\n* [[Reincarnation]] of the souls (plurality of existences)\n* inherent morality of [[God]] and His creation\n* existence of life all over the [[Universe]] (plurality of worlds)\n* progression of the soul towards perfection by experience through several lives\n* migration of [[spirit]]s from one world to another (transmigration)\n* possibility of manifestation of spirits in the living world by means of [[Mediumship|medium]]s\n* [[karma]] (not actually termed such) as an explanation for apparent [[problem of evil|injustices]]\n* Good works are important to spiritual realization, not necessarily [[faith]]\n\n==Contents==\n\n''The Spirits Book'' is divided into four parts or \"books\", each one split into several chapters. Chapters are not regularly subdivided into sections \u2014 though most have titles marking the beginning of particularly sought subjects.

The perispirit is an original word of [[Spiritism]].\n* Spirits pre-exist and will survive matter that was created.\n* There are not [[angels]] or [[demons]] as separate orders in the creation, but only good and evil spirits. Even a beastly person will eventually attain perfection.\n* All Spirits are created simple and ignorant. They gradually evolve intellectually and morally, so passing from an inferior order to more elevated ones until finally reaching perfection.\n* All Spirits preserve their individuality, before, during and after each life ([[incarnation]]). However, the amount of memory one retains depends on one's level of spiritual progression.\n* The different corporeal existences of the Spirit are progressive and not regressive. The pace of their progress, however, depends on the effort made towards betterment. Spirits can stagnate for so long that it seems to be an eternity and it can even appear that they have retrograded.\n* Spirits pertain to various orders, according to the degree of perfection they have attained, in three major categories (with fluid limits and unknown number of subcategories): Pure Spirits, who have attained maximum perfection; Good Spirits, whose desire towards goodness predominates, and Imperfect Spirits, who are characterized by ignorance and evil impulses. The relationship of Spirits with Man is constant and has always existed. The Good Spirits do their best to lead us towards goodness and uphold us during our trials, helping us to support them with courage and resignation. By contrast, the Imperfect Spirits try to incite us toward evil.\n* Everyone has their own spirit-protector, otherwise known as a guardian angel, who is entrusted with keeping watch over somebody as a mission or trial for them. Similarly to our incarnation on the earth, this mission for them can be a way of advancing and purifying themselves.\n* [[Jesus]] is the guide and model for mankind. The Doctrine which he taught and exemplified is the most pure expression of God's Laws. However, most of the traditional doctrine on him being the [[Christ]] ([[Messiah]]) is seen under a different light. Aspects regarded as keystones of faith by most denominations, like [[Trinity|trinitarianism]] and the [[Virgin Mary|virgin birth]] are not seen as important, while his [[resurrection]] is explained in another way. His death also has a different interpretation: instead of a [[sacrifice]] to [[Atonement in Christianity|atone]] for our sins, it is an example of the importance of being coherent and resisting temptation.\n* Man has free will, but must face the consequences of his deeds.\n* The future life is in accordance to one's behavior and learning needs.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Book on Mediums]]''\n* ''[[O Filme dos Esp\u00edritos]]'' - Brazilian film based on the book.\n* ''[[Spiritism (book)|Spiritism]]''\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.allankardec.com/Allan_Kardec/Le_livre_des_esprits/lesp_us.pdf 1018 Questions Answered by the Spirits]\n* [http://www.allankardec.com/Allan_Kardec/Le_livre_des_esprits/ The Spirits' Book]\n* [http://www.geae.net.br/livros/le/ ''O Livro dos Esp\u00edritos''] by Allan Kardec ([[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] page)\n* [http://www.allankardec.org is the correct link address, not \u2018.com\u2019\n* [https://spiritsbook.org Abridged Online Study Aid]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spirits Book, The}}\n[[Category:Books about spirituality]]\n[[Category:Spiritism]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Introlivredesesprits.jpg|thumb|First edition of the book, published in 1857.]]\n'''''The Spirits Book''''' ('''''Le Livre des Esprits''''' in original [[French language|French]]) is part of the [[Spiritist Codification]], and is regarded as one of the five fundamental works of [[Spiritism]].
