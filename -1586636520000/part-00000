In the context of the RSI, where numerous war crimes were committed during the [[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung|Nazi security warfare]], and many individuals were therefore involved in such crimes (especially GNR and Black Brigades personnel), this influences negatively the casualty count, under a statistical point of view.

The new government signed an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies on 8 September 1943. However, German forces soon took control of northern and central Italy; Mussolini, who was rescued by German paratroopers, established a collaborationist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic (RSI) to administer the German-occupied territory. The Germans, often with Italian fascists, also committed several [[Axis war crimes in Italy|atrocities]] against civilians and non-fascist troops. As result, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies, alongside the large Italian resistance movement, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. This period is known as the [[Italian Civil War]]. The campaign ended when [[Army Group C]] surrendered unconditionally to the Allies on May 2, 1945, one week before the formal [[German Instrument of Surrender]]. The independent states of [[Battle of San Marino|San Marino]] and [[The Bombing of The Vatican|the Vatican]], both surrounded by Italian territory, also suffered damage during the campaign.\n\n==Strategic background==\nEven before the victory in the [[North African Campaign|North African campaign]] in May 1943, there was disagreement among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on the best strategy to defeat the [[Axis powers|Axis]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The British, especially the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], advocated their traditional naval-based peripheral strategy. Even with a large [[British Army|army]], but greater [[Royal Navy|naval]] power, the traditional British answer against a continental enemy was to fight as part of a coalition and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy. The United States, with the larger [[U.S. Army]], favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|northwestern Europe]]. The ability to launch such a campaign depended on first winning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nThe strategic disagreement was fierce, with the U.S. service chiefs arguing for an invasion of France as early as possible, while their British counterparts advocated a policy centred on operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There was even pressure from some Latin American countries to stage an invasion of Spain, which, under [[Francisco Franco]], was friendly to the Axis nations, although not a participant in the war.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html \"Batista's Boost\"], ''TIME'', January 18, 1943, Retrieved March 2, 2010</ref> The American staff believed that a full-scale invasion of France at the earliest possible time was required to end the war in Europe, and that no operations should be undertaken that might delay that effort. The British argued that the presence of large numbers of troops trained for amphibious landings in the Mediterranean made a limited-scale invasion possible and useful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nEventually the U.S. and British political leadership reached a compromise in which both would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small-scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s desire to keep U.S. troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating Italy from the war.<ref>Carver, pp4 & 59</ref> It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict,<ref>Blumenson 1969, p. 7.</ref> or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it.<ref>Weinberg 1994, pp. 588 & 591.</ref><ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\">Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457.</ref> The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the [[Royal Navy]], to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt and thus Asia.<ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\"/><ref>Keegan 2005, p. 287.</ref> Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Weinberg 1994, p. 591.</ref><ref>Churchill 1959, p. 669.</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n===Invasion of Sicily===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Sicily}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Sicily 1943 NA4561.jpg|thumb|right|British infantry marching through the town of [[Noto, Sicily]], 11 July 1943]]\n\nA combined Allied invasion of [[Sicily]] began on 10 July 1943 with both amphibious and airborne landings at the [[Gulf of Gela]]. The land forces involved were the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]], under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton]], and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. The original plan contemplated a strong advance by the British northwards along the east coast to [[Messina]], with the Americans in a supporting role along their left flank. When the Eighth Army were held up by stubborn defences in the rugged hills south of [[Mount Etna]], Patton amplified the American role by a wide advance northwest toward [[Palermo]] and then directly north to cut the northern coastal road. This was followed by an eastward advance north of Etna towards Messina, supported by a series of amphibious landings on the northern coast that propelled Patton's troops into Messina shortly before the first units of the Eighth Army. The defending German and Italian forces were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island, but they succeeded in evacuating most of their troops to the mainland, with the last leaving on 17 August 1943. The Allied forces gained experience in opposed amphibious operations, coalition warfare, and large airborne drops.\n\n===Invasion of Continental Italy===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Italy|Armistice of Cassibile|Operation Achse}}\n[[File:ItalySalernoInvasion1943.jpg|thumb|left|Artillery being landed during the invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno, September 1943]]\nForces of the British Eighth Army, still under Montgomery, landed in the 'toe' of Italy on 3 September 1943 in [[Operation Baytown]], the day the Italian government agreed to an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies. The armistice was publicly announced on 8 September by two broadcasts, first by General Eisenhower and then by a [[Badoglio Proclamation|proclamation by Marshal Badoglio]]. Although the German forces prepared to defend without Italian assistance, only two of their divisions opposite the Eighth Army and one at [[Salerno]] were not tied up disarming the [[Royal Italian Army]].\n\nOn 9 September, forces of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], expecting little resistance, landed against heavy German resistance at Salerno in [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Operation Avalanche]]; in addition, British forces landed at [[Taranto]] in [[Operation Slapstick]], which was almost unopposed. There had been a hope that, with the surrender of the Italian government, the Germans would withdraw to the north, since at the time [[Adolf Hitler]] had been persuaded that [[Southern Italy]] was strategically unimportant. However, this was not to be; although, for a while, the Eighth Army was able to make relatively easy progress up the eastern coast, capturing the port of [[Bari]] and the important airfields around [[Foggia]]. Despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], it nevertheless came close to repelling the Salerno landing. The main Allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of [[Naples]]: that city was selected because it was the northernmost port that could receive air cover by [[fighter plane]]s flying from Sicily.\n\nAs the Allies advanced, they encountered increasingly difficult terrain: the [[Apennine Mountains]] form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of [[Abruzzo]], more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and re-entrants to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance. The rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding, which had the potential to thwart the Allied commanders' plans.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c1-2.html#n20 p. 20]</ref>\n\n===Allied advance on Rome===\n{{Main article|Bernhardt Line|Moro River Campaign|Battle of Monte Cassino|Battle of Anzio}}\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\nIn early October 1943, Hitler was persuaded by his Army Group Commander in [[Southern Italy]], [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Albert Kesselring]], that the defence of Italy should be conducted as far away from Germany as possible. This would make the most of the natural defensive geography of [[Central Italy]], whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields, each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the [[Balkans]], with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.<ref>Orgill, ''The Gothic Line'', p5</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian sniper in Ortona.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian sniper at the [[Battle of Ortona]]]]\n\nKesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy, south of [[Rome]]. Two lines, the [[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line|Barbara]], were used to delay the Allied advance so as to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions, which formed the ''[[Winter Line]]'' \u2013 the collective name for the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine Mountains, the [[Bernhardt Line|Bernhardt]] and [[Hitler Line|Hitler]] lines (the latter had been renamed the Senger Line by 23 May 1944).<ref>Carver, p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:Polish II Corps (35) - 1946-05-16 - J\u00f3zef Gawlina in Casarano.jpg|thumb|[[Polish II Corps]] and Bishop [[J\u00f3zef Gawlina]] in [[Casarano]]]]\n[[File:Canadians Italy1.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers inspect a captured German [[MG34]] machine gun.]]\n\nThe Winter Line proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's [[Adriatic]] front, and [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]] was liberated with heavy casualties to Canadian troops, the blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the [[Liri]] valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings behind the line [[Battle of Anzio|at Anzio]] during Operation Shingle, advocated by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur because of disagreements that the American commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John P. Lucas]], had with the battle plan and his insistence that his forces were not large enough to accomplish their mission. Lucas entrenched his forces, during which time German Field Marshal Kesselring assembled sufficient forces to form a ring around the beachhead. After a month of hard fighting Lucas was replaced by Major General [[Lucian Truscott]] who eventually broke out in May.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-310-0880-38, Italien, Rom, Tiger I vor Vittoriano.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Tiger I]] tank in front of the [[Altare della Patria]] in [[Rome]] in 1944]]\n\nIt took four major offensives between January and May 1944 before the line was eventually broken by a combined assault of the Fifth and Eighth Armies (including British, American, French, Polish, and Canadian corps) concentrated along a twenty-mile front between [[Monte Cassino]] and the western seaboard. In a concurrent action, [[Mark W. Clark|American General Mark Clark]] was ordered to break out of the stagnant position at Anzio and cash in on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]] retreating from the Gustav Line between them and the Canadians. But this opportunity was lost on the brink of success, when Clark disobeyed his orders and sent his U.S. forces to enter the vacant Rome instead.<ref>Katz, ''The Battle for Rome''</ref> Rome had been declared an [[open city]] by the German Army so no resistance was encountered.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15496.jpg|thumb|left|The ruined town of [[Pontecorvo]], 26 May 1944]]\n\nThe American forces took possession of Rome on 4 June 1944.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\">Clark, ''Calculated Risk''</ref> The German Tenth Army were allowed to get away and, in the next few weeks, may have been responsible for doubling the Allied casualties in the next few months.

The sudden removal of these experienced units from the Italian front was only partially compensated for by the gradual arrival of three divisions, the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian 1st Infantry Division]], the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 92nd Infantry Division]], both in the second half of 1944, and the [[10th Mountain Division|U.S. 10th Mountain Division]] in January 1945.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\"/>\n\nIn the period from June to August 1944, the Allies advanced beyond Rome, taking [[Florence]] and closing up on the Gothic Line.<ref>{{cite video|year=1944|title =Video: Allies Liberate Florence etc |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39132|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |accessdate =February 21, 2012}}</ref> This last major defensive line ran from the coast some {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of [[Pisa]], along the jagged Apennine Mountains chain between Florence and [[Bologna]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]], just south of [[Rimini]].

Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had hoped that a major advance in late 1944 would open the way for the Allied armies to advance northeast through the \"Ljubljana Gap\" (the area between [[Venice]] and [[Vienna]], which is today's [[Slovenia]]) to Vienna and [[Hungary]] to forestall the [[Red Army]] from advancing into [[Eastern Europe]]. Churchill's proposal had been strongly opposed by the U.S. Chiefs of Staff who, not fully understanding its importance to British postwar interests in the region, did not think that it aligned with the overall Allied war priorities.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\"/>\n\nIn October, Lieutenant General [[Richard McCreery|Sir Richard McCreery]] succeeded Lieutenant General [[Oliver Leese|Sir Oliver Leese]] as the commander of the Eighth Army. In December, Lieutenant General Mark Clark, the Fifth Army commander, was appointed to command the [[15th Army Group]], thereby succeeding the British [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] as commander of all Allied ground troops in Italy; Alexander succeeded [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Sir Henry Wilson]] as the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] in the Mediterranean Theatre. Clark was succeeded in command of the Fifth Army by Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott|Lucian K. Truscott, Jr.]]. In the winter and spring of 1944\u201345, extensive [[Italian partisans|partisan]] activity in Northern Italy took place. As there were two Italian governments during this period, (one on each side of the war), the struggle took on some characteristics of a [[civil war]].\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian troops]] arrive in the city of [[Massarosa]], Italy, September 1944]]\n\nThe poor winter weather, which made armoured manoeuvre and the exploitation of overwhelming air superiority impossible, coupled with the massive losses suffered to its ranks during the autumn fighting,<ref>Keegan, p367</ref><ref>R.Brooks, ''The War North of Rome'', Chps XIX-XX spec.p254</ref> the need to transfer some British troops to [[Greek Civil War|Greece]] (as well as the need to withdraw the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]] and [[I Canadian Corps]] to [[Western Front (World War II)|northwestern Europe]]) made it impractical for the Allies to continue their offensive in early 1945.

In the context of the RSI, where numerous war crimes were committed during the [[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung|Nazi security warfare]], and many individuals were therefore involved in such crimes (especially GNR and Black Brigades personnel), this influences negatively the casualty count, under a statistical point of view. The \"RSI Historical Foundation\" (''Fondazione RSI Istituto Storico'') has drafted [http://www.fondazionersi.org/caduti/AlboCaduti2016.pdf a list that lists the names of some 35,000 RSI military personnel killed in action or executed] during and immediately after World War II (including the \"revenge killings\" that occurred at the end of the hostilities and in their immediate aftermath), including some 13,500 members of the [[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]] and Milizia Difesa Territoriale, 6,200 members of the [[Black Brigades]], 2,800 [[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]] personnel, 1,000 [[Marina Nazionale Repubblicana]] personnel, 1,900 [[X MAS]] personnel, 800 soldiers of the \"Monterosa\" Division, 470 soldiers of the \"Italia\" Division, 1,500 soldiers of the \"San Marco\" Division, 300 soldiers of the \"Littorio\" Division, 350 soldiers of the \"Tagliamento\" Alpini Regiment, 730 soldiers of the 3rd and 8th Bersaglieri regiments, 4,000 troops of miscellaneous units of the [[Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano]] (excluding the aabove-mentioned Divisions and Alpini and Bersaglieri Regiments), 300 members of the ''Legione Autonoma Mobile \"Ettore Muti\"'', 200 members of the ''Raggruppamento Anti Partigiani'', 550 members of the [[29th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Italian)|Italian SS]], and 170 members of the ''Cacciatori degli Appennini Regiment''.</ref> On the [[Western Front of World War II]], Italy was the most costly campaign in terms of casualties suffered by [[infantry]] forces of both sides, during bitter small-scale fighting around strongpoints at the [[Winter Line]], the [[Battle of Anzio|Anzio beachhead]] and the [[Gothic Line]].<ref>[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]] \"The Second World War\" [[Penguin Books]] 2005 {{ISBN|0143035738}} p.368</ref>\n\nThe [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943 led to the [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|collapse of the Fascist Italian regime]] and the fall of [[Mussolini]], who was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III on 25 July. The new government signed an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies on 8 September 1943. However, German forces soon took control of northern and central Italy; Mussolini, who was rescued by German paratroopers, established a collaborationist puppet state, the Italian Social Republic (RSI) to administer the German-occupied territory. The Germans, often with Italian fascists, also committed several [[Axis war crimes in Italy|atrocities]] against civilians and non-fascist troops. As result, the [[Italian Co-Belligerent Army]] was created to fight against the RSI and its German allies, alongside the large Italian resistance movement, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. This period is known as the [[Italian Civil War]]. The campaign ended when [[Army Group C]] surrendered unconditionally to the Allies on May 2, 1945, one week before the formal [[German Instrument of Surrender]]. The independent states of [[Battle of San Marino|San Marino]] and [[The Bombing of The Vatican|the Vatican]], both surrounded by Italian territory, also suffered damage during the campaign.\n\n==Strategic background==\nEven before the victory in the [[North African Campaign|North African campaign]] in May 1943, there was disagreement among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on the best strategy to defeat the [[Axis powers|Axis]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The British, especially the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], advocated their traditional naval-based peripheral strategy. Even with a large [[British Army|army]], but greater [[Royal Navy|naval]] power, the traditional British answer against a continental enemy was to fight as part of a coalition and mount small peripheral operations designed to gradually weaken the enemy. The United States, with the larger [[U.S. Army]], favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[Western Front (World War II)|northwestern Europe]]. The ability to launch such a campaign depended on first winning the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\nThe strategic disagreement was fierce, with the U.S. service chiefs arguing for an invasion of France as early as possible, while their British counterparts advocated a policy centred on operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. There was even pressure from some Latin American countries to stage an invasion of Spain, which, under [[Francisco Franco]], was friendly to the Axis nations, although not a participant in the war.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802544,00.html \"Batista's Boost\"], ''TIME'', January 18, 1943, Retrieved March 2, 2010</ref> The American staff believed that a full-scale invasion of France at the earliest possible time was required to end the war in Europe, and that no operations should be undertaken that might delay that effort. The British argued that the presence of large numbers of troops trained for amphibious landings in the Mediterranean made a limited-scale invasion possible and useful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nEventually the U.S. and British political leadership reached a compromise in which both would commit most of their forces to an invasion of France in early 1944, but also launch a relatively small-scale Italian campaign. A contributing factor was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s desire to keep U.S. troops active in the European theatre during 1943 and his attraction to the idea of eliminating Italy from the war.<ref>Carver, pp4 & 59</ref> It was hoped that an invasion might knock Italy out of the conflict,<ref>Blumenson 1969, p. 7.</ref> or at least increase the pressure on it and weaken it.<ref>Weinberg 1994, pp. 588 & 591.</ref><ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\">Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457.</ref> The elimination of Italy would enable Allied naval forces, principally the [[Royal Navy]], to dominate the Mediterranean Sea, securing the lines of communications with Egypt and thus Asia.<ref name=\"Liddell Hart 1970, p. 457\"/><ref>Keegan 2005, p. 287.</ref> Italian divisions on occupation and coastal defence duties in the Balkans and France would be withdrawn to defend Italy, while the Germans would have to transfer troops from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] to defend Italy and the entire southern coast of France, thus aiding the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>Weinberg 1994, p. 591.</ref><ref>Churchill 1959, p. 669.</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n===Invasion of Sicily===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Sicily}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in Sicily 1943 NA4561.jpg|thumb|right|British infantry marching through the town of [[Noto, Sicily]], 11 July 1943]]\n\nA combined Allied invasion of [[Sicily]] began on 10 July 1943 with both amphibious and airborne landings at the [[Gulf of Gela]]. The land forces involved were the [[Seventh United States Army|U.S. Seventh Army]], under [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[George S. Patton]], and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], under [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery]]. The original plan contemplated a strong advance by the British northwards along the east coast to [[Messina]], with the Americans in a supporting role along their left flank. When the Eighth Army were held up by stubborn defences in the rugged hills south of [[Mount Etna]], Patton amplified the American role by a wide advance northwest toward [[Palermo]] and then directly north to cut the northern coastal road. This was followed by an eastward advance north of Etna towards Messina, supported by a series of amphibious landings on the northern coast that propelled Patton's troops into Messina shortly before the first units of the Eighth Army. The defending German and Italian forces were unable to prevent the Allied capture of the island, but they succeeded in evacuating most of their troops to the mainland, with the last leaving on 17 August 1943. The Allied forces gained experience in opposed amphibious operations, coalition warfare, and large airborne drops.\n\n===Invasion of Continental Italy===\n{{Main article|Allied invasion of Italy|Armistice of Cassibile|Operation Achse}}\n[[File:ItalySalernoInvasion1943.jpg|thumb|left|Artillery being landed during the invasion of mainland Italy at Salerno, September 1943]]\nForces of the British Eighth Army, still under Montgomery, landed in the 'toe' of Italy on 3 September 1943 in [[Operation Baytown]], the day the Italian government agreed to an [[Armistice of Cassibile|armistice]] with the Allies. The armistice was publicly announced on 8 September by two broadcasts, first by General Eisenhower and then by a [[Badoglio Proclamation|proclamation by Marshal Badoglio]]. Although the German forces prepared to defend without Italian assistance, only two of their divisions opposite the Eighth Army and one at [[Salerno]] were not tied up disarming the [[Royal Italian Army]].\n\nOn 9 September, forces of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], under Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], expecting little resistance, landed against heavy German resistance at Salerno in [[Allied invasion of Italy#Salerno landings|Operation Avalanche]]; in addition, British forces landed at [[Taranto]] in [[Operation Slapstick]], which was almost unopposed. There had been a hope that, with the surrender of the Italian government, the Germans would withdraw to the north, since at the time [[Adolf Hitler]] had been persuaded that [[Southern Italy]] was strategically unimportant. However, this was not to be; although, for a while, the Eighth Army was able to make relatively easy progress up the eastern coast, capturing the port of [[Bari]] and the important airfields around [[Foggia]]. Despite none of the northern reserves having been made available to the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]], it nevertheless came close to repelling the Salerno landing. The main Allied effort in the west initially centred on the port of [[Naples]]: that city was selected because it was the northernmost port that could receive air cover by [[fighter plane]]s flying from Sicily.\n\nAs the Allies advanced, they encountered increasingly difficult terrain: the [[Apennine Mountains]] form a spine along the Italian peninsula offset somewhat to the east. In the most mountainous areas of [[Abruzzo]], more than half the width of the peninsula comprises crests and peaks over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} that are relatively easy to defend; and the spurs and re-entrants to the spine confronted the Allies with a succession of ridges and rivers across their line of advance. The rivers were subject to sudden and unexpected flooding, which had the potential to thwart the Allied commanders' plans.<ref>Phillips (1957), [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-1Ita-c1-2.html#n20 p. 20]</ref>\n\n===Allied advance on Rome===\n{{Main article|Bernhardt Line|Moro River Campaign|Battle of Monte Cassino|Battle of Anzio}}\n[[File:ItalyDefenseLinesSouthofRome1943 4.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The situation south of Rome showing German prepared defensive lines]]\nIn early October 1943, Hitler was persuaded by his Army Group Commander in [[Southern Italy]], [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Albert Kesselring]], that the defence of Italy should be conducted as far away from Germany as possible. This would make the most of the natural defensive geography of [[Central Italy]], whilst denying the Allies the easy capture of a succession of airfields, each one being ever closer to Germany. Hitler was also convinced that yielding southern Italy would provide the Allies with a springboard for an invasion of the [[Balkans]], with its vital resources of oil, bauxite and copper.<ref>Orgill, ''The Gothic Line'', p5</ref>\n\n[[File:Canadian sniper in Ortona.jpg|thumb|right|Canadian sniper at the [[Battle of Ortona]]]]\n\nKesselring was given command of the whole of Italy and immediately ordered the preparation of a series of defensive lines across Italy, south of [[Rome]]. Two lines, the [[Volturno Line|Volturno]] and the [[Barbara Line|Barbara]], were used to delay the Allied advance so as to buy time to prepare the most formidable defensive positions, which formed the ''[[Winter Line]]'' \u2013 the collective name for the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine Mountains, the [[Bernhardt Line|Bernhardt]] and [[Hitler Line|Hitler]] lines (the latter had been renamed the Senger Line by 23 May 1944).<ref>Carver, p. 195</ref>\n\n[[File:Polish II Corps (35) - 1946-05-16 - J\u00f3zef Gawlina in Casarano.jpg|thumb|[[Polish II Corps]] and Bishop [[J\u00f3zef Gawlina]] in [[Casarano]]]]\n[[File:Canadians Italy1.jpg|thumb|left|Canadian soldiers inspect a captured German [[MG34]] machine gun.]]\n\nThe Winter Line proved a major obstacle to the Allies at the end of 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's [[Adriatic]] front, and [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]] was liberated with heavy casualties to Canadian troops, the blizzards, drifting snow and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the [[Liri]] valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings behind the line [[Battle of Anzio|at Anzio]] during Operation Shingle, advocated by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], [[Winston Churchill]], were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur because of disagreements that the American commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[John P. Lucas]], had with the battle plan and his insistence that his forces were not large enough to accomplish their mission. Lucas entrenched his forces, during which time German Field Marshal Kesselring assembled sufficient forces to form a ring around the beachhead. After a month of hard fighting Lucas was replaced by Major General [[Lucian Truscott]] who eventually broke out in May.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-310-0880-38, Italien, Rom, Tiger I vor Vittoriano.jpg|thumb|right|German [[Tiger I]] tank in front of the [[Altare della Patria]] in [[Rome]] in 1944]]\n\nIt took four major offensives between January and May 1944 before the line was eventually broken by a combined assault of the Fifth and Eighth Armies (including British, American, French, Polish, and Canadian corps) concentrated along a twenty-mile front between [[Monte Cassino]] and the western seaboard. In a concurrent action, [[Mark W. Clark|American General Mark Clark]] was ordered to break out of the stagnant position at Anzio and cash in on the opportunity to cut off and destroy a large part of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]] retreating from the Gustav Line between them and the Canadians. But this opportunity was lost on the brink of success, when Clark disobeyed his orders and sent his U.S. forces to enter the vacant Rome instead.<ref>Katz, ''The Battle for Rome''</ref> Rome had been declared an [[open city]] by the German Army so no resistance was encountered.\n\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA15496.jpg|thumb|left|The ruined town of [[Pontecorvo]], 26 May 1944]]\n\nThe American forces took possession of Rome on 4 June 1944.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\">Clark, ''Calculated Risk''</ref> The German Tenth Army were allowed to get away and, in the next few weeks, may have been responsible for doubling the Allied casualties in the next few months.

The sudden removal of these experienced units from the Italian front was only partially compensated for by the gradual arrival of three divisions, the [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian 1st Infantry Division]], the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 92nd Infantry Division]], both in the second half of 1944, and the [[10th Mountain Division|U.S. 10th Mountain Division]] in January 1945.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\"/>\n\nIn the period from June to August 1944, the Allies advanced beyond Rome, taking [[Florence]] and closing up on the Gothic Line.<ref>{{cite video|year=1944|title =Video: Allies Liberate Florence etc |url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39132|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]] |accessdate =February 21, 2012}}</ref> This last major defensive line ran from the coast some {{convert|30|mi|km}} north of [[Pisa]], along the jagged Apennine Mountains chain between Florence and [[Bologna]] to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]], just south of [[Rimini]].

Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had hoped that a major advance in late 1944 would open the way for the Allied armies to advance northeast through the \"Ljubljana Gap\" (the area between [[Venice]] and [[Vienna]], which is today's [[Slovenia]]) to Vienna and [[Hungary]] to forestall the [[Red Army]] from advancing into [[Eastern Europe]]. Churchill's proposal had been strongly opposed by the U.S. Chiefs of Staff who, not fully understanding its importance to British postwar interests in the region, did not think that it aligned with the overall Allied war priorities.<ref name=\"Clark, Calculated Risk\"/>\n\nIn October, Lieutenant General [[Richard McCreery|Sir Richard McCreery]] succeeded Lieutenant General [[Oliver Leese|Sir Oliver Leese]] as the commander of the Eighth Army. In December, Lieutenant General Mark Clark, the Fifth Army commander, was appointed to command the [[15th Army Group]], thereby succeeding the British [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]] as commander of all Allied ground troops in Italy; Alexander succeeded [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Sir Henry Wilson]] as the [[Supreme Allied Commander]] in the Mediterranean Theatre. Clark was succeeded in command of the Fifth Army by Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott|Lucian K. Truscott, Jr.]]. In the winter and spring of 1944\u201345, extensive [[Italian partisans|partisan]] activity in Northern Italy took place. As there were two Italian governments during this period, (one on each side of the war), the struggle took on some characteristics of a [[civil war]].\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian troops]] arrive in the city of [[Massarosa]], Italy, September 1944]]\n\nThe poor winter weather, which made armoured manoeuvre and the exploitation of overwhelming air superiority impossible, coupled with the massive losses suffered to its ranks during the autumn fighting,<ref>Keegan, p367</ref><ref>R.Brooks, ''The War North of Rome'', Chps XIX-XX spec.p254</ref> the need to transfer some British troops to [[Greek Civil War|Greece]] (as well as the need to withdraw the [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]] and [[I Canadian Corps]] to [[Western Front (World War II)|northwestern Europe]]) made it impractical for the Allies to continue their offensive in early 1945.
