London: Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980. {{ISBN|0-413-46950-6}}.</ref> Series 1 comprised three episodes. Subsequent series were broadcast on the [[BBC Light Programme]] (relaunched as [[BBC Radio 2]] in September 1967).  Series 2 (1965) had nine episodes, and series 3 through 8 (from 1966 through 1970) each had thirteen episodes. After a three-year hiatus the ninth, final series was transmitted in November and December 1973, with eight episodes. An hour-long 25th anniversary show was broadcast in 1989, comically introduced as \"full frontal radio\". \n\nThe title of the show comes from a sentence commonly used by BBC newsreaders following an on-air [[blooper|flub]]: \"I'm sorry, I'll read that again.\"  Having the phrase used to recover from a mistake as the title of the show set the tone for the series as an irreverent and loosely produced comedy show.<ref name=\"home.clara.co.uk\"/>\n\n''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] panel game show, was first produced in 1972.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] (later one of the three members of ''[[The Goodies]]''). He wrote humorous books on various subjects, including cricket and golf. He was a member of the cast of the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]], and later appeared in Feldman's television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]''. He acted in many other television sitcoms, and appeared in the 1970s BBC radio sketch show ''[[Hello, Cheeky!]]'' with [[John Junkin]] and [[Barry Cryer]], later translated to ITV.  He died in 2020, aged 79.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n*[[John Cleese]] (later part of [[Monty Python]] and star of ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''; formed his own production company [[Video Arts]] to make business training films, which contained much Python-esque/Basil Fawlty-style humour, as well as making films including ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' and ''[[Fierce Creatures]]''). On the 25th anniversary show he did his famous silly walk \u2014 it made terrible radio \u2014 and sang \"The Ferret Song\". He appeared in ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' with Tim Brooke-Taylor, [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]], and was co-writer with Graham Chapman of several episodes of the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series. In later series Cleese was often absent, due to his appearances in ''Monty Python''; in the sleeve notes to the BBC's re-issues of the shows on cassette, his absences were explained as \"[having] ranting commitments elsewhere\".\n*[[Graeme Garden]] (also one of the three members of ''[[The Goodies]]''). A qualified medical doctor, Garden was co-writer with Bill Oddie of several episodes of the medical comedy ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' on ITV (appearing in the episode \"Doctor on the Box\" as a television presenter). He also appeared as Commander Forrest in the ''[[Yes Minister]]'' television episode \"The Death List\".  He was a member of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' from the start.  At the same time, he was studying medicine in London. Because he did a midwifery medical course in [[Plymouth]], he was unable to be a member of the cast of ''ISIRTA'' during the third series, due to the distance between London and Plymouth which made commuting to record the shows impossible. However, Graeme kept sending scripts for the radio show by mail - and rejoined the cast upon his return to his medical studies in London.\n*[[David Hatch]] (who went on to executive positions within the [[BBC]], including the top position of [[Controller (BBC)|Controller]] of [[BBC Radio 4]]), as was common in BBC radio at that time, served both as the show's announcer and as a cast member (similar to [[Douglas Smith (broadcaster)|Douglas Smith]]'s role in ''[[Round the Horne]]''; Hatch however did give his roles some characterisation, in contrast to Smith's totally deadpan style). Hatch's announcements were frequently lampooned or interrupted by other cast members. In the 25th Anniversary special, Hatch invited the audience to join them again in 25 years time - ironically, by 2014 Hatch, who died in 2007, was the only cast member to have died.\n*[[Jo Kendall]] (a radio actress in many straight dramas subsequently; also appeared in the equally popular radio comedy series ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'').  She also guest starred (as the voice of The Queen) in ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' 1980 episode \"[[Goodies and Politics]]\".\n*[[Bill Oddie]] (also one of the three members of ''[[The Goodies]]''). He has written many books, and has been an important spokesman on wildlife and ecological issues since the 1980s. Bill Oddie wrote and performed a daft but well-crafted song in the middle of most ''ISIRTA'' programmes. He was co-writer (with Graeme Garden) of several episodes of the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series.\n*[[Humphrey Barclay]] was the producer of ''ISIRTA'' until 1968; from April that year the task was shared by [[David Hatch]] and [[Peter Titherage]]. In 1973, production was shared by David Hatch with [[John Cassels (radio producer)|John Cassels]] (for six episodes) and with [[Bob Oliver Rodgers]] (for two episodes).\n*Music for the links and songs was provided by Dave Lee and his band.\n\n==Influence==\nAs well as giving rise to [[The Goodies]] team, ISIRTA shows the roots of the [[Monty Python]] team very clearly, with Cleese, Chapman and Eric Idle all regular script contributors. The show's creator Humphrey Barclay went on to create the TV show ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', featuring the rest of the Python team, as well as Idle.\n\n''ISIRTA''{{'}}s roots can be traced back to classic radio comedies like ''[[It's That Man Again|ITMA]]'', ''[[The Goon Show]]'', and ''Round the Horne''.\n\nAs with ''[[Round the Horne]]'', the cast's adventures would sometimes be episodic with cliff-hanger endings each week as with \"The Curse of the Flying Wombat\" (3rd series), and \"Professor Prune And The Electric Time Trousers\" (7th series). Christmas specials normally included a spoof of a traditional [[pantomime]] (or several combined). They had few qualms about the use of puns \u2013 old, strained or inventive \u2013 and included some jokes and catchphrases that would seem politically incorrect by the mid-1990s. Garden's impressions of the legendary rugby league commentator [[Eddie Waring]] and the popular Scottish TV presenter [[Fyfe Robertson]], Oddie's frequent send-ups of the game-show host [[Hughie Green]], and Cleese's occasional but manic impressions of [[Patrick Moore]] (astronomer and broadcaster) built these people into eccentric celebrities in a way that the [[Mike Yarwood]], [[Rory Bremner]], ''[[Spitting Image]]'' and ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' programmes did for other TV presenters with similar disrespect years later.\n\nAs the only woman on the show, Jo Kendall voiced all the female characters (with the exception of Brooke-Taylor's oversexed harridan, Lady Constance de Coverlet) and demonstrated a tremendous range and versatility, which occasionally extended into having conversations with herself in different voices. Kendall also wrote some of her own material. She was the first female performer in British radio comedy to have (and deserve) equal top billing with male stars in a male-dominated series.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe show ended with an unchanging sign-off song, which Bill Oddie performed as \"Angus Prune\" and was referred to by the announcer as \"The Angus Prune Tune\". Spoof dramas were billed as Prune Playhouse and many parodies of commercial radio were badged as Radio Prune, but the name ''Angus Prune'' seemed as random and incidental as the name ''Monty Python'', which appeared several years later.\n\nAlthough earlier BBC radio shows such as ''[[Much Binding in the Marsh]]'', ''[[Take It From Here]]'', and ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'' had conditioned listeners to a mix of music, sketches and jokes in a 30-minute show, and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' was also doing this, ''ISIRTA'' accelerated the transitions, and it certainly seemed more improvised. It was one of those programmes where the listener was unlikely to get all the jokes on first hearing, so would have to listen to the scheduled repeat (or a tape recording) to discover what they had missed. It thus helped prepare the television audience for ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', [[Spike Milligan]]'s ''[[Q (TV series)|Q]]'' series, ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', and ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''. It also may have influenced other spoof-based British radio programmes such as ''[[Radio Active (radio series)|Radio Active]]'', ''[[On the Hour]]'', ''[[The Sunday Format]]'', ''[[The News Huddlines]]'', and later ''[[Bleak Expectations]]''.\n\n==Repeats and spinoffs==\nSeveral cast members appeared in the radio comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', a spinoff from ''ISIRTA'' that has outlived it by decades. Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor continued as regulars on the show.\n\nAll series of ''ISIRTA'' have been rebroadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] (available on digital television, DAB digital radio and the web), though some episodes (series 8 episode 2, and series 9 episodes 5 & 6) were not transmitted due to potentially offensive content. Listeners in Australia occasionally find ''ISIRTA'' in the 5.30am vintage comedy timeslot on ABC [[Radio National]] (available on the web to overseas listeners).\n\nIn 2015, plans were announced for a live \"Best Of\" homage show, using material by Garden and Oddie, and performed by Hannah Boydell, David Clarke, Barnaby Eaton-Jones, William KV Browne and Ben Perkins.<ref>{{Cite web|title = I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again... again : News 2015 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|url = http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2015/11/16/23602/im_sorry_ill_read_that_again..._again|website = www.chortle.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}</ref> The show was a sell-out success at The Bacon Theatre, Cheltenham in February 2016 and a tour was licensed by Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie to the same company, the Offstage Theatre Group.   In February 2017, it was announced that the British tour would take place later in the year, with guest appearances by Garden, Oddie and Jo Kendall.<ref>{{Cite web|title = I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again is back : News 2015 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|url = http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/02/07/26802/im_sorry_ill_read_that_again_is_back|website = www.chortle.co.uk|accessdate = 2017-02-22}}</ref> In 2019 three new episodes with the slightly modified title \"I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again... Again\" were recorded and broadcast on Radio 4 Extra with some original cast including Tim Brooke Taylor, together with newer performers such as Barnaby Eaton-Jones.\n\n==Catchphrases==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}{{fanpov|section|date=December 2014}}\n* \"I'm sorry, I'll read that again\" &ndash; a frequent interruption to mock news broadcasts on the show \u2013 the line often reads \"Here is the news. I'm sorry, I'll read that again: Here ''are'' the news.\"\n* \"[[Rhubarb tart]]?\" A delicacy much loved by all the cast members and often used as a bribe during sketches. [[David Hatch]] famously leaves the University of the Air during a Julius Caesar spoof lecture after [[Bill Oddie]]'s flip remarks, only to be coaxed back with offers of rhubarb tart. It is also Angus Prune's favourite dish. In the \"Ali Baba\" sketch in the 3rd series, Cleese appears as [[Omar Khayyam]]; he remarks to Ali Baba, played by Brooke-Taylor, \"Surely you've heard of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rhubarb Tart of Omar Khayyam]]''?\" There were also two \"Rhubarb Tart\" songs, one sung by Cleese, which he also sang in ''At Last the 1948 Show'', and one sung by Oddie, which became \"The Custard Pie Song\" in the TV series ''The Goodies''.\n* The Tillingbourne Folk and Madrigal Society. A recurring parody of English ''[[a cappella]]'' folk music ([[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]). The Society performed a range of songs from a medley of [[football chant]]s through to the never-ending folk song \"There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May.\" They also presented a version of \"[[House of the Rising Sun]],\" with Graeme Garden singing a fairly straight version of the song and the rest of the group providing highly mannered interjections, such as \"tiddly-pom\" and \"whack-fol-riddle-me-o.\" Yet, despite the whimsy, it was clear that the cast members were very capable singers.\n* \"I'm the king rat!\" Generally said very over-dramatically by John Cleese, on which the rest of the cast would reply, \"Oh, no you're not!\" This was later referenced in a Monty Python sketch at a \"hospital for over-actors.\"\n* \"The Angus Prune Tune\". Written by Bill Oddie with lyrics by Humphrey Barclay and performed by Bill Oddie (often with considerable audience involvement), this was the sign-off song for the series. In a retrospective show called ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, Again'' broadcast on BBC Radio 4Extra in March 2013 to celebrate 50 years of ''ISIRTA'', Bill Oddie said that the lyrics had been written by Humphrey Barclay. The full text runs as follows:\n*:My name is Angus Prune\n*:and I always listen to I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again\n*::(You Don't!)\n*:My name is Angus Prune\n*:and I never miss I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again\n*::(Get Away!)\n*:I sit in my bath\n*:And I have a good laugh\n*:Cause the theme tune is named after me\n*::(Tell us yer name!)\n*:My name is Angus Prune\n*:And this is my tune\n*:It goes I-S-I-R-T-A\n*:I'm Sorry I'll Read That AGAIN!'\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth]]. The famous opening bars of this piece of music are constantly used in the series, usually in inappropriate settings; their first appearance was in the first sketch of the pilot programme in 1963, and during an ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' spoof in the 3rd series Bill Oddie tries to tap-dance to them in what sound like hob-nailed boots. David Hatch once introduced the cast: \"...with another of their sallies forth \u2013 (GRAMS: 'Da-da-da-dummmmm') \u2013 or Beethoven's Fifth \u2013\" On another occasion, the pre-show teaser was Beethoven, played by Brooke-Taylor, trying to get Bill Oddie, playing a stereotypically Jewish-sounding music publisher, to market the tune.  After hearing the tune, Oddie says: \"That's a load of old rubbish!\" and then twists the melody to form the opening sig. The closing bars of the final movement of the symphony were used to introduce a 'promenade concert' that featured \"There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May\" \u2013 Hatch says solemnly in his best BBC voice: \"That was the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. Now, while they're getting up ...\"\n* \"The Ferret Song\". [[John Cleese]] has an obsession with ferrets throughout the show, including his performance of \"The Ferret Song\". This song begins with the line \"I've got a ferret sticking up my nose.\" The line is repeated, then: \"How it got there I can't tell, but now it's there, it hurts like hell and, what is more, it radically affects my sense of smell,\" \u2013 and promptly gets even worse. The song, written by John Cleese and [[Graham Chapman]], was included in ''The Fairly Incomplete and Rather Badly Illustrated Monty Python Song Book'', accompanied by a picture of Cleese with a [[Terry Jones]]-shaped ferret up his nose.\n* The Silly [[Roll Call]]. During many of the longer adventures, the cast engage in the Silly Roll Call, where a series of words (sometimes appropriate to their adventure) are turned into people's names in the vein of an inverted [[knock-knock joke]]. The \"[[Jack the Ripper]]\" story involves criminals such as \"Mr. and Mrs. Ree ... and their son ... [[Robbery|Robby Ree]] ... and his cousin from the Far East, Ahmed Robby Ree; Mr. and Mrs. Nee, their Swedish son [[Larceny|Lars Nee]] .. and his sister Betty Lars Nee; and Mr. and Mrs. Sittingforimmoralpurposes...and their son...Solly Sittingforimmoralpurposes\". In \"Jorrocks\", the Hunt Ball features appearances by \"Lord and Lady V'syouyeahyeahyeah and their daughter [[She Loves You|Sheila V'syouyeahyeahyeah]]\" as well as \"Lord and Lady Umeeroffen and their son Duke Umeeroffen\". Even the Ancient Greek world of [[Oedipus]] is not sacred \u2013 [[Socrates]] appears with Knobblyknees, [[Euripides]] with Iripadose, [[Antigone]] and Uncle-igone, and the treble of [[Aristophanes]], Hoiteetoitees and Afternoonteas (as well as a barrage of rotten fruit). The idea of the Silly Roll Call was revived in ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', the final game of the show often being some variant of the \"[[List of games on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue#Late Arrivals (at a society ball)|Late Arrivals (at a society ball)]]\" where the same sort of \"silly names\" would be announced by each of the players in turn.\n* The [[gibbon]]. Whenever a generic animal is required for a sketch, the team always used a gibbon. Every mention of the gibbon usually raises cheers from the audience. This is often expanded to ludicrous lengths, such as a \"Gibbon-Fanciers' Club\". [[Edward Gibbon]]'s famous ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' is rendered as \"''Decline and Fall of the Roman Gibbon'', by Edward Empire\". [[Stanley Gibbons]]' Stamp Catalogue became known as ''Stanley Stamps' Gibbon Catalogue''. Later, during ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''' heyday in the 1970s, Brooke-Taylor, Garden, and Oddie had a Top Ten hit with \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\", which reached #4, and they sang live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', and during ''The Goodies'' episode \"[[The Goodies \u2013 Almost Live]]\". In ''The Goodies'' episode \"[[That Old Black Magic (The Goodies)|That Old Black Magic]]\", Graeme Garden acts like an ape to the accompaniment of the Bill Oddie song \"Stuff The Gibbon\" \u2014 and in another ''Goodies'' episode, \"[[Radio Goodies]]\", the small boat above their pirate radio submarine is called \"The Saucy Gibbon\". A track on [[Soft Machine]]'s ''[[Six (Soft Machine album)|Six]]'' album entitled \"Stanley Stamp's Gibbon Album\" is dedicated to Bill Oddie.\n* The [[Terrapin]], which appears occasionally. In one show, after a particularly macabre John Cleese monologue, Hatch sends him packing, whereupon the rest of the cast defect with Cleese and form Radio Terrapin in competition to Radio Prune. In another show, Bill performs \"The Terrapin Song\", and on another show, Hatch announces a terrapin joke, as follows: (Garden) \"Who was that Terrapin I saw you with last night?\" (Brooke-Taylor) \"That was no terrapin, that was our old school mistress \u2013 she tortoise (taught us).\"\n* Bill Oddie's accent. Having a [[Brummie|Birmingham accent]] (although born in Rochdale in Lancashire, he grew up in Birmingham) made Oddie the butt of many jokes, as well as leading him naturally towards many roles in sketches where someone was required to speak incomprehensibly. He got his own back in the \"Lawrence Of Arabia On Ice\" sketch, when he appeared as Nanook of the North, complete with a plethora of cod-Lancastrian patois (\"ee bah goom\", \"black puddings\", \"ecky thump\", etc.) This became the basis for an episode of ''[[The Goodies]]'' where \"Ecky Thump\" was a secret Lancastrian [[martial art]], the episode parodying the then-popular TV show ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''.\n* The Old Jokes Home. The old jokes, of which there were many (see script below) were sometimes sent to the Old Jokes Home.\n* 'Spot'. References to \"a spot of brandy\", \"my favourite spot\", etc., were usually followed by a canine yelp from Bill Oddie, attributed to \"Spot the Dog\". Spot became an audience favourite, and made at least one appearance in each episode.\n* [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]. Characters often have OBE added to the end of their name. It is also added to places, objects and names, as well as an interruption, e.g. in \"The Angus Prune (OBE) Song\". The cast occasionally ask for one (\"Thank you ma'am, I'll take the OBE if it's offered\") or decline one that's been offered (\"No thanks, I'm trying to give them up\"). On one occasion, Hatch introduced the team as \"Tim Brooke-Taylor, O.B.E., John Cleese, O.B.E., Graeme Garden, O.B.E., David Hatch, O.B.E., Jo Kendall, O.B.E., and Bill Oddie, O.D.D.I.E.\" On another occasion, in a send-up of the Honours List, Hatch announces that a particular person has been made an earl, and also has been awarded the OBE; he therefore becomes an earlobe (this joke was also used in ''[[The Goodies]]'' series seven episode \"[[Royal Command]]\").\n*: David Hatch was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1994 and was knighted in 2003, Bill Oddie was awarded the OBE also in 2003, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were appointed OBE in 2011, but John Cleese declined a CBE in 1996.

Continually sends memos to the ''ISIRTA'' team with the most ridiculous requests. One week, he decides that \"Radio Prune\" will become a music channel, a rival to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]. His reason is \"We at the [[BBC]] may be very, very silly, but we can write letters\". He is constantly offended by the contents of the show.\n;North American Continuity Man\n: is a parody of [[Hughie Green]] usually played by Oddie, although on one occasion, in the 3rd series, he is voiced by Garden. His [[catchphrase]]s include \"Thank-you, Thank-you\" and \"Wasn't that just great?\" Invariably, when he hands over to Kendall for details of the Prune Play of the Week, she refers to him by another personality's name \u2013 Simon (Dee), Jimmy (Young, or possibly Savile), David (Frost), or Eamonn (Andrews). On one occasion, after Kendall announces the title of the Prune Play of the Week ''Jorrocks: The Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man'' (or a man-hunting fox....), by Stanley Stamps, author of Stanley Stamps' Gibbon catalogue, Bill/Hughie says to the audience, \"So will you please put your hands together ... and pray ....\"\n;Angus Prune\n: is a character adopted by Bill Oddie to sing the playoff.\n;Grimbling\n:Voiced by Bill Oddie, Grimbling is a \"dirty old man\" who often appears as a groundsman, butler, or some similar profession. Due to the limitations of an audio-only medium, the true nature of Grimbling is never revealed, but he is greeted with universal revulsion by all bar the audience. He memorably introduces himself in the 25th anniversary episode \"I am Grimbling, but don't worry, I'll clean it up later.\" In the same episode, Cleese asks him \"Aren't you a little past it, old man?\" with the response, \"No, I'm a little dirty old man\". In the \"Robin Hood\" sketch in the 3rd series, Grimbling is in the employ of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Garden), who tells him, \"You have done well, Grimbling; take this tennis racquet for your services\".\n;Lady Constance de Coverlet\n: is a ridiculous female character who was played by the late [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]. Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement along the lines of \"what is that coming towards us? \u2013 It's huge \u2013 It's a rhinoceros!\" \u2013 \"No, it's me!!!\"  and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\", and always by thunderous cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the \"Henry VIII\" sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen.  Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: \"..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own \u2013 and there's enough to go round \u2013 twice -...\".  In the \"Dentisti\" sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series ''[[Daktari]]'', Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in \"Jack The Ripper\", Lady Constance is invited to: \"please, sit down anywhere ... or in your case, everywhere\". In the \"Radio Prune Greek Tragedy\" sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex \u2013 according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog \u2013 and  she tells Oedipus: \"Now let me get on with my housework, I've got a little behind ..\" (pause for the ''[[double-entendre]]'' to register) \".. oh all right, I've got a colossal behind!!\"  In the \"Colditz\" sketch, the lads' escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims \"She's like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!\". She also in her own way is a bit of a [[hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] \u2013 she's described in the 25th anniversary show version of \"Jack The Ripper\" as a steaming volcano of eroticism \u2013 and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the \"3.17 to Cleethorpes\" sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, \"Yes, and then what?\", Lady Constance replies, \"Well, that's rather up to you ....\"\n;Mr Arnold Totteridge\n:Another famous recurring character, Arnold Totteridge (played by Garden) is a doddering old man who gets lost in the middle of his sentences. He invariably begins with: \"How do you do, do you do, do you do...do you?\" and after rambling incoherently for a few minutes returns to where he started. His most famous moment is in the 25th anniversary episode, where he has been appointed \"The Dynamic new-de-oo-do-de-oo-do-de-oo Head of Radio-do-do-de-do Comedy\"\n;John and Mary\n: John Cleese and Jo Kendall frequently performed poignant \u2013 almost romantic \u2013 dialogues as the respectable but dysfunctional couple \"John and Mary\", a forerunner of the relationship between Basil and Sybil in ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. They bear a passing resemblance to Fiona and Charles of ''[[Round the Horne]]''.\n;Masher Wilkins\n:A kind-hearted simpleton (played by John Cleese), who often appears as an unlikely villain or henchman. He is prone to malapropisms: \"I've been trailing you through this impenetrable ferret-- I mean 'forest'\" - but these are often the intro to clever running jokes - in this case the line continues: \"Oh no, not ferret, I mean stoat\". \"Stoat?\"  \"Yes, 'stoatally impenetrable\". At some point, a female character would often call out \"Oh, Masher, Masher!\" - followed by a chorus of [[Ring a Ring o' Roses|\"All fall down!\"]] by the remaining cast. In one show, the topic on ''The Money Programme'' is fiscal policy and other matters monetary, and Masher asks some very abstruse questions about the Bank of England and its role in the economy. His last question, however is: 'An' wot's the combination o' de safe: oooh wot a giveaway!!'\n\n==Prune Plays==\nWriters and cast in order of appearance:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n;''Robin Hood''\n: Written by Graeme Garden and John Cleese\n: Story narration \u2013 sung by David Hatch\n: 'Curtain' \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Maid Marion \u2013 Jo Kendall\n: Friar Tuck \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Robin Hood \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Alan 'a Gabriel \u2013 Graeme Garden\n: Will Scarlet \u2013 David Hatch\n: Little John \u2013 John Cleese\n: Sir Angus of the Prune \u2013 John Cleese\n: Grimbling (the Bailiff) \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Sheriff of Nottingham \u2013 Graeme Garden\n: Master of Ceremonies for the 'Archery Competition'&nbsp;\u2013 John Cleese\n: Deputy Sheriff \u2013 Graeme Garden\n{{Col-break}}\n;''The Curse of the Flying Wombat''\n: Written by Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie\n: 'King Lear' \u2013 John Cleese\n: Tim Brown-Windsor \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Mr. Hatch \u2013 David Hatch\n: Lady Fiona Rabbit-Vacuum (Jim-Lad) \u2013 Jo Kendall\n: Captain Cleese \u2013 John Cleese\n: 'Lookout' \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Casey O'Sullivan \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Masher Wilkins \u2013 John Cleese\n: Maisie Robinson (the International Temptress)&nbsp;\u2013 Jo Kendall\n: Grimbling (Butler to Tim's Aunt) \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Lady Constance de Coverlet \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: \"Hurricane\" Flossie (Lady Constance's identical twin sister)&nbsp;\u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Slave-girl trader \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Colonel Clutch-Featheringhaugh \u2013 David Hatch\n: Nosebone (the Great White Hunter) \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Wong (the Supply-keeper) \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Wong Tu (his brother) \u2013 John Cleese\n: 'Armand' \u2013 Bill Oddie\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==''ISIRTA'' songs==\n{{main|ISIRTA songs}}\n\nComedy songs replaced traditional songs during episodes.\n\n==Notes==\n''ISIRTA'' is referenced in [[The Goodies]]'s episode ''[[Chubbie Chumps]]'', where the initials are printed on the wall in chalk.\n\n\"Spot the dog\" is referenced in The Goodies's episode ''[[Camelot (The Goodies)|Camelot]]'' as the royal dog \"Spot\", where it received an immediate cheer.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* [http://www.bennewsam.co.uk/ISIRTA.html ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (Ben Newsam)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930072202/http://www.otrtoday.com/lists/imsorrylist.htm ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (OTR Today, archived)]\n* [http://epguides.com/ISIRTA/ ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (Titles & Air Dates)]\n* [http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=106264 ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (Everything2)]\n* Roberts, Jem.

London: Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980. {{ISBN|0-413-46950-6}}.</ref> Series 1 comprised three episodes. Subsequent series were broadcast on the [[BBC Light Programme]] (relaunched as [[BBC Radio 2]] in September 1967).  Series 2 (1965) had nine episodes, and series 3 through 8 (from 1966 through 1970) each had thirteen episodes. After a three-year hiatus the ninth, final series was transmitted in November and December 1973, with eight episodes. An hour-long 25th anniversary show was broadcast in 1989, comically introduced as \"full frontal radio\". \n\nThe title of the show comes from a sentence commonly used by BBC newsreaders following an on-air [[blooper|flub]]: \"I'm sorry, I'll read that again.\"  Having the phrase used to recover from a mistake as the title of the show set the tone for the series as an irreverent and loosely produced comedy show.<ref name=\"home.clara.co.uk\"/>\n\n''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] panel game show, was first produced in 1972.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] (later one of the three members of ''[[The Goodies]]''). He wrote humorous books on various subjects, including cricket and golf. He was a member of the cast of the television comedy series ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' with [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]], and later appeared in Feldman's television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]''. He acted in many other television sitcoms, and appeared in the 1970s BBC radio sketch show ''[[Hello, Cheeky!]]'' with [[John Junkin]] and [[Barry Cryer]], later translated to ITV.  He died in 2020, aged 79.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n*[[John Cleese]] (later part of [[Monty Python]] and star of ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''; formed his own production company [[Video Arts]] to make business training films, which contained much Python-esque/Basil Fawlty-style humour, as well as making films including ''[[A Fish Called Wanda]]'' and ''[[Fierce Creatures]]''). On the 25th anniversary show he did his famous silly walk \u2014 it made terrible radio \u2014 and sang \"The Ferret Song\". He appeared in ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' with Tim Brooke-Taylor, [[Graham Chapman]] and [[Marty Feldman]], and was co-writer with Graham Chapman of several episodes of the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series. In later series Cleese was often absent, due to his appearances in ''Monty Python''; in the sleeve notes to the BBC's re-issues of the shows on cassette, his absences were explained as \"[having] ranting commitments elsewhere\".\n*[[Graeme Garden]] (also one of the three members of ''[[The Goodies]]''). A qualified medical doctor, Garden was co-writer with Bill Oddie of several episodes of the medical comedy ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' on ITV (appearing in the episode \"Doctor on the Box\" as a television presenter). He also appeared as Commander Forrest in the ''[[Yes Minister]]'' television episode \"The Death List\".  He was a member of ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' from the start.  At the same time, he was studying medicine in London. Because he did a midwifery medical course in [[Plymouth]], he was unable to be a member of the cast of ''ISIRTA'' during the third series, due to the distance between London and Plymouth which made commuting to record the shows impossible. However, Graeme kept sending scripts for the radio show by mail - and rejoined the cast upon his return to his medical studies in London.\n*[[David Hatch]] (who went on to executive positions within the [[BBC]], including the top position of [[Controller (BBC)|Controller]] of [[BBC Radio 4]]), as was common in BBC radio at that time, served both as the show's announcer and as a cast member (similar to [[Douglas Smith (broadcaster)|Douglas Smith]]'s role in ''[[Round the Horne]]''; Hatch however did give his roles some characterisation, in contrast to Smith's totally deadpan style). Hatch's announcements were frequently lampooned or interrupted by other cast members. In the 25th Anniversary special, Hatch invited the audience to join them again in 25 years time - ironically, by 2014 Hatch, who died in 2007, was the only cast member to have died.\n*[[Jo Kendall]] (a radio actress in many straight dramas subsequently; also appeared in the equally popular radio comedy series ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'').  She also guest starred (as the voice of The Queen) in ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' 1980 episode \"[[Goodies and Politics]]\".\n*[[Bill Oddie]] (also one of the three members of ''[[The Goodies]]''). He has written many books, and has been an important spokesman on wildlife and ecological issues since the 1980s. Bill Oddie wrote and performed a daft but well-crafted song in the middle of most ''ISIRTA'' programmes. He was co-writer (with Graeme Garden) of several episodes of the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series.\n*[[Humphrey Barclay]] was the producer of ''ISIRTA'' until 1968; from April that year the task was shared by [[David Hatch]] and [[Peter Titherage]]. In 1973, production was shared by David Hatch with [[John Cassels (radio producer)|John Cassels]] (for six episodes) and with [[Bob Oliver Rodgers]] (for two episodes).\n*Music for the links and songs was provided by Dave Lee and his band.\n\n==Influence==\nAs well as giving rise to [[The Goodies]] team, ISIRTA shows the roots of the [[Monty Python]] team very clearly, with Cleese, Chapman and Eric Idle all regular script contributors. The show's creator Humphrey Barclay went on to create the TV show ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', featuring the rest of the Python team, as well as Idle.\n\n''ISIRTA''{{'}}s roots can be traced back to classic radio comedies like ''[[It's That Man Again|ITMA]]'', ''[[The Goon Show]]'', and ''Round the Horne''.\n\nAs with ''[[Round the Horne]]'', the cast's adventures would sometimes be episodic with cliff-hanger endings each week as with \"The Curse of the Flying Wombat\" (3rd series), and \"Professor Prune And The Electric Time Trousers\" (7th series). Christmas specials normally included a spoof of a traditional [[pantomime]] (or several combined). They had few qualms about the use of puns \u2013 old, strained or inventive \u2013 and included some jokes and catchphrases that would seem politically incorrect by the mid-1990s. Garden's impressions of the legendary rugby league commentator [[Eddie Waring]] and the popular Scottish TV presenter [[Fyfe Robertson]], Oddie's frequent send-ups of the game-show host [[Hughie Green]], and Cleese's occasional but manic impressions of [[Patrick Moore]] (astronomer and broadcaster) built these people into eccentric celebrities in a way that the [[Mike Yarwood]], [[Rory Bremner]], ''[[Spitting Image]]'' and ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' programmes did for other TV presenters with similar disrespect years later.\n\nAs the only woman on the show, Jo Kendall voiced all the female characters (with the exception of Brooke-Taylor's oversexed harridan, Lady Constance de Coverlet) and demonstrated a tremendous range and versatility, which occasionally extended into having conversations with herself in different voices. Kendall also wrote some of her own material. She was the first female performer in British radio comedy to have (and deserve) equal top billing with male stars in a male-dominated series.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe show ended with an unchanging sign-off song, which Bill Oddie performed as \"Angus Prune\" and was referred to by the announcer as \"The Angus Prune Tune\". Spoof dramas were billed as Prune Playhouse and many parodies of commercial radio were badged as Radio Prune, but the name ''Angus Prune'' seemed as random and incidental as the name ''Monty Python'', which appeared several years later.\n\nAlthough earlier BBC radio shows such as ''[[Much Binding in the Marsh]]'', ''[[Take It From Here]]'', and ''[[Beyond Our Ken]]'' had conditioned listeners to a mix of music, sketches and jokes in a 30-minute show, and ''[[Round the Horne]]'' was also doing this, ''ISIRTA'' accelerated the transitions, and it certainly seemed more improvised. It was one of those programmes where the listener was unlikely to get all the jokes on first hearing, so would have to listen to the scheduled repeat (or a tape recording) to discover what they had missed. It thus helped prepare the television audience for ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'', [[Spike Milligan]]'s ''[[Q (TV series)|Q]]'' series, ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', and ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''. It also may have influenced other spoof-based British radio programmes such as ''[[Radio Active (radio series)|Radio Active]]'', ''[[On the Hour]]'', ''[[The Sunday Format]]'', ''[[The News Huddlines]]'', and later ''[[Bleak Expectations]]''.\n\n==Repeats and spinoffs==\nSeveral cast members appeared in the radio comedy panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', a spinoff from ''ISIRTA'' that has outlived it by decades. Graeme Garden and Tim Brooke-Taylor continued as regulars on the show.\n\nAll series of ''ISIRTA'' have been rebroadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] (available on digital television, DAB digital radio and the web), though some episodes (series 8 episode 2, and series 9 episodes 5 & 6) were not transmitted due to potentially offensive content. Listeners in Australia occasionally find ''ISIRTA'' in the 5.30am vintage comedy timeslot on ABC [[Radio National]] (available on the web to overseas listeners).\n\nIn 2015, plans were announced for a live \"Best Of\" homage show, using material by Garden and Oddie, and performed by Hannah Boydell, David Clarke, Barnaby Eaton-Jones, William KV Browne and Ben Perkins.<ref>{{Cite web|title = I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again... again : News 2015 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|url = http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2015/11/16/23602/im_sorry_ill_read_that_again..._again|website = www.chortle.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}</ref> The show was a sell-out success at The Bacon Theatre, Cheltenham in February 2016 and a tour was licensed by Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie to the same company, the Offstage Theatre Group.   In February 2017, it was announced that the British tour would take place later in the year, with guest appearances by Garden, Oddie and Jo Kendall.<ref>{{Cite web|title = I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again is back : News 2015 : Chortle : The UK Comedy Guide|url = http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/02/07/26802/im_sorry_ill_read_that_again_is_back|website = www.chortle.co.uk|accessdate = 2017-02-22}}</ref> In 2019 three new episodes with the slightly modified title \"I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again... Again\" were recorded and broadcast on Radio 4 Extra with some original cast including Tim Brooke Taylor, together with newer performers such as Barnaby Eaton-Jones.\n\n==Catchphrases==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}{{fanpov|section|date=December 2014}}\n* \"I'm sorry, I'll read that again\" &ndash; a frequent interruption to mock news broadcasts on the show \u2013 the line often reads \"Here is the news. I'm sorry, I'll read that again: Here ''are'' the news.\"\n* \"[[Rhubarb tart]]?\" A delicacy much loved by all the cast members and often used as a bribe during sketches. [[David Hatch]] famously leaves the University of the Air during a Julius Caesar spoof lecture after [[Bill Oddie]]'s flip remarks, only to be coaxed back with offers of rhubarb tart. It is also Angus Prune's favourite dish. In the \"Ali Baba\" sketch in the 3rd series, Cleese appears as [[Omar Khayyam]]; he remarks to Ali Baba, played by Brooke-Taylor, \"Surely you've heard of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rhubarb Tart of Omar Khayyam]]''?\" There were also two \"Rhubarb Tart\" songs, one sung by Cleese, which he also sang in ''At Last the 1948 Show'', and one sung by Oddie, which became \"The Custard Pie Song\" in the TV series ''The Goodies''.\n* The Tillingbourne Folk and Madrigal Society. A recurring parody of English ''[[a cappella]]'' folk music ([[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]). The Society performed a range of songs from a medley of [[football chant]]s through to the never-ending folk song \"There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May.\" They also presented a version of \"[[House of the Rising Sun]],\" with Graeme Garden singing a fairly straight version of the song and the rest of the group providing highly mannered interjections, such as \"tiddly-pom\" and \"whack-fol-riddle-me-o.\" Yet, despite the whimsy, it was clear that the cast members were very capable singers.\n* \"I'm the king rat!\" Generally said very over-dramatically by John Cleese, on which the rest of the cast would reply, \"Oh, no you're not!\" This was later referenced in a Monty Python sketch at a \"hospital for over-actors.\"\n* \"The Angus Prune Tune\". Written by Bill Oddie with lyrics by Humphrey Barclay and performed by Bill Oddie (often with considerable audience involvement), this was the sign-off song for the series. In a retrospective show called ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again, Again'' broadcast on BBC Radio 4Extra in March 2013 to celebrate 50 years of ''ISIRTA'', Bill Oddie said that the lyrics had been written by Humphrey Barclay. The full text runs as follows:\n*:My name is Angus Prune\n*:and I always listen to I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again\n*::(You Don't!)\n*:My name is Angus Prune\n*:and I never miss I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again\n*::(Get Away!)\n*:I sit in my bath\n*:And I have a good laugh\n*:Cause the theme tune is named after me\n*::(Tell us yer name!)\n*:My name is Angus Prune\n*:And this is my tune\n*:It goes I-S-I-R-T-A\n*:I'm Sorry I'll Read That AGAIN!'\n* [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Fifth]]. The famous opening bars of this piece of music are constantly used in the series, usually in inappropriate settings; their first appearance was in the first sketch of the pilot programme in 1963, and during an ''[[Opportunity Knocks (UK TV series)|Opportunity Knocks]]'' spoof in the 3rd series Bill Oddie tries to tap-dance to them in what sound like hob-nailed boots. David Hatch once introduced the cast: \"...with another of their sallies forth \u2013 (GRAMS: 'Da-da-da-dummmmm') \u2013 or Beethoven's Fifth \u2013\" On another occasion, the pre-show teaser was Beethoven, played by Brooke-Taylor, trying to get Bill Oddie, playing a stereotypically Jewish-sounding music publisher, to market the tune.  After hearing the tune, Oddie says: \"That's a load of old rubbish!\" and then twists the melody to form the opening sig. The closing bars of the final movement of the symphony were used to introduce a 'promenade concert' that featured \"There was a Ship that put to Sea all in the Month of May\" \u2013 Hatch says solemnly in his best BBC voice: \"That was the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra under Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. Now, while they're getting up ...\"\n* \"The Ferret Song\". [[John Cleese]] has an obsession with ferrets throughout the show, including his performance of \"The Ferret Song\". This song begins with the line \"I've got a ferret sticking up my nose.\" The line is repeated, then: \"How it got there I can't tell, but now it's there, it hurts like hell and, what is more, it radically affects my sense of smell,\" \u2013 and promptly gets even worse. The song, written by John Cleese and [[Graham Chapman]], was included in ''The Fairly Incomplete and Rather Badly Illustrated Monty Python Song Book'', accompanied by a picture of Cleese with a [[Terry Jones]]-shaped ferret up his nose.\n* The Silly [[Roll Call]]. During many of the longer adventures, the cast engage in the Silly Roll Call, where a series of words (sometimes appropriate to their adventure) are turned into people's names in the vein of an inverted [[knock-knock joke]]. The \"[[Jack the Ripper]]\" story involves criminals such as \"Mr. and Mrs. Ree ... and their son ... [[Robbery|Robby Ree]] ... and his cousin from the Far East, Ahmed Robby Ree; Mr. and Mrs. Nee, their Swedish son [[Larceny|Lars Nee]] .. and his sister Betty Lars Nee; and Mr. and Mrs. Sittingforimmoralpurposes...and their son...Solly Sittingforimmoralpurposes\". In \"Jorrocks\", the Hunt Ball features appearances by \"Lord and Lady V'syouyeahyeahyeah and their daughter [[She Loves You|Sheila V'syouyeahyeahyeah]]\" as well as \"Lord and Lady Umeeroffen and their son Duke Umeeroffen\". Even the Ancient Greek world of [[Oedipus]] is not sacred \u2013 [[Socrates]] appears with Knobblyknees, [[Euripides]] with Iripadose, [[Antigone]] and Uncle-igone, and the treble of [[Aristophanes]], Hoiteetoitees and Afternoonteas (as well as a barrage of rotten fruit). The idea of the Silly Roll Call was revived in ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', the final game of the show often being some variant of the \"[[List of games on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue#Late Arrivals (at a society ball)|Late Arrivals (at a society ball)]]\" where the same sort of \"silly names\" would be announced by each of the players in turn.\n* The [[gibbon]]. Whenever a generic animal is required for a sketch, the team always used a gibbon. Every mention of the gibbon usually raises cheers from the audience. This is often expanded to ludicrous lengths, such as a \"Gibbon-Fanciers' Club\". [[Edward Gibbon]]'s famous ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' is rendered as \"''Decline and Fall of the Roman Gibbon'', by Edward Empire\". [[Stanley Gibbons]]' Stamp Catalogue became known as ''Stanley Stamps' Gibbon Catalogue''. Later, during ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''' heyday in the 1970s, Brooke-Taylor, Garden, and Oddie had a Top Ten hit with \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\", which reached #4, and they sang live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and the [[Amnesty International]] show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', and during ''The Goodies'' episode \"[[The Goodies \u2013 Almost Live]]\". In ''The Goodies'' episode \"[[That Old Black Magic (The Goodies)|That Old Black Magic]]\", Graeme Garden acts like an ape to the accompaniment of the Bill Oddie song \"Stuff The Gibbon\" \u2014 and in another ''Goodies'' episode, \"[[Radio Goodies]]\", the small boat above their pirate radio submarine is called \"The Saucy Gibbon\". A track on [[Soft Machine]]'s ''[[Six (Soft Machine album)|Six]]'' album entitled \"Stanley Stamp's Gibbon Album\" is dedicated to Bill Oddie.\n* The [[Terrapin]], which appears occasionally. In one show, after a particularly macabre John Cleese monologue, Hatch sends him packing, whereupon the rest of the cast defect with Cleese and form Radio Terrapin in competition to Radio Prune. In another show, Bill performs \"The Terrapin Song\", and on another show, Hatch announces a terrapin joke, as follows: (Garden) \"Who was that Terrapin I saw you with last night?\" (Brooke-Taylor) \"That was no terrapin, that was our old school mistress \u2013 she tortoise (taught us).\"\n* Bill Oddie's accent. Having a [[Brummie|Birmingham accent]] (although born in Rochdale in Lancashire, he grew up in Birmingham) made Oddie the butt of many jokes, as well as leading him naturally towards many roles in sketches where someone was required to speak incomprehensibly. He got his own back in the \"Lawrence Of Arabia On Ice\" sketch, when he appeared as Nanook of the North, complete with a plethora of cod-Lancastrian patois (\"ee bah goom\", \"black puddings\", \"ecky thump\", etc.) This became the basis for an episode of ''[[The Goodies]]'' where \"Ecky Thump\" was a secret Lancastrian [[martial art]], the episode parodying the then-popular TV show ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''.\n* The Old Jokes Home. The old jokes, of which there were many (see script below) were sometimes sent to the Old Jokes Home.\n* 'Spot'. References to \"a spot of brandy\", \"my favourite spot\", etc., were usually followed by a canine yelp from Bill Oddie, attributed to \"Spot the Dog\". Spot became an audience favourite, and made at least one appearance in each episode.\n* [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]. Characters often have OBE added to the end of their name. It is also added to places, objects and names, as well as an interruption, e.g. in \"The Angus Prune (OBE) Song\". The cast occasionally ask for one (\"Thank you ma'am, I'll take the OBE if it's offered\") or decline one that's been offered (\"No thanks, I'm trying to give them up\"). On one occasion, Hatch introduced the team as \"Tim Brooke-Taylor, O.B.E., John Cleese, O.B.E., Graeme Garden, O.B.E., David Hatch, O.B.E., Jo Kendall, O.B.E., and Bill Oddie, O.D.D.I.E.\" On another occasion, in a send-up of the Honours List, Hatch announces that a particular person has been made an earl, and also has been awarded the OBE; he therefore becomes an earlobe (this joke was also used in ''[[The Goodies]]'' series seven episode \"[[Royal Command]]\").\n*: David Hatch was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in 1994 and was knighted in 2003, Bill Oddie was awarded the OBE also in 2003, Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden were appointed OBE in 2011, but John Cleese declined a CBE in 1996. Jo Kendall has not received any honour.\n\n==Episode and sketch titles==\nThe episode titles (for shows from series 3 onwards) are unofficial and mostly come from the last sketch in each episode, which usually took the form of a short play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rfwilmut.net/site/research/notes.html |title=Research notes |publisher=Home.clara.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}</ref> Figures in parentheses after each title are the Series and Episode numbers, where known.

Continually sends memos to the ''ISIRTA'' team with the most ridiculous requests. One week, he decides that \"Radio Prune\" will become a music channel, a rival to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]. His reason is \"We at the [[BBC]] may be very, very silly, but we can write letters\". He is constantly offended by the contents of the show.\n;North American Continuity Man\n: is a parody of [[Hughie Green]] usually played by Oddie, although on one occasion, in the 3rd series, he is voiced by Garden. His [[catchphrase]]s include \"Thank-you, Thank-you\" and \"Wasn't that just great?\" Invariably, when he hands over to Kendall for details of the Prune Play of the Week, she refers to him by another personality's name \u2013 Simon (Dee), Jimmy (Young, or possibly Savile), David (Frost), or Eamonn (Andrews). On one occasion, after Kendall announces the title of the Prune Play of the Week ''Jorrocks: The Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man'' (or a man-hunting fox....), by Stanley Stamps, author of Stanley Stamps' Gibbon catalogue, Bill/Hughie says to the audience, \"So will you please put your hands together ... and pray ....\"\n;Angus Prune\n: is a character adopted by Bill Oddie to sing the playoff.\n;Grimbling\n:Voiced by Bill Oddie, Grimbling is a \"dirty old man\" who often appears as a groundsman, butler, or some similar profession. Due to the limitations of an audio-only medium, the true nature of Grimbling is never revealed, but he is greeted with universal revulsion by all bar the audience. He memorably introduces himself in the 25th anniversary episode \"I am Grimbling, but don't worry, I'll clean it up later.\" In the same episode, Cleese asks him \"Aren't you a little past it, old man?\" with the response, \"No, I'm a little dirty old man\". In the \"Robin Hood\" sketch in the 3rd series, Grimbling is in the employ of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Garden), who tells him, \"You have done well, Grimbling; take this tennis racquet for your services\".\n;Lady Constance de Coverlet\n: is a ridiculous female character who was played by the late [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]]. Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement along the lines of \"what is that coming towards us? \u2013 It's huge \u2013 It's a rhinoceros!\" \u2013 \"No, it's me!!!\"  and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\", and always by thunderous cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the \"Henry VIII\" sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen.  Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: \"..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own \u2013 and there's enough to go round \u2013 twice -...\".  In the \"Dentisti\" sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series ''[[Daktari]]'', Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in \"Jack The Ripper\", Lady Constance is invited to: \"please, sit down anywhere ... or in your case, everywhere\". In the \"Radio Prune Greek Tragedy\" sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex \u2013 according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog \u2013 and  she tells Oedipus: \"Now let me get on with my housework, I've got a little behind ..\" (pause for the ''[[double-entendre]]'' to register) \".. oh all right, I've got a colossal behind!!\"  In the \"Colditz\" sketch, the lads' escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims \"She's like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!\". She also in her own way is a bit of a [[hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] \u2013 she's described in the 25th anniversary show version of \"Jack The Ripper\" as a steaming volcano of eroticism \u2013 and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the \"3.17 to Cleethorpes\" sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, \"Yes, and then what?\", Lady Constance replies, \"Well, that's rather up to you ....\"\n;Mr Arnold Totteridge\n:Another famous recurring character, Arnold Totteridge (played by Garden) is a doddering old man who gets lost in the middle of his sentences. He invariably begins with: \"How do you do, do you do, do you do...do you?\" and after rambling incoherently for a few minutes returns to where he started. His most famous moment is in the 25th anniversary episode, where he has been appointed \"The Dynamic new-de-oo-do-de-oo-do-de-oo Head of Radio-do-do-de-do Comedy\"\n;John and Mary\n: John Cleese and Jo Kendall frequently performed poignant \u2013 almost romantic \u2013 dialogues as the respectable but dysfunctional couple \"John and Mary\", a forerunner of the relationship between Basil and Sybil in ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''. They bear a passing resemblance to Fiona and Charles of ''[[Round the Horne]]''.\n;Masher Wilkins\n:A kind-hearted simpleton (played by John Cleese), who often appears as an unlikely villain or henchman. He is prone to malapropisms: \"I've been trailing you through this impenetrable ferret-- I mean 'forest'\" - but these are often the intro to clever running jokes - in this case the line continues: \"Oh no, not ferret, I mean stoat\". \"Stoat?\"  \"Yes, 'stoatally impenetrable\". At some point, a female character would often call out \"Oh, Masher, Masher!\" - followed by a chorus of [[Ring a Ring o' Roses|\"All fall down!\"]] by the remaining cast. In one show, the topic on ''The Money Programme'' is fiscal policy and other matters monetary, and Masher asks some very abstruse questions about the Bank of England and its role in the economy. His last question, however is: 'An' wot's the combination o' de safe: oooh wot a giveaway!!'\n\n==Prune Plays==\nWriters and cast in order of appearance:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n;''Robin Hood''\n: Written by Graeme Garden and John Cleese\n: Story narration \u2013 sung by David Hatch\n: 'Curtain' \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Maid Marion \u2013 Jo Kendall\n: Friar Tuck \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Robin Hood \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Alan 'a Gabriel \u2013 Graeme Garden\n: Will Scarlet \u2013 David Hatch\n: Little John \u2013 John Cleese\n: Sir Angus of the Prune \u2013 John Cleese\n: Grimbling (the Bailiff) \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Sheriff of Nottingham \u2013 Graeme Garden\n: Master of Ceremonies for the 'Archery Competition'&nbsp;\u2013 John Cleese\n: Deputy Sheriff \u2013 Graeme Garden\n{{Col-break}}\n;''The Curse of the Flying Wombat''\n: Written by Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie\n: 'King Lear' \u2013 John Cleese\n: Tim Brown-Windsor \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Mr. Hatch \u2013 David Hatch\n: Lady Fiona Rabbit-Vacuum (Jim-Lad) \u2013 Jo Kendall\n: Captain Cleese \u2013 John Cleese\n: 'Lookout' \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Casey O'Sullivan \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Masher Wilkins \u2013 John Cleese\n: Maisie Robinson (the International Temptress)&nbsp;\u2013 Jo Kendall\n: Grimbling (Butler to Tim's Aunt) \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Lady Constance de Coverlet \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: \"Hurricane\" Flossie (Lady Constance's identical twin sister)&nbsp;\u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Slave-girl trader \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Colonel Clutch-Featheringhaugh \u2013 David Hatch\n: Nosebone (the Great White Hunter) \u2013 Bill Oddie\n: Wong (the Supply-keeper) \u2013 Tim Brooke-Taylor\n: Wong Tu (his brother) \u2013 John Cleese\n: 'Armand' \u2013 Bill Oddie\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==''ISIRTA'' songs==\n{{main|ISIRTA songs}}\n\nComedy songs replaced traditional songs during episodes.\n\n==Notes==\n''ISIRTA'' is referenced in [[The Goodies]]'s episode ''[[Chubbie Chumps]]'', where the initials are printed on the wall in chalk.\n\n\"Spot the dog\" is referenced in The Goodies's episode ''[[Camelot (The Goodies)|Camelot]]'' as the royal dog \"Spot\", where it received an immediate cheer.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n* [http://www.bennewsam.co.uk/ISIRTA.html ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (Ben Newsam)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930072202/http://www.otrtoday.com/lists/imsorrylist.htm ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (OTR Today, archived)]\n* [http://epguides.com/ISIRTA/ ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (Titles & Air Dates)]\n* [http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=106264 ''I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again'' Episode Guide (Everything2)]\n* Roberts, Jem.

The first game in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], it is a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Star Fox]]'', ''[[List of Yoshi video games|Yoshi]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[Mother (video game series)|Mother]]'', ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skills and the stage's hazards to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately knock opponents off the stage.\n\n''Super Smash Bros.'' received mostly positive reviews upon its release. It was a commercial success, selling over five million copies worldwide by 2001,<ref name=\"N-sider\">{{cite web|url= http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=120|title=Super Smash Bros.

The game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console, starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros.

On a platform, a boy wearing a baseball cap throws a bolt of lightning and in another stand, a round, pink creature wearing red shoes stands still.]]\nThe ''Super Smash Bros.'' series is a departure from the general genre of fighting games; instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, ''Smash Bros.'' players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character is knocked progressively farther by attacks. To knock out (KO) an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic01.html|title=The Basic Rules|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time \"recovering\" than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic03.html|title=You Must Recover!|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but harder for them to recover once sent flying.\n\nWhile games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'' require players to memorize complicated button-input combinations, ''Super Smash Bros.'' uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160494p1.html|title=Super Smash Bros. review|author=Peer Schneider|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 27, 1999|accessdate=April 16, 2008|author-link=Peer Schneider}}</ref> Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to move freely. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with larger, more dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. ''Smash Bros.'' also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.\n\nVarious weapons and power-ups can be used in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or dispense additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Pok\u00e9 Balls.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318161642/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|archivedate=March 18, 2008|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|title=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref> The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' and Sector Z from ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]''. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players move within a two-dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight.\n \t\nIn the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode, the player battles a series of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] opponents in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time. While the player can determine the [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty level]] and the number of lives, the series of opponents never changes. If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time, they can continue at the cost of a loss of overall points. This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| title=Classic| publisher=Smashbros.com| first=Masahiro| last=Sakurai| date=October 30, 2007| access-date=June 1, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210522/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| archive-date=April 30, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The single-player mode also includes two minigames, \"Break the Targets\" and \"Board the Platforms\", in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms, respectively.

It was first released in Japan on January 21, 1999, in North America on April 26, 1999,<ref name=\"IGNrels\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/super-smash-bros/n64-10494 |title=Super Smash Bros. |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"GSrel\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/super-smash-bros/ |title=Super Smash Bros. |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=CBS Interactive Inc. |accessdate=September 1, 2013}}</ref> and in Europe on November 19, 1999. The first game in the [[Super Smash Bros.|''Super Smash Bros.'' series]], it is a crossover between several different Nintendo franchises, including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[Star Fox]]'', ''[[List of Yoshi video games|Yoshi]]'', ''[[Donkey Kong]]'', ''[[Metroid]]'', ''[[F-Zero]]'', ''[[Mother (video game series)|Mother]]'', ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''. It presents a cast of characters and locations from these franchises and allows players to use each character's unique skills and the stage's hazards to inflict damage, recover health, and ultimately knock opponents off the stage.\n\n''Super Smash Bros.'' received mostly positive reviews upon its release. It was a commercial success, selling over five million copies worldwide by 2001,<ref name=\"N-sider\">{{cite web|url= http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=120|title=Super Smash Bros.

The game spawned a series of sequels for each successive Nintendo console, starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'' which was released for the [[GameCube]] in 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{see also|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Super Smash Bros. series}}\n[[File:Mk stockmatch.jpg|thumb|left|Ness from ''[[EarthBound]]'' facing [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] on the Mushroom Kingdom stage, based on the [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'']] franchise.|alt=A scenery full of platforms, blocks and fences in the style of the Super Mario Bros. video game. On a platform, a boy wearing a baseball cap throws a bolt of lightning and in another stand, a round, pink creature wearing red shoes stands still.]]\nThe ''Super Smash Bros.'' series is a departure from the general genre of fighting games; instead of depleting an opponent's life bar, ''Smash Bros.'' players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as the damage is taken and can reach maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character is knocked progressively farther by attacks. To knock out (KO) an opponent, the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic01.html|title=The Basic Rules|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an easier time \"recovering\" than others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/howto/basic/basic03.html|title=You Must Recover!|work=Smash Bros. DOJO!! |publisher=Smashbros.com|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref> Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but harder for them to recover once sent flying.\n\nWhile games such as ''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Tekken]]'' require players to memorize complicated button-input combinations, ''Super Smash Bros.'' uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/160/160494p1.html|title=Super Smash Bros. review|author=Peer Schneider|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=April 27, 1999|accessdate=April 16, 2008|author-link=Peer Schneider}}</ref> Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to move freely. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with larger, more dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. ''Smash Bros.'' also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.\n\nVarious weapons and power-ups can be used in battle to inflict damage, recover health, or dispense additional items. They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises, such as Koopa shells, hammers, and Pok\u00e9 Balls.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318161642/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|archivedate=March 18, 2008|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/characters/index.html|title=Smash Bros. DOJO!!}}</ref> The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises, such as Planet Zebes from ''[[Metroid (series)|Metroid]]'' and Sector Z from ''[[Star Fox (series)|Star Fox]]''. Although stages are rendered in three dimensions, players move within a two-dimensional plane. Stages are dynamic, ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage. Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives, making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight.\n \t\nIn the game's [[Single-player video game|single-player]] mode, the player battles a series of [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|computer-controlled]] opponents in a specific order, attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time. While the player can determine the [[Balance (game design)#Difficulty level|difficulty level]] and the number of lives, the series of opponents never changes. If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time, they can continue at the cost of a loss of overall points. This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| title=Classic| publisher=Smashbros.com| first=Masahiro| last=Sakurai| date=October 30, 2007| access-date=June 1, 2008| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210522/http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/gamemode/various/various11.html| archive-date=April 30, 2008| df=mdy-all}}</ref> The single-player mode also includes two minigames, \"Break the Targets\" and \"Board the Platforms\", in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms, respectively. A \"Training Mode\" is also available in which players can manipulate the environment and experiment against computer opponents without the restrictions of a standard match.\n\nUp to four people can play in [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play.<ref name=Spot/> This gives each player a certain number of lives or a selected time limit, before beginning the match. Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time. A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team have lost all of their lives. A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when the timer expires, which causes the round to end in [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]. During sudden death, all fighters are given 300% damage and the last fighter standing will win the match.\n\n==Characters==\n{{see also|Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series}}\nThe game includes twelve playable characters from popular Nintendo franchises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/16387/page_3.html |title=Guides: Super Smash Bros.

{"title_page": "Desktop environment", "text_new": "{{short description|graphical user interface}}\n{{About|the operating system and user interface schema|desktop computing in general|desktop computer}}\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''desktop environment''' ('''DE''') is an [[implementation]] of the [[desktop metaphor]] made of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer [[operating system]] that share a common [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), sometimes described as a [[graphical shell]]. The desktop environment was seen mostly on [[personal computer]]s until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system. Instead, the traditional [[command-line interface]] (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.\n\nA desktop environment typically consists of [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[Window (computing)|windows]], [[toolbars]], [[directory (file systems)|folders]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]] and [[Widget engine|desktop widgets]] (see [[Elements of graphical user interfaces]] and WIMP). A GUI might also provide [[drag and drop]] functionality and other features that make the [[desktop metaphor]] more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.\n\nWhile the term ''desktop environment'' originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments|title=Window managers and desktop environments \u2013 Linux 101|website=clemsonlinux.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704182940/http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments|archivedate=2008-07-04}}</ref> This usage has been popularized by projects such as the [[Common Desktop Environment]], [[KDE#Plasma Workspaces|K Desktop Environment]], and [[GNOME]].\n\n== Implementation ==\nOn a system that offers a desktop environment, a [[window manager]] in conjunction with applications written using a [[widget toolkit]] are generally responsible for most of what the user sees. The window manager supports the [[user interaction]]s with the environment, while the toolkit provides developers a [[software library]] for [[Application software|applications]] with a unified look and behavior.\n\nA [[windowing system]] of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying [[operating system]] and libraries. This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.\n\nApplications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a [[windowing toolkit]], generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to [[GUI widget|widgets]] that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.\n\n== History and common use ==\n{{Further|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n[[File:Smalltalk-76.png|left|thumb|The interim Dynabook desktop environment (1976; aka Smalltalk-76 running on Alto)]]The first desktop environment was created by [[Xerox]] and was sold with the [[Xerox Alto]] in the 1970s. The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer; it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price tag.{{Dubious |reason=Alto was not a product and was not sold|date=October 2017}}<ref>{{cite web |author-first=Nathan |author-last=Lineback |url=http://toastytech.com/guis/alto.html |title=The Xerox Alto |publisher=Toastytech.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> With the [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced a desktop environment on an affordable [[personal computer]], which also failed in the market.\n\nThe desktop metaphor was popularized on commercial [[personal computer]]s by the original [[Macintosh]] from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] in 1984, and was popularized further by [[Windows]] from [[Microsoft]] since the 1990s. {{As of|2014}}, the most popular desktop environments are descendants of these earlier environments, including the [[Windows Aero|Aero environment]] used in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows&nbsp;7]], and the [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua environment]] used in [[macOS]]. When compared with the [[X Window System|X-based]] desktop environments available for [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]], the [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] desktop environments included with Windows and macOS have relatively fixed layouts and static features, with highly integrated \"seamless\" designs that aim to provide mostly consistent customer experiences across installations.\n\nMicrosoft Windows dominates in marketshare among personal computers with a desktop environment. Computers using Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, Chrome OS, Linux, BSD or Solaris are much less common;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8&qpcal=1&qptimeframe=Y&qpsp=2011 |title=Operating System Market Share |publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> however, {{As of|2015|lc=yes}} there is a growing market for low-cost Linux PCs using the [[X Window System]] or [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] with a broad choice of desktop environments. Among the more popular of these are Google's [[Chromebook]]s and [[Chromebox]]es, Intel's [[Next Unit of Computing|NUC]], the [[Raspberry Pi]], etc.{{Citation needed|reason=NUCs only bundled with Windows I believe|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn tablets and smartphones, the situation is the opposite, with Unix-like operating systems dominating the market, including the [[iOS]] (BSD-derived), [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Tizen]], [[Sailfish OS|Sailfish]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (all Linux-derived). Microsoft's [[Windows phone]], [[Windows RT]] and [[Windows&nbsp;10]] are used on a much smaller number of tablets and smartphones. However, the majority of Unix-like operating systems dominant on handheld devices do not use the X11 desktop environments used by other Unix-like operating systems, relying instead on interfaces based on other technologies.\n\n== Desktop environments for the X Window System ==\n[[File:Popular free desktop environments.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A brief timeline of the most popular modern desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems (greyscale logos indicate when the project's development started, while colorized logos indicate the project's first release)]]\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update the timeline, and include the evolution of LXQt, merge with Razor-qt, etc.  Please review Talk page for details.  -->\n{{Further|Comparison of X Window System desktop environments}}\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update this to talk about Wayland too -->\nOn systems running the [[X Window System]] (typically Unix-family systems such as [[Linux]], [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|the BSDs]], and formal [[UNIX]] distributions), desktop environments are much more dynamic and customizable to meet user needs. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of several separate components, including a [[window manager]] (such as [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]] or [[KWin]]), a [[file manager]] (such as [[GNOME Files|Files]] or [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]]), a set of [[Skin (computing)|graphical themes]], together with [[Widget toolkit|toolkits]] (such as [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]) and [[Library (computing)|libraries]] for managing the desktop. All these individual modules can be exchanged and independently configured to suit users, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that works with minimal user setup.\n\nSome window managers{{mdashb}}such as [[IceWM]], [[Fluxbox]], [[Openbox]], [[ROX Desktop]] and [[Window Maker]]{{mdashb}}contain relatively sparse desktop environment elements, such as an integrated [[spatial file manager]], while others like [[evilwm]] and [[wmii]] do not provide such elements. Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. [[KDE]], for example, provides so-called [[KIO]] slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.\n\nIn 1996 the [[KDE]] was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of [[GNOME]]. [[Xfce]] is a smaller project that was also founded in 1996,<ref name=\"Then\">{{citation |url=http://www.slashgear.com/xfce-creator-talks-linux-moblin-netbooks-and-open-source-0633329/ |title=Xfce creator talks Linux, Moblin, netbooks and open-source |last=Then |first=Ewdison |date=6 February 2009 |publisher=[[SlashGear]] |accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> and focuses on speed and modularity, just like [[LXDE]] which was started in 2006. A [[comparison of X Window System desktop environments]] demonstrates the differences between environments.

The desktop environment was seen mostly on [[personal computer]]s until the rise of mobile computing. Desktop GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files, while they usually do not provide access to all of the features found in the underlying operating system. Instead, the traditional [[command-line interface]] (CLI) is still used when full control over the operating system is required.\n\nA desktop environment typically consists of [[icon (computing)|icons]], [[Window (computing)|windows]], [[toolbars]], [[directory (file systems)|folders]], [[computer wallpaper|wallpapers]] and [[Widget engine|desktop widgets]] (see [[Elements of graphical user interfaces]] and WIMP).  A GUI might also provide [[drag and drop]] functionality and other features that make the [[desktop metaphor]] more complete. A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.\n\nWhile the term ''desktop environment'' originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments|title=Window managers and desktop environments \u2013 Linux 101|website=clemsonlinux.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704182940/http://learn.clemsonlinux.org/wiki/Window_managers_and_desktop_environments|archivedate=2008-07-04}}</ref>  This usage has been popularized by projects such as the [[Common Desktop Environment]], [[KDE#Plasma Workspaces|K Desktop Environment]], and [[GNOME]].\n\n== Implementation ==\nOn a system that offers a desktop environment, a [[window manager]] in conjunction with applications written using a [[widget toolkit]] are generally responsible for most of what the user sees. The window manager supports the [[user interaction]]s with the environment, while the toolkit provides developers a [[software library]] for [[Application software|applications]] with a unified look and behavior.\n\nA [[windowing system]] of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying [[operating system]] and libraries. This provides support for graphical hardware, pointing devices, and keyboards. The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing system. While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality, this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager, which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing system.\n\nApplications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a [[windowing toolkit]], generally provided with the operating system or window manager. A windowing toolkit gives applications access to [[GUI widget|widgets]] that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent way.\n\n== History and common use ==\n{{Further|History of the graphical user interface}}\n\n[[File:Smalltalk-76.png|left|thumb|The interim Dynabook desktop environment (1976; aka Smalltalk-76 running on Alto)]]The first desktop environment was created by [[Xerox]] and was sold with the [[Xerox Alto]] in the 1970s.

When compared with the [[X Window System|X-based]] desktop environments available for [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] and [[FreeBSD]], the [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] desktop environments included with Windows and macOS have relatively fixed layouts and static features, with highly integrated \"seamless\" designs that aim to provide mostly consistent customer experiences across installations.\n\nMicrosoft Windows dominates in marketshare among personal computers with a desktop environment. Computers using Unix-like operating systems such as macOS, Chrome OS, Linux, BSD or Solaris are much less common;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8&qpcal=1&qptimeframe=Y&qpsp=2011 |title=Operating System Market Share |publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}</ref> however, {{As of|2015|lc=yes}} there is a growing market for low-cost Linux PCs using the [[X Window System]] or [[Wayland (display server protocol)|Wayland]] with a broad choice of desktop environments. Among the more popular of these are Google's [[Chromebook]]s and [[Chromebox]]es, Intel's [[Next Unit of Computing|NUC]], the [[Raspberry Pi]], etc.{{Citation needed|reason=NUCs only bundled with Windows I believe|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn tablets and smartphones, the situation is the opposite, with Unix-like operating systems dominating the market, including the [[iOS]] (BSD-derived), [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Tizen]], [[Sailfish OS|Sailfish]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] (all Linux-derived). Microsoft's [[Windows phone]], [[Windows RT]] and [[Windows&nbsp;10]] are used on a much smaller number of tablets and smartphones. However, the majority of Unix-like operating systems dominant on handheld devices do not use the X11 desktop environments used by other Unix-like operating systems, relying instead on interfaces based on other technologies.\n\n== Desktop environments for the X Window System ==\n[[File:Popular free desktop environments.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A brief timeline of the most popular modern desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems (greyscale logos indicate when the project's development started, while colorized logos indicate the project's first release)]]\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update the timeline, and include the evolution of LXQt, merge with Razor-qt, etc.  Please review Talk page for details.  -->\n{{Further|Comparison of X Window System desktop environments}}\n<!-- FIXME!  Please update this to talk about Wayland too -->\nOn systems running the [[X Window System]] (typically Unix-family systems such as [[Linux]], [[Comparison of BSD operating systems|the BSDs]], and formal [[UNIX]] distributions), desktop environments are much more dynamic and customizable to meet user needs. In this context, a desktop environment typically consists of several separate components, including a [[window manager]] (such as [[Mutter (software)|Mutter]] or [[KWin]]), a [[file manager]] (such as [[GNOME Files|Files]] or [[Dolphin (software)|Dolphin]]), a set of [[Skin (computing)|graphical themes]], together with [[Widget toolkit|toolkits]] (such as [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (framework)|Qt]]) and [[Library (computing)|libraries]] for managing the desktop. All these individual modules can be exchanged and independently configured to suit users, but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that works with minimal user setup.\n\nSome window managers{{mdashb}}such as [[IceWM]], [[Fluxbox]], [[Openbox]], [[ROX Desktop]] and [[Window Maker]]{{mdashb}}contain relatively sparse desktop environment elements, such as an integrated [[spatial file manager]], while others like [[evilwm]] and [[wmii]] do not provide such elements.  Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the user. Some of it may be low-level code. [[KDE]], for example, provides so-called [[KIO]] slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual devices. These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environment.\n\nIn 1996 the [[KDE]] was announced, followed in 1997 by the announcement of [[GNOME]]. [[Xfce]] is a smaller project that was also founded in 1996,<ref name=\"Then\">{{citation |url=http://www.slashgear.com/xfce-creator-talks-linux-moblin-netbooks-and-open-source-0633329/ |title=Xfce creator talks Linux, Moblin, netbooks and open-source |last=Then |first=Ewdison |date=6 February 2009 |publisher=[[SlashGear]] |accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> and focuses on speed and modularity, just like [[LXDE]] which was started in 2006.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain which is actually higher in elevation than the 3 westernmost named mountains and between which is a smaller highland valley, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. Duncan's Knob at 2,800 feet, on Catback Mountain, and Strickler's Knob at over 2,700 feet on Masanutten Mountain are the two highest points in the Fort Valley Ridgeline. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping panoramic views of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation and signal post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> From Signal Knob the areas around Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook can be observed. Signal Knob is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise, during the Civil War no battle was fought in the isolated and contained Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]], a historic home and farm built in 1834 overlooking Passage Creek in Fort Valley, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>  Daniel Munch was a successful farmer and distiller, the son on early German settlers who moved to Fort Valley in 1779. The house has excellent examples of architectural details in the German tradition of northern Shenandoah Valley.<ref>https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/085-0363/</ref> It was the only brick house in Fort Valley as late as 1937.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_dmunch.html</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Valley VA - Munch House, 1-11- 2014.jpg|thumb|Fort Valley VA - Munch House, 1-11- 2014]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox valley\n| name = Fort Valley\n| photo = Fort_Valley_air.jpg\n| photo_caption = Air photo of Fort Valley, facing south, with the North (right) and South (left) Forks of the [[Shenandoah River]] visible.

There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping panoramic views of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> From Signal Knob the areas around Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook can be observed. Signal Knob is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise, during the Civil War no battle was fought in the isolated and contained Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]], a historic home and farm built in 1834 overlooking Passage Creek in Fort Valley, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>  Daniel Munch was a successful farmer and distiller, the son on early German settlers who moved to Fort Valley in 1779.

{"title_page": "Globalism", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Globalization}}\n{{basic forms of government}}\n'''Globalism''' refers to various systems with scope beyond the merely international. It is used by political scientists, such as [[Joseph Nye]], to describe \"attempts to understand all the interconnections of the modern world\u2014and to highlight patterns that underlie (and explain) them.\"<ref name=\"Nye 2002\" /> While primarily associated with [[world-system]]s, it can be used to describe other global trends. The term is also used by detractors of [[globalization]] such as [[populist]] movements.\n\nThe term is similar to [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]].\n\n== Political science definitions ==\n[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines ''globalism'', \"at least in its more specific use [...] as the dominant ideology and [[subjectivity]] associated with different historically-dominant formations of global extension. The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the [[Roman Empire]] in the second century AD, and perhaps to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the fifth-century BC.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|James|2006|p=22}}.</ref>\n\n[[Manfred Steger]] distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steger|2008|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}.</ref> Market globalism includes the ideology of [[neoliberalism]]. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book ''[[John Ralston Saul#The Collapse of Globalism|The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World]]'', Canadian philosopher [[John Ralston Saul]] treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their [[national interest]]s in both positive and destructive ways.\n\nAlternatively, American political scientist [[Joseph Nye]], co-founder of the [[international relations theory]] of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], generalized the term to argue that ''globalism'' refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by [[Network theory|networks of connections]] that span multi-continental distances; while [[globalization]] refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.<ref name=\"Nye 2002\">{{Harvnb|Nye|2002}}.</ref> This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00670.x |volume=9 |issue=2 |title=The Third Wave in Globalization Theory |journal=International Studies Review |pages=173\u2013196 |last1=Martell |first1=Luke|year=2007 |url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/1243/1/thirdwaveweb.pdf}}</ref> The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e., whether globalization is unprecedented or not).\n\nIt has been used to describe international endeavours begun after [[World War II]], such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[European Union]], and sometimes the later neoliberal and neoconservative policies of \"[[nation building]]\" and military interventionism between the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991 and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.\n\n== Arguments in favor ==\nProponents of globalism believe in [[global citizenship]]; that is, the problems of humanity can be resolved with democratic globalism.  Democratic globalism is the idea that all people matter, no matter where they live, and that universal freedom and human rights can be fostered for all mankind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/the-answer-to-nationalist-fervour-isnt-less-globalism-its-more/|title=The answer to nationalist fervour isn't less globalisation.

The definition thus implies that there were pre-modern or traditional forms of globalism and globalization long before the driving force of capitalism sought to colonize every corner of the globe, for example, going back to the [[Roman Empire]] in the second century AD, and perhaps to the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] of the fifth-century BC.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|James|2006|p=22}}.</ref>\n\n[[Manfred Steger]] distinguishes between different globalisms such as justice globalism, jihad globalism, and market globalism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Steger|2008|p={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}.</ref> Market globalism includes the ideology of [[neoliberalism]]. In some hands, the reduction of globalism to the single ideology of market globalism and neoliberalism has led to confusion. For example, in his 2005 book ''[[John Ralston Saul#The Collapse of Globalism|The Collapse of Globalism and the Reinvention of the World]]'', Canadian philosopher [[John Ralston Saul]] treated globalism as coterminous with neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization. He argued that, far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their [[national interest]]s in both positive and destructive ways.\n\nAlternatively, American political scientist [[Joseph Nye]], co-founder of the [[international relations theory]] of [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neoliberalism]], generalized the term to argue that ''globalism'' refers to any description and explanation of a world which is characterized by [[Network theory|networks of connections]] that span multi-continental distances; while [[globalization]] refers to the increase or decline in the degree of globalism.<ref name=\"Nye 2002\">{{Harvnb|Nye|2002}}.</ref> This use of the term originated in, and continues to be used, in academic debates about the economic, social, and cultural developments that is described as globalization.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2486.2007.00670.x | volume=9 | issue=2 | title=The Third Wave in Globalization Theory | journal=International Studies Review | pages=173\u2013196 | last1 = Martell | first1 = Luke| year=2007 | url=http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/1243/1/thirdwaveweb.pdf }}</ref> The term is used in a specific and narrow way to describe a position in the debate about the historical character of globalization (i.e. whether globalization is unprecedented or not).\n\nIt has been used to describe international endeavours begun after [[World War II]], such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Warsaw Pact]], the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and the [[European Union]], and sometimes the later neo-liberal and neoconservative policies of \"[[nation building]]\" and military interventionism between the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991 and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001.\n\n== Arguments in favor ==\nProponents of globalism believe in [[global citizenship]]; that is, the problems of humanity can be resolved with democratic globalism.
