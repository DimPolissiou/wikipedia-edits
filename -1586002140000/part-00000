Likewise, it is also the story of the housewife, Aida ([[Nora Aunor]]) who has to assume the head of the family because the husband went away and never came back. The film has its premiere at selected cinemas in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film starts with Noel ([[Coco Martin]]) leaving for [[Malaysia]] as an [[Overseas Filipino Worker|OFW]], he lands a job as a taxi driver and meets a woman named Pia ([[Julia Montes]]), who was crying as she rode the cab. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, Noel's mother, Aida ([[Nora Aunor]]) is receiving his remittances and gifts so she could take care of his siblings ([[Miles Ocampo]] and [[Manuel Chua]]), and the extended family like his hot-headed aunt Ramona ([[Rosanna Roces]]) and his grandmother ([[Anita Linda]]). \n\nPia rides Noel's cab for the second time and he discovers that she is from the Philippines like him. The two start dating after seeing each other more from then. He tells her about his father who also worked as an OFW but never returned, pushing him to work abroad as the new breadwinner of the family. Later on, she tells Noel that she has a partner and a child back home, which Noel didn't seem to mind.\n\nAida receives a letter which she appeared not to expect getting. After receiving it, she starts shopping for new clothes and grooming herself. She also meets Job ([[Joem Bascon]]), a much younger guy who works at the market and falls in love with him. The conflict began when Aida decided to take Job to be her partner, and took the young man to live with the entire family \u2013 much to the dismay of Ramona. \n\nThe plot thickens when Pia decides to leave Noel and go back to the Philippines after her work contract in Malaysia ended. Noel also went home one day and gets furious upon finding out that his mother is cheating on his father with a younger man. The content of the letter Aida received was revealed when she responded to her son's anger. They find out that Ben ([[Joel Torre]]) is alive, so Noel went to where his father was and took him home. He also searched for Pia and found out that her husband Raymond ([[Baron Geisler]]) is abusive, so he makes an effort to take her away from him. However, the husband finds out and beats him up.\n\nLater on, Ramona learns that Aida has not been paying the bills to get their house back after it had been mortgaged. This results to a feud that gives the grandmother a heart attack, eventually killing her. Ben tells the family that the money Noel has been giving to Aida went to his medication and new family, and that she was not spending it for Job. Noel and his mother sort things out right before Raymond set their house on fire.\n\nThe story ends with Noel and his family, finally together with Pia and her child in a new house, with Noel getting ready to go back to Malaysia once again to work and support them financially.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nora Aunor]]<ref name=\"Cast\">{{cite news|url=https://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/13203/coco-martin-and-nora-aunor-co-star-in-upcoming-film-padre-de-pamilya|title=Coco Martin and Nora Aunor co-star in upcoming film Padre de Pamilya|publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal|PEP]]|date=12 January 2014|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> as Aida Santiago\n* [[Coco Martin]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Noel Santiago\n* [[Julia Montes]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Pia\n* [[Joel Torre]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Ben Santiago\n* [[Rosanna Roces]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Ramona Santiago\n* [[Joem Bascon]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Job\n* [[Baron Geisler]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Raymond\n* [[Anita Linda]]<ref name=\"Cast\" /> as Lola Eva\n* [[Miles Ocampo]] as Tana Santiago\n* [[Manuel Chua]] as Caloy Santiago\n* Jess Mendoza as Tana's boyfriend\n* Paolo Diangson as Noel's son\n* Janvier Daily as Matador\n* Sunshine Teodoro as Saleswoman\n* Armand Reyes as Ben's neighbor \n* Malou Crisologo as Debt collector\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a concept by Coco Martin who drew from his experiences as an OFW in [[Canada]]. Nora Aunor was the first and original choice to play the lead actress alongside Martin. She initially had to beg off the project due to being busy with other projects.<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite news|url=https://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/23196/coco-martin-sarah-geronimo-were-supposed-to-play-clark-and-leah-in-emon-the-wings-of-loveem|title=Coco Martin, Sarah Geronimo were supposed to play Clark and Leah in On The Wings Of Love|publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal|PEP]]|first=Nikko|last=Tuazon|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> \n\nWith the film's release then uncertain, the concept was turned into a teleserye which necessitated a change in the female lead to co-star with Martin.

Likewise, it is also the story of the housewife, Aida ([[Nora Aunor]]) who has to assume the head of the family because the husband went away and never came back. The film has its premiere at selected cinemas in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film starts with Noel ([[Coco Martin]]) leaving for [[Malaysia]] as an [[Overseas Filipino Worker|OFW]], he lands a job as a taxi driver and meets a woman named Pia ([[Julia Montes]]), who was crying as she rode the cab. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, Noel's mother, Aida ([[Nora Aunor]]) is receiving his remittances and gifts so she could take care of his siblings ([[Miles Ocampo]] and [[Manuel Chua]]), and the extended family like his hot-headed aunt Ramona ([[Rosanna Roces]]) and his grandmother ([[Anita Linda]]). \n\nPia rides Noel's cab for the second time and he discovers that she is from the Philippines like him. The two start dating after seeing each other more from then. He tells her about his father who also worked as an OFW but never returned, pushing him to work abroad as the new breadwinner of the family. Later on, she tells Noel that she has a partner and a child back home, which Noel didn't seem to mind.\n\nAida receives a letter which she appeared not to expect getting. After receiving it, she starts shopping for new clothes and grooming herself. She also meets Job ([[Joem Bascon]]), a much younger guy who works at the market and falls in love with him. The conflict began when Aida decided to take Job to be her partner, and took the young man to live with the entire family \u2013 much to the dismay of Ramona. \n\nThe plot thickens when Pia decides to leave Noel and go back to the Philippines after her work contract in Malaysia ended. Noel also went home one day and gets furious upon finding out that his mother is cheating on his father with a younger man. The content of the letter Aida received was revealed when she responded to her son's anger. They find out that Ben ([[Joel Torre]]) is alive, so Noel went to where his father was and took him home. He also searched for Pia and found out that her husband Raymond ([[Baron Geisler]]) is abusive, so he makes an effort to take her away from him. However, the husband finds out and beats him up.\n\nLater on, Ramona learns that Aida has not been paying the bills to get their house back after it had been mortgaged. This results to a feud that gives the grandmother a heart attack, eventually killing her. Ben tells the family that the money Noel has been giving to Aida went to his medication and new family, and that she was not spending it for Job. Noel and his mother sort things out right before Raymond set their house on fire.\n\nThe story ends with Noel and his family, finally together with Pia and her child in a new house, with Noel getting ready to go back to Malaysia once again to work and support them financially.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nora Aunor]]<ref name=\"Cast>{{cite news|url=https://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/13203/coco-martin-and-nora-aunor-co-star-in-upcoming-film-padre-de-pamilya|title=Coco Martin and Nora Aunor co-star in upcoming film Padre de Pamilya|publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal|PEP]]|date=12 January 2014|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> as Aida Santiago\n* [[Coco Martin]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Noel Santiago\n* [[Julia Montes]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Pia\n* [[Joel Torre]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Ben Santiago\n* [[Rosanna Roces]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Ramona Santiago\n* [[Joem Bascon]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Job\n* [[Baron Geisler]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Raymond\n* [[Anita Linda]]<ref name=\"Cast/> as Lola Eva\n* [[Miles Ocampo]] as Tana Santiago\n* [[Manuel Chua]] as Caloy Santiago\n* Jess Mendoza as Tana's boyfriend\n* Paolo Diangson as Noel's son\n* Janvier Daily as Matador\n* Sunshine Teodoro as Saleswoman\n* Armand Reyes as Ben's neighbor \n* Malou Crisologo as Debt collector\n\n==Production==\nThe film was based on a concept by Coco Martin who drew from his experiences as an OFW in [[Canada]].

Samuel de Champlain returned to the colony and accuses \u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9 of treason in these terms: \"Here are those who betrayed their Roy & sold their homeland[\u2026]\". \u00c9tienne Brul\u00e9 then took refuge in [[Huronia]] where he was killed, in the year 1633.\n\nThe toponym \"Rivi\u00e8re Br\u00fbl\u00e9\" was formalized on December 13, 1996 at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec.<ref>[http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=167145 Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: Rivi\u00e8re Br\u00fbl\u00e9]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{GeoGroup}}\n* [[Capitale-Nationale]], an administrative region\n* [[La C\u00f4te-de-Beaupr\u00e9 Regional County Municipality]]\n* [[Lac-Jacques-Cartier, Quebec|Lac-Jacques-Cartier]], an unorganized territory\n* [[Lac Br\u00fbl\u00e9 (Lac-Jacques-Cartier)]], a body of water\n* [[Sainte-Anne River (Beaupr\u00e9)]]\n* [[St. Lawrence River]]\n* [[List of rivers of Quebec]]\n\n{{Portal|Capitale-Nationale|lakes and streams}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Br\u00fbl\u00e9, river}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Capitale-Nationale]]\n[[Category:La C\u00f4te-de-Beaupr\u00e9 Regional County Municipality]]\n", "name_user": "Veillg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGeography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brul%C3%A9e_River_(Sainte-Anne_River_tributary)"}

{"title_page": "Message queue", "text_new": "{{redirects|Mailbox (computing)|the file format|Mbox}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}\nIn [[computer science]], '''message queues''' and '''mailboxes''' are [[Software engineering|software-engineering]] [[software componentry|components]] used for [[inter-process communication]] (IPC), or for inter-[[thread (computing)|thread]] communication within the same process. They use a [[Queue (data structure)|queue]] for [[Message (computer science)|messaging]]&nbsp;\u2013 the passing of control or of content.  [[Group communication system]]s provide similar kinds of functionality.\n\nThe message queue paradigm is a sibling of the [[Publish\u2013subscribe pattern|publisher/subscriber]] pattern, and is typically one part of a larger [[message-oriented middleware]] system. Most messaging systems support both the publisher/subscriber and message queue models in their [[application programming interface|API]], e.g. [[Java Message Service]] (JMS).\n\n==Overview==\nMessage queues provide an  [[Asynchronous communication|asynchronous]] [[communications protocol]], meaning that the sender and receiver of the message do not need to interact with the message queue at the same time.  Messages placed onto the queue are stored until the recipient retrieves them.  Message queues have implicit or explicit limits on the size of data that may be transmitted in a single message and the number of messages that may remain outstanding on the queue.\n\nMany implementations of message queues function internally: within an [[operating system]] or within an [[application software|application]]. Such queues exist for the purposes of that [[system]] only.<ref>Win32 system message queues. {{Cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644927(VS.85).aspx|title=About Messages and Message Queues|work=Windows User Interface|publisher=Microsoft Developer Network|accessdate=April 21, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317065349/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms644927(VS.85).aspx|archive-date=March 17, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Linux and POSIX message queues.

Examples of commercial implementations of this kind of message queueing [[software]] (also known as [[message-oriented middleware]]) include [[IBM MQ]] (formerly MQ Series) and [[Oracle Advanced Queuing]] (AQ).  There is a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] standard called [[Java Message Service]], which has several [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] and [[free software]] implementations.\n\nImplementations exist as proprietary software, provided as a [[Message queuing service|service]], open source software, or a hardware-based solution.\n\nProprietary options have the longest history, and include products from the inception of message queuing, such as IBM MQ, and those tied to specific operating systems, such as [[Microsoft Message Queuing]]. \n\nThere are also cloud-based message queuing service options, such as [[Amazon Simple Queue Service]] (SQS), [[StormMQ]], [[IronMQ]], and [[IBM MQ]] has a cloud-based managed queuing service. \n\nThere are a number of open source choices of messaging [[middleware]] systems, including [[Apache ActiveMQ]], [[Apache Kafka]], [[Apache Qpid]]<ref>[http://qpid.apache.org/ Apache Qpid Project, an implementation of [[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol|AMQP]]].</ref>, [[Apache RocketMQ]], Beanstalkd, [[Enduro/X]], HTTPSQS<ref>[http://code.google.com/p/httpsqs/ HTTPSQS, a message queue based on HTTP GET/POST protocol.]</ref>, [[JBoss Messaging]], [[JORAM]], [[RabbitMQ]], [[Open Message Queue|Sun Open Message Queue]], and [[Tarantool]].\n\nIn addition to open source systems, hardware-based [[message oriented middleware|messaging middleware]] exists with vendors like [[Solace Corporation|Solace]], [[Apigee]] and Tervela offering queuing through silicon or silicon/software datapaths. IBM also offers its MQ software on an appliance.\n\nMost [[real-time operating system]]s (RTOSes), such as [[VxWorks]] and [[QNX]], encourage the use of message queueing as the primary inter-process or inter-thread communication mechanism.  The resulting tight integration between message passing and CPU scheduling is attributed as a main reason for the usability of RTOSes for real time applications.  Early examples of commercial RTOSes that encouraged a message-queue basis to inter-thread communication also include [[Versatile Real-Time Executive|VRTX]] and [[pSOS (real-time operating system)|pSOS]]+, both of which date to the early 1980s. The [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang programming language]] uses ''processes'' to provide concurrency; these processes communicate asynchronously using message queuing.\n\n==Usage==\nIn a typical message-queueing implementation, a [[system administrator]] installs and configures message-queueing software (a [[queue manager]] or broker), and defines a named message queue. Or they register with a [[message queuing service]].\n\nAn application then registers a software routine that \"listens\" for messages placed onto the queue.\n\nSecond and subsequent applications may connect to the queue and transfer a message onto it.\n\nThe queue-manager software stores the messages until a receiving application connects and then calls the registered software routine.  The receiving application then processes the message in an appropriate manner.\n\nThere are often numerous options as to the exact semantics of message passing, including:\n\n* Durability - messages may be kept in memory, written to disk, or even committed to a [[database|DBMS]] if the need for reliability indicates a more resource-intensive solution.\n* Security policies - which applications should have access to these messages?\n* Message purging policies - queues or messages may have a \"[[time to live]]\"\n* Message filtering - some systems support filtering data so that a subscriber may only see messages matching some pre-specified criteria of interest\n* Delivery policies - do we need to guarantee that a message is delivered at least once, or no more than once?\n* Routing policies - in a system with many queue servers, what servers should receive a message or a queue's messages?\n* Batching policies - should messages be delivered immediately?   Or should the system wait a bit and try to deliver many messages at once?\n* Queuing criteria - when should a message be considered \"enqueued\"?  When one queue has it?  Or when it has been forwarded to at least one remote queue?  Or to all queues?\n* Receipt notification - A publisher may need to know when some or all subscribers have received a message.\n\nThese are all considerations that can have substantial effects on transaction semantics, system reliability, and system efficiency.\n\n==Standards and protocols==\nHistorically, message queuing has used proprietary, closed protocols, restricting the ability for different operating systems or programming languages to interact in a heterogeneous set of environments.\n\nAn early attempt to make message queuing more ubiquitous was [[Sun Microsystems]]' [[Java Message Service|JMS]] specification, which provided a [[Java (software platform)|Java]]-only abstraction of a client [[Application programming interface|API]]. This allowed Java developers to switch between providers of message queuing in a fashion similar to that of developers using [[SQL]] databases. In practice, given the diversity of message queuing techniques and scenarios, this wasn't always as practical as it could be.\n\nThree standards have emerged which are used in open source message queue implementations:\n#[[Advanced Message Queuing Protocol]] (AMQP) \u2013 feature-rich message queue protocol, approved as ISO/IEC 19464 since April 2014\n#[[Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol]] (STOMP) \u2013 simple, text-oriented message protocol\n#[[MQTT]] (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) - lightweight message queue protocol especially for embedded devices\n\nThese protocols are at different stages of standardization and adoption. The first two operate at the same level as [[HTTP]], MQTT at the level of [[TCP/IP]].\n\nSome proprietary implementations also use HTTP to provide message queuing by some implementations, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Simple Queue Service|SQS]]. This is because it is always possible to layer asynchronous behaviour (which is what is required for message queuing) over a synchronous protocol using request-response semantics. However, such implementations are constrained by the underlying protocol in this case and may not be able to offer the full fidelity or set of options required in message passing above.\n\n==Synchronous vs. asynchronous==\nMany of the more widely known [[communications protocol]]s in use operate [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronously]].  The HTTP protocol&nbsp;\u2013 used in the [[World Wide Web]] and in [[web service]]s&nbsp;\u2013 offers an obvious example where a user sends a request for a web page and then waits for a reply.\n\nHowever, scenarios exist in which synchronous behaviour is not appropriate.  For example, [[AJAX]] ([[wikt:asynchronous|Asynchronous]] [[JavaScript]] and [[XML]]) can be used to asynchronously send text, JSON or XML messages to update part of a web page with more relevant information.  [[Google]] uses this approach for their [http://www.google.com/support/websearch/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=106230 Google Suggest], a search feature which sends the user's partially typed queries to Google's servers and returns a list of possible full queries the user might be interested in the process of typing. This list is asynchronously updated as the user types.\n\nOther asynchronous examples exist in event notification systems and publish/subscribe systems.\n* An application may need to notify another that an event has occurred, but does not need to wait for a response.\n* In [[publish/subscribe]] systems, an application \"publishes\" information for any number of clients to read.\nIn both of the above examples it would not make sense for the sender of the information to have to wait if, for example, one of the recipients had crashed.\n\nApplications need not be exclusively synchronous or asynchronous. An interactive application may need to respond to certain parts of a request immediately (such as telling a customer that a sales request has been accepted, and handling the promise to draw on inventory), but may queue other parts (such as completing calculation of billing, forwarding data to the central accounting system, and calling on all sorts of other services) to be done some time later.\n\nIn all these sorts of situations, having a subsystem which performs message-queuing (or alternatively, a broadcast messaging system) can help improve the behavior of the overall system.\n\n==Implementation in UNIX==\nThere are two common message queue implementations in UNIX. One is part of the SYS V API, the other one is part of [[POSIX]].\n\n===SYS V===\nUNIX SYS V implements message passing by keeping an array of linked lists as message queues. Each message queue is identified by its index in the array, and has a unique descriptor. A given index can have multiple possible descriptors.

Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control).

Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch's voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch's stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it (which would mean, if Murdoch dies while at least one of the children is a minor, that Deng would exercise that control).

Stream-oriented ([[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]; data written through a socket requires formatting to preserve message boundaries) or more rarely message-oriented ([[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], [[SCTP]]). || Most operating systems\n|-\n| [[Unix domain socket]] || Similar to an internet socket, but all communication occurs within the kernel. Domain sockets use the file system as their address space. Processes reference a domain socket as an [[inode]], and multiple processes can communicate with one socket || All POSIX operating systems and Windows 10<ref>{{cite web|title=Windows/WSL Interop with AF_UNIX|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/02/07/windowswsl-interop-with-af_unix |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=25 May 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Message queue]] || A data stream similar to a socket, but which usually preserves message boundaries. Typically implemented by the operating system, they allow multiple processes to read and write to the [[message queue]] without being directly connected to each other. || Most operating systems\n|-\n|[[Anonymous pipe]]|| A unidirectional data channel using [[Stdin|standard input and output]]. Data written to the write-end of the pipe is buffered by the operating system until it is read from the read-end of the pipe. Two-way communication between processes can be achieved by using two pipes in opposite \"directions\". || All [[POSIX]] systems, Windows\n|-\n| [[Named pipe]] || A pipe that is treated like a file. Instead of using standard input and output as with an anonymous pipe, processes write to and read from a named pipe, as if it were a regular file. || All POSIX systems, Windows, AmigaOS 2.0+\n|-\n| [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|Shared memory]] || Multiple processes are given access to the same block of [[Memory (computing)|memory]] which creates a shared buffer for the processes to communicate with each other. || All POSIX systems, Windows\n|-\n| [[Message passing]] || Allows multiple programs to communicate using message queues and/or non-OS managed channels. Commonly used in concurrency models. || Used in [[Remote procedure call|RPC]], [[Remote method invocation|RMI]], and [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] paradigms, [[Java RMI]], [[CORBA]], [[Data Distribution Service|DDS]], [[Microsoft Message Queuing|MSMQ]], [[MailSlot]]s, [[QNX]], others\n|-\n| [[Memory-mapped file]] || A file mapped to [[RAM]] and can be modified by changing memory addresses directly instead of outputting to a stream. This shares the same benefits as a standard [[File (computing)|file]]. || All POSIX systems, Windows\n|-\n|}\n\n== Applications ==\n{{prose|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Remote procedure call interfaces ===\n{{main|remote procedure call}}\n\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]]'s [[Java remote method invocation|Remote Method Invocation]] (RMI)\n* [[ONC RPC]]\n* [[XML-RPC]] or [[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP]]\n* [[JSON-RPC]]\n* Message Bus (Mbus) (specified in RFC 3259)\n* [[.NET Remoting]]\n*[[gRPC]]\n\n=== Platform communication stack ===\nThe following are messaging and information systems that utilize IPC mechanisms, but don't implement IPC themselves:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[KDE]]'s [[DCOP|Desktop Communications Protocol]] (DCOP){{snd}} deprecated by D-Bus\n* [[D-Bus]]\n* [[OpenWrt]] uses [https://openwrt.org/docs/techref/ubus ubus] micro bus architecture\n* [[MCAPI]] Multicore Communications API\n* [[SIMPL]] The Synchronous Interprocess Messaging Project for [[Linux]] (SIMPL)\n* [[9P (protocol)|9P]] (Plan&nbsp;9 Filesystem Protocol)\n* [[Distributed Computing Environment]] (DCE)\n* [[Thrift (protocol)|Thrift]]\n* [[ZeroC]]'s [[Internet Communications Engine]] (ICE)\n* [[\u00d8MQ]]\n* [[Enduro/X]] Middleware\n* [http://www.inspirel.com/yami4 YAMI4]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Operating system communication stack ===\nThe following are platform or programming language-specific APIs:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[TIPC|Linux Transparent Inter Process Communication (TIPC)]]\n* [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Apple events]], previously known as Interapplication Communications (IAC)\n* [[ENEA AB|Enea's]] [[LINX (IPC)|LINX]] for Linux (open source) and various DSP and general-purpose processors under [[Operating System Embedded|OSE]]\n* The [[Mach kernel]]'s Mach Ports\n* [[Microsoft]]'s [[ActiveX]], [[Component Object Model]] (COM), [[Microsoft Transaction Server]] ([[COM+]]), [[Distributed Component Object Model]] (DCOM), [[Dynamic Data Exchange]] (DDE), [[Object Linking and Embedding]] (OLE), [[Anonymous pipe#Microsoft Windows|anonymous pipes]], [[Named pipe#Named pipes in Windows|named pipes]], [[Local Procedure Call]], [[MailSlot]]s, [[Message loop in Microsoft Windows|Message loop]], [[MSRPC]], [[.NET Remoting]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] (WCF)\n* [[Novell]]'s [[IPX/SPX|SPX]]\n* [[POSIX]] [[mmap]], [[message queue]]s, [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]],<ref>\"[http://www.tldp.org/pub/Linux/docs/ldp-archived/linuxfocus/English/Archives/lf-2003_01-0281.pdf Concurrent programming - communication between processes]\"</ref> and [[Shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]]\n* [[RISC OS]]'s messages\n* [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] [[Doors (computing)|Doors]]\n* [[System V]]'s message queues, semaphores, and shared memory\n* [[OpenBinder]] Open binder\n* [[QNX]]'s PPS (Persistent Publish/Subscribe) service\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Distributed object models ===\nThe following are platform or programming language specific-APIs that use IPC, but do not themselves implement it:\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Libt2n]] for [[C++]] under Linux only, handles complex objects and exceptions\n* [[PHP]]'s sessions\n* [[Distributed Ruby]]\n* [[Common Object Request Broker Architecture]] (CORBA)\n{{div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[Computer network programming]]\n* [[Communicating Sequential Processes]] (CSP paradigm)\n* [[Data Distribution Service]]\n* [[Protected procedure call]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[W.
