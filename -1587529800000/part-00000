Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as [[hypotension]], low [[Distal convoluted tubule|distal tubule]] [[Sodium in biology|sodium]] concentration, decreased blood volume and high [[sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic]] tone trigger the release of the enzyme [[renin]] from the cells of [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone [[angiotensin]]ogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten [[amino acid]] residues known as [[angiotensin I]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into [[angiotensin II]]. [[Angiotensin converting enzyme|ACE]] is found in the [[pulmonary circulation]] and in the [[endothelium]] of many blood vessels.<ref>Human Physiology, Silverthorn (Pearson Benjamin Cummings 2004){{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent [[vasoconstrictor]]).\n\n===Effects===\nACE inhibitors block the conversion of Angiotensin I (ATI) to Angiotensin II (ATII).<ref name=\"Ogbru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm |title=ACE Inhibitors (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) |accessdate=2010-03-20 |author =Ogbru O |work=MedicineNet.com |publisher=MedicineNet, Inc. | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100326095902/http://www.medicinenet.com/ace_inhibitors/article.htm| archivedate= 26 March 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> They thereby lower [[arteriole|arteriolar]] resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease [[cardiac output]], [[cardiac index]], stroke work, and [[stroke volume|volume]]; lower resistance in blood vessels in the kidneys; and lead to increased [[natriuresis]] (excretion of sodium in the urine).\nRenin increases in concentration in the blood as a result of negative feedback of conversion of ATI to ATII. ATI increases for the same reason; ATII and aldosterone decrease. [[Bradykinin]] increases because of less inactivation by ACE.\n\nUnder normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:\n* Vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (enlargement) induced by ATII may lead to increased blood pressure and hypertension. Further, constriction of the [[efferent arteriole]]s of the kidney leads to increased perfusion pressure in the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]].\n* It contributes to [[ventricular remodeling]] and [[ventricular hypertrophy]] of the heart through stimulation of the [[proto-oncogene]]s [[c-fos]], [[c-jun]], [[c-myc]], [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-B), through fibrogenesis and apoptosis (programmed cell death). \n* Stimulation by ATII of the [[adrenal cortex]] to release [[aldosterone]], a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a \"water-holding\" ion, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.\n* Stimulation of the posterior pituitary to release [[vasopressin]] (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na<sup>+</sup> level in the plasma may fall (hyponatremia), and this is a sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.\n* A decrease renal protein kinase C\n\nDuring the course of ACE inhibitor use, the production of ATII is decreased,{{noteTag|name=|1=ACE inhibitors don't appear to permanently reduce ATII plasma level after cessation of taking it.

ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, leaving AT<sub>2</sub> receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.\n\n===Use in combination===\nThe combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor.

The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R. Vane]] showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II ''in vivo''. Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.<ref name=\"Kevin\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ng KK, Vane JR | title = Conversion of Angiotensin I to Angiotensin II | journal = Nature | volume = 216 | issue = 5117 | pages = 762\u20136 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4294626 | doi = 10.1038/216762a0 | bibcode = 1967Natur.216..762N }}</ref>\n\nBradykinin is rapidly inactivated in the circulating blood, and it disappears completely in a single pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss.

Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''. Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.\n\nCaptopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.\n\nIn 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein. [[Valine]]-proline-proline (VPP) is also liberated in this process\u2014another milk tripeptide with a very similar chemical structure to IPP.

ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, leaving AT<sub>2</sub> receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.\n\n===Use in combination===\nThe combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor. This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways.

The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, [[Kevin K. F. Ng]] and [[John R.

Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF [[teprotide]] (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect ''in vivo''. Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. [[David Cushman]], [[Miguel Ondetti]] and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.\n\nCaptopril was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.\n\nIn 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the [[tripeptide]] [[isoleucine]]-[[proline]]-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein.

VTV now is the largest television network in the nation, broadcast in nine FTA channels and available internationally via satellite. VTV also operates the largest cable network ([[VTVCab]]) and a DTH satellite service. These carry the nine FTA VTV channels: VTV1, VTV2, VTV3, VTV4, VTV5, VTV6, VTV7, VTV8, VTV9 ; twenty-three Vietnamese subscription channels: VTVCab1 ([[VIE Gi\u1ea3i Tr\u00ed]]), VTVCab2 ([[Phim Vi\u1ec7t]]), VTVCab3 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV]]), VTVCab4 ([[V\u0103n Ho\u00e1/LOVE]]), VTVCab5 ([[E Channel]]), [[VTVCab6]] (Hay TV), VTVCab7 ([[O2TV]]), VTVCab8 ([[BiBi]]), VTVCab9 ([[Info TV]]), VTVCab10 ([[VIE Dramas]]), VTVCab11 ([[TV Shopping]], now Northern VGS SHOP), VTVCab12 ([[Style TV]]), VTVCab14 ([[Lotte \u0110\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t Homeshopping]], now VShopping), VTVCab15 ([[UM Channel]]), VTVCab16 ([[B\u00f3ng \u0110\u00e1 TV]]), VTVCab17 ([[Yeah1 TV]]), VTVCab 18 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV HD Tin t\u1ee9c]]), VTVCab19 ([[FilmTV]]), VTVCab20 ([[V Family]]), VTVCab 21 (BiBi+), VTVCab 22 ([[Life TV]]), VTVCab 23 ([[Golf TV]]) and about 45 local & international channels.\n[[File:VTC logo 2018.svg|right|frameless|293x293px]]\n\n===Vietnam Multimedia Corporation (VTC)===\n\n{{Main|Vietnam Multimedia Corporation}}\n\nVTC operates five national channels and is the first provider of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Vietnam.  VTC's DTT service is a subscription service though unauthorized cloning of the signal is rampant.\n\nVTC is a Vietnamese state-owned corporation under Ministry of Post and Telematics (currently the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]])  . It has 4 FTA channels, which is VTC1 - the generalist and news channel, VTC5 - the entertainment channel, TodayTV-VTC7 - the entertainment and series channel, and VTC9 -the Vietnamese entertainment channel, and a number of subscription channels including [[VTC2]] - the economic & ICT channel, [[VTC3]] - The sport & entertainment channel, [[VTC4]] - the fashion and style channel, [[VTC6]] - the movie channel. Three new channels broadcast for examination in 2008 are [[VTC8]] - the second VTC1, [[VTC13]] the music channel and [[VTC11]] - kids-oriented channel, and finally [[VTC12]] - concurrently the Korean-language channel. Since 2010 VTC also launching three channels under deposit appications from the government, these are [[VTC10 - NETVIET]], the cultural and foreign affairs channel, [[VTC14]], Weather and Natural Disaster, and [[VTC16]] (3NTV) - Agriculture-oriented channel\n\nIn 2006, [[VTC Mobile TV]], one of the world's first subscription TV services for mobile phones, became available using [[DVB-H]]. It is operated by [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation]], owners of VTC.\n\nFrom 1/1/2014, VTC Television Network separated from VTC Corporations and transferred to the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]]. From 27/6/2015 the network was transferred to the Radio the [[ Voice of Vietnam ]] and become the television enterprise agency of the network.\n\n===Local stations===\n{{Main|List of local stations in Vietnam}}\n[[File:Logo of Ho Chi Minh Television.svg|252x252px|right]]\nThese include [[Hanoi Radio Television]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTV). The latter is available over most of the [[Mekong Delta]].\n\n===Other subscription TV===\nSince 1991, hotels, restaurants, clubs, government offices and diplomatic organizations in Vietnam have been permitted under license to install and operate satellite dishes to bring in foreign programming. Nowadays, most of people in large cities (such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) subscribe to a cable network. The largest network is [[VCTV (Vietnam)|VCTV]]/[[VTVCab]] (a division of VTV), follows by that of [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTVC), [[Hanoi TV]] (HCAtv/Hanoicab), and [[Saigontourist Cable Television Company|Saigon Tourist Cable Service]] (SCTV) - a joint venture between VTV and Saigon Tourist company.
