This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's ''Robin and the 7 Hoods''. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. Sinatra and Davis complained during private rehearsals about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra.<ref name=\"Haygood p. 466\"/> The tour began at the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena]] on March 13, 1988 to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.<ref name=\"Levy, p. 339\"/>\n\nDavis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs.

Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984's ''Cannonball Run II'', which also starred Davis. This marked the trio's first feature film appearance since 1964's ''Robin and the 7 Hoods''. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. Sinatra and Davis complained during private rehearsals about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra.<ref name=\"Haygood p. 466\"/> The tour began at the [[Oracle Arena|Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena]] on March 13, 1988 to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.<ref name=\"Levy, p. 339\"/>\n\nDavis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs.

She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]''. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate [[David Niven]], and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[George Raft]]. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]''. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film ''Ocean's 11'' as a drunken woman. The 1984 film ''Cannonball Run II'', with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.\n\nA biopic, ''[[The Rat Pack (film)|The Rat Pack]]'', made by [[HBO]] in 1998, starred [[Ray Liotta]] as Sinatra, [[Joe Mantegna]] as Martin and [[Don Cheadle]] as Davis, dramatizing their private lives and, in particular, their roles in the 1960 presidential campaign of [[John F.

spin-offs|spin-off]] of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] which aired on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1979 to December 1, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery

|url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/108/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

IBM continue to be actively involved in the project and continue to put this Java VM at the core of many software offerings. At the Eclipse Foundation, OpenJ9 is classified as an incubator project, with the first release, v0.8.0, delivered in 2018.\n\n==Features==\n\nThe Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM is fully compliant with the Java JVM specification. The same version of the JVM can be used in OpenJDK 8 and later releases, which means that many features and improvements can be exploited by applications that run on different versions of Java.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eclipse OpenJ9; not just any Java Virtual Machine|author=Dan Heidinga|url=https://jaxenter.com/eclipse-openj9-145182.html|work=JAXenter|date=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nEclipse OpenJ9 embeds '''Eclipse OMR''', which provides core runtime components that can be used to build runtime environments for different programming languages. At the OpenJ9 project, an extra layer of code adds the language semantics to provide a runtime environment for Java applications.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eclipse OpenJ9 - an Open Source Java Virtual Machine Based on the Eclipse OMR Project|author=Monica Beckwith|url=https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/03/OMR-OpenJ9|work=InfoQ|date=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe components that make up Eclipse OpenJ9 are described in the following sections:\n\n===JIT Compiler===\nThe Just-In-Time (JIT) improves the performance of Java applications by compiling platform-neutral Java bytecode into native machine code at run time. Not every method that gets called by an application is compiled. Instead, OpenJ9 records the number of times a method is called and triggers JIT compilation at a predefined threshold. The JIT compiler compiles methods at different optimization levels: ''cold'', ''warm'', ''hot'', ''very hot (with profiling)'', or ''scorching''. The hotter the optimization level, the better the expected performance, but the higher the cost in terms of CPU and memory.\nThe higher optimization levels use special techniques such as escape analysis and partial redundancy elimination, or loop through certain optimization sequences more times. Although these techniques use more CPU and memory, the improved performance that is delivered by the optimizations can make the trade-off worthwhile.\n\n===AOT Compiler===\nAhead of Time (AOT) compilation is a mechanism for improving start up performance. Methods are dynamically compiled into AOT code at runtime, which enables the JVM to start an application faster. AOT is enabled automatically when class data sharing is used (''-Xshareclasses'') and doesn\u2019t require any special tuning. OpenJ9 automatically chooses which methods to compile based on heuristics that identify the start-up phase of large applications. For small or short running applications, the ''-Xtune:virtualized'' option should be added to get the most out of AOT-compiled code.\n\n===Class data sharing===\nSharing class data between JVMs has two main benefits:\n\n# Start up performance is improved by placing classes that an application needs when initializing into a shared classes cache.\n# Memory footprint is reduced by sharing common classes between applications that run in separate Java VMs.\n\nUnlike other class data sharing (CDS) implementations, enabling the feature in OpenJ9 requires only one step: setting ''-Xshareclasses'' on the command line when you start your application. When specified, OpenJ9 creates a memory mapped file to store and share the classes in memory. By default, OpenJ9 always shares both the bootstrap and application classes that are loaded by the default system class loader. Another benefit of the OpenJ9 CDS implementation is that the cache is updated dynamically. So when an application loads new classes, the JVM automatically stores them in the cache without any user intervention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Class sharing in Eclipse OpenJ9|author=Ben Corrie|url=https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-class-sharing-openj9/|work=IBM developerWorks|date=6 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nOpenJ9 also provides a public Helper API for integrating class sharing support into custom class loaders, plus several utilities for managing active caches.\n\n===Garbage Collector===\nTo prevent applications running out of memory, objects in the Java heap that are no longer required must be reclaimed. This process is known as [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] (GC). OpenJ9 provides a number of garbage collection policies that are designed around different types of applications and workloads. Choosing the right policy depends on usage and performance goals. By default, OpenJ9 uses the Generational Concurrent (<code>-Xgcpolicy:gencon</code>) policy, which is best suited to transactional applications that have many short lived objects. Alternative policies are available, including those that cater for applications with large Java heaps (<code>-Xgcpolicy:balanced</code>), applications that are sensitive to response-time (<code>-Xgcpolicy:metronome</code>), or applications that require high application throughput (<code>-Xgcpolicy:optthruput</code>).\n\n===Diagnostic Component===\nOpenJ9 contains extensive trace and debugging utilities to help identify, isolate and solve run time problems. Different types of diagnostic data are automatically produced by default when certain events occur, but can also be triggered from the command line. Types of data include:\n\n'''Java dumps:''' These are produced when the JVM ends unexpectedly because of an operating system signal, ''OutOfMemoryError'' exception, or a user initiated keystroke combination. Java dumps summarize the state of the JVM when the event occurs, with most of the information relating to components of the JVM.\n\n'''Heap dumps:''' Heap dumps show all the live objects on the Java heap when the JVM ends because of an ''OutOfMemoryError'' exception or when requested by a user. The information includes object address, type or class name, size, and references to other objects. Analyzing heap dumps might tell you which objects are using large amounts of memory on the Java heap and why these are not being garbage collected.\n\n'''System dumps:''' Often known as core dumps, these are platform-specific and contain a raw binary dump of the process memory. This dump has a complete copy of the Java heap, including the contents of all Java objects in the application. OpenJ9 tools are available to process the system dump into a readable format for analysis.\n\n'''Garbage collection data:''' To analyze garbage collection problems you can enable verbose logging, which provides data on all garbage collection operations including initialization, stop-the-world processing, finalization, reference processing, and allocation failures. For even more detailed analysis, you can turn on garbage collection tracing.\n\n'''Trace data:''' The OpenJ9 trace facility can be used to trace applications, Java methods, or internal JVM operations with minimal impact on performance.\n\n'''JIT data:''' If a general protection fault or abort event takes place, the JIT produces a small binary dump that can be analyzed by OpenJ9 developers to help determine the root cause.\n\n'''Shared classes data:''' The shared classes data component provides some verbose options that can be used at runtime to show cache activity. The ''printStats'' and ''printAllStats'' utilities allow you to analyze the contents of a shared class cache.\n\nThe diagnostic component also includes the DTFJ application programming interface, which can be used to build diagnostic tools. DTFJ works with data from a system dump or a Java dump.\n\n==Adoption==\n* [[AdoptOpenJDK]]: Community builds of '''OpenJDK with OpenJ9''' are built and tested at the [https://adoptopenjdk.net/index.html AdoptOpenJDK project].\n* IBM: OpenJ9 is a component of the [https://developer.ibm.com/javasdk/ IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition, Version 8].\n* [[OpenWhisk|Apache OpenWhisk]]: OpenWhisk is using OpenJ9 as the JVM for the [https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions.md Actions].<ref>{{cite web|title=Apache OpenWhisk Java actions on Eclipse OpenJ9 Runtime|author=Parameswaran Selvam|url=https://medium.com/@ParamSelvam/apache-openwhisk-java-actions-on-eclipse-openj9-runtime-b21f1239d404|work=medium|date=9 March 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]]: The Eclipse Foundation have approved the inclusion of OpenJDK 8 with OpenJ9 in the Eclipse [[Integrated Development Environment]] (IDE).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n* [[HotSpot]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n**[https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/ OpenJ9 user documentation]\n*[https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.openj9 Eclipse Foundation OpenJ9 project page]\n*{{GitHub|eclipse/openj9}}\n**{{GitHub|eclipse/omr}}\n*[https://blog.openj9.org/ OpenJ9 blog]\n*[http://abstract.cs.washington.edu/wiki/index.php/UbiComp:Hacking:Java:J9 UbiComp:Hacking:Java:J9] at [[University of Washington]] Computer Science and Engineering\n\n{{Java Virtual Machine}}\n{{Eclipse Foundation}}\n\n[[Category:IBM software|J9]]\n[[Category:Java virtual machine]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n| name = Eclipse OpenJ9\n| logo = \n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| author = [[IBM]]\n| developer = [[Eclipse Foundation]]\n| programming language = [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Assembly language|assembly]]\n| latest release version = 0.18.1\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2020|01|24}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = \n| operating system = [[Linux]], [[AIX]], [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[z/OS]], [[IBM i]]\n| genre = [[Java virtual machine]]\n| license = [[Apache 2 License]]<br />[[Eclipse Public License]] 2.0\n}}\n\n'''Eclipse OpenJ9''' is a high performance, scalable, [[Java virtual machine]] (JVM) implementation that is fully compliant with the Java Virtual Machine Specification.<ref>{{cite news|title= New Open Source JVM optimized for Cloud and Microservices|author=Leonardo Zanivan|url=https://medium.com/criciumadev/new-open-source-jvm-optimized-for-cloud-and-microservices-c75a41aa987d|work=medium|date=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nOpenJ9 can be built as a component of [[OpenJDK]] v8 and later, with prebuilt binaries available at the [[AdoptOpenJDK]] project for a number of platforms including Linux and Windows.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hello OpenJ9 on Windows, I Didn't Expect You So Soon!|author=Holger Voormann|url=https://dzone.com/articles/hello-openj9-on-windows-i-didnt-expect-you-so-soon|work=DZone|date=14 March 2018}}</ref> OpenJ9 is also a core component of the IBM developer kit, which is embedded in many IBM middleware products, including [[WebSphere Application Server]] and [[IBM WebSphere Application Server#WebSphere Liberty Versions|Websphere Liberty]].

They are believed to have been nomadic hunter-gatherers following animal migrations. Early stone tools have been discovered in various fields within the county. At the time of European contact, Native Americans made their homes in the region.\n\nDinwiddie County was formed May 1, 1752, from [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]]. The county is named for [[Robert Dinwiddie]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]], 1751\u201358. The county raised several militia units that would fight in the American Revolution.\n\nDinwiddie County was the birthplace of Elizabeth (Burwell) Hobbs Keckly, a [[free black]] dressmaker who worked for two presidents' wives: Mrs. [[Jefferson Davis]] and later [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. [[Thomas Day (North Carolina)|Thomas Day]] was also a native; he was well known later at [[Milton, North Carolina]], as a free black cabinetmaker. Another native son was Dr. Thomas Stewart, perhaps America's first free black 18th-century rural physician.<ref>''Virginia Gazette'' Nov. 1778 as found in Freeafricanamericans.com</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the [[Battle of Lewis's Farm]] was fought along Quaker Road [Rt. 660]. It took place on March 29, 1865. This was the first in several attempts by Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to cut [[Robert E. Lee]]'s final supply line\u2014the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|Southside Railroad]]\u2014in the spring of 1865. Here the [[Union Army|Union]] forces led by Brig. Gen. [[Joshua L. Chamberlain]] engaged [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] under Maj. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]]. After sharp fighting, the Union troops entrenched nearby along the Boydton Plank Road, and Johnson withdrew to his lines at White Oak Road. The Union army cut the rail line four days later, after capturing Five Forks on April 1, 1865, at the [[Battle of Five Forks]]. Several other engagements were fought in Dinwiddie County, including the [[Battle of Dinwiddie Court House]], [[Battle of Sutherland's Station]], and [[Battle of White Oak Road]].\n\nThe [[Dinwiddie County Historical Society]] currently occupies the historic [[Dinwiddie County Court House]].\n\n===Civil War battles===\n* [[Battle of Peebles' Farm]]\n* [[Battle of Lewis's Farm]]\n* [[Battle of Dinwiddie Court House]]\n* [[Battle of White Oak Road]]\n* [[Battle of Five Forks]]\n* [[Battle of Sutherland's Station]]\n\n==Geography==\nDinwiddie is located in southern Virginia, southwest of the independent city of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]].

They are believed to have been nomadic hunter-gatherers following animal migrations. Early stone tools have been discovered in various fields within the county. At the time of European contact, Native Americans made their homes in the region.\n\nDinwiddie County was formed May 1, 1752, from [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]]. The county is named for [[Robert Dinwiddie]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]], 1751\u201358. The county raised several militia units that would fight in the American Revolution.\n\nDinwiddie County was the birthplace of Elizabeth (Burwell) Hobbs Keckly, a [[free black]] dressmaker who worked for two presidents' wives: Mrs. [[Jefferson Davis]] and later [[Mary Todd Lincoln]]. [[Thomas Day (North Carolina)|Thomas Day]] was also a native; he was well known later at [[Milton, North Carolina]], as a free black cabinetmaker. Another native son was Dr. Thomas Stewart, perhaps America's first free black 18th-century rural physician.<ref>''Virginia Gazette'' Nov. 1778 as found in Freeafricanamericans.com</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the [[Battle of Lewis's Farm]] was fought along Quaker Road [Rt. 660]. It took place on March 29, 1865. This was the first in several attempts by Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to cut [[Robert E. Lee]]'s final supply line\u2014the [[Southside Railroad (Virginia)|Southside Railroad]]\u2014in the spring of 1865. Here the [[Union Army|Union]] forces led by Brig. Gen. [[Joshua L. Chamberlain]] engaged [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] under Maj. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]]. After sharp fighting, the Union troops entrenched nearby along the Boydton Plank Road, and Johnson withdrew to his lines at White Oak Road. The Union army cut the rail line four days later, after capturing Five Forks on April 1, 1865, at the [[Battle of Five Forks]]. Several other engagements were fought in Dinwiddie County, including the [[Battle of Dinwiddie Court House]], [[Battle of Sutherland's Station]], and [[Battle of White Oak Road]].\n\nThe [[Dinwiddie County Historical Society]] currently occupies the historic [[Dinwiddie County Court House]].\n\n===Civil War battles===\n* [[Battle of Peebles' Farm]]\n* [[Battle of Lewis's Farm]]\n* [[Battle of Dinwiddie Court House]]\n* [[Battle of White Oak Road]]\n* [[Battle of Five Forks]]\n* [[Battle of Sutherland's Station]]\n\n==Geography==\nDinwiddie is located in southern Virginia, southwest of the independent city of [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]].

[[American Civil War]] era.]]\n\nFloyd County's recorded history begins with the arrival of traders, trappers and hunters in Southwest Virginia in the 18th century. The earliest known travel way through present day Floyd County was the [[Trader's Path]], running from east to west across the [[Roanoke River]] where Back Creek enters the river, by John Mason's, R. Poage's, the headwaters of Back Creek and southwest over Bent Mountain. The trail continued westward through the [[Little River (New River)|Little River]] area to the Lead Mines.\n\nThe first known attempts to settle the area appear to have been made during the 1740s. In 1745 the Virginia Council granted James Patton, of Augusta County, among others, {{convert|100,000|acre|km2}} on the New River and the westward flowing waters, including the Little River area. In 1749 the Royal Company of Virginia also received a grant on the westward flowing waters, putting the two companies in competition with one another to settle the area. The first surveying of the land occurred in the late 1740s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floydcova.org/visitors/history.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303015122/http://www.floydcova.org/visitors/history.shtml |archivedate=2011-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 15, 1831, the General Assembly of Virginia passed an act creating the present county of Floyd out of the county [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery]]. The new county was named for the then Governor of Virginia, [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]].<ref>McDonald, James J. (1907). ''Life in Old Virginia'', p. 368.  The Old Virginia Publishing Co. (Inc.)</ref> The new county's courthouse was completed in 1834. In 1870 a portion of [[Franklin County, Virginia|Franklin County]] was added to Floyd County. The first Commonwealth's Attorney was [[William Ballard Preston]], a nephew of John Floyd, who would later serve as Secretary of the United States Navy.  Preston was followed in later years by [[Jubal Early]], who would later serve as a general for the [[Confederate Army]].<ref>http://www.floydcova.org/visitors/history_floyd_county.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[county seat]] of Floyd County was first called Jacksonville for [[Andrew Jackson]], seventh President of the United States (1829\u20131837). Jacksonville was first incorporated in 1858 and then re-incorporated on February 19, 1892 to expand the town boundaries. On January 23, 1896, the General Assembly passed an Act officially changing the name of the Town of Jacksonville to the town of Floyd.\n\nThe county became a destination for those involved in the [[counterculture]] during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly those who wanted to live in closer contact with nature.<ref>Blackwell, Mary Alice & Causey, Anne Patterson (9th ed. 2005). ''Insider's Guide to Virginia's Blue Ridge'', p. 39. The Globe Pequot Press.</ref>  In the late 1990s, the Rivendell community was established by a group of Christians so they could practice a lifestyle consistent with their [[Reformed Churches]]' interpretations of the [[Bible]] and also, in part, to be better isolated from possible societal disruptions caused by the [[year 2000 problem]]. Most of the original members of this community have moved on.\n\nFloyd County was also a setting for the ministry of [[Bob Childress|Reverend Bob Childress]], whose life was chronicled in the book ''The Man Who Moved a Mountain''.\n\nThe county's location directly adjacent to both the [[Roanoke, VA MSA|Roanoke]] and the [[Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, VA MSA|Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford Metropolitan Statistical Areas]] have contributed to modest population growth in contrast to most rural counties in Southwest Virginia.

[[Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve|Buffalo Mountain]], at {{convert|3971|ft|m}}, is the highest point in the county.\n\nFloyd County is situated atop a high plateau of the Blue Ridge Mountains which divides the eastward flowing from the westward flowing waters. With the high topography, no streams flow into Floyd County. The county is drained primarily by [[Little River (New River)|Little River]] and its tributaries which flow into New River below the [[Claytor Lake]] Dam and, in turn, by way of the [[Kanawha River]], the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Mississippi River]], into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  The headwaters of the south fork of the [[Roanoke River]] are in the northeastern part of the county. No water flows into Floyd County - it all flows out - one particular fast stream is Shooting Creek. Named for its speed over rocks. This creek today follows Shooting Creek Road from Floyd into Franklin County. In later  years, it would become the site of moonshine liquor  distilleries and the lawlessness that surrounded this industry.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Franklin County, Virginia]] \u2013 east\n* [[Patrick County, Virginia]] \u2013 southeast\n* [[Carroll County, Virginia]] \u2013 southwest\n* [[Pulaski County, Virginia]] \u2013 northwest\n* [[Montgomery County, Virginia]] \u2013 northwest\n* [[Roanoke County, Virginia]] \u2013 north\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (part)\n* [[Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve]]\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|221}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|8}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 4453\n|1850= 6458\n|1860= 8236\n|1870= 9824\n|1880= 13255\n|1890= 14405\n|1900= 15388\n|1910= 14092\n|1920= 13115\n|1930= 11698\n|1940= 11967\n|1950= 11351\n|1960= 10462\n|1970= 9775\n|1980= 11563\n|1990= 12005\n|2000= 13874\n|2010= 15279\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15795\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

[[American Civil War]] era.]]\n\nFloyd County's recorded history begins with the arrival of traders, trappers and hunters in Southwest Virginia in the 18th century. The earliest known travel way through present day Floyd County was the [[Trader's Path]], running from east to west across the [[Roanoke River]] where Back Creek enters the river, by John Mason's, R. Poage's, the headwaters of Back Creek and southwest over Bent Mountain. The trail continued westward through the [[Little River (New River)|Little River]] area to the Lead Mines.\n\nThe first known attempts to settle the area appear to have been made during the 1740s. In 1745 the Virginia Council granted James Patton, of Augusta County, among others, {{convert|100,000|acre|km2}} on the New River and the westward flowing waters, including the Little River area. In 1749 the Royal Company of Virginia also received a grant on the westward flowing waters, putting the two companies in competition with one another to settle the area. The first surveying of the land occurred in the late 1740s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.floydcova.org/visitors/history.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303015122/http://www.floydcova.org/visitors/history.shtml |archivedate=2011-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 15, 1831, the General Assembly of Virginia passed an act creating the present county of Floyd out of the county [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery]]. The new county was named for the then Governor of Virginia, [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]].<ref>McDonald, James J. (1907). ''Life in Old Virginia'', p. 368.  The Old Virginia Publishing Co. (Inc.)</ref> The new county's courthouse was completed in 1834. In 1870 a portion of [[Franklin County, Virginia|Franklin County]] was added to Floyd County. The first Commonwealth's Attorney was [[William Ballard Preston]], a nephew of John Floyd, who would later serve as Secretary of the United States Navy.  Preston was followed in later years by [[Jubal Early]], who would later serve as a general for the [[Confederate Army]].<ref>http://www.floydcova.org/visitors/history_floyd_county.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[county seat]] of Floyd County was first called Jacksonville for [[Andrew Jackson]], seventh President of the United States (1829\u20131837). Jacksonville was first incorporated in 1858 and then re-incorporated on February 19, 1892 to expand the town boundaries. On January 23, 1896, the General Assembly passed an Act officially changing the name of the Town of Jacksonville to the town of Floyd.\n\nThe county became a destination for those involved in the [[counterculture]] during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly those who wanted to live in closer contact with nature.<ref>Blackwell, Mary Alice & Causey, Anne Patterson (9th ed. 2005). ''Insider's Guide to Virginia's Blue Ridge'', p. 39. The Globe Pequot Press.</ref>  In the late 1990s, the Rivendell community was established by a group of Christians so they could practice a lifestyle consistent with their [[Reformed Churches]]' interpretations of the [[Bible]] and also, in part, to be better isolated from possible societal disruptions caused by the [[year 2000 problem]]. Most of the original members of this community have moved on.\n\nFloyd County was also a setting for the ministry of [[Bob Childress|Reverend Bob Childress]], whose life was chronicled in the book ''The Man Who Moved a Mountain''.\n\nThe county's location directly adjacent to both the [[Roanoke, VA MSA|Roanoke]] and the [[Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, VA MSA|Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford Metropolitan Statistical Areas]] have contributed to modest population growth in contrast to most rural counties in Southwest Virginia.

[[Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve|Buffalo Mountain]], at {{convert|3971|ft|m}}, is the highest point in the county.\n\nFloyd County is situated atop a high plateau of the Blue Ridge Mountains which divides the eastward flowing from the westward flowing waters. With the high topography, no streams flow into Floyd County. The county is drained primarily by [[Little River (New River)|Little River]] and its tributaries which flow into New River below the [[Claytor Lake]] Dam and, in turn, by way of the [[Kanawha River]], the [[Ohio River]] and the [[Mississippi River]], into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  The headwaters of the south fork of the [[Roanoke River]] are in the northeastern part of the county. No water flows into Floyd County - it all flows out - one particular fast stream is Shooting Creek. Named for its speed over rocks. This creek today follows Shooting Creek Road from Floyd into Franklin County. In later  years, it would become the site of moonshine liquor  distilleries and the lawlessness that surrounded this industry.\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Franklin County, Virginia]] \u2013 east\n* [[Patrick County, Virginia]] \u2013 southeast\n* [[Carroll County, Virginia]] \u2013 southwest\n* [[Pulaski County, Virginia]] \u2013 northwest\n* [[Montgomery County, Virginia]] \u2013 northwest\n* [[Roanoke County, Virginia]] \u2013 north\n\n===National protected area===\n* [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (part)\n* [[Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve]]\n\n===Major highways===\n* {{Jct|state=VA|US|221}}\n* {{Jct|state=VA|SR|8}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 4453\n|1850= 6458\n|1860= 8236\n|1870= 9824\n|1880= 13255\n|1890= 14405\n|1900= 15388\n|1910= 14092\n|1920= 13115\n|1930= 11698\n|1940= 11967\n|1950= 11351\n|1960= 10462\n|1970= 9775\n|1980= 11563\n|1990= 12005\n|2000= 13874\n|2010= 15279\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=15795\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Russian torpedoes are often named descriptively for their characteristics \u2013 examples include \"acoustic homing\" or \"electric torpedo\", all in Russian acronyms.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n\nModel 53-27 (1927) with 265&nbsp;kg of TNT was developed domestically in the so-called {{Interlanguage link multi|Ostekhbureau|WD=Q4338659}}, and it had a poor 3.7&nbsp;km range at 45 [[knot (unit)|knot]]s. In 1932 USSR bought in Italy several types of torpedoes, and the 21-inch model of Whitehead plant in [[Rijeka]] (in the Soviet Union it was designated 53F) was considered superior. After adapting several features from the latter in unsuccessful 53-36 the decision was made to copy 53F. Resulting 53-38 (3 speed regimes, range up to 10&nbsp;km, 300&nbsp;kg of trotyl in warhead) was later upgraded to 53-38U (400&nbsp;kg of TNT, roughly the same characteristics) and then redesigned in 53-39 (317&nbsp;kg, up to 51 kt), considered to be one of the fastest in the world at the time (another were secret Japanese oxygen torpedoes and the Italian Silure Tipo W. 270/533,4 \u00d7 7,20 Veloce).\n\n===World War 2===\n\nThe 53-38/53-38U, which had entered service in 1938\u20131939, were the main Soviet torpedoes in [[World War 2]]; they proved to be fairly reliable and effective. The two deadliest sinkings in history (the Nazi 25,484-[[Gross register tons|ton]] military transport ''[[MV Wilhelm Gustloff]]'' and the troop transport ''[[MV Goya]]'') were performed by two soviet submarines using 53-38's on 30 January and 16 April 1945; both ships were hit on first attempt and sank within minutes in despite of difficult visibility conditions and the presence of escorts. Notably, all three torpedoes launched against the ''Gustloff'' hit and exploded with catastrophic results, not a common feat in those times and conditions.\n\nAnother notable sinking with 53-38/53-38U's was the 14,660-ton ''[[SS General von Steuben|General von Steuben]]''. During the [[Black Sea campaigns (1941\u201344)]], Soviet submarines sank at least 29,000 tons of enemy shipping, mostly using mines, shellfire and 53-58 torpedoes.\n\nThe new 53-39 (entering service in 1941) was very fast and effective but only available in limited numbers, while the ET-80 (1942-1943) was the first Soviet electric torpedo and crews didn't trust it because of its teething and rushed induction problems.\n\n===Cold War===\n\nThe first Soviet torpedo with passive-homing capability was the SAET-50 (1950), which was an anti-ship weapon used on submarines. The 53-61 was the first Soviet homing torpedo to exceed 40 knots.\n\nThe 53-65 torpedo family are Russian made, [[wake-homing]] torpedoes designed to destroy surface ships. The 53-65 became operational in 1965, while the 53-65K and 53-65M both became operational in 1969. The 53-65KE is an exported version. China received an unknown number of 53-65KE torpedoes from Russia after purchasing 4 Kilo class submarines in the 1990s.\n\nThe Type 53 torpedo is carried by almost all Russian submarines, including the [[Kilo class submarine|Kilo class]] and the {{sclass-|Akula|submarine}}.\n\nThe Type 53-65 torpedo is considered especially threatening by the [[United States Navy]] because they do not respond to usual torpedo countermeasures.  Normal countermeasures are decoys that use noise to divert homing torpedoes, but the Type 53-65 uses sensors that detect the churn made by ships moving, then follows the chopped water in an S-pattern between the wakes until impact from up to {{convert|11.8|mi|km nmi|abbr=on}} away.  Wake homing torpedoes have caused the U.S. Navy to develop the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) system that employs a maneuvering Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) that seeks and intercepts an incoming torpedo.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2013/06/20/navy-develops-torpedo-killing-torpedo Navy Develops Torpedo Killing Torpedo] - News.USNI.org, 20 June 2013</ref>\n\n===UGST===\n\nThe last entry in the class is the [[UGST torpedo|UGST (Fizik-1)]] heavy deepwater torpedo with a range of up to 60&nbsp;km (export versions are limited to 40&nbsp;km). It differs from most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or [[High-test peroxide|peroxide]] propulsion, it uses the [[Otto fuel]] [[axial engine]], which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive [[wake homing]], features a [[phased array]] [[active sonar]] and an improved [[wire guidance]] system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow [[propeller]] shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before. It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s,<ref>http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTRussian_post-WWII.php</ref> but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name,<ref>http://navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/2017/march-2017-navy-naval-forces-defense-industry-technology-maritime-security-global-news/4995-improved-ugst-fizik-torpedo-futlyar-to-enter-russian-navy-service-in-2018.html</ref> being quickly replaced by the new-generation [[Futlyar]] (''Fizik-2'').

Russian torpedoes are often named descriptively for their characteristics \u2013 examples include \"acoustic homing\" or \"electric torpedo\", all in Russian acronyms.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n\nModel 53-27 (1927) with 265&nbsp;kg of TNT was developed domestically in the so-called {{Interlanguage link multi|Ostekhbureau|WD=Q4338659}}, and it had a poor 3.7&nbsp;km range at 45 [[knot]]s. In 1932 USSR bought in Italy several types of torpedoes, and the 21-inch model of Whitehead plant in [[Rijeka]] (in the Soviet Union it was designated 53F) was considered superior. After adapting several features from the latter in unsuccessful 53-36 the decision was made to copy 53F. Resulting 53-38 (3 speed regimes, range up to 10&nbsp;km, 300&nbsp;kg of trotyl in warhead) was later upgraded to 53-38U (400&nbsp;kg of TNT, roughly the same characteristics) and then redesigned in 53-39 (317&nbsp;kg, up to 51 kt), considered to be one of the fastest in the world at the time (another were secret Japanese oxygen torpedoes and the Italian Silure Tipo W. 270/533,4 \u00d7 7,20 Veloce).\n\n===World War 2===\n\nThe 53-38/53-38U, which had entered service in 1938\u20131939, were the main Soviet torpedoes in [[World War 2]]; they proved to be fairly reliable and effective. The two deadliest sinkings in history (the Nazi 25,484-[[Gross register tons|ton]] military transport ''[[MV Wilhelm Gustloff]]'' and the troop transport ''[[MV Goya]]'') were performed by two soviet submarines using 53-38's on 30 January and 16 April 1945; both ships were hit on first attempt and sank within minutes in despite of difficult visibility conditions and the presence of escorts. Notably, all three torpedoes launched against the ''Gustloff'' hit and exploded with catastrophic results, not a common feat in those times and conditions.\n\nAnother notable sinking with 53-38/53-38U's was the 14,660-ton ''[[SS General von Steuben|General von Steuben]]''. During the [[Black Sea campaigns (1941\u201344)]], Soviet submarines sank at least 29,000 tons of enemy shipping, mostly using mines, shellfire and 53-58 torpedoes.\n\nThe new 53-39 (entering service in 1941) was very fast and effective but only available in limited numbers, while the ET-80 (1942-1943) was the first Soviet electric torpedo and crews didn't trust it because of its teething and rushed induction problems.\n\n===Cold War===\n\nThe first Soviet torpedo with passive-homing capability was the SAET-50 (1950), which was an anti-ship weapon used on submarines. The 53-61 was the first Soviet homing torpedo to exceed 40 knots.\n\nThe 53-65 torpedo family are Russian made, [[wake-homing]] torpedoes designed to destroy surface ships. The 53-65 became operational in 1965, while the 53-65K and 53-65M both became operational in 1969. The 53-65KE is an exported version. China received an unknown number of 53-65KE torpedoes from Russia after purchasing 4 Kilo class submarines in the 1990s.\n\nThe Type 53 torpedo is carried by almost all Russian submarines, including the [[Kilo class submarine|Kilo class]] and the {{sclass-|Akula|submarine}}.\n\nThe Type 53-65 torpedo is considered especially threatening by the [[United States Navy]] because they do not respond to usual torpedo countermeasures.  Normal countermeasures are decoys that use noise to divert homing torpedoes, but the Type 53-65 uses sensors that detect the churn made by ships moving, then follows the chopped water in an S-pattern between the wakes until impact from up to {{convert|11.8|mi|km nmi|abbr=on}} away.  Wake homing torpedoes have caused the U.S. Navy to develop the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) system that employs a maneuvering Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) that seeks and intercepts an incoming torpedo.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2013/06/20/navy-develops-torpedo-killing-torpedo Navy Develops Torpedo Killing Torpedo] - News.USNI.org, 20 June 2013</ref>\n\n===UGST===\n\nThe last entry in the class is the [[UGST torpedo|UGST (Fizik-1)]] heavy deepwater torpedo with a range of up to 60&nbsp;km (export versions are limited to 40&nbsp;km). It differs from most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or [[High-test peroxide|peroxide]] propulsion, it uses the [[Otto fuel]] [[axial engine]], which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive [[wake homing]], features a [[phased array]] [[active sonar]] and an improved [[wire guidance]] system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow [[propeller]] shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before. It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s,<ref>http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WTRussian_post-WWII.php</ref> but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name,<ref>http://navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/2017/march-2017-navy-naval-forces-defense-industry-technology-maritime-security-global-news/4995-improved-ugst-fizik-torpedo-futlyar-to-enter-russian-navy-service-in-2018.html</ref> being quickly replaced by the new-generation [[Futlyar]] (''Fizik-2'').

By 1701, the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] [[Iroquois]] had overrun the entire Virginia Piedmont, which they sold to [[Virginia Colony]] in 1721 at the Treaty of Albany.\n\nThe area which is now Fluvanna County was once considered part of [[Henrico County]], one of the original [[Shires of Virginia|shires]] of the [[Virginia Colony]]. Henrico was divided in 1727 and the Fluvanna County area became a part of [[Goochland County]]. In 1744 Goochland was divided and the area presently known as Fluvanna became a part of [[Albemarle County]]. When [[Amherst County]], [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]] and [[Buckingham County, Virginia|Buckingham County]] were split off from Albemarle County, the Albemarle County Seat was moved in 1762 from [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]] to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].  When the Albemarle County seat was moved citizens in the Fluvanna area would now have to trek over the [[Southwest Mountains]] to reach the new seat at Charlottesville.  Fluvanna area citizens lobbied the Virginia General Assembly to create a new county. Finally, in 1777, Albemarle County was divided again and Fluvanna County established.\n\nThe county was named for the Fluvanna River, a name once given to the [[James River]] west of [[Columbia, Virginia|Columbia]]. \"Fluvanna\" means \"Anne's River\", in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], who reigned until 1714.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

It was sometimes referred to as \"Old Flu.\"<ref>{{cite news |agency=The Tennessean |date=4 May 1840}}</ref>\n\nFluvanna was defended by six militia companies during the American Revolutionary War. The county was invaded by British forces in 1781 who destroyed the Point of Fork Arsenal.  From an initial 882 \"tithables,\" the population reached 3,300 by 1782. Columbia was formed in 1788 with Bernardsburg and Wilmington following soon after. Lyles Baptist Church was organized in 1774 and the formation of the Methodist denomination had its roots in a Conference held in Fluvanna in 1779. The \"Brick Union\" Church was built in 1825 for the use of Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians. The village of Fork Union grew up around the Church.\n\nWhen Palmyra was made the county seat in 1828 it quickly became a thriving town after the new courthouse was completed in 1830.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, [[Thomas Jefferson]] improved the navigability of the Rivanna River, as he owned much property along its upper course, e.g. [[Shadwell (Virginia)|Shadwell]] and [[Monticello]] plantations. Improvements included in the first generation (through 1830) were [[sluice]] cuts, small dams and [[batteaux]] [[lock (water transport)|locks]].\n\nSecond-generation (1840\u20131870) improvements made by others included construction of long stretches of [[canal]], serviced by large locks, many of which are still visible along the river. Shortly after the completion of the initial Rivanna navigational works, Virginia requested that the river be opened to public usage. Jefferson reportedly initially refused, but the state insisted and the Rivanna became an integral part of the central Virginian transportation network.  The route serviced a large community of farmsteads, plantations throughout Albemarle and Fluvanna counties. It also was lined by increasing numbers of industrial facilities, such as those at Union Mills. Construction of the larger mills prompted the great improvements to navigation. For instance, Union Mills featured a two-and-a-half-mile long canal and towpath, and one upper and two massive lower locks, all directly upon the river.\n\nWhere the Rivanna meets the James River at Columbia, the [[Rivanna Connexion Canal]] merged with a much longer canal. (The series of locks which connected the two canals lie just outside the Town of Columbia and are mostly buried by sediment today). In 1840, the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] was constructed adjacent to the north bank of the James River and opened to traffic. The new canal was part of a planned link between the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the James and the [[Kanawha River|Kanawha]] rivers; it was intended to connect via the [[Ohio River]], to the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The canal was used by packet and freight boats, which replaced the earlier shallow-draft [[batteau]] for commerce. These boats brought goods and passengers to and from Richmond and points beyond. Long a dream of early Virginians such as [[George Washington]], who was a surveyor early in his career, the canal was never completed as envisioned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn the batteaux era, [[Milton, Albemarle County, Virginia|Milton]] was the [[head of navigation]] on the river.  By the early nineteenth century, horse-drawn canal boats were traveling all the way upstream to Charlottesville.  The head of navigation was located at the point where the Fredericksburg Road (now [[Virginia State Route 20|VA 20]]) and Three Chopt Road ([[U.S. Route 250]]), the primary road to Richmond, met and entered the city at the Free Bridge, establishing the city as a major commercial hub.\n\nWhile no [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battles were fought in Fluvanna, Union soldiers burned mills and bridges and damaged the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] to disrupt traffic and commerce. During the [[American Civil War]] more than 1,200 of the county's citizens served in the Confederate forces. Its citizens served in [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] units during the war, including the [[Fluvanna Artillery]].\n\nThe canal was repaired after the war, but traffic never returned to pre-war levels, as [[railroad]]s were being constructed throughout the state and were more efficient. After many years of trying to compete with the ever-expanding railroad network, the James River and Kanawha Canal was conveyed to a new railroad company by a deed dated March 4, 1880. Railroad construction workers promptly started laying tracks on the [[towpath]]. The new [[Richmond and Allegheny Railroad]] offered a water-level route from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] just east of [[West Virginia]] near [[Clifton Forge, Virginia|Jackson's River Station]] (now Clifton Forge) through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] at [[Balcony Falls, Virginia|Balcony Falls]] to Richmond. In 1888 the railroad was leased, and later purchased, by [[Collis P. Huntington]]'s [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]].\n\n[[Fork Union Military Academy]] (FUMA) was initially founded as Fork Union Academy in October 1898 by Dr. William E. Hatcher, a prominent local Baptist minister. The first class had 19 boys and girls. In 1902, the academy took on a military structure to provide organization, discipline, and physical development for the boys of what was a rapidly growing school. In 1913, the academy became an all-male institution and changed its name to Fork Union Military Academy. That same year, the Academy began receiving support from the Baptist General Association of Virginia, which has continued into the 21st century. FUMA is known for its One Subject Plan as well as Post Graduate Football team that has many NFL players and [[Heisman Trophy]] winners as alumni.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nEarly in the 20th century, the C&O built a new line between the James River Line at [[Strathmore, Virginia|Strathmore]] and the Piedmont Subdivision on the old [[Virginia Central Railroad]]'s line at [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]]. The [[Virginia Air Line Railway]] was built to move loads that were too high or too wide to pass through the tunnels of the [[Blue Ridge Tunnel|Blue Ridge Mountain complex]] between Charlottesville and [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]]. Additionally, [[coal]] trains from West Virginia headed eastbound for [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Northern Virginia]] were routed on the new line to avoid steep mountain grades. The VAL was completed on September 29, 1909. A new freight station was built at Palmyra. The tracks of the VAL were abandoned in 1975, as railroad freight traffic had declined.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 3921\n|1800= 4623\n|1810= 4775\n|1820= 6704\n|1830= 8221\n|1840= 8812\n|1850= 9487\n|1860= 10353\n|1870= 9875\n|1880= 10802\n|1890= 9508\n|1900= 9050\n|1910= 8323\n|1920= 8547\n|1930= 7466\n|1940= 7088\n|1950= 7121\n|1960= 7227\n|1970= 7621\n|1980= 10244\n|1990= 12429\n|2000= 20047\n|2010= 25691\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26783\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

By 1701, the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] [[Iroquois]] had overrun the entire Virginia Piedmont, which they sold to [[Virginia Colony]] in 1721 at the Treaty of Albany.\n\nThe area which is now Fluvanna County was once considered part of [[Henrico County]], one of the original [[Shires of Virginia|shires]] of the [[Virginia Colony]]. Henrico was divided in 1727 and the Fluvanna County area became a part of [[Goochland County]]. In 1744 Goochland was divided and the area presently known as Fluvanna became a part of [[Albemarle County]]. When [[Amherst County]], [[Nelson County, Virginia|Nelson County]] and [[Buckingham County, Virginia|Buckingham County]] were split off from Albemarle County, the Albemarle County Seat was moved in 1762 from [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]] to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].  When the Albemarle County seat was moved citizens in the Fluvanna area would now have to trek over the [[Southwest Mountains]] to reach the new seat at Charlottesville.  Fluvanna area citizens lobbied the Virginia General Assembly to create a new county. Finally, in 1777, Albemarle County was divided again and Fluvanna County established.\n\nThe county was named for the Fluvanna River, a name once given to the [[James River]] west of [[Columbia, Virginia|Columbia]]. \"Fluvanna\" means \"Anne's River\", in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], who reigned until 1714.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA128#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

Off. | author=Gannett, Henry | year=1905 | pages=128}}</ref> Located in the Piedmont above the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]], the county has the James and [[Rivanna River|Rivanna]] rivers running through it. It was sometimes referred to as \"Old Flu.\"<ref>{{cite news |agency=The Tennessean |date=4 May 1840}}</ref>\n\nFluvanna was defended by six militia companies during the American Revolutionary War. The county was invaded by British forces in 1781 who destroyed the Point of Fork Arsenal.  From an initial 882 \"tithables,\" the population reached 3,300 by 1782. Columbia was formed in 1788 with Bernardsburg and Wilmington following soon after. Lyles Baptist Church was organized in 1774 and the formation of the Methodist denomination had its roots in a Conference held in Fluvanna in 1779. The \"Brick Union\" Church was built in 1825 for the use of Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians. The village of Fork Union grew up around the Church.\n\nWhen Palmyra was made the county seat in 1828 it quickly became a thriving town after the new courthouse was completed in 1830.\n\nIn the late eighteenth century, [[Thomas Jefferson]] improved the navigability of the Rivanna River, as he owned much property along its upper course, e.g. [[Shadwell (Virginia)|Shadwell]] and [[Monticello]] plantations. Improvements included in the first generation (through 1830) were [[sluice]] cuts, small dams and [[batteaux]] [[lock (water transport)|locks]].\n\nSecond-generation (1840\u20131870) improvements made by others included construction of long stretches of [[canal]], serviced by large locks, many of which are still visible along the river. Shortly after the completion of the initial Rivanna navigational works, Virginia requested that the river be opened to public usage. Jefferson reportedly initially refused, but the state insisted and the Rivanna became an integral part of the central Virginian transportation network.  The route serviced a large community of farmsteads, plantations throughout Albemarle and Fluvanna counties. It also was lined by increasing numbers of industrial facilities, such as those at Union Mills. Construction of the larger mills prompted the great improvements to navigation. For instance, Union Mills featured a two-and-a-half-mile long canal and towpath, and one upper and two massive lower locks, all directly upon the river.\n\nWhere the Rivanna meets the James River at Columbia, the [[Rivanna Connexion Canal]] merged with a much longer canal. (The series of locks which connected the two canals lie just outside the Town of Columbia and are mostly buried by sediment today). In 1840, the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] was constructed adjacent to the north bank of the James River and opened to traffic. The new canal was part of a planned link between the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] via the James and the [[Kanawha River|Kanawha]] rivers; it was intended to connect via the [[Ohio River]], to the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The canal was used by packet and freight boats, which replaced the earlier shallow-draft [[batteau]] for commerce. These boats brought goods and passengers to and from Richmond and points beyond. Long a dream of early Virginians such as [[George Washington]], who was a surveyor early in his career, the canal was never completed as envisioned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn the batteaux era, [[Milton, Albemarle County, Virginia|Milton]] was the [[head of navigation]] on the river.  By the early nineteenth century, horse-drawn canal boats were traveling all the way upstream to Charlottesville.  The head of navigation was located at the point where the Fredericksburg Road (now [[Virginia State Route 20|VA 20]]) and Three Chopt Road ([[U.S. Route 250]]), the primary road to Richmond, met and entered the city at the Free Bridge, establishing the city as a major commercial hub.\n\nWhile no [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battles were fought in Fluvanna, Union soldiers burned mills and bridges and damaged the [[James River and Kanawha Canal]] to disrupt traffic and commerce. During the [[American Civil War]] more than 1,200 of the county's citizens served in the Confederate forces. Its citizens served in [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] units during the war, including the [[Fluvanna Artillery]].\n\nThe canal was repaired after the war, but traffic never returned to pre-war levels, as [[railroad]]s were being constructed throughout the state and were more efficient. After many years of trying to compete with the ever-expanding railroad network, the James River and Kanawha Canal was conveyed to a new railroad company by a deed dated March 4, 1880. Railroad construction workers promptly started laying tracks on the [[towpath]]. The new [[Richmond and Allegheny Railroad]] offered a water-level route from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] just east of [[West Virginia]] near [[Clifton Forge, Virginia|Jackson's River Station]] (now Clifton Forge) through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] at [[Balcony Falls, Virginia|Balcony Falls]] to Richmond. In 1888 the railroad was leased, and later purchased, by [[Collis P. Huntington]]'s [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]].\n\n[[Fork Union Military Academy]] (FUMA) was initially founded as Fork Union Academy in October 1898 by Dr. William E. Hatcher, a prominent local Baptist minister. The first class had 19 boys and girls. In 1902, the academy took on a military structure to provide organization, discipline, and physical development for the boys of what was a rapidly growing school. In 1913, the academy became an all-male institution and changed its name to Fork Union Military Academy. That same year, the Academy began receiving support from the Baptist General Association of Virginia, which has continued into the 21st century. FUMA is known for its One Subject Plan as well as Post Graduate Football team that has many NFL players and [[Heisman Trophy]] winners as alumni.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nEarly in the 20th century, the C&O built a new line between the James River Line at [[Strathmore, Virginia|Strathmore]] and the Piedmont Subdivision on the old [[Virginia Central Railroad]]'s line at [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]]. The [[Virginia Air Line Railway]] was built to move loads that were too high or too wide to pass through the tunnels of the [[Blue Ridge Tunnel|Blue Ridge Mountain complex]] between Charlottesville and [[Waynesboro, Virginia|Waynesboro]]. Additionally, [[coal]] trains from West Virginia headed eastbound for [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[Northern Virginia]] were routed on the new line to avoid steep mountain grades. The VAL was completed on September 29, 1909. A new freight station was built at Palmyra. The tracks of the VAL were abandoned in 1975, as railroad freight traffic had declined.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 3921\n|1800= 4623\n|1810= 4775\n|1820= 6704\n|1830= 8221\n|1840= 8812\n|1850= 9487\n|1860= 10353\n|1870= 9875\n|1880= 10802\n|1890= 9508\n|1900= 9050\n|1910= 8323\n|1920= 8547\n|1930= 7466\n|1940= 7088\n|1950= 7121\n|1960= 7227\n|1970= 7621\n|1980= 10244\n|1990= 12429\n|2000= 20047\n|2010= 25691\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=26783\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 14, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/va190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

[[Siouan]]-speaking tribes were the historic peoples encountered by [[English colonial empire|English colonists]]. Their numbers were sharply reduced by European [[infectious diseases]] to which they had no immunity, which caused widespread social disruption.\n\nPortions of the historic Three Chopt Trail, a [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] trail, run through a large portion of the county. The trail was marked by three hatchet chops in trees to show the way. The modern-day [[U.S. Route 250]] roughly follows this route from Richmond to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].\n\n===Henrico Shire===\nIn 1634, the colonial government organized the territory of [[Virginia]] into eight shires, to be governed as [[shire]]s in [[England]]. [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico]] was one of these shires.<ref name=\"Facets\">Agee, Helene. ''Facets of Goochland County's History,'' Richmond, VA: Dietz Press, 1962.</ref>\n\n===Formation of Goochland County===\nAmong the earliest European settlers in this area of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] were several hundred [[French Huguenot]] religious refugees, who were given land in 1700 and 1701 by the Crown and colonial authorities about 20 miles above the falls of the James River. They settled the villages collectively known as [[Manakin-Sabot, Virginia|Manakin-Sabot]] in this area. Soon they moved out to farms and plantations they developed. In neighboring [[Powhatan County]], to the south across the James, they settled Manakin Town, but by 1750 had mostly moved out to farms.<ref name=\"neh\">[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/growth/text4/frenchvirginia.pdf \"MANAKIN TOWN / The French Huguenot Settlement in Virginia * 1700-ca. 1750\"] (includes primary sources), ''Becoming American: The British Atlantic Colonies, 1690-1763'', National Humanities Center, 2009; accessed 11 January 2019</ref>\n\nGoochland was founded in 1728 as the first county formed from Henrico shire, followed by [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]] in 1749. Goochland originally included all of the land from Tuckahoe Creek, on both sides of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], west as far as the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]].<ref name=\"GCHS\" />\n\nThe county was named for [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet]],<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The nominal governor, the [[Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle|Earl of Albemarle]], had remained in England. As acting [[List of colonial governors of Virginia|royal governor]], Gooch promoted settlement of the Virginia backcountry as a means to insulate the Virginia colony from Native American and [[New France]] settlements in the [[Ohio Country]].<ref name = \"encva\">\"Backcountry Frontier of Colonial Virginia\", ''Encyclopedia Virginia'' http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Backcountry_Frontier_of_Colonial_Virginia#start_entry Quote: \"The major push toward the British occupation of the backcountry began with a series of land orders totaling close to {{convert|400,000|acres|abbr=on}} west of the Blue Ridge, issued by Lieutenant Governor William Gooch between 1730 and 1732\" ...\"Settlement of the valley by British subjects would secure and defend Virginia, not only in conflicts with northern and southern Indians, but also in the imperial struggles that had convulsed the Atlantic world for the previous three decades, during which New France had extended settlements and garrisons from Canada to Louisiana along the broad Ohio and Mississippi river systems.\"</ref>\n\nAs the colonists moved into the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] west of Richmond, they first developed [[tobacco plantation]]s like those of the [[Tidewater Virginia|Tidewater]]. After the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], tobacco did not yield as high profits as markets changed. In Goochland, as in other areas of Virginia, many planters switched to growing [[wheat]] and mixed crops. This reduced their need for labor. In the early nineteenth century, some planters sold slaves in the domestic [[slave trade]], as demand was high in the developing Deep South where cotton plantations were developed.\n\n===Goochland Courthouse===\nThe first court was held in May 1728. The exact location of this first court is unknown, but researchers believe that the first courthouse was constructed in old Goochland County between 1730 and 1737, perhaps at [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]]\u2014an old county seat located today at what is the intersection of three counties. When the vast county was divided in 1744, old [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] retained the original county seat. The location of the second Goochland County courthouse had to be moved east.<ref name=\"Facets\" /> In the early 19th century, the courthouse was moved to its current location along Rt. 6 in central Goochland. The [[Goochland County Court Square]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970.<ref>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===Revolutionary War===\nDuring the early part of 1781, [[Lord Cornwallis]] marched his sizable army through the boundaries of Goochland. They occupied and thoroughly destroyed [[Elk Hill (Goochland, Virginia)|Elkhill]], a small estate of [[Thomas Jefferson]], slaughtering the livestock for food, burning barns and fences, and finally burning down the house.   They took 27 slaves as prisoners of war, and 24 died of disease in the camp.<ref>[http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/elkhill Places: \"Elkhill\"], ''Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia'', Monticello, accessed January 10, 2012.</ref>\n\nOne point along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] came to be known as Cornwallis Hill. It is said that the British general, who paused here on his way to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], where he would be defeated and surrender, remarked that this spot with its magnificent vista of the James River Valley would make an ideal site for a house.<ref>Bullard, Cece. ''Goochland Yesterday and Today: A Pictorial History'', Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company, 1994.</ref>\n\n[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]], a French hero of the Revolution, returned to the United States for a [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|grand tour in 1824 and 1825]]. On November 2, 1824, General Lafayette \"left Richmond on his way to [[Monticello]] to visit Mr. Jefferson.\" <ref name=\"Facets\" /> On the way, Gen. Lafayette stopped at Powell's Tavern in Goochland. (\"I spent some time at the Tavern and there was much celebration at his arrival.\"){{citation needed|date=January 2019}} While there, the general met with American officers and many citizens of the county.\n\n===Civil War===\nThe county was a site of a battle late in the war. When the war broke out, James Pleasants, a native of Goochland County and descendant of the [[James Pleasants|22nd governor of the state]], insisted he replace his uncle in the Goochland Light Dragoons (known during the war as Co. F, [[4th Virginia Cavalry]]). In 1861, he was allowed to take his uncle's place. In the winter of 1864, any troops who were close to home were allowed to return to recruit more soldiers.\n\nAt the same time, the young Union Colonel [[Ulric Dahlgren]] had a plan to infiltrate central Virginia, break out nearly 12,000 [[Union Army|Union]] prisoners from [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]] in Richmond, the Confederate capital, and destroy the city. On March 1, 1864, Dahlgren's forces reached the plantations of Sabot Hill, Dover, and Eastwood in eastern Goochland.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\nOn Pleasants's first night home, Dahlgren's raiders stole his horses but did not search the property. When Pleasants found out what happened, he grabbed his carbine and started off on foot after the raiders. Hearing a noise, he hid in the woods, and ordered a single Union cavalryman to surrender. Pleasants mounted the man's horse, and forced the soldier to walk in front of him to search for more soldiers. Within a short amount of time, Pleasants had captured several Union prisoners and took them as prisoners back to Bowles' store. In all, he captured 15 Union soldiers, recovered 16 horses, and shot one officer who refused to surrender to him.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\nEastwood was occupied by Plumer Hobson and his wife, the daughter of Brigadier General [[Henry A. Wise]], the last governor of Virginia before the war. On the previous night General Wise had arrived at Eastwood. When a Union detail arrived at Eastwood looking for him, his daughter said that he was in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  Instead, he was already riding rapidly southeast to Richmond to warn the troops of the Union raiders.<ref name=\"Facets\" />  Dahlgren went to Sabot Hill, the home of [[James Seddon]] and his wife. She answered the door and invited the officer in for some wine and Southern hospitality; she knew that Wise was on his way to Richmond and wanted to delay Dahlgren. Ultimately, due to the quick thinking by the families in Goochland, Wise was able to warn forces in Richmond, who defeated Dahlgren's raid.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\n===Convict lease program===\nAfter [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Goochland County [[convict lease|leased convicts]] as laborers to build roads in 1878. The state's practice of convict leasing was effectively a means of keeping African Americans in near-slavery conditions. The legislature passed a variety of minor nuisance laws, with penalties of fees, which they knew the cash-poor [[sharecroppers]] could not readily pay.<ref>{{cite book|author=Virginia|title=Acts Passed at a General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8M_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA436|year=1878|pages=436\u2013442}}</ref> When convicted of minor offenses and unable to pay the fine, black men were jailed and leased out as convicts. They suffered frequent abuse under this system, as the state exercised little supervision of conditions.\n\n===Monument===\nAs part of their effort at commemoration after the war, the [[Daughters of the Confederacy]] commissioned a monument to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] dead, to be erected on the green of the Goochland Courthouse. It was unveiled on June 22, 1918. Among those in attendance was Robert E. Lee, a grandson of General [[Robert E. Lee]].\n\n===Churches===\nIn 1720, there were two parishes in Henrico County, St. James and Henrico. When Goochland County was formed, St. James Parish fell within the boundaries on both sides of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and westward. When [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] was formed from Goochland in 1744, the Parish was divided into three. St. Anne's Parish covered Albemarle, St. James Southam Parish covered the south side of the river (now [[Powhatan County]]), and St. James Northam Parish covered the rest of Goochland.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\nIn St. James Northam Parish there were three early churches, all Anglican (and Episcopal after the church was disestablished after the Revolution): Dover Episcopal, Beaverdam Episcopal, and Lickinghole Episcopal. Dover was the first, being built in 1724; it closed sometime after the Revolutionary War. Its location and closing date are unknown. Beaverdam was located near what is now Whitehall Road, but its exact location is also unknown.\n\nOne notable church is [[Byrd Presbyterian Church]]. The congregation has some members descended from the original worshippers who were organized in 1748 at Tucker Woodson's farm by [[Samuel Davies (Presbyterian educator)|Samuel Davies]], a theologian. He later served as president of [[Princeton University]]. By 1759 the group had constructed its own building on Byrd Creek. In 1838 descendants of the original congregation built a new church and began worshiping here; this church is still in use. It retains many of its original architectural features, including its slate roof and interior window valances. The cemetery has been preserved since it was established in 1838.\n\nOne of the first independent black congregations founded after the Civil War was what is now called Second Union Baptist Church, founded in 1865 near Fife/Bula northwest of Richmond. Most [[freedmen]] left white Baptist churches to found their own, and soon set up state associations with the aid of organizers from free states. Today the numerous churches in the county include several Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and non-denominational Christian churches.\n\n===Historic homes===\n* [[Tuckahoe Plantation]] \u2013 One of the older James River plantation mansions in the county, it has grounds that include a private schoolhouse where [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his Randolph cousins were educated.<ref name=\"Tuckahoe Plantation\"/>\n* [[Sabot Hill]] \u2013 Built in 1855, it was owned by [[James A. Seddon]], the [[Secretary of War]] for the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) during the Civil War. The large home was damaged in Dahlgren's Raid.\n* [[Woodlawn (Oilville, Virginia)|Woodlawn]] \u2013 This is a [[Georgian Colonial]]-style home built prior to 1760 by Josiah Leake. In 1834 it was purchased by Colonel Thomas Taylor, a hero of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n* [[Clover Forest Plantation]] \u2013 The land was first patented in 1714. The central core of the home was nt built until 1807\u20131811, by Captain Thomas Pemberton of the Continental Dragoons. He was later a member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]]. It has had several owners since then.<ref>Elie Weeks, \"Clover Forest\", ''Goochland County Historical Society Magazine'', 5-A, 1973, pp. 7\u201313.</ref>\n\nOther historic homes and mansions in Goochland can be found through the Goochland County Historical Society (see links below).\n\n==School buses==\nIn 1973, [[Wayne Corporation]] of [[Richmond, Indiana]] introduced a safer design in [[school bus]] construction, the [[Wayne Lifeguard|Lifeguard]].  Shortly afterward, the manufacturer held a nationwide contest to gain ideas to improve school bus safety, with the grand prize to be the award of a new Lifeguard school bus.  Pearl P. Randolph, a member of the Goochland County School Board, created the winning entry.\n\nAs a result, the Goochland County Public Schools received the new school bus. Her idea was to install [[sound baffles]] in the ceilings of school bus bodies to help reduce driver distraction. Compact forms of such equipment were later developed in the 1980s by Wayne and other bus manufacturers when [[diesel engine]]s (and their greater noise) became commonplace.\n\n==Government==\n===Board of Supervisors===\n* District 1: Susan F.

They settled the villages collectively known as [[Manakin-Sabot, Virginia|Manakin-Sabot]] in this area. Soon they moved out to farms and plantations they developed. In neighboring [[Powhatan County]], to the south across the James, they settled Manakin Town, but by 1750 had mostly moved out to farms.<ref name=\"neh\">[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/becomingamer/growth/text4/frenchvirginia.pdf \"MANAKIN TOWN / The French Huguenot Settlement in Virginia * 1700-ca. 1750\"] (includes primary sources), ''Becoming American: The British Atlantic Colonies, 1690-1763'', National Humanities Center, 2009; accessed 11 January 2019</ref>\n\nGoochland was founded in 1728 as the first county formed from Henrico shire, followed by [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]] in 1749.

After the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], tobacco did not yield as high profits as markets changed. In Goochland, as in other areas of Virginia, many planters switched to growing [[wheat]] and mixed crops. This reduced their need for labor. In the early nineteenth century, some planters sold slaves in the domestic [[slave trade]], as demand was high in the developing Deep South where cotton plantations were developed.\n\n===Goochland Courthouse===\nThe first court was held in May 1728. The exact location of this first court is unknown, but researchers believe that the first courthouse was constructed in old Goochland County between 1730 and 1737, perhaps at [[Scottsville, Virginia|Scottsville]]\u2014an old county seat located today at what is the intersection of three counties. When the vast county was divided in 1744, old [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] retained the original county seat. The location of the second Goochland County courthouse had to be moved east.<ref name=\"Facets\" /> In the early 19th century, the courthouse was moved to its current location along Rt. 6 in central Goochland. The [[Goochland County Court Square]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970.<ref>{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n===Revolutionary War===\nDuring the early part of 1781, [[Lord Cornwallis]] marched his sizable army through the boundaries of Goochland. They occupied and thoroughly destroyed [[Elk Hill (Goochland, Virginia)|Elkhill]], a small estate of [[Thomas Jefferson]], slaughtering the livestock for food, burning barns and fences, and finally burning down the house.   They took 27 slaves as prisoners of war, and 24 died of disease in the camp.<ref>[http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/elkhill Places: \"Elkhill\"], ''Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia'', Monticello, accessed January 10, 2012.</ref>\n\nOne point along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] came to be known as Cornwallis Hill. It is said that the British general, who paused here on his way to [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], where he would be defeated and surrender, remarked that this spot with its magnificent vista of the James River Valley would make an ideal site for a house.<ref>Bullard, Cece. ''Goochland Yesterday and Today: A Pictorial History'', Virginia Beach, VA: The Donning Company, 1994.</ref>\n\n[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]], a French hero of the Revolution, returned to the United States for a [[Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States (1824-25)|grand tour in 1824 and 1825]]. On November 2, 1824, General Lafayette \"left Richmond on his way to [[Monticello]] to visit Mr. Jefferson.\" <ref name=\"Facets\" /> On the way, Gen. Lafayette stopped at Powell's Tavern in Goochland. (\"I spent some time at the Tavern and there was much celebration at his arrival.\"){{citation needed|date=January 2019}} While there, the general met with American officers and many citizens of the county.\n\n===Civil War===\nThe county was a site of a battle late in the war. When the war broke out, James Pleasants, a native of Goochland County and descendant of the [[James Pleasants|22nd governor of the state]], insisted he replace his uncle in the Goochland Light Dragoons (known during the war as Co. F, [[4th Virginia Cavalry]]). In 1861, he was allowed to take his uncle's place. In the winter of 1864, any troops who were close to home were allowed to return to recruit more soldiers.\n\nAt the same time, the young Union Colonel [[Ulric Dahlgren]] had a plan to infiltrate central Virginia, break out nearly 12,000 [[Union Army|Union]] prisoners from [[Belle Isle (Virginia)|Belle Isle]] in Richmond, the Confederate capital, and destroy the city. On March 1, 1864, Dahlgren's forces reached the plantations of Sabot Hill, Dover, and Eastwood in eastern Goochland.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\nOn Pleasants's first night home, Dahlgren's raiders stole his horses but did not search the property. When Pleasants found out what happened, he grabbed his carbine and started off on foot after the raiders. Hearing a noise, he hid in the woods, and ordered a single Union cavalryman to surrender. Pleasants mounted the man's horse, and forced the soldier to walk in front of him to search for more soldiers. Within a short amount of time, Pleasants had captured several Union prisoners and took them as prisoners back to Bowles' store. In all, he captured 15 Union soldiers, recovered 16 horses, and shot one officer who refused to surrender to him.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\nEastwood was occupied by Plumer Hobson and his wife, the daughter of Brigadier General [[Henry A. Wise]], the last governor of Virginia before the war. On the previous night General Wise had arrived at Eastwood. When a Union detail arrived at Eastwood looking for him, his daughter said that he was in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  Instead, he was already riding rapidly southeast to Richmond to warn the troops of the Union raiders.<ref name=\"Facets\" />  Dahlgren went to Sabot Hill, the home of [[James Seddon]] and his wife. She answered the door and invited the officer in for some wine and Southern hospitality; she knew that Wise was on his way to Richmond and wanted to delay Dahlgren. Ultimately, due to the quick thinking by the families in Goochland, Wise was able to warn forces in Richmond, who defeated Dahlgren's raid.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\n===Convict lease program===\nAfter [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Goochland County [[convict lease|leased convicts]] as laborers to build roads in 1878. The state's practice of convict leasing was effectively a means of keeping African Americans in near-slavery conditions. The legislature passed a variety of minor nuisance laws, with penalties of fees, which they knew the cash-poor [[sharecroppers]] could not readily pay.<ref>{{cite book|author=Virginia|title=Acts Passed at a General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P8M_AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA436|year=1878|pages=436\u2013442}}</ref> When convicted of minor offenses and unable to pay the fine, black men were jailed and leased out as convicts. They suffered frequent abuse under this system, as the state exercised little supervision of conditions.\n\n===Monument===\nAs part of their effort at commemoration after the war, the [[Daughters of the Confederacy]] commissioned a monument to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] dead, to be erected on the green of the Goochland Courthouse. It was unveiled on June 22, 1918. Among those in attendance was Robert E. Lee, a grandson of General [[Robert E. Lee]].\n\n===Churches===\nIn 1720, there were two parishes in Henrico County, St. James and Henrico. When Goochland County was formed, St. James Parish fell within the boundaries on both sides of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and westward. When [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] was formed from Goochland in 1744, the Parish was divided into three. St. Anne's Parish covered Albemarle, St. James Southam Parish covered the south side of the river (now [[Powhatan County]]), and St. James Northam Parish covered the rest of Goochland.<ref name=\"Facets\" />\n\nIn St. James Northam Parish there were three early churches, all Anglican (and Episcopal after the church was disestablished after the Revolution): Dover Episcopal, Beaverdam Episcopal, and Lickinghole Episcopal. Dover was the first, being built in 1724; it closed sometime after the Revolutionary War. Its location and closing date are unknown. Beaverdam was located near what is now Whitehall Road, but its exact location is also unknown.\n\nOne notable church is [[Byrd Presbyterian Church]]. The congregation has some members descended from the original worshippers who were organized in 1748 at Tucker Woodson's farm by [[Samuel Davies (Presbyterian educator)|Samuel Davies]], a theologian. He later served as president of [[Princeton University]]. By 1759 the group had constructed its own building on Byrd Creek. In 1838 descendants of the original congregation built a new church and began worshiping here; this church is still in use. It retains many of its original architectural features, including its slate roof and interior window valances. The cemetery has been preserved since it was established in 1838.\n\nOne of the first independent black congregations founded after the Civil War was what is now called Second Union Baptist Church, founded in 1865 near Fife/Bula northwest of Richmond. Most [[freedmen]] left white Baptist churches to found their own, and soon set up state associations with the aid of organizers from free states. Today the numerous churches in the county include several Episcopal, Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and non-denominational Christian churches.\n\n===Historic homes===\n* [[Tuckahoe Plantation]] \u2013 One of the older James River plantation mansions in the county, it has grounds that include a private schoolhouse where [[Thomas Jefferson]] and his Randolph cousins were educated.<ref name=\"Tuckahoe Plantation\"/>\n* [[Sabot Hill]] \u2013 Built in 1855, it was owned by [[James A. Seddon]], the [[Secretary of War]] for the [[Confederate States of America]] (CSA) during the Civil War. The large home was damaged in Dahlgren's Raid.\n* [[Woodlawn (Oilville, Virginia)|Woodlawn]] \u2013 This is a [[Georgian Colonial]]-style home built prior to 1760 by Josiah Leake. In 1834 it was purchased by Colonel Thomas Taylor, a hero of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n* [[Clover Forest Plantation]] \u2013 The land was first patented in 1714. The central core of the home was nt built until 1807\u20131811, by Captain Thomas Pemberton of the Continental Dragoons. He was later a member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]]. It has had several owners since then.<ref>Elie Weeks, \"Clover Forest\", ''Goochland County Historical Society Magazine'', 5-A, 1973, pp. 7\u201313.</ref>\n\nOther historic homes and mansions in Goochland can be found through the Goochland County Historical Society (see links below).\n\n==School buses==\nIn 1973, [[Wayne Corporation]] of [[Richmond, Indiana]] introduced a safer design in [[school bus]] construction, the [[Wayne Lifeguard|Lifeguard]].  Shortly afterward, the manufacturer held a nationwide contest to gain ideas to improve school bus safety, with the grand prize to be the award of a new Lifeguard school bus.  Pearl P. Randolph, a member of the Goochland County School Board, created the winning entry.\n\nAs a result, the Goochland County Public Schools received the new school bus. Her idea was to install [[sound baffles]] in the ceilings of school bus bodies to help reduce driver distraction. Compact forms of such equipment were later developed in the 1980s by Wayne and other bus manufacturers when [[diesel engine]]s (and their greater noise) became commonplace.\n\n==Government==\n===Board of Supervisors===\n* District 1: Susan F. Lascolette (R)\n* District 2: Manuel Alvarez Jr. (R)\n* District 3: John Lumpkins Jr.\n* District 4: R.H. \"Bob\" Minnick (I)\n* District 5: Ken C.
