Admittance is selective. Requirements include enrollment in advanced classes taught on the campus by DBU faculty, attendance at enrichment events, and a Senior Thesis or Project. Successful completion carries with it recognition at graduation and on the student's transcript which assists in admission to graduate school and future interviews.<ref>{{Citation| title = DBU Honors Society| url = http://www.dbu.edu/honors/default.asp\n| accessdate = 6 February 2009}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=September 2011}}\n\nFormerly Pew College Society, Paideia College Society has steadily grown since its conception in 1997. It is now internally funded by DBU, with Dr. [[David Naugle]] at its helm. The rather unfamiliar term \"Paideia\" (pronounced py-dee-a or py-day-a) comes from the Greek word pais or paidos meaning \"child.\" It refers literally to the training and education of children. In due course, it was used in the classical Greek system of education, and referred specifically to a complete course of study in order to produce a whole, fully educated citizen. The Paideia College Society at DBU is rooted in this venerable tradition, and takes as its purpose the educating of Christian students into their true nature as the image of God. The goal of the society is to unite the themes  ''Pietas'', ''Doctrina'', and ''Humanitas'', meaning piety, learning, and humanity, in order to become \"fully human under God\".<ref>{{Citation| title = Paideia College Society| url = http://www.dbu.edu/naugle/paideia.htm\n| accessdate = 6 February 2009}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Accreditations===\nDallas Baptist University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Institution Details |url=http://sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=24960 |publisher=Southern Association of Colleges and Schools: Commission on Colleges |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405083112/http://sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=24960 |archivedate=5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe teacher, principal and superintendent education programs of the university are accredited by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas Baptist University: Approved Certification Areas|url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=7503|publisher=Texas Education Agency|accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe College of Business is nationally accredited by the [[Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP) to offer the Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) and the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) business degrees.<ref>{{cite web |title=Current ACBSP Educational Institution Members |url=http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid=14 |publisher=Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713065626/http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D14 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Dallas Baptist University Department of Music is accredited by the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM).<ref>{{cite web|title=Accredited Members |url=http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=List_Accredited_Members&memberId=7b1d966a18ffaa3dcffbc4fd0e0d8a95 |publisher=National Association of Schools of Music |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331184946/http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=List_Accredited_Members&memberId=7b1d966a18ffaa3dcffbc4fd0e0d8a95 |archivedate=31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDBU is also affiliated with the [[Baptist General Convention of Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Teaching Them: A Sesquicentennial Celebration of Texas Baptist Education|year=1996|publisher=Baptist General Convention of Texas|location=Dallas|pages=62}}</ref>\n\n=== Institute for Global Engagement ===\nThe Institute for Global Engagement was founded at DBU in 2015 to be \u201ca Christian, non-partisan think tank dedicated to addressing issues in the public square with biblical distinctiveness\u201d and to be \u201ca moral and spiritual catalyst for renewal in our culture.\u201d  The goal of the institute is to be interdisciplinary in bringing together experts and practitioners from a variety of fields to address issues from a distinctively Christian worldview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbu.edu/ige/about.html|title=About {{!}} The Institute for Global Engagement {{!}} Dallas Baptist University|website=www.dbu.edu|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, physician Dr. Peter Dysart, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen.

It is now internally funded by DBU, with Dr. [[David Naugle]] at its helm. The rather unfamiliar term \"Paideia\" (pronounced py-dee-a or py-day-a) comes from the Greek word pais or paidos meaning \"child.\" It refers literally to the training and education of children. In due course, it was used in the classical Greek system of education, and referred specifically to a complete course of study in order to produce a whole, fully educated citizen. The Paideia College Society at DBU is rooted in this venerable tradition, and takes as its purpose the educating of Christian students into their true nature as the image of God. The goal of the society is to unite the themes  ''Pietas'', ''Doctrina'', and ''Humanitas'', meaning piety, learning, and humanity, in order to become \"fully human under God\".<ref>{{Citation| title = Paideia College Society| url = http://www.dbu.edu/naugle/paideia.htm\n| accessdate = 6 February 2009}}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Accreditations===\nDallas Baptist University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Institution Details |url=http://sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=24960 |publisher=Southern Association of Colleges and Schools: Commission on Colleges |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405083112/http://sacscoc.org/details.asp?instid=24960 |archivedate=5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe teacher, principal and superintendent education programs of the university are accredited by the State Board for Educator Certification (SBEC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Dallas Baptist University: Approved Certification Areas|url=http://www.tea.state.tx.us/index4.aspx?id=7503|publisher=Texas Education Agency|accessdate=28 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe College of Business is nationally accredited by the [[Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs]] (ACBSP) to offer the Bachelor of Business Administration (B.B.A.) and the Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) business degrees.<ref>{{cite web |title=Current ACBSP Educational Institution Members |url=http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid=14 |publisher=Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713065626/http://www.acbsp.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D14 |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe Dallas Baptist University Department of Music is accredited by the [[National Association of Schools of Music]] (NASM).<ref>{{cite web|title=Accredited Members |url=http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=List_Accredited_Members&memberId=7b1d966a18ffaa3dcffbc4fd0e0d8a95 |publisher=National Association of Schools of Music |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331184946/http://nasm.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=List_Accredited_Members&memberId=7b1d966a18ffaa3dcffbc4fd0e0d8a95 |archivedate=31 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDBU is also affiliated with the [[Baptist General Convention of Texas]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Teaching Them: A Sesquicentennial Celebration of Texas Baptist Education|year=1996|publisher=Baptist General Convention of Texas|location=Dallas|pages=62}}</ref>\n\n=== Institute for Global Engagement ===\nThe Institute for Global Engagement was founded at DBU in 2015 to be \u201ca Christian, non-partisan think tank dedicated to addressing issues in the public square with biblical distinctiveness\u201d and to be \u201ca moral and spiritual catalyst for renewal in our culture.\u201d  The goal of the institute is to be interdisciplinary in bringing together experts and practitioners from a variety of fields to address issues from a distinctively Christian worldview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dbu.edu/ige/about.html|title=About {{!}} The Institute for Global Engagement {{!}} Dallas Baptist University|website=www.dbu.edu|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> Since its founding, the IGE has held several seminars and lectures featuring a variety of individuals, including author Eric Metaxas, physician Dr. Peter Dysart, former presidential speech writer Michael Gerson, political commentator Matthew Dowd, UN Ambassador Samuel Brownback, and former Secretary of Defense Gen.

The University currently has seven local sororities (Alpha Delta Kappa, Alpha Epsilon Chi, Delta Theta, Kappa Gamma, Sigma Chi Eta, Zeta Chi and Chi Theta Alpha) and four fraternities (Beta Beta, Pi Theta Tau, Psi Omega Phi, and Tau Alpha Phi). The Student Government Association is DBU's oldest active student organization, having been established in 1958. The University contains Spiritual Organizations such as Baptist Student Ministries, Ministry Fellowship, and Ratio Christ. These organizations exist as opportunities for students to learn about [[apologetics]], [[servant leadership]], and as places for Christ centered [[Fellowship of Christian Athletes|fellowship]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www2.dbu.edu/student-life/index.php?action=student-organizations&page=spiritual-organizations|title=Spiritual Organizations|website=DBU Student Life|access-date=12/4/18}}</ref> The University contains seven academic organizations; [[American Association of Christian Counselors]], Dallas Baptist Music Educators, History Society, Sigma Tau Delta, [[Society for Human Resource Management|The Society for Human Resource Management]], Student Education Association and Grammy U.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Traditions==\nIn its early years, Dallas Baptist University's mascot was the Indians, but in the late 1980s, it was changed to the Patriot, and the school colors were changed from blue and gold to the more patriotic theme colors of red, white, and blue.\n\n=== Cross Ring===\nThe Official DBU Cross Ring serves as a symbol of the Christ-centered education students experience at DBU. The ring features many university symbols, including the Mahler Student Center, the Fishers of Men statue, as well as the university seal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dbu.edu/about/cross-ring|title=Cross Ring|work=dbu.edu}}</ref>\n\n===Mr. Patriot===\nOne of DBU's longest running tradition, stemming from when DBU's mascot was the Indians, is the Mr. Patriot pageant. This anticipated event, formerly named Mr. Big Chief from 1981-2018, allows male students to show off their skills, humor, and creativity. The show, a mock beauty pageant, begins with an opening number performed by all the contestants and is followed by three categories: the stamp act (formalwear), the tea act (beachwear) , and the intolerable act (talent). The categories were formerly known as just talent, beachwear, and formalwear. Magic tricks, lip-syncing, and musical interpretations are just some of the ways contestants have attempted to gain points in the past. The contestant with the most points at the end wins the coveted title, and has rights to wear the coat and hat that have replaced the headdress on display in the Dean Learning Center as the prize.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Michael|title=To God Be The Glory: A Centennial History of Dallas Baptist University|year=1998|publisher=Summit Publishing|pages=171}}</ref>\n\n===Family events===\nFamily Weekend and Grandparents Day allow students to invite their families into their lives on campus.

From 1930 until 1952 he was a member of the [[Warsaw Scientific Society]] (''TNW''), from 1946 of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]] (''PAU''), from 1959 of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] (''PAN''), and from 1961 of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in the United States. In 1986 he received the [[National Medal of Science]].\n\nIn 1935 Zygmund published in Polish the original edition of what has become, in its English translation, the two-volume ''[[Trigonometric Series]]''. It was described by Robert A. Fefferman as \"one of the most influential books in the history of mathematical analysis\" and \"an extraordinarily comprehensive and masterful presentation of a ... vast field\".<ref name=\"Zygmund Fefferman\">''Trigonometric Series'', the 2nd edition ([[Cambridge University Press]], 1959) consists of 2 separate volumes. The 3rd edition (Cambridge University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0 521 89053 5}}) consists of the two volumes combined with a foreword by Robert A. Fefferman. The nine pages in Fefferman's foreword (biographic and other information concerning Zygmund) are not numbered.</ref> [[Jean-Pierre Kahane]] called the book \"The Bible\" of a [[harmonic analysis|harmonic analyst]]. The theory of [[trigonometric series]] had remained the largest component of Zygmund's mathematical investigations.<ref name=\"Lorentz\"/>\n\nHis work has had a pervasive influence in many fields of mathematics, mostly in mathematical analysis, and particularly in harmonic analysis. Among the most significant were the results obtained with Calder\u00f3n on [[Singular integral|singular integral operator]]s.<ref>{{cite newspaper|title=Obituary: Professor Antoni Zygmund|author=Carbery, Tony|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 July 1992|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-antoni-zygmund-1533716.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Zygmund Fefferman\"/> [[George G.
