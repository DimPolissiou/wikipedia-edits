This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm). It was discovered in 1817 simultaneously by [[Friedrich Stromeyer|Stromeyer]] and [[Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann|Hermann]], both in Germany, as an impurity in [[zinc carbonate]].\n\nCadmium occurs as a minor component in most zinc ores and is a byproduct of zinc production.

The two natural radioactive isotopes are <sup>113</sup>Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is {{val|7.7|e=15|u=y}}) and <sup>116</sup>Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is {{val|2.9|e=19|u=y}}). The other three are <sup>106</sup>Cd, <sup>108</sup>Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and <sup>114</sup>Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&nbsp;\u2013 <sup>110</sup>Cd, <sup>111</sup>Cd, and <sup>112</sup>Cd&nbsp;\u2013 are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are <sup>109</sup>Cd with a half-life of 462.6&nbsp;days, and <sup>115</sup>Cd with a half-life of 53.46&nbsp;hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5&nbsp;hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5&nbsp;minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being <sup>113m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 14.1&nbsp;years), <sup>115m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 44.6&nbsp;days), and <sup>117m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 3.36&nbsp;hours).<ref name=\"NUBASE\">{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>95</sup>Cd) to 131.946&nbsp;u (<sup>132</sup>Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112&nbsp;u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element&nbsp;47 ([[silver]]).

The metal was named after the Latin word for calamine, because it was found in this zinc ore. Stromeyer noted that some impure samples of calamine changed color when heated but pure calamine did not.

This soft, silvery-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in [[group 12 element|group 12]], [[zinc]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. Like zinc, it demonstrates [[oxidation state]] +2 in most of its compounds, and like mercury, it has a lower melting point than the [[transition metal]]s in [[group 3 element|groups 3]] through [[group 11 element|11]]. Cadmium and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in group 12 are often not considered transition metals, in that they do not have partly filled ''d'' or ''f'' electron shells in the elemental or common oxidation states. The average concentration of cadmium in Earth's crust is between 0.1 and 0.5 parts per million (ppm).

Two of them are [[radionuclide|radioactive]], and three are expected to [[radioactive decay|decay]] but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are <sup>113</sup>Cd ([[beta decay]], half-life is {{val|7.7|e=15|u=y}}) and <sup>116</sup>Cd (two-neutrino [[double beta decay]], half-life is {{val|2.9|e=19|u=y}}). The other three are <sup>106</sup>Cd, <sup>108</sup>Cd (both [[double electron capture]]), and <sup>114</sup>Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes&nbsp;\u2013 <sup>110</sup>Cd, <sup>111</sup>Cd, and <sup>112</sup>Cd&nbsp;\u2013 are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are <sup>109</sup>Cd with a half-life of 462.6&nbsp;days, and <sup>115</sup>Cd with a half-life of 53.46&nbsp;hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5&nbsp;hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5&nbsp;minutes. Cadmium has 8 known [[meta state]]s, with the most stable being <sup>113m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 14.1&nbsp;years), <sup>115m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 44.6&nbsp;days), and <sup>117m</sup>Cd (''t''<sub>1\u20442</sub>&nbsp;= 3.36&nbsp;hours).<ref name=\"NUBASE\">{{NUBASE 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe known isotopes of cadmium range in [[atomic mass]] from 94.950&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (<sup>95</sup>Cd) to 131.946&nbsp;u (<sup>132</sup>Cd). For isotopes lighter than 112&nbsp;u, the primary [[decay mode]] is [[electron capture]] and the dominant [[decay product]] is element&nbsp;47 ([[silver]]). Heavier isotopes decay mostly through [[beta emission]] producing element&nbsp;49 ([[indium]]).<ref name=\"NUBASE\"/>\n\nOne isotope of cadmium, <sup>113</sup>Cd, [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] with high selectivity: With very high probability, neutrons with energy below the ''cadmium cut-off'' will be absorbed; those higher than the ''cut-off will be transmitted''.

His wife Rhonda has made a sculpture of her husband at the behest of the US State Department, commissioned by his friend, US Ambassador to England, Ray Whitely, for $50,000, in order to promote Unispeak. It is intended that the sculpture be unveiled in London's Grosvener Square.\n\nThe sculpture is an 18-foot [[Greco-Roman]] style nude statue of Alex. He is embarrassed and fears it will cause a PR disaster and jeopardise his status. The two fight over whether the statue should be exhibited at all; further, Alex becomes enraged when he realises that the only parts of the statue to not resemble himself are the genitals. \n\nRhonda points out that she has only seen Alex eighteen days in the past three years. Rhonda is intensely amourous for Alex, but angrily rejects his company over the statue argument. Alex becomes convinced that Rhonda has had an affair and that her illicit model, whom he dubs \"Charlie\", must be the model for the mystery genitals. Meanwhile, Ray, who has no idea about the statue's appearance, fights with Alex over the unveiling of the statue. He begins to use CIA operatives to tail Alex and photograph his movements in an attempt to ruin and discredit him. \n\nAlex seeks advice from his friend Harry, an advertising man trained as a psychiatrist. Members of the British government inform him that the statue is technically [[defamation]] if it doesn't represent his private parts accurately, so on Harry's advice, he tries to track down the model of the statue in order to prove the culprit and thus get it suppressed entirely. \n\nAlex interrogates a household employee, Joachim, who thinks Alex is accusing him of an affair with his wife and attacks him. Joachim proceeds to give information to the Portuguese embassy, which makes it to Ray, who steps up his spying campaign. Alex then goes to a Turkish bathhouse to interview possible Charlies, but is caught by the attendant and thrown out. \n\nHarry suggests that Alex move on and forget about it, to which he ultimately commits. He surprises Rhonda with an array of thoughtful notes and gifts and a heartfelt apology, and the two retire to their bed in the first time in years. However, the enormous statue casts a shadow visible from the bedroom, and Alex becomes functionally impotent at the reminder. Alex and Rhonda fight once again, and Alex resumes the search for \"Charlie\".\n\nRay and his team of American diplomats have become increasingly disturbed as they catalogue Alex's various attempts to view men's genitals, believing him to be a pervert. Ray attempts to manipulate and seduce Rhonda in her loneliness, and Rhonda shows Ray the statue. Ray immediately reverses plans, as he too fears the effects of the statue's unveiling. After cornering Alex with the evidence of his seemingly-perverted activities, the two come to a truce, with Ray sending his CIA and American military assets to help him track down the last few suspects. \n\nMany hijinks and cul-de-sacs later, Alex has truly begun to give up hope for the mission. Harry meanwhile encourages him to pursue the final candidate, a sculptor living in Florence. Ray meanwhile decides to betray both Alex and Rhonda, by having two special military operatives break into Rhonda's studio and saw the private parts off of the statue.

His wife Rhonda has made a sculpture of her husband at the behest of the US State Department, commissioned by his friend, US Ambassador to England, Ray Whitely, for $50,000, in order to promote Unispeak. It is intended that the sculpture be unveiled in London's Grosvener Square.\n\nThe sculpture is an 18-foot [[Greco-Roman]] style nude statue of Alex. He is embarrassed and fears it will cause a PR disaster and jeopardise his status. The two fight over whether the statue should be exhibited at all; further, Alex becomes enraged when he realises that the only parts of the statue to not resemble himself are the genitals. \n\nRhonda points out that she has only seen Alex eighteen days in the past three years. Rhonda is intensely amourous for Alex, but angrily rejects his company over the statue argument. Alex becomes convinced that Rhonda has had an affair and that her illicit model, whom he dubs \"Charlie\", must be the model for the mystery genitals. Meanwhile, Ray, who has no idea about the statue's appearance, fights with Alex over the unveiling of the statue. He begins to use CIA operatives to tail Alex and photograph his movements in an attempt to ruin and discredit him. \n\nAlex seeks advice from his friend Harry, an advertising man trained as a psychiatrist. Members of the British government inform him that the statue is technically [[defamation]] if it doesn't represent his private parts accurately, so on Harry's advice, he tries to track down the model of the statue in order to prove the culprit and thus get it suppressed entirely. \n\nAlex interrogates a household employee, Joachim, who thinks Alex is accusing him of an affair with his wife and attacks him. Joachim proceeds to give information to the Portuguese embassy, which makes it to Ray, who steps up his spying campaign. Alex then goes to a Turkish bathhouse to interview possible Charlies, but is caught by the attendant and thrown out. \n\nHarry suggests that Alex move on and forget about it, to which he ultimately commits. He surprises Rhonda with an array of thoughtful notes and gifts and a heartfelt apology, and the two retire to their bed in the first time in years. However, the enormous statue casts a shadow visible from the bedroom, and Alex becomes functionally impotent at the reminder. Alex and Rhonda fight once again, and Alex resumes the search for \"Charlie\".\n\nRay and his team of American diplomats have become increasingly disturbed as they catalogue Alex's various attempts to view men's genitals, believing him to be a pervert. Ray attempts to manipulate and seduce Rhonda in her loneliness, and Rhonda shows Ray the statue. Ray immediately reverses plans, as he too fears the effects of the statue's unveiling. After cornering Alex with the evidence of his seemingly-perverted activities, the two come to a truce, with Ray sending his CIA and American military assets to help him track down the last few suspects. \n\nMany hijinks and cul-de-sacs later, Alex has truly begun to give up hope for the mission. Harry meanwhile encourages him to pursue the final candidate, a sculptor living in Florence. Ray meanwhile decides to betray both Alex and Rhonda, by having two special military operatives break into Rhonda's studio and saw the private parts off of the statue. The operatives leave no evidence, and Rhonda becomes convinced that Alex did this; when Alex turns up again with another apology, she accuses him of deceit. \n\nAlex decides to track down the final possible culprit; the Italian police are after him thanks to Ray and Rhonda, but he eventually tracks down what turns out to be an elderly sculptor who mentored Rhonda years ago. The sculptor directs Alex to find someone \"well known\" in a town square in Venice, and after a hectic police chase, Alex discovers the model source all along: the statue of [[Michelangelo's David|''David'']] by [[Michelangelo]]. \n\nRay, believing that Rhonda is going to scrap the statue and make a new one, has the severed genitals discarded by a roadside, where they are immediately discovered by truant schoolboys and presented to their teacher. Ultimately, at the grand unveiling at the ceremony, Rhonda reveals that the statue has been recompleted, with exposed genitals and all - only that the head has been remodeled to resemble Ray.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[David Niven]] as Alex Bolt \n* [[Virna Lisi]] as Rhonda Bolt \n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Ray Whiteley\n* [[Ann Bell]] as Pat \n* [[John Cleese]] as Harry \n* [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] as Hillcrest \n* [[Hugh Burden]] as Sir Geoffrey \n* [[Erik Chitty]] as Mouser \n* [[Derek Francis]] as Sanders \n* [[Susan Travers (actress)|Susan Travers]]  as Mrs. Southwick\n\n==Production==\n===Songs===\n*\"Charlie\" by the Statuettes - lyrics by Norman Newwell, music by Riz Ortolani\n*\"Skin\" Sequence - choreography by Gia Landi, lyrics by Audrey Nohra, music by Luis Enriquez Bacalov\n\n===Casting===\n[[Dyan Cannon]] and [[Robert Culp]] were originally announced as supporting David Niven.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1970/03/20/page/59/article/henry-fondas-new-series|title=Henry Fonda's new series|first=Norma Lee|last=Browning|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[tronc|tronc, Inc.]]|location=[[Chicago]]|date=20 March 1970|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> \"It's a fun role, in a fun picture,\" said Virna Lisi.<ref>Virna Lisi: Italian Actress, Housewife and Evolutionized Sexpot\nABA, MARIKA.

It is set in an alternate world in which magic is real, but has become weakened and is also being replaced by modern technology.  The setting is almost like modern Britain, except that it is split into a number of small states.  Those states reference modern-day geography.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe story begins with 15-year-old Jennifer Strange, who is filling in for the missing manager, Mr. Zambini, for an employment agency for magicians called Kazam.  There are prophecies that the last dragon will soon die, meaning that the dragon's territory is up for grabs.  Trying to find the truth of the matter, she finds the official Dragonslayer and is pushed into becoming his apprentice.  And from there it gets worse.\nThe Dragonslayer dies and she becomes the last Dragonslayer, which means that she will be the one that slays the dragon.\n\n==Plot==\nJennifer strange is almost 16.  A Foundling, or orphan, she is two years away from completing her indentured servitude to Mr. Zambini, who runs the last magic employment house.  Jennifer is in charge of managing all the wizards under her care and providing them with work, as well as filling out all the governmental jobs that are associated with performing magic in the current era.  She returns back to Zambini Towers after a job to find Tiger, a new foundling, who will work under her for the next two years while she teaches him how to do her job.  This includes things like dealing with the quirky personality of many of the wizards, and handling things like the transient moose.  She is soon pulled away by one of the wizards who is a pre-cog, or who gets glimpses of a version of the future.  He says that the last dragon will die soon.\nJennifer calls up another pre-cog who is stronger than the Zambini wizard and he tells her it will happen on Sunday at noon.  The wizards of Zambini Towers begin noting that their powers seem stronger than before, and magic appears to be building instead of slowly depleting like it has for the past four hundred years.  Jennifer learns about the Dragonpact, which was made to protect both people and dragons, and provides each dragon with a dragonland that is protected by a magical shield that will vaporize any who try to cross it.  She seeks out the current Dragonslayer and he tells her that he has been waiting for her.  Jennifer Strange is the last Dragonslayer as outlined in the Dragonslayer sword that was created with the Dragonpact.  She gets a crash course in dragon slaying, takes the oath and immediately becomes the new Dragonslayer, as her predecessor crumbles to dust (as his true age finally catches up with him).  \nJennifer goes through a time of political manipulation by King Snodd IV, who uses all of his resources to try and replace her, sway her decisions, or corrupt her.  She uses quick wit and her loyal Quarkbeast, a terrifying mix of a blender and maybe a terrier, as well as some unlikely assistants, to evade this.  Jennifer is reluctant to kill the dragon unless he violates the Dragonpact.  She goes and speaks with him twice before the prophesied day and he, like any dragon would, gives her vague answers. \nDuring this time, Jennifer has an apprentice, Gordon.  He regulates the press, makes breakfast, and sometimes drives the Slayermobile.  However, when the time comes for Jennifer to kill the dragon, she finds his betrayal and his allegiance to a large corporation.  His greed and that of all the millions of people waiting outside the dragonland in the hopes of securing a piece of land for themselves when the magic shield dies with the dragon enrages Jennifer.  The Quarkbeast sacrifices himself for Jennifer, and she uses her quick thinking to enact revenge on Gordon.  Eventually, she does slay the dragon, and is filled with such white-hot fury that she lets out a scream so loud and so powerful it unleashes what the wizards speculated was building: Big Magic. \nWith this, two dragons emerge from where one once stood, and new magic surges.  Jennifer learns the nefarious truth about the Dragonpact and how it was not an equal protection, but the dragons from long before found a way to fix it in the current day.  Jennifer serves a brief stint in jail but returns to Zambini Towers to continue her role as acting manager, as well as Last Dragonslayer.\n\n==Context==\nThe style is similar to his [[Thursday Next]] and [[Jack Spratt|Nursery Crimes]] series, but the assumptions and world-rules are very different.  Unlike other Jasper Fforde novels, there are no obvious references to specific works of fiction, even though many standard elements of fantasy are used for comic effect.\n\nThe book is described as for 'Adults' and is the first in a trilogy. (A fourth book is planned but as yet unpublished.)\n\nIt is also available as an [http://www.enhanced-editions.com/books/the-last-dragonslayer/ Enhanced Editions iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad application] containing the audiobook synchronised to the full text.\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe novel was adapted into a TV movie by [[Blueprint Pictures]] and Motion Content Group, and broadcast on [[Sky One]] on Christmas Day, 2016. It starred [[Ellise Chappell]] as Jennifer, [[Andrew Buchan]] as Zambini and [[Richard E. Grant]] as the voice of the dragon.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jasperfforde.com/dragon/dragon.html Dragonslayer page at the official Jasper Fforde website]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5807628/ IMDB page for the adaptation]\n\n{{Jasper Fforde}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Last Dragonslayer}}\n[[Category:Novels by Jasper Fforde]]\n[[Category:2010 British novels]]\n[[Category:2010 fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:British fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Hodder & Stoughton books]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:British novels adapted into films]]\n\n{{2010s-fantasy-novel-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2011}}\n{{Infobox book  | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name           = The Last Dragonslayer\n| title_orig     = \n| translator     = \n| image          = File:TheLastDragonslayer.jpg\n| caption        = First edition\n| author         = [[Jasper Fforde]]\n| illustrator    = \n| cover_artist   = \n| country        = UK\n| language       = English\n| series         = The Chronicles of Kazam\n| subject        = <!-- Subject is not relevant for fiction -->\n| genre          = [[Fantasy]] \n| publisher      = [[Hodder & Stoughton]]\n| release_date   = 4 Nov 2010 (Hardback)\n| english_release_date = \n| media_type     = Print [[Hardback]] \n| pages          = 280 pp\n| isbn           = 978-1-4447-0717-5 \n| oclc = \n| preceded_by    = The mortal dragon\n| followed_by    = [[The Song of the Quarkbeast]]\n}}\n'''''The Last Dragonslayer''''' is a fantasy novel by [[Jasper Fforde]].

{"title_page": "Scots property law", "text_new": "{{Scots law}}'''Scots property law''' governs the rules relating to [[property]] found in the legal jurisdiction of [[Scotland]]. As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].    \n\nThe term 'property' is wide-ranging but in this article, as in Scots law and many other jurisdictions, it does not solely describe land. Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with four classes of property as a result:     \n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\nEach class of property has rules concerning the rights ''in rem'' (or [[Scots property law#The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The Numerus Clausus|real rights]]) an individual may have in that property.     \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\nThe recognised rights ''in rem'' a person can have in Scots law are<ref name=\":1\" />:\n\n* [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]]\n* [[Lease in Scots Law|Lease]] of heritable property.\n* Right in [[Security in Scots Property Law|Security]]\n* [[Servitudes in Scots law|Servitude]]\n* [[Real burdens in Scots law|Real burdens]]\n* [[Liferent in Scots law|Liferent]]\n\nOwnership is the main real right, with all other real rights subordinate to ownership<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Corporeal Heritable Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. In Scotland, crown vassals could be given \"''the highest and most privileged tenure of land known to the Scottish Feudal System\" ,'' a Barony title, with the ability of the holder to be called a ''[[Baron]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/79RM/pages/76155367/L33+Barony+Titles|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with it the obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I.

The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium directum]]''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium utile]]''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> the delay between [[royal assent]] of the 2000 Act and its commencement was due to the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before feudalism's final abolition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2002|page=287}}</ref> However, on 28 November 2004, feudalism in Scotland ended and its relevance will diminish over time. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Security in Scots Property Law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> However the Northern Isles had their own legal system, [[udal law]], and its own system of [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|land ownership]][[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#An Absolute Right of Ownership|,]] unlike the rest of Scotland's feudal system.

Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with four classes of property as a result:     \n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\nEach class of property has rules concerning the rights ''in rem'' (or [[Scots property law#The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The Numerus Clausus|real rights]]) an individual may have in that property.     \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A.

'''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is:\n\n===== [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]] =====\nSubordinate to ownership are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\">''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Corporeal Heritable Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. In Scotland, crown vassals could be given \"''the highest and most privileged tenure of land known to the Scottish Feudal System\" ,'' a Barony title, with the ability of the holder to be called a ''[[Baron]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/79RM/pages/76155367/L33+Barony+Titles|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with it the obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref>  Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place in the feudal chain with another individual by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium directum]]''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium utile]]''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> the delay between [[royal assent]] of the 2000 Act and its commencement was due to the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before feudalism's final abolition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2002|page=287}}</ref> However, on 28 November 2004, feudalism in Scotland ended and its relevance will diminish over time. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Security in Scots Property Law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> However the Northern Isles had their own legal system, [[udal law]], and its own system of [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|land ownership]][[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#An Absolute Right of Ownership|,]] unlike the rest of Scotland's feudal system.

In [[Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4]]'s recording of the work, released in 1997, the first movement is played at the metronome mark suggested by Sibelius and takes 9:42 (compared with the {{frac|10|1|2}}\u2013{{frac|11|1|2}} minute duration of most other recordings).<!--Awful lot on duration; little on more important aspects such as form.-->\n\n==Instrumentation==\n2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (both doubling on [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s (1st and 4th movements in A, 2nd and 3rd in B{{music|b}}), 2 [[bassoon]]s, 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[harp]], and [[String section|strings]]\n\n==Movements==\nLike most symphonies, it is in four [[movement (music)|movements]]:\n\n{{ordered list|list_style_type=upper-roman\n|''[[Tempo|Andante]], ma non troppo'' \u2013 ''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]] energico'' ({{music|dotted half}} {{=}} 108) in [[E minor]] and [[sonata form]] with introduction\n:This movement starts with a well-known long clarinet solo, stating all the basic themes and motif of the symphony. \n\n\n|''Andante (ma non troppo lento)'' ({{music|half}} {{=}} 54) in [[E-flat major|E{{flat}} major]] and [[ternary form]], [[variation form]]\n:Similar to the second movement of Sibelius'  [[Symphony No. 2 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 2]], the slow movement starts quietly with tragic themes.
