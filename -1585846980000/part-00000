On October 23, 1953, a Treaty of Amity and Association was signed and France committed to defend Laos against the advance of communist troops.  A garrison assigned under the command of General [[Henri Navarre]] \u2013 whose mission was to prevent any Vi\u1ec7t Minh infiltration to Laos \u2013 was implanted in a strategic area, in West [[Tonkin]], close to the Laotian border, where were some important runways connecting Luang Prabang to Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu Basin.\n\nBut May 7, 1954, French soldiers suffered a bitter military setback and Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu's entrenched camp fell into the hands of the People's Army of Vietnam, commanded by General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p. Whereupon, a conference was organized on July 20 in Geneva (Switzerland) to end hostilities between the French Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, ending eight years of war in Indochina. By the same occasion, the independence of Laos and Cambodia was reaffirmed.\n\nAt the conference, the Kingdom of Laos delegation was composed of Phoui Sananikone (minister of Foreign Affairs \u2013 leader), Kou Voravong (Minister of Defense \u2013 vice-leader) and eight members of Parliament. The members of Pathet Lao including Chao [[Souphanouvong]], who carried North-Vietnamese passports, were integrated into the Vi\u1ec7t Minh delegation.\n\nThe final declaration of the Geneva Agreements provided for Laos:\n#Recognition of the independence and total sovereignty of Laos.\n#Recognition of Vientiane Royal Government as the legal government of Laos.\n#Recognition of the \u00ab Fighting Units of the Pathet Lao \u00bb grouped in the Xam Neua and Phongsali Provinces, awaiting for their integration into the Royal Army after political settlement through free general elections planned in 1955, under the supervision of the International Commission Control (CIC).\n#Withdrawal of the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military troops of the territory, except for the French instructors placed at the disposal of the Laotian Army.\n#Principle of neutrality which prohibited membership in military alliances and introduction of troops and foreign weapons on Laotian territory.\n\n[[File:Ap540721012_geneva_conference_1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Palais de Nations, Geneva, July 21, 1954, after the signing of the Indo China Truce Agreements. Left to right: the Soviet delegation and the British. Next table: the Laotian, French and Vietnam delegations, and with backs to the camera, the Cambodia delegation and, left, the United States delegation.]]\n\nWhereas all details of the cease-fire in Vietnam were settled, the agreement #3 which was equivalent to a recognition of the [[Pathet Lao]] as an official authority through its \u00ab Fighting Units \u00bb, divided the royal representatives of the Laotian delegation and extended negotiations till late in the night of July 20. Shortly after midnight, despite the opinion of his delegation's leader, [[Phoui Sananikone]], Kou Voravong finally granted to sign the final declaration, thereby closing the conference on July 21, 1954.\n\nIn spite of significant concessions of the [[Pathet Lao]], politically -[recognition of the Government of Vientiane]- as well as military -[withdrawals of the armed forces of the liberated zones and their grouping in [[Xam Neua]] (Houaphanh) and [[Phongsali]] Provinces] \u2013 their official establishment next to the Lao Royal Government pending elections was far from eliciting unanimity. This was particularly true for the U.S. government which refused to sign and to apply the [[Geneva Agreements]], considering that they handed a too large victory to the Indochinese Liberation Movements, headed by the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]], and supported by China and the Soviet Union. The spectrum of the Korean War just ended is still too present, that's why Washington's policy goal from now on, was to challenge the results of such agreements.\n\nOn September 8, 1954, at the initiative of the United States, a military organization [[SEATO]] was created. Equivalent of [[NATO]] in Southeast Asia, its official goal was to form a \"quarantine line\" against Communist expansion. It was decided by the authority that [[Cambodia]], and Laos, considering their strategical position, belonged automatically to its protection zone. The defense minister Kou Voravong, supporter of strict application of the Geneva Agreements on the principle of neutrality prohibiting any military alliance, declined the protection of his country by the SEATO and refused to ratify the treaty, thereby blocking the American policy of containment towards the Communist expansion in Asia.\n\nUpon returning of the Geneva delegation, conflicts appeared within the Government. At the same period, rumors of coup by revolutionary conspiracies supporting Chao [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] circulated, creating strong troubles in the country. These extreme tensions reached the summit, when two months later, an attack was committed on September 18, during a reception at [[Phoui Sananikone]]'s residence, one of the delegates at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Present among the dinner guests, hit by a bullet in the back, Kou Voravong died one half an hour later at the Mahosot Hospital (\u0ec2\u0eae\u0e87\u0e9e\u0e8d\u0eb2\u0e9a\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ea1\u0eb0\u0ec2\u0eab\u0eaa\u0ebb\u0e94), in Vientiane.\n\n== Assassination and political consequences ==\n\n=== September 18th attack ===\n\n==== Circumstances and facts ====\nThe attack occurred at approximately 22:15, at Phoui Sananikone's, an official residence nearby the Voravong family's. The attackers launched three grenades by one of the windows on the ground floor, in the dining room. They fired three or four pistol shots and then run away. Kou voravong, sitting with his back to the window, was directly hit by a bullet which came in by the kidney and out through the navel, after cutting the vena cava and crossed the liver and intestines. His dead is declared shortly after admission to hospital. A dozen people were injured by the explosion of the grenades, slightly for most of them.\n\nFifteen minutes later, when the police arrived, it was total confusion: in the panic, people had trampled the crime scene and destroyed evidences. According to witnesses, two men flew away behind the house through the gardens, in the direction of the swamps Muang Noy (\u0ec0\u0ea1\u0eb7\u0ead\u0e87\u0e99\u0ec9\u0ead\u0e8d), located 20&nbsp;km around Vientiane. Two suspects, Oudom Louksourine (\u0ead\u0eb8\u0e94\u0ebb\u0ea1 \u0ea5\u0eb8\u0e81\u0eaa\u0eb8\u0ea3\u0eb4\u0e99) and Mi (\u0ea1\u0eb5) were formally recognized, police officers, therefore, set off in pursuit. Even wounded in the arms and legs, Oudom and Mi managed to escape. Supported by local complicity, they succeed in reaching Nong Khai (thai: \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e32\u0e22), on the other side of the Mekong River.\n\nAccording to the police investigations, one of bullets fired by Oudom Louksourine reached Kou Voravong and caused his death. Oudom was a dangerous and notorious gangster, who confessed to have committed about fifteen assassinations. Imprisoned since 1950, he escaped in 1954 and with Mi -his partner in crime- joined a band of bandits established in [[Isan]] region, northeast Thailand, whose leader named Bounkong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e81\u0ead\u0e87), a veteran Lao Issara and faithful follower of Chao Phetsarath.\n\nThis band of gangsters was hostile to France and ploted against the Royal Government. It was partly formed by soldiers who have deserted the Chinaimo camp, located near the capital. The conspiracy's members are gathered and hosted by the Thai police under the order of Colonel Praseuth (thai : \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e10), in Nong Khai, a border city located only 20&nbsp;km from Vientiane. It appeared clearly that the Thai police, with or without the approval of the Government, supported the plot of Chinaimo which projected to reverse the Souvanna Phouma's government in order to return power to Chao Phetsarath, exiled in Bangkok since 1946. In addition, Thai authority appeared to have an ambiguous policy towards this case: they protected the conspirators of the Bounkong's band at the beginning, before eliminated most of them. They have constantly refused to extradite Oudom Louksourine, who would still sentenced to death in absentia for Kou Voravong's assassination by the Court of Vientiane in July 1959. At that time, he was captain in the Thai police.\n\n==== Various theories ====\nIf there was no doubt about the identity of the one who pulled the trigger, various theories about the person who was behind the crime were advanced by some people, depending on their political, ideological or family affiliations. They were mainly three:\n\n#The plot headed by Bounkong, supported by Thai separatists, sympathizers of both Vi\u1ec7t Minh revolutionists and of Chao Phetsarath, was firmly anti-French.

His son Boutsabong, would have informed the conspirators of the reception at Sananikone's, which had been although decided in the afternoon. Bong Souvannavong was then arrested and jailed on October 6. According to some conspirators testimony, this attack would be aimed at [[Phoui Sananikone]], who was accused of the anti-Pathet Lao attitude and not having resisted Western pressures on the [[Geneva Agreements]]. For some of them, Kou Voravong's death would be first of all an error, which was then exploited to threaten pro-French government members,<ref name=\"JD-China\u00efmo78,81,107\">{{cite book |language=fr |author=[[Jean Deuve]] |title=Le complot de China\u00efmo|pages=78, 81, 107}}</ref> and for others, it would be a fatal consequence of his intense anti-subversive activity when he was Minister of the Interior,<ref name=\"LoG-ID\">{{cite web|language=en |url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/20.htm|title=Initial Difficulties|website=U.S.Library of Congress|access-date=27 November 2015 }}</ref> and for still others, that could be an extreme reaction of the French Government to his active anti-feudal militancy for a Laotian led administration. \n#Immediately after the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO)'s signing in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the Thai Army was deployed in the North and on the East Bank of the Mekong River, along the Laotian borders.

Kou Voravong's refusal to join the military organization blocked any US intervention and thus hindered the \"containment\" policy of which Thailand was part of. During a National Assembly session, Kou Voravong revealed that strong pressures were put on the two Laotian delegation's leaders by the United States so that they refused to sign the agreement's part concerning Laos at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. [[Phoui Sananikone]] would have accepted a one million bribe not to affix his signature. In his speech, Kou Voravong also revealed that the right-wing forces had planned the [[Pathet Lao]]'s troops suppression, as soon as they were withdrawn from [[Houaphan Province|Samneua]] and [[Phongsaly Province]], as set out in the [[Geneva Agreements]]. And lastly, nine days before his murder, he was preparing a meeting between Chao [[Souvanna Phouma]] \u2013 the Lao Royal Government's chief \u2013 and his half-brother Chao [[Souphanouvong]] \u2013 the [[Pathet Lao]]'s leader \u2013 for the discussions in order to organize the free elections envisaged by these same agreements. For some circles, particularly in the Communist left-wing, Kou Voravong would have become a target of the Lao-Thai right-wing and the [[CIA]]: the main \"beneficiaries\" of his death being the Thai and American governments who considered the [[Geneva Agreements]] as a serious concession from France to communist bloc countries.<ref>{{cite book |language=fr |author1=Sav\u00e8ng Phinith|title=Histoire du Pays Lao|pages=149}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|language=fr |author1=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=Laos \u2013 Encore un \"domino\" de tomb\u00e9 |newspaper=L'unit\u00e9 |number=159 |date= 23 May 1975 |pp=20\u201321 |url=http://62.210.214.184/unite/u-result_frame.php?catalogueID=5098&Rubrique=Laos }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |language=en |author=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=The Furtive War |pages=A Fateful Assassination |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/burchett/1963/the-furtive-war/ch09.htm |access-date=20 September 2015 }}</ref>\n#This affair confronted the three most influential rival families in Laos: the Sananikones, the Souvannavongs and the Voravongs. This was typical in Lao political circles where conflicts of families or personalities were mingled with national politics. Kou Voravong \u2013 leading supporter of the policy of \"neutrality\" \u2013 stood in opposition to the American \"anti-communist\" policy which started to find many sympathizers, and among them was [[Phoui Sananikone]]. Actually, Kou Voravong was murdered at the residence of [[Phoui Sananikone]], who shortly after became Minister of the Interior and hastily got Bong Souvannavong- a left-wing sympathizer \u2013 arrested, whom he accused of being the instigator of Chinaimo's conspiracy, and therefore to be behind the assassination. On January 5, 1955, Thai authorities arrested Oudom Louksourine in Bangkok and declared that the latter confessed to having been paid by [[Phoui Sananikone]] to kill Kou Voravong, but however refused to extradite him to Laos. The two rival families newspapers then started a violent campaign against [[Phoui Sananikone]] and the March 9, 1955, complaints for assassination was filed against him by the Voravong family at the Vientiane Court. Despite of the given judgement which concluded to dismiss the case for insufficient evidence, the resentments persisted and the charges were maintained.

A two-thirds majority was necessary for a nomination, but no major political party came to get it. A compromise was reached between the two major parties: half members of former neutralist government \u2013 pro-French, favoring the strict application of the agreements signed at Geneva \u2013 and half members of the progressive opposition \u2013 pro-American, opposed to this same agreements \u2013 knowing that neither side was intending to grant concessions to the other.

But as the independence movement was led by the Communist Party, and [[Vietnam]] was geographically close to China and not far from [[North Korea]], USA got interested in the conflict taking place in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]]. To justify their intervention, the Americans referred to the \"[[Domino theory]]\" that if Vietnam fell into the hands of the Communists, neighboring countries would follow, earned by the contagion or assaulted by military forces from Hanoi. This shift would change radically forces East/West reports in whole Asia.\n\nIn the other camp, the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]]'s victory enabled [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] to control the area of North-Laos, but [[Ho Chi Minh]] nourished a higher ambition for Indochina.

And then in the aftermath of the defeat, he took refuge in Thailand. Upon his return from exile in 1949, he joined the newly formed Lao National Army, created in March of the same year.\n\nEarly in 1950, when Bounkong and his band engaged in violent anti-government campaigns in the South of the country, Kou Voravong created the \"Pacification of Southern Laos Mission\" to combat internal subversion and border piracy. This organization whose headquarter was based in [[Pakse]], was responsible to bring together supporters, volunteers and former members of the [[Lao Issara]] movement, to form units to combat subversion and banditry. Occupied with his ministerial responsibilities in Vientiane, he entrusted the command to his cousin and brother-in-law, the young lieutenant [[Phoumi Nosavan]].\n\n[[File:Stade Kou Voravong.jpg|thumb|upright=1|entrance to Kou Voravong stadium]]\n\nConsidering that the Bounkong Band was known in the province, he got in touch with its members and proposed them negotiations so that they convinced the local insurgents to lay down arms and to adhered to the national cause.

In 1960, during the legislative election campaign of Ou (\u0ead\u0eb8) and Bounthong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e97\u0ebb\u0e87) \u2013 Kou Voravong's half-brothers \u2013 the three cousins promised to the [[Savannakhet]] population that in the event of electoral success they would pay tribute to their brother and cousin, \"the home-grown child\", a murdered rising political figure.

At the height of his career in May 1960, thanks to his relationship with [[Sarit Thanarat]] \u2013 the current Thai Prime Minister \u2013 and in association with Ou and Bounthong Voravong, he commissioned and financed a life-size statue of Kou Voravong at the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] of the Ministry of Culture of Thailand. In [[Savannakhet]], a \"Kou Voravong Stadium\" was built at the extreme north of the avenue of the same name, and the site of the statue was planned on an esplanade just at the entrance.\n\nBut the country was immersed in a civil war, itself within the context of the [[Cold War]]. In 1963, when his uncle the General [[Sarit Thanarat]] died, he lost Thailand's Government support, while on the other side, the United States opted for direct military intervention policy. At the end of January 1965, after several \"disobediences\" to the American military advisory, and following a coup against his government, whose instigator was General [[Kouprasith Abhay]], [[Phoumi Nosavan]] was forced to go into exile in Thailand with his followers and relatives.

On October 23, 1953, a Treaty of Amity and Association was signed and France committed to defend Laos against the advance of communist troops.  A garrison assigned under the command of General [[Henri Navarre]] \u2013 whose mission was to prevent any Vi\u1ec7t Minh infiltration to Laos \u2013 was implanted in a strategic area, in West [[Tonkin]], close to the Laotian border, where were some important runways connecting Luang Prabang to Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu Basin.\n\nBut May 7, 1954, French soldiers suffered a bitter military setback and Di\u00ean Bi\u00ean Phu's entrenched camp fell into the hands of the People's Army of Vietnam, commanded by General V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p. Whereupon, a conference was organized on July 20 in Geneva (Switzerland) to end hostilities between the French Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, ending eight years of war in Indochina. By the same occasion, the independence of Laos and Cambodia was reaffirmed.\n\nAt the conference, the Kingdom of Laos delegation was composed of Phoui Sananikone (minister of Foreign Affairs \u2013 leader), Kou Voravong (Minister of Defense \u2013 vice-leader) and eight members of Parliament. The members of Pathet Lao including Chao [[Souphanouvong]], who carried North-Vietnamese passports, were integrated into the Vi\u1ec7t Minh delegation.\n\nThe final declaration of the Geneva Agreements provided for Laos:\n#Recognition of the independence and total sovereignty of Laos.\n#Recognition of Vientiane Royal Government as the legal government of Laos.\n#Recognition of the \u00ab Fighting Units of the Pathet Lao \u00bb grouped in the Xam Neua and Phongsali Provinces, awaiting for their integration into the Royal Army after political settlement through free general elections planned in 1955, under the supervision of the International Commission Control (CIC).\n#Withdrawal of the French and Vi\u1ec7t Minh military troops of the territory, except for the French instructors placed at the disposal of the Laotian Army.\n#Principle of neutrality which prohibited membership in military alliances and introduction of troops and foreign weapons on Laotian territory.\n\n[[File:Ap540721012_geneva_conference_1954.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Palais de Nations, Geneva, July 21, 1954, after the signing of the Indo China Truce Agreements. Left to right: the Soviet delegation and the British. Next table: the Laotian, French and Vietnam delegations, and with backs to the camera, the Cambodia delegation and, left, the United States delegation.]]\n\nWhereas all details of the cease-fire in Vietnam were settled, the agreement #3 which was equivalent to a recognition of the [[Pathet Lao]] as an official authority through its \u00ab Fighting Units \u00bb, divided the royal representatives of the Laotian delegation and extended negotiations till late in the night of July 20. Shortly after midnight, despite the opinion of his delegation's leader, [[Phoui Sananikone]], Kou Voravong finally granted to sign the final declaration, thereby closing the conference on July 21, 1954.\n\nIn spite of significant concessions of the [[Pathet Lao]], politically -[recognition of the Government of Vientiane]- as well as military -[withdrawals of the armed forces of the liberated zones and their grouping in [[Xam Neua]] (Houaphanh) and [[Phongsali]] Provinces] \u2013 their official establishment next to the Lao Royal Government pending elections was far from eliciting unanimity. This was particularly true for the U.S. government which refused to sign and to apply the [[Geneva Agreements]], considering that they handed a too large victory to the Indochinese Liberation Movements, headed by the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]], and supported by China and the Soviet Union. The spectrum of the Korean War just ended is still too present, that's why Washington's policy goal from now on, was to challenge the results of such agreements.\n\nOn September 8, 1954, at the initiative of the United States, a military organization [[SEATO]] was created. Equivalent of [[NATO]] in Southeast Asia, its official goal was to form a \"quarantine line\" against Communist expansion. It was decided by the authority that [[Cambodia]], and Laos, considering their strategical position, belonged automatically to its protection zone. The defense minister Kou Voravong, supporter of strict application of the Geneva Agreements on the principle of neutrality prohibiting any military alliance, declined the protection of his country by the SEATO and refused to ratify the treaty, thereby blocking the American policy of containment towards the Communist expansion in Asia.\n\nUpon returning of the Geneva delegation, conflicts appeared within the Government. At the same period, rumors of coup by revolutionary conspiracies supporting Chao [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] circulated, creating strong troubles in the country. These extreme tensions reached the summit, when two months later, an attack was committed on September 18, during a reception at [[Phoui Sananikone]]'s residence, one of the delegates at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Present among the dinner guests, hit by a bullet in the back, Kou Voravong died one half an hour later at the Mahosot Hospital (\u0ec2\u0eae\u0e87\u0e9e\u0e8d\u0eb2\u0e9a\u0eb2\u0e99\u0ea1\u0eb0\u0ec2\u0eab\u0eaa\u0ebb\u0e94), in Vientiane.\n\n== Assassination and political consequences ==\n\n=== September 18th attack ===\n\n==== Circumstances and facts ====\nThe attack occurred at approximately 22:15, at Phoui Sananikone's, an official residence nearby the Voravong family's. The attackers launched three grenades by one of the windows on the ground floor, in the dining room. They fired three or four pistol shots and then run away. Kou voravong, sitting with his back to the window, was directly hit by a bullet which came in by the kidney and out through the navel, after cutting the vena cava and crossed the liver and intestines. His dead is declared shortly after admission to hospital. A dozen people were injured by the explosion of the grenades, slightly for most of them.\n\nFifteen minutes later, when the police arrived, it was total confusion: in the panic, people had trampled the crime scene and destroyed evidences. According to witnesses, two men flew away behind the house through the gardens, in the direction of the swamps Muang Noy (\u0ec0\u0ea1\u0eb7\u0ead\u0e87\u0e99\u0ec9\u0ead\u0e8d), located 20&nbsp;km around Vientiane. Two suspects, Oudom Louksourine (\u0ead\u0eb8\u0e94\u0ebb\u0ea1 \u0ea5\u0eb8\u0e81\u0eaa\u0eb8\u0ea3\u0eb4\u0e99) and Mi (\u0ea1\u0eb5) were formally recognized, police officers, therefore, set off in pursuit. Even wounded in the arms and legs, Oudom and Mi managed to escape. Supported by local complicity, they succeed in reaching Nong Khai (thai: \u0e2b\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e32\u0e22), on the other side of the Mekong River.\n\nAccording to the police investigations, one of bullets fired by Oudom Louksourine reached Kou Voravong and caused his death. Oudom was a dangerous and notorious gangster, who confessed to have committed about fifteen assassinations. Imprisoned since 1950, he escaped in 1954 and with Mi -his partner in crime- joined a band of bandits established in [[Isan]] region, northeast Thailand, whose leader named Bounkong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e81\u0ead\u0e87), a veteran Lao Issara and faithful follower of Chao Phetsarath.\n\nThis band of gangsters was hostile to France and ploted against the Royal Government. It was partly formed by soldiers who have deserted the Chinaimo camp, located near the capital. The conspiracy's members are gathered and hosted by the Thai police under the order of Colonel Praseuth (thai : \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e10), in Nong Khai, a border city located only 20&nbsp;km from Vientiane. It appeared clearly that the Thai police, with or without the approval of the Government, supported the plot of Chinaimo which projected to reverse the Souvanna Phouma's government in order to return power to Chao Phetsarath, exiled in Bangkok since 1946. In addition, Thai authority appeared to have an ambiguous policy towards this case: they protected the conspirators of the Bounkong's band at the beginning, before eliminated most of them. They have constantly refused to extradite Oudom Louksourine, who would still sentenced to death in absentia for Kou Voravong's assassination by the Court of Vientiane in July 1959. At that time, he was captain in the Thai police.\n\n==== Various theories ====\nIf there was no doubt about the identity of the one who pulled the trigger, various theories about the person who was behind the crime were advanced by some people, depending on their political, ideological or family affiliations. They were mainly three:\n\n#The plot headed by Bounkong, supported by Thai separatists, sympathizers of both Vi\u1ec7t Minh revolutionists and of Chao Phetsarath, was firmly anti-French.

His son Boutsabong, would have informed the conspirators of the reception at Sananikone's, which had been although decided in the afternoon. Bong Souvannavong was then arrested and jailed on October 6. According to some conspirators testimony, this attack would be aimed at [[Phoui Sananikone]], who was accused of the anti-Pathet Lao attitude and not having resisted Western pressures on the [[Geneva Agreements]]. For some of them, Kou Voravong's death would be first of all an error, which was then exploited to threaten pro-French government members,<ref name=\"JD-China\u00efmo78,81,107\">{{cite book |language=fr |author=[[Jean Deuve]] |title=Le complot de China\u00efmo|pages=78, 81, 107}}</ref> and for others, it would be a fatal consequence of his intense anti-subversive activity when he was Minister of the Interior,<ref name=\"LoG-ID\">{{cite web|language=en |url=http://countrystudies.us/laos/20.htm|title=Initial Difficulties|website=U.S.Library of Congress|access-date=27 November 2015 }}</ref> and for still others, that could be an extreme reaction of the French Government to his active anti-feudal militancy for a Laotian led administration. \n#Immediately after the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO)'s signing in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], the Thai Army was deployed in the North and on the East Bank of the Mekong River, along the Laotian borders. Following the refusal of the [[the United Nations|UNO]]'s Security Council to monitor borders against communist infiltration,<ref group=\"n\">Request filed late May and rejected on June 18, 1954.</ref> the Bangkok Government fear facing the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] was effective, and the Thai Authorities role in this case appeared decisive. Kou Voravong's refusal to join the military organization blocked any US intervention and thus hindered the \"containment\" policy of which Thailand was part of. During a National Assembly session, Kou Voravong revealed that strong pressures were put on the two Laotian delegation's leaders by the United States so that they refused to sign the agreement's part concerning Laos at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. [[Phoui Sananikone]] would have accepted a one million bribe not to affix his signature. In his speech, Kou Voravong also revealed that the right-wing forces had planned the [[Pathet Lao]]'s troops suppression, as soon as they were withdrawn from [[Houaphan Province|Samneua]] and [[Phongsaly Province]], as set out in the [[Geneva Agreements]]. And lastly, nine days before his murder, he was preparing a meeting between Chao [[Souvanna Phouma]] \u2013 the Lao Royal Government's chief \u2013 and his half-brother Chao [[Souphanouvong]] \u2013 the [[Pathet Lao]]'s leader \u2013 for the discussions in order to organize the free elections envisaged by these same agreements. For some circles, particularly in the Communist left-wing, Kou Voravong would have become a target of the Lao-Thai right-wing and the [[CIA]]: the main \"beneficiaries\" of his death being the Thai and American governments who considered the [[Geneva Agreements]] as a serious concession from France to communist bloc countries.<ref>{{cite book |language=fr |author1=Sav\u00e8ng Phinith|title=Histoire du Pays Lao|pages=149}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|language=fr |author1=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=Laos \u2013 Encore un \"domino\" de tomb\u00e9 |newspaper=L'unit\u00e9 |number=159 |date= 23 May 1975 |pp=20\u201321 |url=http://62.210.214.184/unite/u-result_frame.php?catalogueID=5098&Rubrique=Laos }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |language=en |author=[[Wilfred Burchett]] |title=The Furtive War |pages=A Fateful Assassination |url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/burchett/1963/the-furtive-war/ch09.htm |access-date=20 September 2015 }}</ref>\n#This affair confronted the three most influential rival families in Laos: the Sananikones, the Souvannavongs and the Voravongs. This was typical in Lao political circles where conflicts of families or personalities were mingled with national politics. Kou Voravong \u2013 leading supporter of the policy of \"neutrality\" \u2013 stood in opposition to the American \"anti-communist\" policy which started to find many sympathizers, and among them was [[Phoui Sananikone]]. Actually, Kou Voravong was murdered at the residence of [[Phoui Sananikone]], who shortly after became Minister of the Interior and hastily got Bong Souvannavong- a left-wing sympathizer \u2013 arrested, whom he accused of being the instigator of Chinaimo's conspiracy, and therefore to be behind the assassination. On January 5, 1955, Thai authorities arrested Oudom Louksourine in Bangkok and declared that the latter confessed to having been paid by [[Phoui Sananikone]] to kill Kou Voravong, but however refused to extradite him to Laos. The two rival families newspapers then started a violent campaign against [[Phoui Sananikone]] and the March 9, 1955, complaints for assassination was filed against him by the Voravong family at the Vientiane Court. Despite of the given judgement which concluded to dismiss the case for insufficient evidence, the resentments persisted and the charges were maintained.

A two-thirds majority was necessary for a nomination, but no major political party came to get it. A compromise was reached between the two major parties: half members of former neutralist government \u2013 pro-French, favoring the strict application of the agreements signed at Geneva \u2013 and half members of the progressive opposition \u2013 pro-American, opposed to this same agreements \u2013 knowing that neither side was intending to grant concessions to the other.

On September 9, 1951, an agreement had been signed between Washington and the Royal Government for economic and, to a lesser extent, military support. Only a small number of Protestant missionaries and a project manager, accompanied by a few [[United States Information Agency|USIS]]<ref group=\"n\">USIS was abolished in 1948 as a central organization, but local services abroad retained this title. Its functions were taken over in 1953 by the United States Information Agency (USIA).</ref> and [[CIA]]'s agents were settled in [[Vientiane]], in 1953. But as the independence movement was led by the Communist Party, and [[Vietnam]] was geographically close to China and not far from [[North Korea]], USA got interested in the conflict taking place in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]]. To justify their intervention, the Americans referred to the \"[[Domino theory]]\" that if Vietnam fell into the hands of the Communists, neighboring countries would follow, earned by the contagion or assaulted by military forces from Hanoi. This shift would change radically forces East/West reports in whole Asia.\n\nIn the other camp, the [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]]'s victory enabled [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh]] to control the area of North-Laos, but [[Ho Chi Minh]] nourished a higher ambition for Indochina. Even though the [[Geneva Agreements]] decreed the neutrality of [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]], Hanoi considered that the independence of [[Vietnam]] could not be complete as long as its two neighboring countries remained under \"imperialist domination\".<ref group=\"n\">The general [[V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p]] wrote in 1950: \u00ab Indochina is one strategic unit and a single battlefield.

This civic association of young Laotians, anti-communist and renovator, was led by the army strongman, the general [[Phoumi Nosavan]]. Born in the Thai-Lao region border (Moukdahane-Savannakhet), he was the nephew of [[Sarit Thanarat]] ([[thai (language)|thai]]: \u0e2a\u0e24\u0e29\u0e14\u0e34\u0e4c \u0e18\u0e19\u0e30\u0e23\u0e31\u0e0a\u0e15\u0e4c) \u2013 the current Thai Government Prime minister \u2013 and first of all, the general [[Phoumi Nosavan]] was Kou Voravong's cousin and brother-in-law.\n\n== The statue ==\n\n=== Creation in Bangkok ===\n\n\n\nDuring the confrontations in 1946, [[Phoumi Nosavan]] had sided with Chao [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa|Phetsarath]]'s [[Lao Issara]] Government. And then in the aftermath of the defeat, he took refuge in Thailand. Upon his return from exile in 1949, he joined the newly formed Lao National Army, created in March of the same year.\n\nEarly in 1950, when Bounkong and his band engaged in violent anti-government campaigns in the South of the country, Kou Voravong created the \"Pacification of Southern Laos Mission\" to combat internal subversion and border piracy. This organization whose headquarter was based in [[Pakse]], was responsible to bring together supporters, volunteers and former members of the [[Lao Issara]] movement, to form units to combat subversion and banditry. Occupied with his ministerial responsibilities in Vientiane, he entrusted the command to his cousin and brother-in-law, the young lieutenant [[Phoumi Nosavan]].\n\n[[File:Stade Kou Voravong.jpg|thumb|upright=1|entrance to Kou Voravong stadium]]\n\nConsidering that the Bounkong Band was known in the province, he got in touch with its members and proposed them negotiations so that they convinced the local insurgents to lay down arms and to adhered to the national cause. But the bandits would take advantage of the naivety of the young lieutenant to carry out during several months, acts of banditry, spying and intense anti-government guerrillas, by using the pass, material and funds provided by the chief himself.<ref name=\"JD-HPN77-80\">{{cite book |language=fr |author=[[Jean Deuve]] |title=Histoire de la police nationale du Laos|pages=77\u201380}}</ref> Despite the failure of the \"Pacification of Southern Laos Mission\" which has nearly cost his political career, Kou Voravong renewed his confidence in [[Phoumi Nosavan]] who would pursue his military career until becoming the Lao National Army's chief of staff, in 1955.\n\nFollowing Kou Voravong's death, he led his family members in their search for the truth concerning the assassination. In 1960, during the legislative election campaign of Ou (\u0ead\u0eb8) and Bounthong (\u0e9a\u0eb8\u0e99\u0e97\u0ebb\u0e87) \u2013 Kou Voravong's half-brothers \u2013 the three cousins promised to the [[Savannakhet]] population that in the event of electoral success they would pay tribute to their brother and cousin, \"the home-grown child\", a murdered rising political figure. Ou and Bounthong Voravong shall be both elected assembly members of the [[Savannakhet Province]] that year.\n\nStarting from 1959 and during six years, with the financial support of [[the CIA]], the general [[Phoumi Nosavan]] became the dominant figure in the Laotian political life. At the height of his career in May 1960, thanks to his relationship with [[Sarit Thanarat]] \u2013 the current Thai Prime Minister \u2013 and in association with Ou and Bounthong Voravong, he commissioned and financed a life-size statue of Kou Voravong at the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] of the Ministry of Culture of Thailand. In [[Savannakhet]], a \"Kou Voravong Stadium\" was built at the extreme north of the avenue of the same name, and the site of the statue was planned on an esplanade just at the entrance.\n\nBut the country was immersed in a civil war, itself within the context of the [[Cold War]]. In 1963, when his uncle the General [[Sarit Thanarat]] died, he lost Thailand's Government support, while on the other side, the United States opted for direct military intervention policy. At the end of January 1965, after several \"disobediences\" to the American military advisory, and following a coup against his government, whose instigator was General [[Kouprasith Abhay]], [[Phoumi Nosavan]] was forced to go into exile in Thailand with his followers and relatives.

Its highly planned ceremonial plazas sited around the mounds with homes for thousands connected by laid out pathways and courtyards suggest the location served as a central religious pilgrimage city.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Bey |first=Lee |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/17/lost-cities-8-mystery-ahokia-illinois-mississippians-native-americans-vanish |title=Lost cities #8: mystery of Cahokia \u2013 why did North America's largest city vanish? |date=August 17, 2016 |work=The Guardian |access-date=2020-03-30 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\nThe city's original name is unknown.  The mounds were later named after the [[Cahokia tribe]], a historic [[Illiniwek]] people living in the area when the first French explorers arrived in the 17th century. As this was centuries after Cahokia was abandoned by its original inhabitants, the Cahokia tribe was not necessarily descended from the earlier Mississippian-era people. Most likely, multiple indigenous ethnic groups settled in the Cahokia Mounds area during the time of the city's apex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/14/0303cahokia_ThomasEmerson.html |title=Native American city on the Mississippi was America's first 'melting pot' &#124; News Bureau &#124; University of Illinois |publisher=News.illinois.edu |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/1880-140306-illinois-cahokia-immigrants |title=12th-Century Cahokia Was a \"Melting Pot\"|work=Archaeology Magazine |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Daniel K. Richter|Daniel Richter]] notes that the apex of the city occurred during the [[Medieval Warming Period]]. This period appears to have fostered an agricultural revolution in upper North America, as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three-fold crops]] of [[maize]], beans ([[legumes]]), and gourds ([[Cucurbita|squash]]) were developed and adapted or bred to the temperate climates of the north from their origins in [[Mesoamerica]]. Richter also notes that Cahokia's advanced development coincided with the development in the Southwest of the [[Chaco Canyon]] society, which also produced large-scale works in an apparent socially stratified society. The decline of the city coincides with the [[Little Ice Age]], although by then, the three-fold agriculture remained well-established throughout temperate North America.<ref>{{cite book | title=Before the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts | publisher=Belknap - Harvard University Press | author=Richter, Daniel K. | year=2011 | location=Cambridge, MA | pages=20\u201321 | isbn=9780674055803}}</ref>\n\n===Rise and peak (13th century)===\nCahokia became the most important center for the people known today as [[Mississippian culture|Mississippians]]. Their settlements ranged across what is now the [[Midwest]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and Southeastern United States. Cahokia was located in a strategic position near the confluence of the Mississippi, [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] Rivers. It maintained trade links with communities as far away as the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Gulf Coast]] to the south, trading in such exotic items as copper, [[Mill Creek chert]],<ref name=ILLINOISAGRI>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/agriculture/htmls/technology/hand_tools/tech_hand_na.html |title=Illinois Agriculture-Technology-Hand tools-Native American Tools |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> and [[whelk]] shells.\n[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|Artists recreation of central Cahokia.

Cahokia's control of the manufacture and distribution of these hand tools was an important economic activity that allowed the city to thrive.<ref name=SNOW2010 /> [[Mississippian culture pottery]] and stone tools in the Cahokian style were found at the Silvernale site<ref>[https://cannonvalleytrail.com/cultural/  Cannon Valley Trail]</ref> near [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], and materials and trade goods from Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast and Lake Superior have been excavated at Cahokia.

Although it was home to only about 1,000 people before ''circa'' 1050, its population grew rapidly after that date. According to a 2007 study in ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', \"Between AD 1050 and 1100, Cahokia's population increased from between 1,400 and 2,800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people\".<ref>Benson LV, Berry MS, Jolie EA, Spangler JD, Stahle DW, Hattori EM. \"Possible impacts of early-11th-, middle-12th-, and late-13th-century droughts on western Native Americans and the Mississippian Cahokians.\" ''Quaternary Science Reviews'' 2007, 26:336\u2013350,</ref> an estimate that applies only to a {{convert|1.8|km2|adj=on}} high density central occupation area.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Benson | first1 = L.

A related problem was waste disposal for the dense population, and Cahokia became unhealthy from polluted waterways. Because it was such an unhealthy place to live, Snow believes that the town had to rely on social and political attractions to bring in a steady supply of new immigrants; otherwise, the town's death rate would have caused it to be abandoned earlier.<ref name=SNOW2010/>\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Mississippian culture mound components HRoe 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A mound diagram of the Mississippian culture|Mississippian period showing the multiple layers of mound construction, mound structures such as temples or mortuaries, ramps with log stairs, and prior structures under later layers, multiple terraces, and intrusive burials]]\nThe population of Cahokia began to decline during the 13th century, and the site was eventually abandoned around 1300.<ref name=\"reader\">Henderson, Harold. \"[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-mound-people/Content?oid=902673 The Rise and Fall of the Mound People]\".

There is no other evidence for warfare, so the [[palisade]] may have been more for ritual or formal separation than for military purposes. Diseases transmitted among the large, dense urban population are another possible cause of decline. Many theories since the late 20th century propose conquest-induced political collapse as the primary reason for Cahokia's abandonment.<ref>Emerson 1997, [[Timothy Pauketat|Pauketat]] 1994.</ref>\n\nTogether with these factors, researchers found evidence in 2015 of major floods at Cahokia, so severe as to flood dwelling places. Analysis of sediment from beneath [[Horseshoe Lake (Madison County, Illinois)|Horseshoe Lake]] has revealed that two major floods occurred in the period of settlement at Cahokia, in roughly 1100\u20131260 and 1340\u20131460.<ref name=\"insight\">[http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/new-insights-curious-disappearance-cahokia-mounds-builders Durrie Bouscaren, \"New insights into the curious disappearance of the Cahokia Mounds builders\"], St. Louis Public Radio, 4 May 2015, accessed 6 May 2015</ref><ref>[http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/spring-2015/article/cahokia-s-rise-and-fall-linked-to-river-flooding \"Cahokia's rise and fall linked to river flooding\"], ''Popular Archaeology'', Spring 2015</ref>\n\n==Notable features==\n\nThe original site contained 120 earthen mounds over an area of {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|0}}, of which 80 remain today.

Along with the early phase of Monks Mound, an overarching urban layout was established at the site. It was built with a symbolic quadripartite worldview and oriented toward the four cardinal directions with the main east-west and north-south axes defined with Monks Mound near its center point. Four large [[plaza]]s were established to the east, west, north, and south of Monks Mound.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Archaeology of Religion: Cultures and their Beliefs in Worldwide Context| author= Steadman, Sharon R. | page= | isbn= 978-1598741544 | publisher= Routledge| date=2009 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=5XGTDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT136&dq=quadripartite%20world%20view%20at%20cahokia&pg=PT136#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author= Chappell, Sally A.

A later addition to the site, when the palisade was constructed, it cut through and separated some pre-existing neighborhoods.<ref name=SNOW2010/> Archaeologists found evidence of the stockade during excavation of the area and indications that it was rebuilt several times. Its [[bastions]] showed that it was mainly built for defensive purposes.<ref name=SNOW2010/>\n\nBeyond Monks Mound, as many as 120 more mounds stood at varying distances from the city center. To date, 109 mounds have been located, 68 of which are in the park area. The mounds are divided into three different types: [[platform mound|platform]], [[cone (geometry)|conical]], and [[ridge]]-top. Each appeared to have had its own meaning and function. In general terms, the city center seems to have been laid out in a diamond-shaped pattern about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} from end to end, while the entire city is {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} across from east to west.\n\n===Mound 72===\n{{main|Mound 72}}\n[[File:Cahokia Mound 72.jpg|thumb|Mound 72]]\n\nDuring excavation of Mound 72, a ridge-top [[burial mound]] south of main urban precinct, archaeologists found the remains of a man in his 40s who was probably an important Cahokian ruler. The man was buried on a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a [[falcon]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2001augustmound72excavation1.htm |title=Cahokia and the excavation of Mound 72|accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> with the bird's head appearing beneath and beside the man's head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs.\n\nThe falcon warrior or \"[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|birdman]]\" is a common motif in Mississippian culture. This burial clearly had powerful [[iconography|iconographic]] significance. In addition, a cache of sophisticated, finely worked [[arrow]]heads in a variety of different styles and materials was found near the grave of this important man. Separated into four types, each from a different geographical region, the arrowheads demonstrated Cahokia's extensive trade links in North America.\n\nArcheologists recovered more than 250 other skeletons from Mound 72. Scholars believe almost 62% of these were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors.<ref>Young & Fowler, p. 148.</ref>  The skeletons include:\n* Four young males, missing their hands and skulls\n* A mass grave of more than 50 women around 21 years old, with the bodies arranged in two layers separated by matting\n* A mass burial containing 40 men and women who appear to have been violently killed, some of these may have been buried alive: \"From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred \u2013 that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.\"<ref>Young & Fowler, pp. 146\u2013149.</ref>\n\nThe relationship of these burials to the central burial is unclear. They were unlikely to have all deposited at the same time. Wood in several parts of the mound has been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to between 950 and 1000&nbsp;CE.\n\nExcavations have indicated that Mound 72 was not constructed as a single mound, but rather as a series of smaller mounds.

Most of these mounds were leveled throughout the construction of St. Louis, as their material was reused in construction projects.\n\nThe lone survivor of these mounds is [[Sugarloaf Mound]], which is located on the west bank of the Mississippi.

Later designation as a state historic site offered additional protection, but the site came under significant threat from the federal highway building program in the 1950s. The highway program reduced the site's integrity; however, it increased funding for emergency archeological investigations. These investigations became intensive, and today continue, and have led to the present understanding of the significance of the site.

The mounds were later named after the [[Cahokia tribe]], a historic [[Illiniwek]] people living in the area when the first French explorers arrived in the 17th century. As this was centuries after Cahokia was abandoned by its original inhabitants, the Cahokia tribe was not necessarily descended from the earlier Mississippian-era people. Most likely, multiple indigenous ethnic groups settled in the Cahokia Mounds area during the time of the city's apex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/14/0303cahokia_ThomasEmerson.html |title=Native American city on the Mississippi was America's first 'melting pot' &#124; News Bureau &#124; University of Illinois |publisher=News.illinois.edu |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news/1880-140306-illinois-cahokia-immigrants |title=12th-Century Cahokia Was a \"Melting Pot\"|work=Archaeology Magazine |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=2014-03-06 |accessdate=2014-03-29}}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Daniel K. Richter|Daniel Richter]] notes that the apex of the city occurred during the [[Medieval Warming Period]]. This period appears to have fostered an agricultural revolution in upper North America, as the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three-fold crops]] of [[maize]], beans ([[legumes]]), and gourds ([[Cucurbita|squash]]) were developed and adapted or bred to the temperate climates of the north from their origins in [[Mesoamerica]]. Richter also notes that Cahokia's advanced development coincided with the development in the Southwest of the [[Chaco Canyon]] society, which also produced large-scale works in an apparent socially stratified society. The decline of the city coincides with the [[Little Ice Age]], although by then, the three-fold agriculture remained well-established throughout temperate North America.<ref>{{cite book | title=Before the Revolution: America's Ancient Pasts | publisher=Belknap - Harvard University Press | author=Richter, Daniel K. | year=2011 | location=Cambridge, MA | pages=20\u201321 | isbn=9780674055803}}</ref>\n\n===Rise and peak (13th century)===\nCahokia became the most important center for the people known today as [[Mississippian culture|Mississippians]]. Their settlements ranged across what is now the [[Midwest]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and Southeastern United States. Cahokia was located in a strategic position near the confluence of the Mississippi, [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and [[Illinois River|Illinois]] Rivers. It maintained trade links with communities as far away as the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Gulf Coast]] to the south, trading in such exotic items as copper, [[Mill Creek chert]],<ref name=ILLINOISAGRI>{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/agriculture/htmls/technology/hand_tools/tech_hand_na.html |title=Illinois Agriculture-Technology-Hand tools-Native American Tools |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> and [[whelk]] shells.\n[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|Artists recreation of central Cahokia.

Cahokia's control of the manufacture and distribution of these hand tools was an important economic activity that allowed the city to thrive.<ref name=SNOW2010 /> [[Mississippian culture pottery]] and stone tools in the Cahokian style were found at the Silvernale site<ref>[https://cannonvalleytrail.com/cultural/  Cannon Valley Trail]</ref> near [[Red Wing, Minnesota]], and materials and trade goods from Pennsylvania, the Gulf Coast and Lake Superior have been excavated at Cahokia. Bartering, not money, was used in trade.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/march/12/cahokia.htm</ref>\n\nAt the high point of its development, Cahokia was the largest urban center north of the great [[Mesoamerica]]n cities in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]]. Although it was home to only about 1,000 people before ''circa'' 1050, its population grew rapidly after that date. According to a 2007 study in ''[[Quaternary Science Reviews]]'', \"Between AD 1050 and 1100, Cahokia's population increased from between 1,400 and 2,800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people\".<ref>Benson LV, Berry MS, Jolie EA, Spangler JD, Stahle DW, Hattori EM. \"Possible impacts of early-11th-, middle-12th-, and late-13th-century droughts on western Native Americans and the Mississippian Cahokians.\" ''Quaternary Science Reviews'' 2007, 26:336\u2013350,</ref> an estimate that applies only to a {{convert|1.8|km2|adj=on}} high density central occupation area.<ref>Benson, L.

A related problem was waste disposal for the dense population, and Cahokia became unhealthy from polluted waterways. Because it was such an unhealthy place to live, Snow believes that the town had to rely on social and political attractions to bring in a steady supply of new immigrants; otherwise, the town's death rate would have caused it to be abandoned earlier.<ref name=SNOW2010/>\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Mississippian culture mound components HRoe 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A mound diagram of the Mississippian culture|Mississippian period showing the multiple layers of mound construction, mound structures such as temples or mortuaries, ramps with log stairs, and prior structures under later layers, multiple terraces, and intrusive burials]]\nThe population of Cahokia began to decline during the 13th century, and the site was eventually abandoned around 1300.<ref name=\"reader\">Henderson, Harold. \"[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-mound-people/Content?oid=902673 The Rise and Fall of the Mound People]\".

There is no other evidence for warfare, so the [[palisade]] may have been more for ritual or formal separation than for military purposes. Diseases transmitted among the large, dense urban population are another possible cause of decline. Many theories since the late 20th century propose conquest-induced political collapse as the primary reason for Cahokia's abandonment.<ref>Emerson 1997, [[Timothy Pauketat|Pauketat]] 1994.</ref>\n\nTogether with these factors, researchers found evidence in 2015 of major floods at Cahokia, so severe as to flood dwelling places. Analysis of sediment from beneath [[Horseshoe Lake (Madison County, Illinois)|Horseshoe Lake]] has revealed that two major floods occurred in the period of settlement at Cahokia, in roughly 1100\u20131260 and 1340\u20131460.<ref name=\"insight\">[http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/new-insights-curious-disappearance-cahokia-mounds-builders Durrie Bouscaren, \"New insights into the curious disappearance of the Cahokia Mounds builders\"], St. Louis Public Radio, 4 May 2015, accessed 6 May 2015</ref><ref>[http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/spring-2015/article/cahokia-s-rise-and-fall-linked-to-river-flooding \"Cahokia's rise and fall linked to river flooding\"], ''Popular Archaeology'', Spring 2015</ref>\n\n==Notable features==\n\nThe original site contained 120 earthen mounds over an area of {{convert|6|sqmi|km2|0}}, of which 80 remain today.

Along with the early phase of Monks Mound, an overarching urban layout was established at the site. It was built with a symbolic quadripartite worldview and oriented toward the four cardinal directions with the main east-west and north-south axes defined with Monks Mound near its center point. Four large [[plaza]]s were established to the east, west, north, and south of Monks Mound.<ref>{{Cite book| title= Archaeology of Religion: Cultures and their Beliefs in Worldwide Context| author= Steadman, Sharon R. | page= | isbn= 978-1598741544 | publisher= Routledge| date=2009 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=5XGTDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT136&dq=quadripartite%20world%20view%20at%20cahokia&pg=PT136#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author= Chappell, Sally A.

The causeway itself may have been seen as a symbolic \"Path of Souls\".<ref name=BAIRES/>\n\nThe high-status central district of Cahokia was surrounded by a 2-mi-long palisade that was equipped with protective bastions. A later addition to the site, when the palisade was constructed, it cut through and separated some pre-existing neighborhoods.<ref name=SNOW2010/> Archaeologists found evidence of the stockade during excavation of the area and indications that it was rebuilt several times. Its [[bastions]] showed that it was mainly built for defensive purposes.<ref name=SNOW2010/>\n\nBeyond Monks Mound, as many as 120 more mounds stood at varying distances from the city center. To date, 109 mounds have been located, 68 of which are in the park area. The mounds are divided into three different types: [[platform mound|platform]], [[cone (geometry)|conical]], and [[ridge]]-top. Each appeared to have had its own meaning and function. In general terms, the city center seems to have been laid out in a diamond-shaped pattern about {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} from end to end, while the entire city is {{convert|5|mi|km|abbr=on}} across from east to west.\n\n===Mound 72===\n{{main|Mound 72}}\n[[File:Cahokia Mound 72.jpg|thumb|Mound 72]]\n\nDuring excavation of Mound 72, a ridge-top [[burial mound]] south of main urban precinct, archaeologists found the remains of a man in his 40s who was probably an important Cahokian ruler. The man was buried on a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged in the shape of a [[falcon]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2001augustmound72excavation1.htm |title=Cahokia and the excavation of Mound 72|accessdate=2010-08-21}}</ref> with the bird's head appearing beneath and beside the man's head, and its wings and tail beneath his arms and legs.\n\nThe falcon warrior or \"[[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Birdman|birdman]]\" is a common motif in Mississippian culture. This burial clearly had powerful [[iconography|iconographic]] significance. In addition, a cache of sophisticated, finely worked [[arrow]]heads in a variety of different styles and materials was found near the grave of this important man. Separated into four types, each from a different geographical region, the arrowheads demonstrated Cahokia's extensive trade links in North America.\n\nArcheologists recovered more than 250 other skeletons from Mound 72. Scholars believe almost 62% of these were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors.<ref>Young & Fowler, p. 148.</ref>  The skeletons include:\n* Four young males, missing their hands and skulls\n* A mass grave of more than 50 women around 21 years old, with the bodies arranged in two layers separated by matting\n* A mass burial containing 40 men and women who appear to have been violently killed, some of these may have been buried alive: \"From the vertical position of some of the fingers, which appear to have been digging in the sand, it is apparent that not all of the victims were dead when they were interred \u2013 that some had been trying to pull themselves out of the mass of bodies.\"<ref>Young & Fowler, pp. 146\u2013149.</ref>\n\nThe relationship of these burials to the central burial is unclear. They were unlikely to have all deposited at the same time. Wood in several parts of the mound has been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] to between 950 and 1000&nbsp;CE.\n\nExcavations have indicated that Mound 72 was not constructed as a single mound, but rather as a series of smaller mounds.

Most of these mounds were leveled throughout the construction of St. Louis, as their material was reused in construction projects.\n\nThe lone survivor of these mounds is [[Sugarloaf Mound]], which is located on the west bank of the Mississippi.  It marked the initial border between St. Louis and the once autonomous city of [[Carondelet, Missouri|Carondelet]].\n\n==Cahokia Museum and Interpretive Center==\n[[File:Cahokia 1.jpg|thumb|222px|right|Museum and Interpretive Center]]\nThe Cahokia Museum and Interpretive Center, which receives up to a million visitors a year, was designed by [[AAIC Inc.]]  The building, which opened in 1989, received the Thomas H. Madigan Award, the ''St. Louis Construction News & Reviews'' Readers Choice Award, the Merit Award from the [[Metal Construction Association]], and the Outstanding Achievement Award from the Brick Manufacturer Association.\n\n==Designations==\nCahokia Mounds was first protected by the state of Illinois in 1923 when its legislature authorized purchase of a state park. Later designation as a state historic site offered additional protection, but the site came under significant threat from the federal highway building program in the 1950s. The highway program reduced the site's integrity; however, it increased funding for emergency archeological investigations. These investigations became intensive, and today continue, and have led to the present understanding of the significance of the site. The site was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on July 19, 1964, and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on October 15, 1966.<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=682&ResourceType=Site|title=Cahokia Mounds|accessdate=2008-07-23|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303145337/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=682&ResourceType=Site|archivedate=March 3, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, [[UNESCO]] (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) designated the site a [[World Heritage Site]].

Its capital is [[Bloemfontein]], which is also South Africa's judicial capital. Its historical origins lie in the [[Boer republic]] called the [[Orange Free State]] and later [[Orange Free State Province]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|Orange Free State}}\nThe current borders of the province date from 1994 when the [[Bantustan]]s were abolished and reincorporated into South Africa. It is also the only one of the four original provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, apart from the reincorporation of Bantustans, and has had these borders since before the outbreak of the [[Boer War]].\n\n==Law and government==\nThe provincial government consists of a premier, an executive council of ten ministers, and a legislature. The provincial assembly and premier are elected for five-year terms, or until the next national election. Political parties are awarded assembly seats based on the percentage of votes each party receives in the province during the national elections. The assembly elects a premier, who then appoints the members of the executive council.\n\nThe premier of Free State is [[Sisi Ntombela]]. She has been serving since her appointment in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/new-female-premiers-elect-for-mpumalanga-and-free-state-20180314|title=ANC chooses women to be next premiers of Free State, Mpumalanga|work=News24|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cornelia, suidaansig, a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cornelia, Free State|Cornelia]] in the Riemland region]]\nThe Free State is situated on a succession of flat grassy plains sprinkled with pastureland, resting on a general elevation of 3,800 feet only broken by the occasional hill or [[kopje]]. The rich soil and pleasant climate allow for a thriving agricultural industry. With more than 30,000 farms, which produce over 70% of the country's grain, it is known locally as South Africa's [[breadbasket]].\n\nThe province is high-lying, with almost all land being 1,000 metres above sea level. The [[Drakensberg]] and [[Maluti Mountains]] foothills raise the terrain to over 2,000 m in the east. The Free State lies in the heart of the [[Karoo]] Sequence of rocks, containing [[shales]], [[mudstones]], [[sandstones]] and the Drakensberg [[Basalt]] forming the youngest capping rocks. Mineral deposits are plentiful, with gold and [[diamonds]] being of particular importance, mostly found in the north and west of the province.\n\n===Fauna and flora===\nThe flats in the south of the reserve provides ideal conditions for large herds of plain game such as [[black wildebeest]] and [[springbok]]. The ridges, koppies and plains typical of the northern section are home to [[kudu]], [[red hartebeest]], [[southern white rhinoceros]] and [[African buffalo|buffalo]]. The [[Southern African wildcat]], [[black wildebeest]], [[zebra]], [[common eland|eland]], white rhinoceros and [[Cape wild dog|wild dog]] can be seen at the [[Soetdoring Nature Reserve]] near [[Bloemfontein]]. The [[South African cheetah]]s has been reintroduced in the Free State for the first time in June 2013 after a hundred years of regional extinction, at [[Laohu Valley Reserve]] near [[Philippolis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cheetahs Return to Laohu Valley Reserve & The Free State|url=http://savechinastigers.org/news.html|publisher=Savechinastigers.org|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Following the reintroduction of an adult female South African cheetah in early 2016, three wild cheetah cubs has been born for the first time in Laohu Valley Reserve in February 2017, making the three new cubs the first cheetahs born in the wild since their disappearance from the Free State province in over a century.<ref>{{cite news|title=First Wild Cheetahs Born In Free State In Over A Century|url=http://www.netwerk24.com/ZA/Bloemnuus/Nuus/first-wild-cheetahs-born-in-fs-in-century-20170301-2|author=Jens Friis|publisher=Netwerk24|date=2 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe Free State experiences a [[continental climate]], characterised by warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Areas in the east experience frequent snowfalls, especially on the higher ranges, whilst the west can be extremely hot in summer. Almost all [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls in the summer months as brief afternoon [[thunderstorms]], with aridity increasing towards the west. Areas in the east around [[Harrismith]], [[Bethlehem, Free State|Bethlehem]] and [[Ficksburg]] are well watered.

South Africa is one of the top ten [[Maize]] producers in the world (12,365,000 tons {{as of|2013|lc=y}}) whereby all of the crops come from the Free State. The Free State is well known for its ''Mielielande'' (corn-fields; the former term is in [[Afrikaans]]).\n\nField crops yield almost two-thirds of the gross agricultural income of the province. Animal products contribute a further 30%, with the balance generated by horticulture. Ninety percent of the country's cherry crop is produced in the Ficksburg district, which is also home to the country's two largest asparagus canning factories. Soya, sorghum, sunflowers and wheat are cultivated in the eastern Free State, where farmers specialise in seed production. About 40% of the country's potato yield comes from the province's high-lying areas.\n\nThe main vegetable crop is asparagus, both white and green varieties. Although horticulture is expanding and becoming increasingly export-orientated, most produce leaves the province unprocessed.\n\nThe Free State's advantage in floriculture is the opposing seasons of the southern and northern hemispheres. The province exports about 1.2&nbsp;million tons of [[cut flowers]] a year.{{dubious|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Mining===\n\nThe Free State is also rich in mineral wealth, gold representing 20% of the world's total gold production. Mining is the province's major employer. The province has 12 gold mines, producing 30% of South Africa's output and making it the fifth-largest producer of gold in the world. The Harmony Gold Refinery and Rand Refinery are the only two gold refineries in South Africa.\n\nGold mines in the Free State also supply a substantial portion of the total silver produced in the country, while considerable concentrations of uranium occurring in the gold-bearing conglomerates of the goldfields are extracted as a byproduct.\n\nBituminous coal is also mined, and converted to petrochemicals at Sasolburg. The Free State also produces high-quality diamonds from its kimberlite pipes and fissures, and the country's largest deposit of bentonite is found in the [[Koppies]] district.\n\n===Industry===\n\nSince 1989, the Free State economy has moved from dependence on primary sectors such as mining and agriculture to an economy increasingly oriented towards manufacturing and export. \nSome 14% of the province's manufacturing is classified as being in high-technology industries \u2013 the highest of all provincial economies. The northern Free State's chemicals sector is one of the most important in the southern hemisphere. Petrochemicals company [[Sasol]], based in the town of [[Sasolburg]], is a world leader in the production of fuels, waxes, chemicals and low-cost feedstock from coal.\n\n===Tourism===\n\nIn the northeastern Free State, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Maluti mountains, the [[Golden Gate Highlands National Park]] is the province's prime tourist attraction. The park gets its name from the brilliant shades of gold cast by the sun on the spectacular sandstone cliffs, especially the imposing Brandwag or Sentinel Rock, which keeps vigil over the park.\n[[File:Brandwag rock.JPG|thumb|Brandwag (The Sentinel)]]\nThe sandstone of this region has been used for the lovely dressed-stone buildings found on the Eastern Highlands, while decoratively painted [[Sotho people|Sotho]] houses dot the grasslands. Some of South Africa's most valued San (Bushman) rock art is found in the Free State, particularly in the regions around [[Clarens, Free State|Clarens]], [[Bethlehem, Free State|Bethlehem]], [[Ficksburg]], [[Ladybrand]] and [[Wepener]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Free State population density map.svg|thumb|Population density in the Free State\n{{div col}}\n{{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#ffeda0|1\u20133 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fed976|3\u201310 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#feb24c|10\u201330 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fd8d3c|30\u2013100 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fc4e2a|100\u2013300 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#e31a1c|300\u20131000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#bc0026|1000\u20133000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{colend}}]]\n[[File:Free State dominant language map.svg|thumb|Dominant home languages in the Free State\n{{colbegin}}\n{{legend|#8dd3c7|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffb3|[[South African English|English]]}}\n{{legend|#fb8072|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]}}\n{{legend|#80b1d3|[[Zulu language|Zulu]]}}\n{{legend|#b3de69|[[Sotho language|Sotho]]}}\n{{legend|#fccde5|[[Tswana language|Tswana]]}}\n{{legend|#d0d0d0|No language dominant}}\n{{colend}}]]\n[[Sesotho]] is the dominant home language in most of the province. [[isiZulu]] is the major language in the far eastern municipality of [[Phumelela Local Municipality|Phumelela]]. [[Setswana]] is the main language in [[Tokologo Local Municipality|Tokologo]] in the northwest, and in and around the area of [[Thaba Nchu]]. The Free State is the only province in South Africa with a Sesotho majority. [[Afrikaans]] is widely spoken throughout the province, as a first language for the majority of whites and coloureds and as a second or third language by Sesotho, Setswana and isiZulu speakers. Although the numbers of first language English speakers are relatively low, it is becoming increasingly important as the language of business and government. This is further evidenced by the shift of tertiary institutions such as the [[University of the Free State]] from Afrikaans to a dual English/Afrikaans medium of instruction.\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nThe majority of the population are black Africans who speak [[Sotho language|Sotho]] as a first language. The vast majority of white people in the Free State are Afrikaans-speaking. In 1880 the white population made up 45.7% of the total population. In 1904 this had fallen to 36.8%.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Orange Free State |display=Orange Free State \u00a7 Inhabitants |volume=20 |page=152 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}</ref> Of the 142,679 people in 1904, only 60% were born in the province. Of the 2,726 [[Europe]]an immigrants born in non-[[United Kingdom|British]] states, 1,025 came from the [[Russian Empire]], mainly [[Jews]]. In 1904 whites made up a majority in most settlements, namely [[Ficksburg]] (52.3%), [[Wepener]] (60.2%), [[Ladybrand]] (60.0%), and [[Kroonstad]] (51.6%), and made up a substantial minority in

Its capital is [[Bloemfontein]], which is also South Africa's judicial capital. Its historical origins lie in the [[Boer republic]] called the [[Orange Free State]] and later [[Orange Free State Province]].\n\n==History==\n{{further|Orange Free State}}\nThe current borders of the province date from 1994 when the [[Bantustan]]s were abolished and reincorporated into South Africa. It is also the only one of the four original provinces of South Africa not to undergo border changes, apart from the reincorporation of Bantustans, and has had these borders since before the outbreak of the [[Boer War]].\n\n==Law and government==\nThe provincial government consists of a premier, an executive council of ten ministers, and a legislature. The provincial assembly and premier are elected for five-year terms, or until the next national election. Political parties are awarded assembly seats based on the percentage of votes each party receives in the province during the national elections. The assembly elects a premier, who then appoints the members of the executive council.\n\nThe premier of Free State is [[Sisi Ntombela]]. She has been serving since her appointment in March 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/new-female-premiers-elect-for-mpumalanga-and-free-state-20180314|title=ANC chooses women to be next premiers of Free State, Mpumalanga|work=News24|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cornelia, suidaansig, a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cornelia, Free State|Cornelia]] in the Riemland region]]\nThe Free State is situated on a succession of flat grassy plains sprinkled with pastureland, resting on a general elevation of 3,800 feet only broken by the occasional hill or [[kopje]]. The rich soil and pleasant climate allow for a thriving agricultural industry. With more than 30,000 farms, which produce over 70% of the country's grain, it is known locally as South Africa's [[breadbasket]].\n\nThe province is high-lying, with almost all land being 1,000 metres above sea level. The [[Drakensberg]] and [[Maluti Mountains]] foothills raise the terrain to over 2,000 m in the east. The Free State lies in the heart of the [[Karoo]] Sequence of rocks, containing [[shales]], [[mudstones]], [[sandstones]] and the Drakensberg [[Basalt]] forming the youngest capping rocks. Mineral deposits are plentiful, with gold and [[diamonds]] being of particular importance, mostly found in the north and west of the province.\n\n===Fauna and flora===\nThe flats in the south of the reserve provides ideal conditions for large herds of plain game such as [[black wildebeest]] and [[springbok]]. The ridges, koppies and plains typical of the northern section are home to [[kudu]], [[red hartebeest]], [[southern white rhinoceros]] and [[African buffalo|buffalo]]. The [[Southern African wildcat]], [[black wildebeest]], [[zebra]], [[common eland|eland]], white rhinoceros and [[Cape wild dog|wild dog]] can be seen at the [[Soetdoring Nature Reserve]] near [[Bloemfontein]]. The [[South African cheetah]]s has been reintroduced in the Free State for the first time in June 2013 after a hundred years of regional extinction, at [[Laohu Valley Reserve]] near [[Philippolis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Cheetahs Return to Laohu Valley Reserve & The Free State|url=http://savechinastigers.org/news.html|publisher=Savechinastigers.org|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Following the reintroduction of an adult female South African cheetah in early 2016, three wild cheetah cubs has been born for the first time in Laohu Valley Reserve in February 2017, making the three new cubs the first cheetahs born in the wild since their disappearance from the Free State province in over a century.<ref>{{cite news|title=First Wild Cheetahs Born In Free State In Over A Century|url=http://www.netwerk24.com/ZA/Bloemnuus/Nuus/first-wild-cheetahs-born-in-fs-in-century-20170301-2|author=Jens Friis|publisher=Netwerk24|date=2 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe Free State experiences a [[continental climate]], characterised by warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters. Areas in the east experience frequent snowfalls, especially on the higher ranges, whilst the west can be extremely hot in summer.

They are able to reach far flung areas in only 45 minutes and deliver a high level of care on scene. On 31 October 2018 Free State Emergency Medical Service launched an additional 65 road ambulances to augment the fleet. \n\nFree state has many public and private hospitals. Some of them are:\n\n*[[Bloemfontein Medi-clinic]]\n*[[Bethlehem Medi-clinic]]\n*[[Welkom Medi-clinic]]\n*[[Rosepark Hospital]]\n*[[Busamed Bram Fischer International Airport Hospital]]\n*[[Mofumahadi Mmanapo Regional Hospital]] in [[Phuthaditjhaba]].\n\nAs of 20 March 2020, seven people had tested positive for Covid-19 in the province.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe province is the granary of South Africa, with agriculture central to its economy, while mining on the rich goldfields reef is its largest employer.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:South Africa-Free State-Cattle01.jpg|thumb|left|Cattle grazing near [[Winburg]]]]\nAgriculture dominates the Free State landscape, with cultivated land covering 32,000 square kilometres, and natural veld and grazing a further 87,000 square kilometres of the province. It is also South Africa's leader in the production of biofuels, or fuel from agricultural crops, with a number of ethanol plants under construction in the grain-producing western region. South Africa is one of the top ten [[Maize]] producers in the world (12,365,000 tons {{as of|2013|lc=y}}) whereby all of the crops come from the Free State. The Free State is well known for its ''Mielielande'' (corn-fields; the former term is in [[Afrikaans]]).\n\nField crops yield almost two-thirds of the gross agricultural income of the province. Animal products contribute a further 30%, with the balance generated by horticulture. Ninety percent of the country's cherry crop is produced in the Ficksburg district, which is also home to the country's two largest asparagus canning factories. Soya, sorghum, sunflowers and wheat are cultivated in the eastern Free State, where farmers specialise in seed production. About 40% of the country's potato yield comes from the province's high-lying areas.\n\nThe main vegetable crop is asparagus, both white and green varieties. Although horticulture is expanding and becoming increasingly export-orientated, most produce leaves the province unprocessed.\n\nThe Free State's advantage in floriculture is the opposing seasons of the southern and northern hemispheres. The province exports about 1.2&nbsp;million tons of [[cut flowers]] a year.{{dubious|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Mining===\n\nThe Free State is also rich in mineral wealth, gold representing 20% of the world's total gold production. Mining is the province's major employer. The province has 12 gold mines, producing 30% of South Africa's output and making it the fifth-largest producer of gold in the world. The Harmony Gold Refinery and Rand Refinery are the only two gold refineries in South Africa.\n\nGold mines in the Free State also supply a substantial portion of the total silver produced in the country, while considerable concentrations of uranium occurring in the gold-bearing conglomerates of the goldfields are extracted as a byproduct.\n\nBituminous coal is also mined, and converted to petrochemicals at Sasolburg. The Free State also produces high-quality diamonds from its kimberlite pipes and fissures, and the country's largest deposit of bentonite is found in the [[Koppies]] district.\n\n===Industry===\n\nSince 1989, the Free State economy has moved from dependence on primary sectors such as mining and agriculture to an economy increasingly oriented towards manufacturing and export. \nSome 14% of the province's manufacturing is classified as being in high-technology industries \u2013 the highest of all provincial economies. The northern Free State's chemicals sector is one of the most important in the southern hemisphere. Petrochemicals company [[Sasol]], based in the town of [[Sasolburg]], is a world leader in the production of fuels, waxes, chemicals and low-cost feedstock from coal.\n\n===Tourism===\n\nIn the northeastern Free State, nestled in the rolling foothills of the Maluti mountains, the [[Golden Gate Highlands National Park]] is the province's prime tourist attraction. The park gets its name from the brilliant shades of gold cast by the sun on the spectacular sandstone cliffs, especially the imposing Brandwag or Sentinel Rock, which keeps vigil over the park.\n[[File:Brandwag rock.JPG|thumb|Brandwag (The Sentinel)]]\nThe sandstone of this region has been used for the lovely dressed-stone buildings found on the Eastern Highlands, while decoratively painted [[Sotho people|Sotho]] houses dot the grasslands. Some of South Africa's most valued San (Bushman) rock art is found in the Free State, particularly in the regions around [[Clarens, Free State|Clarens]], [[Bethlehem, Free State|Bethlehem]], [[Ficksburg]], [[Ladybrand]] and [[Wepener]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Free State population density map.svg|thumb|Population density in the Free State\n{{div col}}\n{{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#ffeda0|1\u20133 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fed976|3\u201310 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#feb24c|10\u201330 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fd8d3c|30\u2013100 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fc4e2a|100\u2013300 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#e31a1c|300\u20131000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#bc0026|1000\u20133000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{colend}}]]\n[[File:Free State dominant language map.svg|thumb|Dominant home languages in the Free State\n{{colbegin}}\n{{legend|#8dd3c7|[[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffb3|[[South African English|English]]}}\n{{legend|#fb8072|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]}}\n{{legend|#80b1d3|[[Zulu language|Zulu]]}}\n{{legend|#b3de69|[[Sotho language|Sotho]]}}\n{{legend|#fccde5|[[Tswana language|Tswana]]}}\n{{legend|#d0d0d0|No language dominant}}\n{{colend}}]]\n[[Sesotho]] is the dominant home language in most of the province. [[isiZulu]] is the major language in the far eastern municipality of [[Phumelela Local Municipality|Phumelela]]. [[Setswana]] is the main language in [[Tokologo Local Municipality|Tokologo]] in the northwest, and in and around the area of [[Thaba Nchu]]. The Free State is the only province in South Africa with a Sesotho majority. [[Afrikaans]] is widely spoken throughout the province, as a first language for the majority of whites and coloureds and as a second or third language by Sesotho, Setswana and isiZulu speakers. Although the numbers of first language English speakers are relatively low, it is becoming increasingly important as the language of business and government. This is further evidenced by the shift of tertiary institutions such as the [[University of the Free State]] from Afrikaans to a dual English/Afrikaans medium of instruction.\n\n=== Ethnicity ===\nThe majority of the population are black Africans who speak [[Sotho language|Sotho]] as a first language. The vast majority of white people in the Free State are Afrikaans-speaking. In 1880 the white population made up 45.7% of the total population. In 1904 this had fallen to 36.8%.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Orange Free State |display=Orange Free State \u00a7 Inhabitants |volume=20 |page=152 |first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana}}</ref> Of the 142,679 people in 1904, only 60% were born in the province. Of the 2,726 [[Europe]]an immigrants born in non-[[United Kingdom|British]] states, 1,025 came from the [[Russian Empire]], mainly [[Jews]]. In 1904 whites made up a majority in most settlements, namely [[Ficksburg]] (52.3%), [[Wepener]] (60.2%), [[Ladybrand]] (60.0%), and [[Kroonstad]] (51.6%), and made up a substantial minority in [[Bloemfontein]] (45.7%) and [[Winburg]] (36.3%).\n\n==Education==\n===Universities===\n*[[University of the Free State]] ([[Bloemfontein]], [[Phuthaditjhaba]])\n*[[Central University of Technology]] ([[Bloemfontein]], [[Welkom]])\n===Other educational institutions===\n*[[Flavius Mareka FET College]] ([[Kroonstad]], [[Mphohardi]], [[Sasolburg]])\n*[[Goldfields FET College]] ([[Welkom]], [[Thabong|Tosa]])\n*[[Motheo FET College]] ([[Bloemfontein]], [[Botshabelo]], [[Thaba nchu]], [[Koffiefontein]])\n*[[Maluti TVET College]] ([[QwaQwa]]\u02cc[[Bethlehem]]\u0329 [[Harrismith]])\n===Secondary schools===\n*[[Grey College, Bloemfontein]]\n*[[Eunice High School (Bloemfontein)]]\n*[[Ho\u00ebrskool Sentraal]] (Bloemfontein)\n*[[Ho\u00ebrskool Jim Fouch\u00e9]] (Bloemfontein)\n*[[Ho\u00ebrskool Fichardtpark]] (Bloemfontein)\n*[[St. Andrew's School, Bloemfontein|St. Andrew's School]] (Bloemfontein)\n*[[St. Michael's School, Bloemfontein|St. Michael's School]] (Bloemfontein)\n*[[Witteberg High School]] (Bethlehem)\n*[[Bethlehem Voortrekker High School]]\n*Unitas Secondary School (Welkom)\n*Sekgutlong Secondary school (Phuthaditjhaba)\n*Mohato Secondary School (Phuthaditjhaba)\n*Kwetlisong Secondary School (Petrus Steyn)\n\n==Media==\n\n===Newspapers===\n*[[Dumelang News]] ([[The People's Paper]])\n*[[Die Volksblad]] ([[Bloemfontein]])\n*[[Bloem news]] ([[Bloemfontein]])\n\n===Radio===\n*[[OFM]]\n*[[Lesedi FM]]\n*[[Motheo FM]]\n*[[Radio Rosestad]]\n*[[Kovsie FM]]\n*[[CUT FM]]\n\n==Sports==\n\n===Provincial sport teams===\n*Soccer\n**[[African Warriors]] ([[Phuthaditjhaba]])\n**[[Carara Kicks F.C.]] ([[Welkom]])\n**[[Bloemfontein Celtic]]\n**[[Free State Stars]]\n**[[Roses United]]\n**[[Bloemfontein Young Tigers]]\n*[[Rugby union|Rugby]]\n**[[Pro14]]:\n***[[Cheetahs (rugby union)|Cheetahs]] ([[Bloemfontein]]) \u2013 also represents [[Northern Cape]]\n**[[Currie Cup]]:\n***[[Free State Cheetahs]] ([[Bloemfontein]])\n***[[Griffons (rugby team)|Griffons]] ([[Welkom]])\n*[[Cricket]]\n**[[Knights (cricket team)|Knights]] ([[Bloemfontein]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Speakers of the Free State Provincial Legislature]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Free State}}\n* [http://www.freestateonline.fs.gov.za Free State Provincial Government]\n* [http://www.freestatetourism.org/ Free State Tourism Authority]\n\n{{Free State province}}\n{{Provinces of South Africa}}\n\n[[Category:Free State (province)| ]]\n[[Category:English-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Provinces of South Africa]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1994]]\n[[Category:1994 establishments in South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "TheAwesomeHwyh", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:OFM\u2192OFM (South Africa)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_(province)"}

The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u20131999===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Williams College]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a [[lawn ornament]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] that is no longer in business. At first Collingwood hated the name but eventually warmed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/waynes-world-6423163|title=Wayne's World|first=Ted|last=Simons|website=Phoenix New Times|date=1997-05-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> Previous band names included Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], then recruited guitarist [[Jody Porter]] and still-active Posies drummer [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne's label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of [[Swingtown (song)|\"Swingtown\"]] by [[Steve Miller Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2007/04/brian-young/|title=Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne|first=Waleed|last=Rashidi|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=April 2007|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThough Collingwood and Schlesinger share co-writer credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together they have written their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, \"We decided early on, it\u2019s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, \u2018I wrote 15% of that song,\u2019 and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.\" Schlesinger added, \"We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we\u2019d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven\u2019t collaborated as writers in years. And that\u2019s kind of intentional too because we didn\u2019t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, 'Adam\u2019s songs are like this\u2026' We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|magazine=American Songwriter|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the band released its [[Fountains of Wayne (album)|self-titled debut]], which spawned the singles \"[[Radiation Vibe]]\" and \"[[Sink to the Bottom]]\", and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], and [[The Lemonheads]]. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.\n\n[[File:Fountains of Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fountains of Wayne performing in April 2007]]\n\n===2000\u20132011===\n\nThe band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, \"When we got dropped from Atlantic, it\u2019s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to keep doing it.  At the end of four years of the hardest work I\u2019d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it.  I got back home and I had nothing.  I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted.  I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/fountains.htm|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Record Sales|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|publisher=PopEntertainment.com|date=2004-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nSchlesinger co-wrote many of the songs for the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' film and soundtrack, produced albums for [[Verve Pipe]], [[David Mead (musician)|David Mead]], and [[They Might Be Giants]], and released a third record with his other band, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]]. Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single, \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, [[The Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook.

The band consisted of [[Chris Collingwood]], [[Adam Schlesinger]], [[Jody Porter]], and [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]]. The band is best known for its 2003 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-nominated single \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n===1995\u20131999===\nAfter [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair]]-based [[Adam Schlesinger]] and [[Sellersville, Pennsylvania|Sellersville]]-based [[Chris Collingwood]] first met as freshmen at [[Williams College]], they played music in various bands and eventually went their separate ways, with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]] in New York City. In the mid-1990s, they came together to form Fountains of Wayne, named after a [[lawn ornament]] store in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] that is no longer in business. At first Collingwood hated the name but eventually warmed to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/music/waynes-world-6423163|title=Wayne's World|first=Ted|last=Simons|website=Phoenix New Times|date=1997-05-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref> Previous band names included Woolly Mammoth, Are You My Mother? and Three Men Who When Standing Side by Side Have a Wingspan of Over Twelve Feet. The band cut a demo and signed with [[Atlantic Records]], then recruited guitarist [[Jody Porter]] and still-active Posies drummer [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] after recording their debut album. Young got in touch with a friend who worked at Fountains of Wayne's label to see if there were any job openings, and when he auditioned for the band, they asked him to play the beat of [[Swingtown (song)|\"Swingtown\"]] by [[Steve Miller Band]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/2007/04/brian-young/|title=Brian Young of Fountains of Wayne|first=Waleed|last=Rashidi|magazine=Modern Drummer|date=April 2007|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nThough Collingwood and Schlesinger share co-writer credit for all original Fountains of Wayne material, for most of their career together they have written their songs separately. In 2005 Collingwood said, \"We decided early on, it\u2019s better to not have arguments that some bands have where someone might say, \u2018I wrote 15% of that song,\u2019 and try to figure out those numbers. It just seems ridiculous.\" Schlesinger added, \"We just agreed many years ago that if we were to have a band we\u2019d just split the songwriting to avoid having a conversation every time we tried to finish a song. But we really haven\u2019t collaborated as writers in years. And that\u2019s kind of intentional too because we didn\u2019t want it to turn into a thing where people would say, 'Adam\u2019s songs are like this\u2026' We wanted the band to have an identity more than we wanted each of us to have an identity in the band.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2005/07/fountains-of-wayner-bright-future-in-sales/|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Sales|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|magazine=American Songwriter|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the band released its [[Fountains of Wayne (album)|self-titled debut]], which spawned the singles \"[[Radiation Vibe]]\" and \"[[Sink to the Bottom]]\", and the band toured the world extensively behind its debut album, playing alongside bands including [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Sloan (band)|Sloan]], and [[The Lemonheads]]. That same year, Schlesinger wrote the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated, [[RIAA]] gold certified [[That Thing You Do (song)|title song]] for the film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]''.\n\nIn 1999, the band released ''[[Utopia Parkway]]'', an album named after a road in [[Queens]], New York. The album was a concept record that dealt with life in modern suburbia. ''Utopia Parkway'' was received well by critics, garnering many favorable reviews, and was album of the week in [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]]. The group once again toured extensively behind the album, but frustrations grew between the band and the label. The band was later dropped by Atlantic in late 1999.\n\n[[File:Fountains of Wayne.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Fountains of Wayne performing in April 2007]]\n\n===2000\u20132011===\n\nThe band was inactive for a period of time. Collingwood, in particular, had a difficult time coping with the band being dropped by their label. In 2004 he said, \"When we got dropped from Atlantic, it\u2019s my fault that it took so long, because I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to keep doing it.  At the end of four years of the hardest work I\u2019d ever done in my life, more traveling and being away from my wife the whole time, I had nothing to show for it.  I got back home and I had nothing.  I was broke, I was demoralized, I was exhausted.  I think I just needed a year to recharge my batteries.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/fountains.htm|title=Fountains of Wayne: Bright Future in Record Sales|first=Jay S.|last=Jacobs|publisher=PopEntertainment.com|date=2004-01-09|accessdate=2019-01-04}}</ref>\n\nSchlesinger co-wrote many of the songs for the ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (film)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' film and soundtrack, produced albums for [[Verve Pipe]], [[David Mead (musician)|David Mead]], and [[They Might Be Giants]], and released a third record with his other band, [[Ivy (band)|Ivy]]. Collingwood formed and fronted a [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]-based pop-country band, called [[Chris Collingwood#Gay Potatoes (side project)|Gay Potatoes]], and played a string of solo shows in the Boston and Los Angeles areas. Guitarist Jody Porter worked with his band, The Astrojet, alongside famed producer [[Gordon Raphael]] and keyboardist David Zhang in New York City. Percussionist [[Brian Young (drummer)|Brian Young]] moved to Los Angeles and did session work for various artists such as producer [[Steve Fisk]], Ivy, [[Heather Duby]], and [[Greg Dulli]]. The band reunited recording a cover of [[The Kinks]]' \"Better Things\" for the tribute album, ''This Is Where I Belong: Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks'', in 2001.\n \nIn 2003, the band released ''[[Welcome Interstate Managers]]'', a successful album that spawned the Grammy-nominated [[RIAA]] gold-certified hit single, \"[[Stacy's Mom]]\", which Adam Schlesinger says was a tribute to the band, [[The Cars]]; initially, the single stalled at commercial alternative radio in the US, but MTV President [[Judy McGrath]] championed the single's [[music video]], a ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' homage featuring [[Rachel Hunter]]. Another song off the album, \"All Kinds of Time\", was used for [[NFL]] commercial promotions during the 2005 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fountainsofwayne.us/newsarchive.php |title=Fountains of Wayne.us |publisher=Fountains of Wayne.us |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the band released ''[[Out-of-State Plates]]'', a collection of [[B-side]]s and two new songs, which was supported by the single \"Maureen\" and a limited US tour that included some acoustic-only sets, a set on PBS ''[[Soundstage (TV program)|Soundstage]]'', and American Songbook. Also included on the album is a 1999 cover of the [[Britney Spears]] hit, \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\".\n\nIn 2006, while on tour in Tokyo, Collingwood had a mental breakdown in which he hadn't slept for four days, experienced hallucinations for two days and didn't believe that he was in Tokyo to play in front of 25,000.
