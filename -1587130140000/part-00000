It stars Lee, [[Maria Yi]], [[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]] and [[Tony Liu]]. Originally written for Tien, the leading role was given to Lee instead when the film's original director, Ng Kar-seung, was replaced by Lo. The film was a critical success and excelled at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|title=In Review: The Big Boss on DVD|author=Michael Ewins|date=4 July 2012|work=New Empress Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208142724/http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee's strong performance overshadowed Tien, already a star in Hong Kong, and made Bruce Lee famous across Asia, and eventually, the world.\n\n==Plot==\nCheng Chao-an (Pronounced \"Cheng Chow-On\") ([[Bruce Lee]]) is a Chinese man who moves to [[Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]], to live with his adopted family and to work in an ice factory. He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs who steal dumplings from Hsu's brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the ice blocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe. Once he knows that Chiao Mei is safe (as she came running along with the police division), he surrenders to the police when they arrive at the mansion. Cheng does not get arrested for murder due to self-defense. The movie ends as the crowd walks back to the police car to leave the mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Bruce Lee]] as Cheng Chao-an ({{zh|first=t|t=\u912d\u6f6e\u5b89|cy=Zeng Ciu-On}}), a young man who, along with his uncle, travels from [[Guangdong]], [[China]] to [[Pak Chong District|Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]] to stay with his cousins.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=Bruce Lee the Legend |format=Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= | year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong,<ref name=mandarin /> a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were plentiful in the hotel, and the tap water was yellow.<ref name=Letters>Little, John (1998). ''Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon''.</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the \"uncertain\" original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as \"another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority\".<ref name=Letters /> Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby Rimtarninn Hotel (formerly New Wan Chai), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>''In Pursuit of the Dragon'' (2012 documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> \n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters /><ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in Bangkok was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=JKDClub /><ref name=mandarin /> before flying to the US the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, [[Fist of Fury]].<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside drinks vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release and box office==\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=Nation>New Nation, 29 November 1971, page 1</ref> It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over S$700,000 ({{US$|{{To USD|700000|SGP|year=2011|round=yes}}|link=no}}), about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name=Straits>The Straits Times, 24 January 1972, page 5</ref> The film also played to packed cinemas in [[Malaysia]], the third territory to show the film.\n\nDespite the enormous success of ''The Big Boss'' in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they didn't think it had potential outside Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe.<ref name=Misad>Death by Misadventure (director Toby Russell)</ref> In the UK however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).<ref name=Straits2>The Straits Times, 28 April 1972, page 17</ref> There was also a delay in the US, as distributors [[National General Pictures]] disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue.<ref name=Misad /> This new version was eventually released in the US in April 1973 with the title ''Fists of Fury'', about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (retitled ''The Chinese Connection'' in the U.S.), Lee's second major role, had been released in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film reviews: Fists of Fury|date=27 June 1973|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=34}}</ref> It was an instant hit, surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the returning villains. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the Original Cantonese language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Mandarin release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Mandarin version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss? (Or How I Learned to Stop Complaining and Love The Big Boss Part II)]</ref><ref>Logan, Bey ''Bruce Lee and I'' (Reel East Press, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Other actors as Bruce Lee playing Cheng Chao-an==\nVarious Bruce Lee biopics have been filmed over the years, with the two most famous being ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth]]'' and ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;

The film was a critical success and excelled at the box office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|title=In Review: The Big Boss on DVD|author=Michael Ewins|date=4 July 2012|work=New Empress Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208142724/http://newempressmagazine.com/2012/04/in-review-the-big-boss-on-dvd/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Lee's strong performance overshadowed Tien, already a star in Hong Kong, and made Bruce Lee famous across Asia, and eventually, the world.\n\n==Plot==\nCheng Chao-an (Pronounced \"Cheng Chow-On\") ([[Bruce Lee]]) is a Chinese man who moves to [[Pak Chong]], [[Thailand]], to live with his adopted family and to work in an ice factory. He meets his cousins Hsu Chien (Pronounced \"Shu Sheng\") ([[James Tien (actor)|James Tien]]) and Hsu's younger brother by accident when Hsu Chien stands up to local street thugs who steal dumplings from Hsu's brother. Cheng refrains from getting involved despite being tempted to, as he swore to his mother to never participate in any fighting. He wears a [[jade]] [[amulet]] around his neck as a reassurance of his pledge.\n\nCheng begins his work at the ice factory. When an ice block is accidentally broken, a bag of white powdery drugs falls out. Two of Cheng's cousins pick up the bag and are told to see the manager later that night. The factory is actually a front for a [[drug smuggling]] ring led by Hsiao Mi (a.k.a. the Big Boss). When Cheng's cousins refuse to join them, the manager sends his thugs to kill them and dispose of their bodies, thereby stopping the cat from getting out of the bag and restricting any of those to know.\n\nHsu Chien and Ah Pei, another one of Cheng's cousins, go to Hsiao Mi's Mansion to find out what happened to the two cousins. Hsu doubts Hsiao's claims that he doesn't know anything and threatens to go to the police. Hsiao sets his gang on the duo as a result, and after a brutal battle, they are both killed with their bodies hidden as to keep the boss's crime operations a secret.\n\nWhen the Chinese workers at the ice factory learn that Hsu is missing as well, they start a riot against the Thai management, which leads to a brawl with the hired thugs, who come in a red bus mid-fight. During the chaos, one of the thugs accidentally rips off and breaks Cheng's amulet. Enraged, Cheng jumps into the brawl and beats some of the thugs, causing them to flee immediately.\n\nTo reduce tensions, the ice factory manager makes Cheng a [[shop foreman|foreman]], inviting him to a dinner that night. This later causes much unease for Cheng's family and friends, who believe that Cheng is growing arrogant and spending more time reveling in his new position than helping to look for their brothers. They grow to resent him, all except Chiao Mei, his Sister, who stands up for him.\n\nCheng gets drunk at the dinner party and is seduced by Sun Wu Man (played by Marilyn Bautista), a prostitute who attended the dinner. She later warns Cheng that his life is in danger and reveals that Hsiao Mi is running a drug trafficking operation. Immediately after Cheng leaves, Hsiao's son, Hsiao Chiun, sneaks in and kills Sun by throwing a knife at her heart from behind. Cheng breaks into the factory and first finds the drugs before discovering a hand, the head of Sun, and the head of Hsu Chien with a horrified face in the ice blocks. He is surrounded by Hsiao Chiun and a group of his men. Cheng fights his way out, killing Hsiao Chiun and all gangsters in the process. It is believed that the notorious \"Saw in the head\" scene which was deleted took place in this fight, which was deleted during the [[1972 Hong Kong Movie Crackdown]].\n\nHe returns home to find that his remaining family members have been murdered, while Chiao Mei has gone missing. Mourning his loss by a river, he vows to exact his revenge at all costs, even if it means breaking his oath of non-violence. Cheng subsequently storms Hsiao Mi's mansion to fight him and his men. Meanwhile, one of Hsiao Mi's disgruntled slaves frees Chiao Mei, who was being held hostage by Hsiao Mi in a cramped room used as a [[prison cell]]. She runs away to get help from the Thai police. Cheng finally kills Hsiao Mi after a fierce fight, by deflecting the knife Mi throws it at him with his shoe.

In 1970, he was incapacitated for several months after damaging a sacral nerve in his lower back while weightlifting. Money became tight as roles in Hollywood proved hard to come by, and wife Linda had to work evenings at an answering service to help pay the bills. Bruce was still keen to develop film and TV projects in Hollywood, but Warner Bros. was reluctant to accept a TV script project he had developed (the plotline of which was similar to, but not the same as, ''[[Kung Fu (TV series)|Kung Fu]]''), and production on ''[[Circle of Iron|The Silent Flute]]'' had to be suspended indefinitely after a three-week trip to India with [[James Coburn]] and [[Stirling Silliphant]] to scout locations for the movie proved unproductive. In light of these recent events, Coburn suggested to Bruce that he try his luck in the increasingly growing Hong Kong film industry.\"<ref name=OnlyI>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew |first= Linda |last= Lee| year= 1975| publisher= | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIn spring 1970, Bruce paid a visit to Hong Kong with his young son [[Brandon Lee|Brandon]]. Unbeknownst to Bruce, he had become famous there due to reruns of ''The Green Hornet'' on TV, and the enthusiastic reception he received took him by surprise. He was invited to appear on popular [[TVB|HKTVB]] chat show ''[[Enjoy Yourself Tonight]]'', where he was interviewed and gave a board-breaking demonstration.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nEncouraged by the interest in Hong Kong, Bruce asked his childhood friend [[Unicorn Chan]] to pass on his [[curriculum vitae|CV]] to [[Shaw Brothers Studio|Shaw Brothers]], Hong Kong's largest film production company. They offered Bruce a long-term contract but only US$2,000 per film, which Bruce declined. Another offer appeared unexpectedly from [[Raymond Chow]], a film producer who had in 1970 left Shaw Brothers to form a new company, Golden Harvest.<ref name=OnlyI /> Chow, aware of the rejected offer from Shaw Brothers, had been impressed by Bruce's interviews on Hong Kong television and radio, and also by his confidence during a long-distance phone call. During that phone call, Lee determined the best action movie playing in Hong Kong and assured Chow that he could do much better.<ref name=\"Legend\">{{cite web| title=Bruce Lee the Legend |format=Documentary film|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=TIsInQYekSU| date= | publisher= | via= YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1971, Chow sent one of his producers Liu Liang-Hua (the wife of director Lo Wei) to Los Angeles to meet and negotiate with Bruce, who signed a contract to make two films for Golden Harvest for US$15,000 ($10,000 for The Big Boss and $5,000 on completion of a second film tentatively ''King of Chinese Boxers'' and which became ''[[Fist of Fury]]''). This eased the Lees' financial worries and permitted Linda Lee to quit her job.<ref name=OnlyI />\n\nWith the contract signed, Chow hastily arranged a meeting with his Golden Harvest executives and an old friend called Ma Thien-Ek (Fatty Ma), a Thai businessman, film distributor and cinema owner. Inspired by the success of a recent Shaw Brothers film about [[Muay Thai]] boxing (''[[Duel of Fists]]''), they came up with the idea of shooting an action film on location in Thailand, which would also help to keep costs down. Fatty Ma, an expert in Thai affairs, offered to help with locations and expenses.<ref name=Dai>{{cite news|title= [Unknown article title]| work= Dai Yan |type= magazine| date= 15 December 1971| place= Hong Kong | publisher=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nVeteran Chinese novelist and screenwriter Ni Kuang was commissioned to create a script based loosely on [[Cheng Chi-Yong]], a prominent Chinese figure in Thai society in the early 20th century. Ni Kuang changed the name of the character to Cheng Chao-an, after Chao'an county in eastern China, the home of Cheng Chi-Yong's ancestors. He also developed the idea of Cheng being sent by his mother to live and work with fellow Chinese migrants in Thailand, after his father had been killed in a fight. She gave her son a jade necklace symbolising peace, protection and good fortune, as a reminder to avoid trouble.<ref name=mandarin>{{cite book| title= Bruce Lee: Mandarin Superstar |first1= Steve |last1= Kerridge | first2= Darren |last2= Chua| publisher= | year= 2018 | isbn= }}</ref>\n\nIt was not unusual in Hong Kong cinema for the director to amend the script during filming, and The Big Boss was no exception. When Lo Wei replaced the original director in late July 1971, he was unhappy with the script and re-wrote it, without Bruce's knowledge. Lo later recalled, \"I wouldn't tell him I was re-writing the script for fear of affecting his morale. In my hotel room, he would often discuss the script with me which would leave me tongue-tied, so I would tell him I needed to rest, and as soon as he left I would be burning the midnight oil in order to get the script ready for the next day's filming.\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Filming==\nBruce Lee flew from Los Angeles to [[Bangkok]] via Hong Kong on 12 July 1971. Raymond Chow, concerned about renewed interest from Shaw Brothers, had wanted him to fly directly to Bangkok, but Bruce refused, stopping in Hong Kong briefly to greet a friend and make a few phone calls.<ref name=OnlyI /> Bruce stayed in Bangkok for five nights, and it was here that he met most of the cast and crew and also Raymond Chow for the first time.<ref name=mandarin /> Filming commenced on 22 July in Pak Chong,<ref name=mandarin /> a small town situated some 90 miles (150&nbsp;km) northeast of Bangkok, on the northern edge of the [[Khao Yai National Park]], Thailand's oldest reserve; it also serves as the gateway to the northeast ([[Isan]]) of Thailand from the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]]. Pak Chong would be Bruce's home for about four weeks \u2013 from 18 July to 19 August<ref name=mandarin /> \u2013 and he made no secret of his dislike for it in letters to wife Linda, describing it as a lawless, impoverished and undeveloped village. Due to the lack of fresh food, Bruce was losing weight due to a lack of proper diet, having to eat canned meat and supplement his diet with vitamins, which he had thankfully brought along. He occasionally lost his voice through trying to shout above the noise on set; mosquitoes and cockroaches were plentiful in the hotel, and the tap water was yellow.<ref name=Letters>Little, John (1998). ''Bruce Lee: Letters of the Dragon''.</ref>\n\nWhen Bruce arrived in Pak Chong, rival film companies tried desperately to poach him away from Golden Harvest, including Shaw Brothers, with a new and improved offer. A film producer from Taiwan told Bruce to rip up his contract and promised to take care of any lawsuit. Bruce, a man of his word, had no intention of considering the offers, although it did add some extra tension on the film set.\n\nShooting did not go smoothly at first. After just a few days, the \"uncertain\" original director, Wu Chia Hsiang, was replaced by Lo Wei (the husband of associate producer Liu Liang-Hua). Bruce was initially sceptical of Lo, describing him in letters to Linda as \"another so-so one with an almost unbearable air of superiority\".<ref name=Letters /> Bruce sliced open the index finger of his right hand while washing a thin glass, the wound requiring ten stitches<ref name=Letters /> and a large plaster, which is very noticeable throughout the movie, especially the scenes filmed at the Thamrongthai ice factory, the first filming location used in Pak Chong. Fatty Ma had a contact who knew the owner of the ice factory, and arranged for Golden Harvest to film there for a few days.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAside from the factory, other locations in Pak Chong used for filming include the Lam Ta Khong river (a tributary of the [[Mun River]]), and a local brothel (the Mitsumphun Hotel), which has since burnt down. The actual bedroom scenes however were filmed in a riverside bungalow owned by the nearby Rimtarninn Hotel (formerly New Wan Chai), where the film crew stayed during filming, due to the bedrooms in the brothel being smelly and unhygienic. The prostitutes charged only fifteen Baht in Thai money per client, but the film crew paid them one to two hundred Baht each to appear as extras in the film.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nPerhaps the most iconic location seen in the film is the titular big boss's mansion<ref>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/14%C2%B041'43.2%22N+101%C2%B024'20.5%22E/@14.6953245,101.4046127,446m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x311c29f4205485af:0x15be7cfc7ed1acb0!2sPak+Chong+Village,+Pak+Chong,+Pak+Chong+District,+Nakhon+Ratchasima+30130,+Thailand!3b1!8m2!3d14.729553!4d101.438016!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d14.695322!4d101.4056836?hl=en Geo coordinates]</ref> and gardens, which was a Buddhist temple situated on the main road called Wat Siri Samphan, built in 1963.<ref name=mandarin /> Like the ice factory, it is still in Pak Chong today and remains largely unchanged, much to the delight of the dedicated fans who have made the pilgrimage to Thailand to view the filming locations.<ref name=Pursuit>''In Pursuit of the Dragon'' (2012 documentary) by John Little</ref>\n\nThere has been some speculation that Bruce was involved in a real fight on the set of The Big Boss, as depicted in the 1993 biopic ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Although no such fight actually took place, Bruce did interact extensively with a few of the Thai stuntmen (one of whom was a former [[Muay Thai]] bantamweight champion), and exchanged info and skills with them between takes. Bruce reportedly though seemed unimpressed and called their kicks \"telegraphed\", while the Hong Kong stunt team (Lam Ching-Ying, Billy Chan and his brother Peter Chan Lung) were initially unimpressed with Bruce, and doubted his abilities. Their opinion of him soon changed when Lam challenged Bruce in the hotel, and Bruce sidekicked him across the room.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nAfter an eventful and at times chaotic first few days' filming in Pak Chong, by early August 1971 the filming had picked up speed, and was progressing well. Bruce and Lo Wei were collaborating, but they still clashed over a few of the scenes, in particular the use of trampolines and mattresses to propel people through the air, and also the scene where Bruce punches a man through a wooden wall, leaving a cartoonish outline in the wood. Bruce was also hesitant to go along with Lo Wei's ideas of filming risky scenes of his character getting in bed with Thai ladies portraying prostitutes, although he eventually agreed to do them as Lo insisted it would add to his character's newfound image as a revenge-driven warrior.<ref name=JKDClub>''Bruce Lee in The Big Boss'' published by Bruce Lee JKD Club (1980)</ref> \n\nThe final scene filmed in Pak Chong was the climactic fight between Bruce and the boss (played by Han Ying Chieh, who also served as the fight choreographer), which proved to be problematic: Bruce endured \"two days of hell\" when he sprained his ankle from a high jump on a slipped mattress, and had to be driven to Bangkok to see a doctor, where he caught a virus in the hot and stuffy conditions. Close-ups were used to finish the fight, as Bruce struggled and had to drag his leg, which was covered up with and contributed to his character's worn out, exhausted appearance.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\nThe cast and crew spent the last twelve days in August filming further scenes in Bangkok, where Bruce enjoyed breakfast in bed at the Thai Hotel, a luxury he never had in Pak Chong. At times filming had to be delayed by heavy rain.<ref name=Letters /><ref name=mandarin /> One of the main locations used for filming in Bangkok was the [[Chao Phraya River]] in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], for the opening scene in the film where Bruce and his uncle step off the ferry boat and walk through the busy pier. The dinner party scene was filmed in the back room of the Poonsin Chinese Restaurant, close to the Thai Hotel.<ref name=mandarin /> An old teak house in the east side of Phra Pradaeng district was used as the family home, while Nora Miao's scenes (and part of the opening fight sequence) were filmed on the quieter west side, which resembled rural Pak Chong.<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe Big Boss film crew finally returned to Hong Kong on 3 September,<ref name=mandarin /> where there would be a further day of filming for insert shots including close-ups of Bruce avoiding the dogs and the \"leg-grappling\" scene during the fight with the boss (these were filmed at the Royal Hong Kong Golf Club).<ref name=mandarin /> The final scene filmed was the now deleted \"pushcart attack\" in the alleyway, at Wader Studio in Hong Kong, as Golden Harvest had not as yet moved into their famous studios on Hammer Hill Road.<ref name=mandarin /> Bruce viewed the raw, unedited three-hour footage on 5 September,<ref name=JKDClub /><ref name=mandarin /> before flying to the US the next day to see his family and to film further episodes of [[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]; he would return to Hong Kong on 16 October to promote the release of The Big Boss and begin pre-production work on his second film for Golden Harvest, [[Fist of Fury]].<ref name=mandarin />\n\n==Bruce Lee and JKD short film==\nWhile in Thailand, Bruce wrote to Linda regularly, telling her he missed her and the children, and was looking forward to seeing them in Hong Kong once filming had been completed. In return for their air fare (from their home in Los Angeles to Hong Kong), Golden Harvest wanted Bruce to make a short film for them called ''Bruce Lee and Jeet Kune Do'', which would run for approximately 15 minutes and be narrated by actress Nora Miao. According to Hong Kong press reports, Golden Harvest had originally planned for the short film to accompany the release of another upcoming film of theirs called ''The Hurricane'' (a.k.a. ''Gold Cyclone Whirlwind''), starring Nora and written and directed by Lo Wei. This would promote Nora and introduce Lee's skills to the Hong Kong public prior to the release of ''The Big Boss''. Nora joined the film crew in Bangkok in late August 1971 to make the short film with Lee but sadly it never happened, presumably because there was not enough time; she did however film a few brief scenes for ''The Big Boss'' in a cameo role as a roadside drinks vendor.<ref name=mandarin /><ref name=Letters />\n\n==Release and box office==\nOn 23 October 1971 the film premiered at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong's Central district for a now legendary midnight screening.<ref name=mandarin /> Linda recalled in her 1975 book ''Bruce Lee: The Man Only I Knew'': \"Every dream that Bruce had ever possessed came true that night. The audience rose to its feet, yelling, clapping, cheering. It was almost impossible to leave the theatre; we were absolutely mobbed.\"<ref name=OnlyI /> The Lees also attended the official gala premiere on 3 November, which was a charity screening for the Scout Association of Hong Kong. The film was an instant success, taking just 3 days to reach HK$1 million, and a week to reach HK$2 million. By the end of its relatively brief run (ending on 18 November), ''The Big Boss'' had made HK$3.2 million, shattering the previous record held by ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' by more than HK$800,000.<ref name=mandarin /> Its Hong Kong gross was equivalent to {{US$|{{#expr:3200000/5.98 round -4}}|link=no}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average) |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.FCRF?end=1972&locations=HK&start=1971 |website=[[World Bank]] |year=1971 |accessdate=27 November 2018 |language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the Hong Kong run, ''The Big Boss'' was released in [[Singapore]], and enjoyed similar success there, where it played for a total of 45 days at five theatres. There was chaos at a midnight preview screening (27 November 1971) at Cathay's Jurong Drive-in cinema; police were called as hundreds of cars caused huge jams, and the film had to be delayed for 45 minutes.<ref name=Nation>New Nation, 29 November 1971, page 1</ref> It went on general release on 8 December, and by the end of its run on 21 January 1972, it had broken box office records with just over S$700,000 ({{US$|{{To USD|700000|SGP|year=2011|round=yes}}|link=no}}), about S$240,000 more than previous record-holder ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.<ref name=Straits>The Straits Times, 24 January 1972, page 5</ref> The film also played to packed cinemas in [[Malaysia]], the third territory to show the film.\n\nDespite the enormous success of ''The Big Boss'' in the Far East, overseas distributors were initially reluctant as they didn't think it had potential outside Asia. It was only when the film suddenly became a surprise hit in Beirut in 1972 that they began to take notice. Suddenly buyers from all over the world were arriving in Hong Kong to buy the film, which was soon opening in new markets for Chinese films such as South America, Africa and southern Europe.<ref name=Misad>Death by Misadventure (director Toby Russell)</ref> In the UK however, the release of the English-dubbed version was delayed as distributors Crest Films withdrew their application for a BBFC certificate, while they waited for the current storm surrounding film censorship in Britain to pass (the Mandarin version was shown in Chinese cinema clubs in Britain in June 1972).<ref name=Straits2>The Straits Times, 28 April 1972, page 17</ref> There was also a delay in the US, as distributors [[National General Pictures]] disliked the dubbing, and spent a lot of money on a new soundtrack featuring new music and rewritten, redubbed English dialogue.<ref name=Misad /> This new version was eventually released in the US in April 1973 with the title ''Fists of Fury'', about 18 months after the Hong Kong premiere and after ''[[Fist of Fury]]'' (retitled ''The Chinese Connection'' in the U.S.), Lee's second major role, had been released in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Film reviews: Fists of Fury|date=27 June 1973|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=34}}</ref> It was an instant hit, surprising given that the film was only originally intended for the Mandarin circuit.

The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing from under his shirt, would have given the film an \"[[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|X]]\" rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel [[American Movie Classics|AMC]] in July 2004.\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] released the film as a re-issue in 1978 and again re-issued it with ''Fist of Fury'' as a studio sanctioned double feature in February 1981. [[Miramax]] distributed ''The Big Boss'' on television & streaming (Hulu & Netflix) along with ''Bruce Lee, the Legend'' (1984), ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'' and ''[[Fist of Fury]]''.\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 64% based on 11 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 5.59/10.[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_boss_1972]\n\n==Censorship and missing scenes==\n''The Big Boss'' has quite a long and complicated history of censorship and editing, with many scenes being trimmed or removed completely for various reasons, for different markets. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly what was cut and when, as the editing took place over a span of several decades. The notorious \"handsaw in the split head\" shot was cut by the censors in Hong Kong shortly before the film was released there in October 1971. It was only shown in a private screening at Golden Harvest for the press, cinema owners and prospective buyers on 17 October,<ref name=mandarin /> but has not been seen since; all that survives are a few stills.\n\nFurther scenes were cut by the studio and/or the distributors for the first overseas prints released in some territories in late 1971 and early 1972. The nudity and bloodshed was toned down, along with a few seemingly innocuous scenes, including the final one filmed (in a studio in Hong Kong), where Cheng Chao-An (Bruce Lee) and Hsu Chien (James Tien) are walking home after the fight near the gambling den; they enter a narrow alleyway and have to grab hands and leap onto a wall to avoid a cart which is hurled towards them by one of the returning villains. The only logical explanation for the cutting of this scene was that it was done to increase the pacing of the early part of the film, which placed more emphasis on James Tien's character than on Bruce Lee.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\">{{cite web|title=The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart|url=http://bruceleelives.co.uk/missingboss.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|title=Original mandarin cut|date=21 August 2016|website=web.archive.org|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was a reduction to the gruesome sequence in which the body of cousin Ah Wong is cut apart by the electric saw, and body parts are placed into the ice container.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nA small edit was made to the dinner party scene, where a drunken Cheng approaches the prostitute Wu Man (played by Malarin Boonak), and imagines her topless.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nThe scene where Cheng is sitting by the riverside following his discovery of the bodies at the family home, was shortened. When he stands and throws his bundle of belongings into the river, there were then shots of his murdered friends, followed by him angrily shaking his fist and shouting, \"Revenge!\"<ref name=mandarin />\n\nThe next cut is another entirely deleted scene, and another popular one alongside of the \"saw-in-the-head\" scene. After Cheng runs down the road from the creek, rather than cutting to him arriving at the Big Boss' mansion like the mainstream cuts, he returns to the Thai brothel for a third time. Here, he picks up the prostitute in a red sweater-type dress (seen in the background the second time Cheng visits the brothel). Cheng and the prostitute go to her room; Cheng pushes her onto the bed, and the two begin to strip. Cheng stands in front of the bed, completely nude, but also completely emotionless. The woman lies on the bed and Cheng walks (waist-high shot) towards the camera, blurring out the scene. Next, Cheng is shown putting on his shirt, while the woman remains in bed. He lays his remaining money on her stomach, even though he already paid to be with her. He then picks up a bag of crisps from the bedside table; he tries one, then leaves. This scene is symbolic and quite important, as in the previous scene Cheng discards his belongings in the river, and here he gives away his money and enjoys his final pleasures and one last meal before either being killed or arrested, a message which is now lost. A few seconds of this scene (including a shot of an apparently naked Bruce standing behind the bed) can be seen in the original trailer.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nOther missing scenes briefly visible in the same trailer show Hsu Chien re-enacting a fight for his co-workers in the family home; Cheng walking towards the Drinkstand Girl's (Nora Miao) roadside refreshment stall (the camera zooms in to show her smiling at him); a different head visible in the block of ice when Cheng is investigating the ice house; blood pouring from Hsu Chien's head after being stabbed by the boss's son. It is not known if these four scenes were in any print of the film.\n\nFurther quick shots of violence \u2013 mostly involving weapons such as iron chains, sticks, knives and an ice pick \u2013 were cut from the prints in the UK and a few other European countries. These cuts were inexplicably maintained for the \"pan and scan\" videos released in the 1980s and 1990s but waived for the UK DVD release by Hong Kong Legends in late 2000. Also restored, surprisingly, was the bloodier death scene of the big boss. However, the material cut in 1971 in Hong Kong has never been restored, and remains missing. It was last seen in December 1979 at a Bruce Lee film festival in Kilburn, London, organised by Kung-Fu Monthly poster magazine. The Mandarin print screened for over 1,700 lucky fans came from Golden Harvest's London office, and was complete with the exception of the censored \"saw in the head\" shot.<ref name=\"The Missing Big Boss by Jason Hart\"/>\n\nAn early Mandarin print containing some extra footage is rumoured to still exist, and is thought to be in the hands of a private collector. A DVD was to be released in 2004 called \"The Big Boss\": \"The Version You've Never Seen\" but release was cancelled due to copyright issues. Hopefully in the future it will see the light of day and the fans will finally be able to see the original, longer version. Until then, all that remains of the missing scenes are a handful of photos and a few brief trailer clips.\n\n==Alternative title confusion==\nWhen ''The Big Boss'' was being prepared for American distribution, the U.S. release was to be re-titled ''The Chinese Connection'', a play on the popular ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', since both dealt with drug trafficking. The U.S. title of Lee's second film, ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', was to be kept nearly the same, except using the plural ''Fists''. However, the titles were accidentally reversed. ''The Big Boss'' was released as ''Fists of Fury'' and ''Fist of Fury'' became ''The Chinese Connection''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alternate title confusion \u2013 The Big Boss (1972) \u2013 Chinese Kungfu Kaleidoscope|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|publisher=Cultural China|accessdate=25 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821095617/http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/188K7063K12336.html|archivedate=21 August 2016}}</ref> Film purists{{who?|date=January 2019}} refer to the films by their original titles and ignore this incident. Recent American TV showings and the official US DVD release from [[20th Century Fox]] have restored the original titles of all Bruce Lee films, however the descriptions are still switched despite people's attempts to revert the titles. This can be seen in Television programs (Disney+, Netflix, etc.) with titles as \"Fist of Fury\" with the description of \"The Big Boss\". Film Purists ignore this mainly and focus more on the original titles.\n\n==Alternative music scores==\nUnlike other Lee films, ''The Big Boss'' is unique in having not only two, but three completely different music scores. ''[[Fist of Fury]]'', ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', and ''[[Game of Death]]'' all only feature one score with minor alterations.\n\nThe first music score for it was composed by Wang Fu-ling, who worked on films such as ''[[The Chinese Boxer]]'' and ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]''. This was made for the Original Cantonese language version, and was also used in the English export version, in addition to the theatrical French and Turkish versions. It is similar to other martial arts film scores, especially the Shaw Brothers films. Wang was the only one to receive credit, but it is also believed composer Chen Yung-yu assisted with the score. At least one cue from Japanese composer [[Akira Ifukube]]'s scores for the ''[[Daimajin]]'' trilogy of films was also utilised as stock music.\n\nThe second and most popular of the music scores was by German composer [[Peter Thomas (composer)|Peter Thomas]]. This did not become widely known until 2005, when most of the music he composed for the film appeared on [[iTunes]] in a ''The'' ''Big Boss'' collection. Thomas's involvement stems from a complete reworking of the English version of the film. The early version featured the British voice actors who worked on all Shaw Brothers films and used Wang Fu-ling's score. It was decided to make a new English version that would stand out from the other martial arts films. New actors were brought in to voice the film in English, and Thomas re-scored the film, abandoning Wang Fu-ling's music. The German dubbed version features his score, especially in the German title of the film (German: Die Todesfaust des Cheng Li English: The Deadly fist of Cheng Li) in the iTunes compilation.\n\nThe third score is the 1982 Mandarin release score, which primarily features music from [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] composer [[Joseph Koo]]. However, a good portion of Koo's music in the Mandarin version was originally created in 1974 for the Japanese theatrical release of ''The Big Boss'', which was half Koo's music and half Peter Thomas'. Golden Harvest simply took Koo's music from the Japanese version and added it to the Cantonese version. Aside from this, this version is most infamous for its use of the [[Pink Floyd]] music cues from \"[[The Grand Vizier's Garden Party]], Part 2\", \"[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]\" and \"[[Obscured by Clouds]]\", as well as [[King Crimson]]'s \"[[Larks' Tongues in Aspic (instrumental)#Part II|Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two]]\".\n\n==Brucesploitation sequel==\nIn 1976, an unofficial sequel to ''The Big Boss'' was made called ''The Big Boss Part II'', starring [[Bruce Le]] (Huang Kin Lung) as Cheng Chao-an and [[Lo Lieh]] as Cheng's brother, who wants revenge for their father's murder. The film was directed by Chan Chue, who was an assistant director on the original film and also reprises his role as the villainous ice factory manager. ''The Big Boss Part II'' (not to be confused with ''Big Boss 2'' starring Dragon Lee and Bolo Yeung) was partly filmed at some of the Pak Chong locations used in the original film, including the ice factory and the Buddhist temple which is used as the villain's lair. The elusive film still exists, but has never been officially released on home media.<ref>[https://bruceploitation.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/whos-the-boss-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-complaining-and-love-the-big-boss-part-ii/ Who's The Boss? (Or How I Learned to Stop Complaining and Love The Big Boss Part II)]</ref><ref>Logan, Bey ''Bruce Lee and I'' (Reel East Press, 2018)</ref>\n\n==Other actors as Bruce Lee playing Cheng Chao-an==\nVarious Bruce Lee biopics have been filmed over the years, with the two most famous being ''[[Bruce Lee: The Man, The Myth]]'' and ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]''. Both of these films feature their respective actors, [[Bruce Li]] and [[Jason Scott Lee]], at one point acting as Lee on the set of ''The Big Boss''. Both films feature a variation of the rumour that Lee was challenged on the set by a Thai boxer. In ''Myth'', Lee was challenged on set and was caught in the middle of an ambush later on off the set. In ''Dragon'', Lee is challenged during an actual take during filming of ''The Big Boss'', wearing the trademark rolled up long sleeve white T-shirt, white sash, and black pants. Both of these are highly exaggerated accounts (not to mention that ''Dragon'' makes the mistake of saying that filming for ''The Big Boss'' began in July 1970 rather than in July 1971), as the story told is that Lee merely discusses martial arts with a Thai fighter on the set. Besides these two examples, a third Bruce Lee biopic, ''[[The Legend of Bruce Lee]]'', this time with [[Danny Chan Kwok-kwan]] as Lee and filmed in mini-series form, was shown in Hong Kong in 2008 as part of China's hosting of the summer Olympics. Once again, this biopic shows Lee encountering a Thai boxer on the set of ''The Big Boss'', this time with the challenger being played by martial arts film veteran [[Mark Dacascos]]. Photos and behind-the-scenes video of this scene have appeared on various websites, including Dacascos's official site.\n\n==Home media==\n===VHS releases===\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 17 March 1997\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''4 Front (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 1 October 2001\n*'''Part of a boxset'''\n*'''Classification''': 18\n\n'''''20th Century Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Named ''Fists of Fury'''''\n*'''Classification''': R, X (known in some video releases)\n*'''Color''': NTSC\n*'''Run time''': 99 minutes\n\n===DVD releases===\n'''''Universe (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian, Thai, Vietnamese\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, trailers for ''[[Way of the Dragon]]'', ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'', ''[[Game of Death]]'', ''[[Legacy of Rage]]'', star files\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Mega Star (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:29:1)\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean\n*'''Supplements''': Trailer, synopsis, cast and Crew biographies\n*All regions, NTSC\n\n'''''Fortune Star \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate DVD Collection (Hong Kong)'''''\n*'''Released''': 29 April 2004\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (DTS 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 5.1), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Mandarin (DTS 5.1), Mandarin (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': Traditional, Simplified Chinese, English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, celebrity interviews, unseen footage, ''Game of Death'' outtakes, ''Enter the Dragon'' alternate opening, 32-page booklet\n*Region 3, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 21 May 2002\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:27:1) letterboxed\n*'''Sound''': English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': None\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Fox \u2013 Bruce Lee Ultimate Collection (America)'''''\n*'''Released''': 18 October 2005\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), Manadarin (Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono), English (DTS 5.1), English (Dolby Digital 5.1)\n*'''Subtitles''': English\n*'''Supplements''': Original trailer, new trailer, still photos, slideshow of photos, interview with Tung Wai, bonus trailers\n*Region 1, NTSC\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Special Collector's Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 6 November 2000\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': Commentary by Bey Logan, production photo gallery, animated biography showcase of Bruce Lee with voice over, original Mandarin trailer, Hong Kong promotional trailer, UK promotional trailer, bonus trailers\n*Region 2, PAL\n\n'''''Hong Kong Legends \u2013 Platinum Edition (United Kingdom)'''''\n*'''Released''': 23 October 2006\n*'''Aspect ratio''': Widescreen (2:35:1) anamorphic\n*'''Sound''': Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), Cantonese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Dual Mono), English (2.0 Dual Mono)\n*'''Subtitles''': English, Dutch\n*'''Supplements''': '''Disc 1''': Commentary by Andrew Staton and Will Johnston, bonus trailers;

The programme has been on the air since 1 January 1968 (there were no broadcasts from August 1991 to December 1994) and was broadcast in color since 1974.\n\n==Editorial line==\nIn the Soviet days of ''Vremya'', the programme had a pro-[[Government of the Soviet Union|government]] bias and typically did not report on news that could potentially fuel anti-government sentiment. The programme presented reports that promoted [[socialism]] and portrayed the [[Western world|West]] in a negative manner. The newsroom was tied to the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee]]. This situation changed after [[Glasnost]], when a director of news was introduced alongside the news being sourced [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|from official outlets]]. This made CT USSR report accurately on the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Union's satellite communist countries]] in Eastern Europe in 1989. This also made Vremya to be shown uncensored and critical, triggering the protests that hastened [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the end of the Soviet Union]].\n\n==Schedule and popularity==\n''Vremya'' is produced in three daily editions, scheduled for transmission in Moscow at 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00 [[Moscow Time|local time (= UTC+3)]], the last of these having been the programme's main edition ever since its inception in 1968. Given the country's vast size (it stretches over eleven time zones) editions of ''Vremya'' are also broadcast (either live or deferred) at Moscow time plus two, four, six, and eight hours, according to locality.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005827379.pdf Soviet television: a new asset for Kremlin watchers] p. 48; [http://7days.ru/stars/privatelife/ekaterina-andreeva-muzh-znaet-chto-darit-mne-brillianty-bespolezno.htm 7days.ru] Interview with Ekatherina Andreeva</ref> \n\nDuring the Soviet era, the programme's main edition was also carried simultaneously on the primary channel of each republican station: Azeri Television, [[Belarus 1]], [[Eesti Televisioon]], Georgian Public Broadcasting, Kazakhstan-1, Channel 1 of the [[National Television Company of Ukraine|Kiev Telecentre]], [[Latvijas Telev\u012bzija|LTV1]], [[Lithuanian National Radio and Television]], Uzbekistan 1, etc.\n\nThe [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] lasts 30 minutes, but in special circumstances (more especially during the Soviet era), the broadcast is extended beyond the 30 minutes allotted when necessary (such as the [[Red Square]] state ceremonies and parades, [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Party Congress]] telecasts together with other CPSU-led activities, plenary sessions of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], and deaths of Soviet leaders [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]). Even highlights of the celebrations of the Union-wide holidays were also broadcast.\n\nStarting in the mid-1970s, another 30-minute edition was presented on the All-Union Programme (launched in 1956) around 11:00pm.(This was in the form of a live simulcast of ''Vremya'' in the next ''Orbita'' transmission zone, occasionally a repeat of the 9:00pm programme, especially in the European USSR.) Prior to that, both channels aired ''Vremya'' simultaneously at 9:00pm, then repeated the next morning when the First Programme [[Sign-on|signed on]] around 7:30am (later 6:30am) after the exercise programme, before airing children's programming and schools and colleges programmes, all produced together with the USSR Ministry of Education and were also seen on Programme 4. Later, a live morning edition was shown at 6:30am, before the [[Morning show|breakfast programme]] [[120 minut]] (which continues today on Channel One Russia as ''Dobroye Utro'', [[Russian language|Russian]]:{{lang|ru|\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0442\u0440\u043e}}) on weekdays (on weekends Vremya aired at 8:00 am after sign-on).\n\nNews summaries were added as the transmissions increased during the day. There was a bulletin at the end of the morning and midday programmes (i.e. around 1:00pm), an afternoon edition at 3:00pm, and another at 6:30pm on the first channel. From 1989, the latter bulletin began to use the two presenter format of ''Vremya'', as well as the ''Vremya'' moniker, and its corresponding studio and graphics (including the title sequence and theme music), looking as it was the program's first edition (the 6:30 am program was the morning news edition while the one at 1PM was the midday update), with the 9:00 pm telecast as the second (main) edition and the one at 11:00 pm as the third or late edition or the late night replay.  The All-Union Programme's daytime schedule always began with the news at around 15:00. Midnight newscasts did not appear until the 1980s, when the First Programme screened a headline update preceding the [[sign-off|closedown]] sequence, usually after midnight. All of these bulletins were known as ''Novosti'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]:{{lang|ru|\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438}}, \"The News\"). From 1989, the 15:00 news round-up on the All-Union Programme and the midnight news round-up on the First Programme were known as ''TSN: Television News Service'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]:TCH:{{lang|ru|\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439}}, ''TSN:Televizionnaya sluzhba novostey''), which ended in 1991. Today the news on Channel One Russia follows a similar schedule to this one, with Vremya, Novosti, and the all-Russian and regional news updates.\n\nThe majority of Russians rely on ''Vremya'' as a trusted news source.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1983 and since 1986, ''Vremya'' has used the theme song from [[Time, Forward!]] as its signature tune and opening sequence.\n\nIn a two-week test that lasted from 12 to 26 February 1990 more than 100 [[PBS]] member stations across the United States broadcast ''Vremya''. The test was coordinated by [[WGBH-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Soviet news program comes to public TV|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|page=6A|date=20 February 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Coverage during the last days of the USSR==\nAfter the introduction of the ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'', ''Vremya'' loosened its fidelity to the party line and began presenting fair reports about the events transforming Eastern Europe at the time. On 15 March 1989 150 million Soviet citizens watched as the station aired an 85-page speech by Gorbachev to a [[Plenary session|''plenum'']] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee]] criticizing the poor state of agriculture and setting out the case for reforms,<ref name=\"LLC1989\">{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=Lenin Meets Letterman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-cCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19|date=3 April 1989|work=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=19|issn=0028-7369}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobbs|first1=Michael|title=GORBACHEV SETS SWEEPING AGRICULTURAL REFORMS|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/03/16/gorbachev-sets-sweeping-agricultural-reforms/46f5204b-e52c-4d24-b495-c1d51e30e5ca/|work=The Washington Post|date=March 16, 1989}}</ref> the highlights of that address being featured on that day's telecast.\n\nIn the 1980s, 86% of Soviet adults relied on television coverage as their primary source of news.

On 19 August 1991 it showed pictures of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|impending coup d'etat]] in Moscow for the first time, albeit in the new styled studios which opened in 1990.\n\nVremya covered highlights of the March 1989 elections for the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] and the sessions of the Congress in Moscow, making interviews with its leadership and deputies.\n\n==Transition==\nThe last Soviet-era ''Vremya'' newscast was broadcast on 27 August 1991 and replaced with another news programme known as ''TV-Inform'' ([[Russian language|ru]]: {{lang|ru|\u0422\u0412-\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c}}) the following day.<ref>{{cite web|title=1991/08/28 \u2014 \u0422\u0412 \u0418\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c. 1 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b. 28 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1991 \u0433.

The programme has been on the air since 1 January 1968 (there were no broadcasts from August 1991 to December 1994) and was broadcast in color since 1974.\n\n==Editorial line==\nIn the Soviet days of ''Vremya'', the programme had a pro-[[Government of the Soviet Union|government]] bias and typically did not report on news that could potentially fuel anti-government sentiment. The programme presented reports that promoted [[socialism]] and portrayed the [[Western world|West]] in a negative manner. The newsroom was tied to the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Central Committee]]. This situation changed after [[Glasnost]], when a director of news was introduced alongside the news being sourced [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|from official outlets]]. This made CT USSR report accurately on the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Soviet Union's satellite communist countries]] in Eastern Europe in 1989. This also made Vremya to be shown uncensored and critical, triggering the protests that hastened [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the end of the Soviet Union]].\n\n==Schedule and popularity==\n''Vremya'' is produced in three daily editions, scheduled for transmission in Moscow at 13:00, 17:00 and 21:00 [[Moscow Time|local time (= UTC+3)]], the last of these having been the programme's main edition ever since its inception in 1968. Given the country's vast size (it stretches over eleven time zones) editions of ''Vremya'' are also broadcast (either live or deferred) at Moscow time plus two, four, six, and eight hours, according to locality.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0005827379.pdf Soviet television: a new asset for Kremlin watchers] p. 48; [http://7days.ru/stars/privatelife/ekaterina-andreeva-muzh-znaet-chto-darit-mne-brillianty-bespolezno.htm 7days.ru] Interview with Ekatherina Andreeva</ref> \n\nDuring the Soviet era, the programme's main edition was also carried simultaneously on the primary channel of each republican station: Azeri Television, [[Belarus 1]], [[Eesti Televisioon]], Georgian Public Broadcasting, Kazakhstan-1, Channel 1 of the [[National Television Company of Ukraine|Kiev Telecentre]], [[Latvijas Telev\u012bzija|LTV1]], [[Lithuanian National Radio and Television]], Uzbekistan 1, etc.\n\nThe [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] lasts 30 minutes, but in special circumstances (more especially during the Soviet era), the broadcast is extended beyond the 30 minutes allotted when necessary (such as the [[Red Square]] state ceremonies and parades, [[Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Party Congress]] telecasts together with other CPSU-led activities, plenary sessions of the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]], and deaths of Soviet leaders [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]). Even highlights of the celebrations of the Union-wide holidays were also broadcast.\n\nStarting in the mid-1970s, another 30-minute edition was presented on the All-Union Programme (launched in 1956) around 11:00pm.(This was in the form of a live simulcast of ''Vremya'' in the next ''Orbita'' transmission zone, occasionally a repeat of the 9:00pm programme, especially in the European USSR.) Prior to that, both channels aired ''Vremya'' simultaneously at 9:00pm, then repeated the next morning when the First Programme [[Sign-on|signed on]] around 7:30am (later 6:30am) after the exercise programme, before airing children's programming and schools and colleges programmes, all produced together with the USSR Ministry of Education and were also seen on Programme 4. Later, a live morning edition was shown at 6:30am, before the [[Morning show|breakfast programme]] [[120 minut]] (which continues today on Channel One Russia as ''Dobroye Utro'', [[Russian language|Russian]]:{{lang|ru|\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0442\u0440\u043e}}) on weekdays (on weekends Vremya aired at 8:00 am after sign-on).\n\nNews summaries were added as the transmissions increased during the day. There was a bulletin at the end of the morning and midday programmes (i.e. around 1:00pm), an afternoon edition at 3:00pm, and another at 6:30pm on the first channel. From 1989, the latter bulletin began to use the two presenter format of ''Vremya'', as well as the ''Vremya'' moniker, and its corresponding studio and graphics (including the title sequence and theme music), looking as it was the program's first edition (the 6:30 am program was the morning news edition while the one at 1PM was the midday update), with the 9:00 pm telecast as the second (main) edition and the one at 11:00 pm as the third or late edition or the late night replay.  The All-Union Programme's daytime schedule always began with the news at around 15:00. Midnight newscasts did not appear until the 1980s, when the First Programme screened a headline update preceding the [[sign-off|closedown]] sequence, usually after midnight. All of these bulletins were known as ''Novosti'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]:{{lang|ru|\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438}}, \"The News\"). From 1989, the 15:00 news round-up on the All-Union Programme and the midnight news round-up on the First Programme were known as ''TSN: Television News Service'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]:TCH:{{lang|ru|\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439}}, ''TSN:Televizionnaya sluzhba novostey''), which ended in 1991. Today the news on Channel One Russia follows a similar schedule to this one, with Vremya, Novosti, and the all-Russian and regional news updates.\n\nThe majority of Russians rely on ''Vremya'' as a trusted news source.\n\nBetween 1981 and 1983 and since 1986, ''Vremya'' has used the theme song from [[Time, Forward!]] as its signature tune and opening sequence.\n\nIn a two-week test that lasted from 12 to 26 February 1990 more than 100 [[PBS]] member stations across the United States broadcast ''Vremya''. The test was coordinated by [[WGBH-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Soviet news program comes to public TV|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|page=6A|date=20 February 1990}}</ref>\n\n==Coverage during the last days of the USSR==\nAfter the introduction of the ''[[glasnost]]'' and ''[[perestroika]]'', ''Vremya'' loosened its fidelity to the party line and began presenting fair reports about the events transforming Eastern Europe at the time. On 15 March 1989 150 million Soviet citizens watched as the station aired an 85-page speech by Gorbachev to a [[Plenary session|''plenum'']] of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee]] criticizing the poor state of agriculture and setting out the case for reforms,<ref name=\"LLC1989\">{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=Lenin Meets Letterman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-cCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA19|date=3 April 1989|work=New York Magazine|publisher=New York Media, LLC|page=19|issn=0028-7369}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dobbs|first1=Michael|title=GORBACHEV SETS SWEEPING AGRICULTURAL REFORMS|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/03/16/gorbachev-sets-sweeping-agricultural-reforms/46f5204b-e52c-4d24-b495-c1d51e30e5ca/|work=The Washington Post|date=March 16, 1989}}</ref> the highlights of that address being featured on that day's telecast.\n\nIn the 1980s, 86% of Soviet adults relied on television coverage as their primary source of news.

On 19 August 1991 it showed pictures of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'etat attempt|impending coup d'etat]] in Moscow for the first time, albeit in the new styled studios which opened in 1990.\n\nVremya covered highlights of the March 1989 elections for the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] and the sessions of the Congress in Moscow, making interviews with its leadership and deputies.\n\n==Transition==\nThe last Soviet-era ''Vremya'' newscast was broadcast on 27 August 1991 and replaced with another news programme known as ''TV-Inform'' ([[Russian language|ru]]: {{lang|ru|\u0422\u0412-\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c}}) the following day.<ref>{{cite web|title=1991/08/28 \u2014 \u0422\u0412 \u0418\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c. 1 \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b. 28 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 1991 \u0433.

[[EA Sports]] selected him for the cover of the 2003 edition of their [[NCAA Football series|NCAA Football]] video game series. Harrington was given the nickname \"Captain Comeback\" among fans for his ability to lead Oregon to victory in late game situations, accumulating a record of 11-2 in games in which the Ducks trailed or were tied in the fourth quarter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oregonlive.com/sports/2014/11/for_former_oregon_ducks_quarte.html|title=For former Oregon Ducks quarterback Joey Harrington, TV work is a matter of family: Media Mike Check|last=Tokito|first=Mike|date=2014-11-04|website=oregonlive|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>\n\nHarrington's best collegiate game was arguably the [[2002 Fiesta Bowl|2002 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl]] at [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in [[Tempe, Arizona]] when he threw for 350 yards and four touchdowns and helped lead the Ducks to a 38-16 victory over [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]]. Harrington was named offensive player of the game.\n\nHarrington's worst game was arguably the 2000 Civil War in which he passed 24-36 for 333 yards, but threw five interceptions. Three of those interceptions were by Oregon State defensive back Jake Cookus. #8 Oregon State ultimately won 23-13 over then-#6 Oregon.\n\n===College statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| !!colspan=6| Passing !!colspan=3|Rushing\n|-\n!

Harrington took over for incumbent [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] late in the Lions' Week 1 loss against the [[2002 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and became the Lions' starting quarterback shortly thereafter, finishing that year with a 50.1 completion percentage, a ratio of 12 [[touchdown]]s to 16 [[interception]]s, and a 59.9 [[quarterback rating]]; the Lions finished the season with a 3\u201313 record. He was named the 2002 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nHarrington's career in Detroit was largely unsuccessful. Front office mismanagement, woeful offensive line protection, lack of talent at other skill positions, and an erratic philosophical change in the team's identity to a conservative [[West Coast Offense]] (WCO) oriented attack under Head Coach [[Steve Mariucci]] may have played a factor in Harrington not realizing his potential professionally. Harrington's best season as a Lion came in [[2004 NFL season|2004]], when he threw for 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. The Lions started the season with a 4\u20132 record, but Harrington led the team to only two more wins the rest of the season. The Lions finished 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs for the fifth season in a row.\n\nOn October 23, [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Mariucci chose to bench Harrington in favour of veteran [[Jeff Garcia]] for the team's game against the [[2005 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] to try to provide a spark to the team's 2\u20133 start. The Lions won 13\u201310, and Garcia rushed for Detroit's only touchdown. After yet another dismal offensive performance, Mariucci declared that Garcia would remain the starter. That marked the first time since the 2002 season that Harrington did not appear in a Lions' game, breaking a string of 37 consecutive appearances. Harrington regained the starting role the week after Garcia threw a game-ending interception returned for a touchdown in overtime against Chicago. Harrington started again for Detroit on November 13, 2005, against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], throwing for three touchdowns without an interception in the Lions' 29\u201321 win. Harrington was voted by Lions fans as their Offensive Player of the Year, according to the Lions' official website.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Despite his difficult times in Detroit, he remained unwaveringly optimistic and was thus dubbed \"Joey Blue-Skies\" and \"Joey Sunshine\" by sarcastic Lions' fans and beat writers who grew tired of his predictable post-game commentary as the losses continued to mount.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n====Trade to Miami====\nAfter the 2005 season, Detroit signed free agents [[Jon Kitna]] and [[Josh McCown]], and traded Harrington to the Miami Dolphins on May 12, 2006, for a fifth-round draft pick in [[2007 NFL Draft|2007]], after meeting performance stipulations in Miami (the pick was later traded to the [[New Orleans ]]). Harrington started the 2006 season as a backup behind new Dolphins quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]]. During his tenure with the Lions, Harrington started 55 games and had a record of 18 wins and 37 losses.<ref>{{cite web | first = Len | last = Pasquarelli | authorlink = Len Pasquarelli | title = Harrington sent to Dolphins for draft pick | publisher = [[ESPN]] | date = May 12, 2006 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2442339 | accessdate = August 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\nIn 2006, Harrington did not play in the Dolphins' first four games, backing up Culpepper. Culpepper injured his shoulder prior to Miami's fifth game against the [[New England Patriots]], forcing Harrington into the starting role.  Harrington lost his first three starts, before leading Miami to a 31\u201313 win over the previously unbeaten (7\u20130 at the time) [[Chicago Bears]]. Harrington followed that game with four consecutive victories. In perhaps his most memorable game professionally,{{According to whom|date=October 2013}} Harrington capped off this winning streak in front of a national television audience on [[Thanksgiving Day]] in Detroit with a 27\u201310 victory at [[Ford Field]] against his former team.  Harrington passed for 3 touchdowns and 213 yards against Detroit, compiling a passer rating of 107.4, his highest single game rating for 2006.  Harrington struggled after the Lions' game.  Against the [[Buffalo Bills]] in Week 15, Harrington went 5-for-17 for 20 yards, throwing two interceptions.  His passer rating for the game was 0.0, the minimum possible under the complex NFL formula.  Harrington was pulled midway through Miami's next game against the [[New York Jets]], replaced in the 13\u201310 Christmas night loss by [[Cleo Lemon]].  Harrington did not appear in Miami's Week 17 finale against the [[Indianapolis Colts]].  Overall, Harrington played in and started eleven games, leading Miami to a 5\u20136 record (Miami finished 6\u201310 for the season as a whole).\n\n===Atlanta Falcons===\nOn April 9, 2007, Harrington agreed to a two-year, $6 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons to compete with [[D. J. Shockley]] and [[Chris Redman]] to be the backup quarterback to [[Michael Vick]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Former No. 1 pick Harrington agrees to Falcons deal | publisher = [[ESPN]] | date = April 9, 2007 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2830712 | accessdate = August 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHarrington was elevated to starting quarterback after the suspension of Vick for the 2007 NFL season. Harrington performed well in the preseason, but after going 0-2, Atlanta signed former [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] starting quarterback [[Byron Leftwich]] as a possible replacement for Harrington.  During the Week 3 Atlanta home opener against the division rival [[2007 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]], Harrington completed 31-of-44 passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions for a 110.1 passer rating in a 27\u201320 loss. In Week 4, Harrington improved on his numbers with a 121.7 passer rating, completing 23-of-29 passes for two touchdowns with no interceptions, leading the Falcons to their first win of the 2007 season.\n\nOn March 5, 2008, the Falcons released Harrington in a salary cap move. He was re-signed by the team seven days later<ref>{{Cite news |title=Falcons re-sign Harrington one week after cutting veteran QB |url= http://www.nfl.com/freeagency/story/09000d5d807279f6/article/falcons-resign-harrington-one-week-after-cutting-veteran-qb |date=March 11, 2008 |work=NFL.com Wire Reports\n}}</ref> but was again released in August after the Falcons completed their preseason schedule.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Falcons keep Shockley, cut Harrington |url=http://www.ajc.com/falcons/content/sports/falcons/stories/2008/08/30/falcons_keep_shockley.html |publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=August 30, 2008 |accessdate=August 30, 2008 |author= }}</ref>\n\n===New Orleans Saints===\nHarrington signed with the [[New Orleans Saints]] on September 19, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3597637 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922092629/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3597637 |archivedate=September 22, 2008 }}</ref> He was the third-string quarterback behind [[Drew Brees]] and [[Mark Brunell]] for one game against the [[2008 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]].

Many speculate that his premature start in the NFL, along with lack of surrounding talent, poor coaching, and questionable offensive lines have affected his performance severely. Many other quarterbacks, such as [[Tim Couch]] and [[David Carr (American football)|David Carr]], were also drafted highly and eventually lost their starting jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/393302-does-tim-couch-deserve-to-be-labeled-an-all-time-bust|title=Does Tim Couch Deserve To Be Labeled an All-Time Bust?|first=Derrick|last=G|date=|website=bleacherreport.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2011/04/big-mistakes-the-top-25-biggest-nfl-draft-busts-of-past-15-years/1#.VpR7bhUrLIV|title=Huge mistakes: The 25 biggest NFL draft busts of past 15 years|author=|date=|website=usatoday.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, NFL analyst and Hall Of Fame quarterback [[Troy Aikman]] wrote that Harrington \"can still be a really good quarterback in this league,\" and does not deserve the blame for what happened in Detroit: \"The focus on Joey's play has given every other player a hall pass, and that's not right.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Aikman |first=Troy |authorlink=Troy Aikman |title=Harrington doesn't deserve all the blame |magazine=[[The Sporting News]] |date=September 29, 2005 |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/exclusives/20050929/654803.html |accessdate=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328135355/http://www.sportingnews.com/exclusives/20050929/654803.html |archivedate=March 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[Phil Simms]], a [[CBS Sports]] analyst and Super Bowl MVP, said in 2006 that Harrington got a bad rap in Detroit. \"I am not a Joey Harrington basher,\" \"The quarterback can't overcome bad coaching and bad players.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=Simms |authorlink=Phil Simms |title=Simms sounds off |newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |date=October 10, 2006 |url=http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/sports_football_dolphins/2006/10/simms_sounds_of.html |accessdate=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111843/http://blogs.sun-sentinel.com/sports_football_dolphins/2006/10/simms_sounds_of.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> Former [[Miami Dolphins]] quarterback and television analyst [[Dan Marino]] said that he did not believe that Harrington had the necessary pieces around him in Detroit to be successful, but that he might be OK in a different place.\n\nWhen Lions head coach [[Steve Mariucci]] was fired by general manager [[Matt Millen]], Lions cornerback [[Dr\u00e9 Bly]] told [[Rich Eisen]] in an NFL Total Access interview that he blamed Harrington for the dismissal of Mariucci.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2240566|title=Corner Bly blames Mariucci firing on QB|author=|date=November 29, 2005|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Bly later apologized to the Lions, but not to Harrington.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10252033/%5Benter+URL%5D|title=Homepage|author=|date=August 23, 2015|website=msnbc.com|access-date=June 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006212822/http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10252033/%5Benter%20URL%5D|archive-date=October 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSome fingers were also pointed at the Lions' management and coaching staff.

Harrington took over for incumbent [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] late in the Lions' Week 1 loss against the [[2002 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] and became the Lions' starting quarterback shortly thereafter, finishing that year with a 50.1 completion percentage, a ratio of 12 [[touchdown]]s to 16 [[interception]]s, and a 59.9 [[quarterback rating]]; the Lions finished the season with a 3\u201313 record. He was named the 2002 recipient of the Detroit Lions/Detroit Sports Broadcasters Association Rookie of the Year Award.\n\nHarrington's career in Detroit was largely unsuccessful. Front office mismanagement, woeful offensive line protection, lack of talent at other skill positions, and an erratic philosophical change in the team's identity to a conservative [[West Coast Offense]] (WCO) oriented attack under Head Coach [[Steve Mariucci]] may have played a factor in Harrington not realizing his potential professionally. Harrington's best season as a Lion came in [[2004 NFL season|2004]], when he threw for 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. The Lions started the season with a 4\u20132 record, but Harrington led the team to only two more wins the rest of the season. The Lions finished 6\u201310 and missed the playoffs for the fifth season in a row.\n\nOn October 23, [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Mariucci chose to bench Harrington in favour of veteran [[Jeff Garcia]] for the team's game against the [[2005 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] to try to provide a spark to the team's 2\u20133 start. The Lions won 13\u201310, and Garcia rushed for Detroit's only touchdown. After yet another dismal offensive performance, Mariucci declared that Garcia would remain the starter. That marked the first time since the 2002 season that Harrington did not appear in a Lions' game, breaking a string of 37 consecutive appearances. Harrington regained the starting role the week after Garcia threw a game-ending interception returned for a touchdown in overtime against Chicago. Harrington started again for Detroit on November 13, 2005, against the [[Arizona Cardinals]], throwing for three touchdowns without an interception in the Lions' 29\u201321 win. Harrington was voted by Lions fans as their Offensive Player of the Year, according to the Lions' official website.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Despite his difficult times in Detroit, he remained unwaveringly optimistic and was thus dubbed \"Joey Blue-Skies\" and \"Joey Sunshine\" by sarcastic Lions' fans and beat writers who grew tired of his predictable post-game commentary as the losses continued to mount.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n====Trade to Miami====\nAfter the 2005 season, Detroit signed free agents [[Jon Kitna]] and [[Josh McCown]], and traded Harrington to the Miami Dolphins on May 12, 2006, for a fifth-round draft pick in [[2007 NFL Draft|2007]], after meeting performance stipulations in Miami (the pick was later traded to the [[New Orleans ]]).

Harrington lost his first three starts, before leading Miami to a 31\u201313 win over the previously unbeaten (7\u20130 at the time) [[Chicago Bears]]. Harrington followed that game with four consecutive victories. In perhaps his most memorable game professionally,{{According to whom|date=October 2013}} Harrington capped off this winning streak in front of a national television audience on [[Thanksgiving Day]] in Detroit with a 27\u201310 victory at [[Ford Field]] against his former team.  Harrington passed for 3 touchdowns and 213 yards against Detroit, compiling a passer rating of 107.4, his highest single game rating for 2006.  Harrington struggled after the Lions' game.  Against the [[Buffalo Bills]] in Week 15, Harrington went 5-for-17 for 20 yards, throwing two interceptions.  His passer rating for the game was 0.0, the minimum possible under the complex NFL formula.  Harrington was pulled midway through Miami's next game against the [[New York Jets]], replaced in the 13\u201310 Christmas night loss by [[Cleo Lemon]].  Harrington did not appear in Miami's Week 17 finale against the [[Indianapolis Colts]].  Overall, Harrington played in and started eleven games, leading Miami to a 5\u20136 record (Miami finished 6\u201310 for the season as a whole).\n\n===Atlanta Falcons===\nOn April 9, 2007, Harrington agreed to a two-year, $6 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons to compete with [[D. J. Shockley]] and [[Chris Redman]] to be the backup quarterback to [[Michael Vick]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Former No. 1 pick Harrington agrees to Falcons deal | publisher = [[ESPN]] | date = April 9, 2007 | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2830712 | accessdate = August 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHarrington was elevated to starting quarterback after the suspension of Vick for the 2007 NFL season. Harrington performed well in the preseason, but after going 0-2, Atlanta signed former [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] starting quarterback [[Byron Leftwich]] as a possible replacement for Harrington.

This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.

As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.

Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">{{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}}</ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG.

As a consequence, less hemoglobin is available and this affects oxygen supply to the tissues. \nHemoglobin Barts syndrome manifests when all four genes coding for \u03b1 subunit are deleted. This is often fatal for the fetus carrying the disorder, as in the absence of \u03b1 subunits, a form of hemoglobin with four \u03b3 subunits, hemoglobin Barts, is produced. This form of hemoglobin isn\u2019t fit for oxygen exchange precisely due to its very high affinity for oxygen.

Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.

As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin.
