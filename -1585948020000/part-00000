The Leafs managed to make the post-season as well as the Cup finals. In game six of the 1964 Cup finals, Baun suffered a fractured ankle and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice.

The home jersey was blue with alternating thin-thick stripes on the arms, legs and shoulders. The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back, waist and legs.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=364}} For 1933\u201334, the alternating thin-thick stripes were replaced with stripes of equal thickness. This remained the basic design for the next 40 years.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=364}} In 1937, veins were added to the leaf and \"Toronto\" curved downwards at the ends instead of upwards.{{sfn|Obodiac|1976|p=212}} In 1942, the 35-point leaf was introduced. In 1946, the logo added trimming to the leaf with a white or blue border, while \"C\" for captain and \"A\" for alternate captain first appeared on the sweaters. In 1947, the \"Toronto Maple Leafs\" lettering was in red for a short time. In 1958, a six-eyelet lace and tie was added to the neck and a blue shoulder yoke was added. In 1961, player numbers were added on the sleeves.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=365}}\n[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs Logo 1939 - 1967.svg|thumb|150px|left|alt=Old logo for the Maple Leaf, featuring a blue maple leaf stylized with leaf veins on its edges, with white lettering Toronto Maple Leaf placed within the Maple Leaf.|Logo for the Maple Leafs from 1938 to 1967. The logo was later used as an alternate logo for the Maple Leafs (1992\u20132000; 2008\u20132016).]]\nThe fourth major change came in the 1966\u201367 season, when the logo was changed to an 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new [[flag of Canada]] to commemorate the [[Canadian Centennial]].{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=365}} The simpler leaf logo featured the [[Futura (typeface)#Futura Display (Futura Schlagzeile)|Futura Display]] typeface, replacing the previous block letters. The stripes on the sleeves and waistline were also changed, adding a wider stripe in between the two thinner stripes (similar to the stripe patterns on the socks and on the early Leafs sweaters). Before the 1970\u201371 season, the Leafs adopted a new 11-point leaf logo, with a [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel bold-font]] \"Toronto\" going straight across, running parallel to the other words. Other changes to the sweater included the replacement of the arm strips with an elongated yoke that extended to the ends of the sleeves, a solid single stripe on the waist replacing the three waistline stripes, two stripes on the stockings, and a smaller, textless Leaf crest on the shoulders.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}} In 1973, the jersey's neck was a lace tie-down design, before the V-neck returned in 1976. In 1977, the NHL rules were changed to require names on the backs of the uniforms, but Harold Ballard resisted the change. Under Ballard's direction, the team briefly \"complied\" with the rule by placing blue letters on the blue road jersey for a game on February 26, 1978. With the NHL threatening hefty fines for failing to comply with the spirit of the rule (namely, having the names be legible for the fans and broadcasters in attendance), Ballard reached a compromise with the league, allowing the Leafs to finish the [[1977\u201378 NHL season|1977\u201378 season]] with contrasting white letters on the road sweaters, and coming into full compliance with the new rule in the [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1978\u201379 season]] by adding names in blue to the white home sweaters.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}}\n\nWith the NHL's 75th anniversary season (1991\u201392 season), the Leafs wore \"Original Six\" style uniforms similar to the designs used in the 1940s.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}} Because of the fan reaction to the previous season's classic uniforms, the first changes to the Maple Leafs uniform in over 20 years were made. The revised uniforms for [[1992\u201393 NHL season|1992\u201393]] featured two stripes on the sleeves and waistline like the classic uniform, but with the 1970 11-point leaf with Kabel text on the front. A vintage-style veined leaf crest was placed on the shoulders.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}} The uniforms would undergo a few modifications over the years. \n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660206292).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A banner featuring an old Maple Leaf logo, featuring an eleven pointed white maple leaf on a blue background.|Maple Leafs banner at the [[2016 National Hockey League All-Star Game|2016 NHL All-Star Game]]. The 11-point leaf logo was used as the primary team logo from [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970]] to [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2016]].]]\nIn 1997, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired the rights to manufacture Maple Leafs uniforms. Construction changes to the uniform included a wishbone collar and pothole mesh underarms, while the player name and number font was changed to Kabel to match the logo. CCM returned to manufacturing the Leafs uniforms in 1999 when Nike withdrew from the hockey jersey market, and kept most of the changes, although in 2000 the Kabel numbers were replaced with block numbers outlined in silver, and a silver-outlined interlocked TML monogram replaced the vintage leaf on the shoulders. Also during this time, the Leafs began wearing a white 1960s-style throwback [[third jersey]] featuring the outlined 35-point leaf, blue shoulders, and lace-up collar.\n\nWith Reebok taking over the NHL jersey contract following the 2004\u201305 lock-out, changes were expected when the [[Reebok Edge|Edge uniform system]] was set to debut in 2007. As part of the Edge overhaul, the TML monograms were removed from the shoulders, the silver outlines on the numbers were replaced with blue or white outlines (e.g. the blue home jersey featured white numbers with blue and white outlines, rather than blue and silver), and the waistline stripes were removed. In 2010, the two waistline stripes were restored, the vintage leaf returned to the shoulders, and the player names and numbers were changed again, reverting to a simpler single-colour block font. Finally, lace-up collars were brought back to the primary uniforms.<ref name=\"hunter2010\"/>{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=367}} The Leafs also brought back the 1967\u20131970 blue uniform, replacing the white 1960s jersey as their third uniform. For the [[2014 NHL Winter Classic]], the Leafs wore a sweater inspired by their earlier uniforms in the 1930s.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=367}}\n\nOn February 2, 2016, the team unveiled a new logo for the 2016\u201317 season in honour of its centennial, dropping the use of the Kabel-style font lettering used from 1970; it returns the logo to a form inspired by the earlier designs, with 31 points to allude to the 1931 opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, and 17 veins a reference to its establishment in 1917. 13 of the veins are positioned along the top part in honour of its 13 Stanley Cup victories.

For the 2018 season, the Leafs also wore a Toronto Arenas-inspired throwback design. In addition, the Leafs participated in two outdoor games as part of the NHL's own centennial celebration. In the [[NHL Centennial Classic]] against the Red Wings, the Leafs wore blue sweaters with bold white stripes across the chest and arms.

They also remained voting members of the NHA, and thus had enough votes to suspend the other league's operations, effectively leaving Livingstone's league with one team.{{sfn|Holzman|Nieforth|2002|p=151}}\n\nThe NHL had decided that it would operate a four-team circuit, made up of the Canadiens, Maroons, Ottawa, and one more club in either Quebec or Toronto.

The beginning of the [[1960\u201361 NHL season|1960\u201361]] season also saw the debut of rookies [[Bob Nevin]], and [[Dave Keon]].

With Imlach seeking to reinvigorate the slumping Leafs, he made a mid-season trade that sent Duff, and Nevin to the Rangers for [[Andy Bathgate]] and [[Don McKenney]]. The Leafs managed to make the post-season as well as the Cup finals. In game six of the 1964 Cup finals, Baun suffered a fractured ankle and required a stretcher to be taken off the ice.

The home jersey was blue with alternating thin-thick stripes on the arms, legs and shoulders. The road uniform was white with three stripes on the chest and back, waist and legs.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=364}} For 1933\u201334, the alternating thin-thick stripes were replaced with stripes of equal thickness. This remained the basic design for the next 40 years.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=364}} In 1937, veins were added to the leaf and \"Toronto\" curved downwards at the ends instead of upwards.{{sfn|Obodiac|1976|p=212}} In 1942, the 35-point leaf was introduced. In 1946, the logo added trimming to the leaf with a white or blue border, while \"C\" for captain and \"A\" for alternate captain first appeared on the sweaters. In 1947, the \"Toronto Maple Leafs\" lettering was in red for a short time. In 1958, a six-eyelet lace and tie was added to the neck and a blue shoulder yoke was added. In 1961, player numbers were added on the sleeves.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=365}}\n[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs Logo 1939 - 1967.svg|thumb|150px|left|alt=Old logo for the Maple Leaf, featuring a blue maple leaf stylized with leaf veins on its edges, with white lettering Toronto Maple Leaf placed within the Maple Leaf.|Logo for the Maple Leafs from 1938 to 1967. The logo was later used as an alternate logo for the Maple Leafs (1992\u20132000; 2008\u20132016).]]\nThe fourth major change came in the 1966\u201367 season, when the logo was changed to an 11-point leaf, similar to the leaf on the then-new [[flag of Canada]] to commemorate the [[Canadian Centennial]].{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=365}} The simpler leaf logo featured the [[Futura (typeface)#Futura Display (Futura Schlagzeile)|Futura Display]] typeface, replacing the previous block letters. The stripes on the sleeves and waistline were also changed, adding a wider stripe in between the two thinner stripes (similar to the stripe patterns on the socks and on the early Leafs sweaters). Before the 1970\u201371 season, the Leafs adopted a new 11-point leaf logo, with a [[Kabel (typeface)|Kabel bold-font]] \"Toronto\" going straight across, running parallel to the other words. Other changes to the sweater included the replacement of the arm strips with an elongated yoke that extended to the ends of the sleeves, a solid single stripe on the waist replacing the three waistline stripes, two stripes on the stockings, and a smaller, textless Leaf crest on the shoulders.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}} In 1973, the jersey's neck was a lace tie-down design, before the V-neck returned in 1976. In 1977, the NHL rules were changed to require names on the backs of the uniforms, but Harold Ballard resisted the change. Under Ballard's direction, the team briefly \"complied\" with the rule by placing blue letters on the blue road jersey for a game on February 26, 1978. With the NHL threatening hefty fines for failing to comply with the spirit of the rule (namely, having the names be legible for the fans and broadcasters in attendance), Ballard reached a compromise with the league, allowing the Leafs to finish the [[1977\u201378 NHL season|1977\u201378 season]] with contrasting white letters on the road sweaters, and coming into full compliance with the new rule in the [[1978\u201379 NHL season|1978\u201379 season]] by adding names in blue to the white home sweaters.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}}\n\nWith the NHL's 75th anniversary season (1991\u201392 season), the Leafs wore \"Original Six\" style uniforms similar to the designs used in the 1940s.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}} Because of the fan reaction to the previous season's classic uniforms, the first changes to the Maple Leafs uniform in over 20 years were made. The revised uniforms for [[1992\u201393 NHL season|1992\u201393]] featured two stripes on the sleeves and waistline like the classic uniform, but with the 1970 11-point leaf with Kabel text on the front. A vintage-style veined leaf crest was placed on the shoulders.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=366}} The uniforms would undergo a few modifications over the years. \n[[File:2016 NHL All-Star Game (24660206292).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A banner featuring an old Maple Leaf logo, featuring an eleven pointed white maple leaf on a blue background.|Maple Leafs banner at the [[2016 National Hockey League All-Star Game|2016 NHL All-Star Game]]. The 11-point leaf logo was used as the primary team logo from [[1970\u201371 NHL season|1970]] to [[2016\u201317 NHL season|2016]].]]\nIn 1997, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired the rights to manufacture Maple Leafs uniforms. Construction changes to the uniform included a wishbone collar and pothole mesh underarms, while the player name and number font was changed to Kabel to match the logo. CCM returned to manufacturing the Leafs uniforms in 1999 when Nike withdrew from the hockey jersey market, and kept most of the changes, although in 2000 the Kabel numbers were replaced with block numbers outlined in silver, and a silver-outlined interlocked TML monogram replaced the vintage leaf on the shoulders. Also during this time, the Leafs began wearing a white 1960s-style throwback [[third jersey]] featuring the outlined 35-point leaf, blue shoulders, and lace-up collar.\n\nWith Reebok taking over the NHL jersey contract following the 2004\u201305 lock-out, changes were expected when the [[Reebok Edge|Edge uniform system]] was set to debut in 2007. As part of the Edge overhaul, the TML monograms were removed from the shoulders, the silver outlines on the numbers were replaced with blue or white outlines (e.g. the blue home jersey featured white numbers with blue and white outlines, rather than blue and silver), and the waistline stripes were removed. In 2010, the two waistline stripes were restored, the vintage leaf returned to the shoulders, and the player names and numbers were changed again, reverting to a simpler single-colour block font. Finally, lace-up collars were brought back to the primary uniforms.<ref name=\"hunter2010\"/>{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=367}} The Leafs also brought back the 1967\u20131970 blue uniform, replacing the white 1960s jersey as their third uniform. For the [[2014 NHL Winter Classic]], the Leafs wore a sweater inspired by their earlier uniforms in the 1930s.{{sfn|LeafsPR|2016|p=367}}\n\nOn February 2, 2016, the team unveiled a new logo for the 2016\u201317 season in honour of its centennial, dropping the use of the Kabel-style font lettering used from 1970; it returns the logo to a form inspired by the earlier designs, with 31 points to allude to the 1931 opening of Maple Leaf Gardens, and 17 veins a reference to its establishment in 1917. 13 of the veins are positioned along the top part in honour of its 13 Stanley Cup victories.

{"title_page": "Harry Plunket Greene", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:Plunket Greene.jpg|thumb|Harry Plunket Greene]]\n'''Harry Plunket Greene''' (24 June 1865 \u2013 19 August 1936) was an [[Irish (people)|Irish]] [[baritone]] who was most famous in the formal concert and oratorio repertoire. Making a great contribution to British musical life, he wrote and lectured on his art, and enriched the field of musical competitions and examinations. He also wrote ''Where the Bright Waters Meet'' (1924) a classic book about [[fly fishing]].\n\n== Training ==\nPlunket Greene was born in [[Dublin]], the son of Richard Jonas Greene, a barrister, and [[Louisa Lilias Plunket Greene|Louisa Lilias Plunket]], granddaughter of [[William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket|William Conyngham Plunket]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishheritage.co.uk/harry-plunket-greene/ |title=Harry Plunket Greene |publisher=Irish Heritage |date= |accessdate=2020-04-03}}</ref> He was educated at [[Clifton College]] and initially expected to follow Law at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. However, after he was 'smashed up' in a football accident he had a year's convalescence. Discovering his musical calling he studied under Arthur Barraclough in [[Dublin]] before attending the [[Stuttgart Conservatory]] for two years under Hromada in the early 1880s. He also studied in [[Florence]] with [[Luigi Vannuccini]] (a pupil of [[Francesco Lamperti]]), and in London with J. B. Welsh and Alfred Blume.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924>Eaglefield-Hull 1924.</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nHe made his debut in London (at the People's Palace, Mile End) in 1888, in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'',<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and in the next year appeared in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''Redemption''. In 1890 he made operatic debuts as Commendatore in ''Don Giovanni'' and as the Duke of Verona in ''Romeo et Juliette'', at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. Thereafter he elected to make his career in recital.\n\nIn oratorio, his first Festival appearance was at [[Worcester]] in 1890. Plunket Greene created the title part in [[Hubert Parry|Parry]]'s ''Job'', at the [[Gloucester Festival]] in 1892. This includes the ''Lamentation of Job'', an extremely long (28-page) and sustained oratorio scena. [[David Bispham]] said of his performances that he 'created the part and rendered it many times with superb dramatic feeling.'<ref>Bispham 1920, 159.</ref> In this, as in most of Parry's songs, Plunket Greene recognised the perfect declamation of Parry's writing, the accent upon word-values falling naturally and correctly in the music. As a result, he became the original exponent or dedicatee of many of the lyrical works of Parry,<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and also of [[Battison Haynes]] (\"Off to Philadelphia\"), and of [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Stanford wrote ''[[Songs of the Sea (Stanford)|Songs of the Sea]]'' for him, and the singer also greatly admired Stanford's ''Cushendall'' and ''Irish Idyll'' cycles and the ''Three Cavalier Songs'' set to [[Robert Browning|Browning]]'s words. Although his voice was not exceptionally powerful he used it with great style, musicianship and intelligence.\n\nIn 1891 [[George Bernard Shaw]] found him 'fairly equal to the occasion in the wonderful duet' from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Whitsuntide Canatata, ''O, Ewiges Feuer'', with the Bach Choir. In April 1892 (sharing the platform with [[Joseph Joachim]] and [[Franz Xaver Neruda]], [[Fanny Davies]], [[Carlo Alfredo Piatti|Alfredo Piatti]] and Agnes Zimmermann (piano)) he sang admirably in his first set ([[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Peter Cornelius]] and [[Robert Schumann]]) in a Monday Popular Concert, but made little of his second group. In November 1893 at the first of [[George Henschel]]'s London Symphony Orchestra concerts for the season he performed Stanford's new song, \"Prince Madoc's Farewell\", so patriotically 'that he once or twice almost burst into the next key.' Shaw's strictures on his diction were no doubt taken very seriously by the singer, who studied to make absolute clarity and naturalness of diction a central point of his teaching and example.<ref>Shaw 1932, i, 107, 129; ii, 73, 89; iii, 86\u201388.</ref>\n\nFrom early in his career Plunket Greene became a champion of ballad and song in the English language, including traditional Irish and English song, into the concert repertoire. Through his connections with Stanford, Parry, Vaughan Williams, [[Gervase Elwes]], and through the imitations or arrangements of Irish songs by [[Hamilton Harty]], [[Arthur Somervell]] or [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] he was very active in promoting this movement in English and Anglo-Irish art-song. He did this not by succumbing to the imitation of country singing, but by investing whatever he sang with all the principles of good singing - of long and intelligent phrasing, clean, natural attack and diction, lively faithfulness to rhythm and timing, and the powerful engagement of imagination in interpretation. These values were explained in his 1912 book ''Interpretation in Song'' which ran through many editions and rapidly became a classic. His advocacy of art-song was indefatigable. His early accompanist Henry Bird gained an appointment as accompanist to the Chappell Ballad Concerts after his very successful partnership with Plunket Greene in the Hungarian Songs of [[Francis Korbay]].<ref>Harold Simpson, 'Ch. XI: Plunket Greene, and Stanford's Irish songs' in ''A Century of Ballads, 1810-1910'' (Mills and Boon, London 1910), [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/century-ballads/century-of-ballads%20-%200337.htm pp. 237-247].</ref>\n\n== Recitals \u2013 partnership with Leonard Borwick ==\nDuring the 1890s (from 1893) Plunket Greene became one of the foremost British performers and interpreters of the German Lieder, especially of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. This he did in association with the English pianist [[Leonard Borwick]] (the brother of a schoolfriend), a Frankfurt pupil of [[Clara Schumann]]'s noted for his powerful rhythmic delivery, and who (like his fellow-pupil [[Fanny Davies]]) was closely involved in the London work of [[Joseph Joachim]]. Plunket Greene and Borwick formed a musical friendship which lasted until Borwick's death.\n\nPlunket Greene was touring in America in spring 1893 and wrote to Borwick suggesting they should deliver a song and pianoforte recital in London, unlike the more usual form of miscellaneous concert with a mixed company. The first recital was in [[St James's Hall]] in December 1893, followed by a tour throughout the country, and this pattern was repeated for ten years. Borwick played his own programme as well as accompanying, but after a couple of seasons [[Samuel Liddle]] came in as accompanist. Pioneering this model of the recital, they gave a lead to that movement in London. Their rules were to maintain musicianship, avoid the glare of publicity, and never to take care of hands or voice.\n\nOn 11 January 1895 at St James's Hall, Borwick and Greene gave the first complete public performance of [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' to be heard in London. Their musical partnership was still active in 1913, but the demands of their separate tours became so great by the early 1900s that they agreed not to continue their former recital programme unless it could be done whole-heartedly. Plunket Greene toured especially in the United States, where he considered the audiences especially attentive and appreciative, and in Germany. He also liked northern English audiences better than southern ones, and liked singing to audiences of public schoolboys.<ref>Plunket Greene 1934 (''Blue Danube to Shannon''), 74\u201389.</ref>\n\n== Gerontius and after ==\nPlunket Greene was a friend of Elgar's, and appeared in his Malvern Concert Club events.<ref>Young 1956, 126\u2013127.</ref> He was the original baritone in the first (October 1900) performance (Birmingham Festival) of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius|Dream of Gerontius]]'', alongside [[Marie Brema]] (angel) and [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] (soul), under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. In June 1900 Elgar had written to Jaeger, \"he sings both bass bits and won't they suit him. Gosh.\"<ref>Young 1956, 84.</ref> Although his recordings, and some commentators, suggest the voice was not a large one,<ref>e.g. Eaglefield-Hull 1924.</ref> it must have been capable of sustaining and projecting a considerable tone at this time, for both the ''Gerontius'' baritone solos require this. Moreover, for this most personal of his works, Elgar must have felt some real aptness in the choice.\n\n[[Arthur Somervell]]'s song-cyle, on [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s 'Maud' was originally produced (with twelve songs) in 1898 and was championed by Plunket Greene. In 1899 he married Gwendolen Maud, the youngest daughter of Hubert Parry,<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and their first son was born in 1901. He also gave the first performance of Somervell's '[[A Shropshire Lad]]' cycle, at the [[Aeolian Hall (London)|Aeolian Hall]] on 3 February 1904, and so had the distinction of being the first to sing settings of [[Alfred Edward Housman|A. E. Housman]]'s lyrics, which afterwards became so fundamental an inspiration to the composers associated with the English song revival of that period.\n\nPlunket Greene included a selection from the ''Songs of Travel'' by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in recital in February 1905. Then (or soon afterwards) the composer heard him and dedicated the songs to him, and Greene afterwards quoted from them, and from ''Silent Noon'' (from the ''House of Life'' cycle), in his work on ''Interpretation in Song''. Greene was responsible for establishing these songs in the English concert repertoire, where he was constantly attempting to raise the standard and quality of appreciation of English song through his programming.<ref>Rufus Hallmark, 'Robert Louis Stevenson, Ralph Vaughan Williams and their ''Songs of Travel'',' in Brian Adams and Robin Wells (Eds.), ''Vaughan Williams Essays'' Vol 44 (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), pp. 135, 138.</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Gervase Elwes]] from the start of his professional career and was his lifelong friend. At Elwes' audition for the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1903 Greene wrote to encourage him with the favourable reactions of Parry and Stanford,<ref>Elwes 1935, 127.</ref> and soon afterwards put him up for the [[Savile Club]] in London.<ref>Elwes 1935, 155.</ref> In 1906, he joined the party at [[Brigg]] to sing in the second festival there organised by Elwes and [[Percy Grainger]], and declared his wish to be in many more of them.<ref>Elwes 1935, 165.</ref> When Elwes died in 1921, Greene wrote \"I always felt he [Elwes] was the man I most looked up to.\"<ref>Elwes 1935, 281\u2013282.</ref> 'In the ''St Matthew Passion'', (he) made us feel that he of all men was best fitted to tell us the greatest story in the world.'<ref>Elwes 1935, 296\u2013297.</ref>\n\nPlunkett Greene's recordings were made first for the [[Gramophone Company]], in 1904\u20131906. He included folk-songs in his recitals, according to them the same values of diction, phrasing, rhythm, and interpretative sincerity which he brought to art-songs. In later years, as he moved into the field of song-lecturing, he did great service to the cause of British folk-music.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> His last recordings were made by the electric process for [[Columbia Records]]: his late recording of 'Poor old horse' is an affecting example.\n\nOn 24 January 1910 he appeared in the memorial concert at [[Queen's Hall]] for [[August Jaeger]] (Elgar's 'Nimrod'), singing a group of songs by [[Walford Davies]], and Hans Sachs's monologue from ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg|Die Meistersinger]]''.<ref>Elkin 1944, 41.</ref> He made his first appearance in [[Henry Joseph Wood|Henry Wood]]'s [[The Proms|Promenade Concerts]] at the Queen's Hall in October 1914 singing Stanford's ''Songs of the Sea'' with the [[Alexandra Palace]] Choral Society.<ref>Wood 1946, 295: Elkin 1944, 70.</ref> He had declined to fulfil an engagement to sing them there for the ''Stock Exchange Orchestral Society'' in 1907 on hearing that they still used the high English [[Pitch (music)|Concert pitch]].<ref>Elkin 1944, 104.</ref>\n\n== Competitions and festivals, teaching ==\nIn his later years Plunket Greene was busily involved in the organisation of music events and in teaching and administration. In 1923 he made his fifteenth voyage across the Atlantic (the first had been in 1893), on this occasion to act as a judge in Musical Competitions throughout Canada. From New York he went to [[Toronto]] by train to join [[Granville Bantock]]. This was to be at the five Festivals of [[Ontario]], Manitoba, [[Saskatchewan]], Alberta and [[British Columbia]]. This was the first Ontario Festival (Toronto) (with [[Robert Watkin-Mills]] and [[Boris Hambourg]] also in attendance), the 6th in [[Winnipeg]] (with [[Herbert Witherspoon]] and [[Cecil Forsyth]] assisting), where the Earl Grey trophy was competed for, the 16th in [[Edmonton]] (Alberta), with choirs from [[Lethbridge]] and [[Calgary]], and in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] they were with [[Herbert Howells]].

Making a great contribution to British musical life, he wrote and lectured on his art, and enriched the field of musical competitions and examinations. He also wrote ''Where the Bright Waters Meet'' (1924) a classic book about [[fly fishing]].\n\n== Training ==\nPlunket Greene was born in [[Dublin]], the son of Richard Jonas Greene, a barrister, and [[Louisa Lilias Plunket Greene|Louisa Lilias Plunket]], granddaughter of [[William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket|William Conyngham Plunket]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishheritage.co.uk/harry-plunket-greene/ |title=Harry Plunket Greene |publisher=Irish Heritage |date= |accessdate=2020-04-03}}</ref> He was educated at [[Clifton College]] and initially expected to follow Law at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. However, after he was 'smashed up' in a football accident he had a year's convalescence. Discovering his musical calling he studied under Arthur Barraclough in [[Dublin]] before attending the [[Stuttgart Conservatory]] for two years under Hromada in the early 1880s. He also studied in [[Florence]] with [[Luigi Vannuccini]] (a pupil of [[Francesco Lamperti]]), and in London with J. B. Welsh and Alfred Blume.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924>Eaglefield-Hull 1924.</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nHe made his debut in London (at the People's Palace, Mile End) in 1888, in [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'',<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and in the next year appeared in [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]]'s ''Redemption''. In 1890 he made operatic debuts as Commendatore in ''Don Giovanni'' and as the Duke of Verona in ''Romeo et Juliette'', at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]. Thereafter he elected to make his career in recital.\n\nIn oratorio, his first Festival appearance was at [[Worcester]] in 1890. Plunket Greene created the title part in [[Hubert Parry|Parry]]'s ''Job'', at the [[Gloucester Festival]] in 1892. This includes the ''Lamentation of Job'', an extremely long (28-page) and sustained oratorio scena. [[David Bispham]] said of his performances that he 'created the part and rendered it many times with superb dramatic feeling.'<ref>Bispham 1920, 159.</ref> In this, as in most of Parry's songs, Plunket Greene recognised the perfect declamation of Parry's writing, the accent upon word-values falling naturally and correctly in the music. As a result, he became the original exponent or dedicatee of many of the lyrical works of Parry,<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and also of [[Battison Haynes]] (\"Off to Philadelphia\"), and of [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Stanford wrote ''[[Songs of the Sea (Stanford)|Songs of the Sea]]'' for him, and the singer also greatly admired Stanford's ''Cushendall'' and ''Irish Idyll'' cycles and the ''Three Cavalier Songs'' set to [[Robert Browning|Browning]]'s words. Although his voice was not exceptionally powerful he used it with great style, musicianship and intelligence.\n\nIn 1891 [[George Bernard Shaw]] found him 'fairly equal to the occasion in the wonderful duet' from [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s Whitsuntide Canatata, ''O, Ewiges Feuer'', with the Bach Choir. In April 1892 (sharing the platform with [[Joseph Joachim]] and [[Franz Xaver Neruda]], [[Fanny Davies]], [[Carlo Alfredo Piatti|Alfredo Piatti]] and Agnes Zimmermann (piano)) he sang admirably in his first set ([[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], [[Peter Cornelius]] and [[Robert Schumann]]) in a Monday Popular Concert, but made little of his second group. In November 1893 at the first of [[George Henschel]]'s London Symphony Orchestra concerts for the season he performed Stanford's new song, \"Prince Madoc's Farewell\", so patriotically 'that he once or twice almost burst into the next key.' Shaw's strictures on his diction were no doubt taken very seriously by the singer, who studied to make absolute clarity and naturalness of diction a central point of his teaching and example.<ref>Shaw 1932, i, 107, 129; ii, 73, 89; iii, 86\u201388.</ref>\n\nFrom early in his career Plunket Greene became a champion of ballad and song in the English language, including traditional Irish and English song, into the concert repertoire. Through his connections with Stanford, Parry, Vaughan Williams, [[Gervase Elwes]], and through the imitations or arrangements of Irish songs by [[Hamilton Harty]], [[Arthur Somervell]] or [[Charles Wood (composer)|Charles Wood]] he was very active in promoting this movement in English and Anglo-Irish art-song. He did this not by succumbing to the imitation of country singing, but by investing whatever he sang with all the principles of good singing - of long and intelligent phrasing, clean, natural attack and diction, lively faithfulness to rhythm and timing, and the powerful engagement of imagination in interpretation. These values were explained in his 1912 book ''Interpretation in Song'' which ran through many editions and rapidly became a classic. His advocacy of art-song was indefatigable. His early accompanist Henry Bird gained an appointment as accompanist to the Chappell Ballad Concerts after his very successful partnership with Plunket Greene in the Hungarian Songs of [[Francis Korbay]].<ref>Harold Simpson, 'Ch. XI: Plunket Greene, and Stanford's Irish songs' in ''A Century of Ballads, 1810-1910'' (Mills and Boon, London 1910), [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/century-ballads/century-of-ballads%20-%200337.htm pp. 237-247].</ref>\n\n== Recitals \u2013 partnership with Leonard Borwick ==\nDuring the 1890s (from 1893) Plunket Greene became one of the foremost British performers and interpreters of the German Lieder, especially of [[Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]. This he did in association with the English pianist [[Leonard Borwick]] (the brother of a schoolfriend), a Frankfort pupil of Mme [[Clara Schumann]]'s noted for his powerful rhythmic delivery, and who (like his fellow-pupil Fanny Davies) was closely involved in the London work of Joachim. Plunket Greene and Borwick formed a musical friendship which lasted until Borwick's death.\n\nPlunket Greene was touring in America in Spring 1893 and wrote to Borwick suggesting they should deliver a song and pianoforte recital in London, unlike the more usual form of miscellaneous concert with a mixed company. The first recital was in [[St James's Hall]] in December 1893, followed by a tour throughout the country, and this pattern was repeated for ten years. Borwick played his own programme as well as accompanying, but after a couple of seasons [[Samuel Liddle]] came in as accompanist. Pioneering this model of the recital, they gave a lead to that movement in London. Their rules were to maintain musicianship, avoid the glare of publicity, and never to take care of hands or voice.\n\nOn 11 January 1895 at St James's Hall, Borwick and Greene gave the first complete public performance of Schumann's ''[[Dichterliebe]]'' to be heard in London. Their musical partnership was still active in 1913, but the demands of their separate tours became so great by the early 1900s that they agreed not to continue their former recital programme unless it could be done whole-heartedly. Plunket Greene toured especially in the United States, where he considered the audiences especially attentive and appreciative, and in Germany. He also liked northern English audiences better than southern ones, and liked singing to audiences of public schoolboys.<ref>This section, ref Plunket Greene 1934 (''Blue Danube to Shannon''), 74\u201389.</ref>\n\n== Gerontius and after ==\nPlunket Greene was a friend of Elgar's, and appeared in his Malvern Concert Club events.<ref>Young 1956, 126\u2013127.</ref> He was the original baritone in the first (October 1900) performance (Birmingham Festival) of [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[The Dream of Gerontius|Dream of Gerontius]]'', alongside [[Marie Brema]] (angel) and [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] (soul), under [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]]. In June 1900 Elgar had written to Jaeger, \"he sings both bass bits and won't they suit him. Gosh.\"<ref>Young 1956, 84.</ref> Although his recordings, and some commentators, suggest the voice was not a large one,<ref>e.g. Eaglefield-Hull 1924.</ref> it must have been capable of sustaining and projecting a considerable tone at this time, for both the ''Gerontius'' baritone solos require this. Moreover, for this most personal of his works, Elgar must have felt some real aptness in the choice.\n\n[[Arthur Somervell]]'s song-cyle, on [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s 'Maud' was originally produced (with twelve songs) in 1898 and was championed by Plunket Greene. In 1899 he married Gwendolen Maud, the youngest daughter of Hubert Parry,<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> and their first son was born in 1901. He also gave the first performance of Somervell's '[[A Shropshire Lad]]' cycle, at the [[Aeolian Hall (London)|Aeolian Hall]] on 3 February 1904, and so had the distinction of being the first to sing settings of [[Alfred Edward Housman|A. E. Housman]]'s lyrics, which afterwards became so fundamental an inspiration to the composers associated with the English song revival of that period.\n\nPlunket Greene included a selection from the ''Songs of Travel'' by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] in recital in February 1905. Then (or soon afterwards) the composer heard him and dedicated the songs to him, and Greene afterwards quoted from them, and from ''Silent Noon'' (from the ''House of Life'' cycle), in his work on ''Interpretation in Song''. Greene was responsible for establishing these songs in the English concert repertoire, where he was constantly attempting to raise the standard and quality of appreciation of English song through his programming.<ref>Rufus Hallmark, 'Robert Louis Stevenson, Ralph Vaughan Williams and their ''Songs of Travel'',' in Brian Adams and Robin Wells (Eds.), ''Vaughan Williams Essays'' Vol 44 (Ashgate Publishing, 2003), pp. 135, 138.</ref>\n\nHe supported [[Gervase Elwes]] from the start of his professional career and was his lifelong friend. At Elwes' audition for the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1903 Greene wrote to encourage him with the favourable reactions of Parry and Stanford,<ref>Elwes 1935, 127.</ref> and soon afterwards put him up for the [[Savile Club]] in London.<ref>Elwes 1935, 155.</ref> In 1906, he joined the party at [[Brigg]] to sing in the second festival there organised by Elwes and [[Percy Grainger]], and declared his wish to be in many more of them.<ref>Elwes 1935, 165.</ref> When Elwes died in 1921, Greene wrote \"I always felt he [Elwes] was the man I most looked up to.\"<ref>Elwes 1935, 281\u2013282.</ref> 'In the ''St Matthew Passion'', (he) made us feel that he of all men was best fitted to tell us the greatest story in the world.'<ref>Elwes 1935, 296\u2013297.</ref>\n\nPlunkett Greene's recordings were made first for the [[Gramophone Company]], in 1904\u20131906. He included folk-songs in his recitals, according to them the same values of diction, phrasing, rhythm, and interpretative sincerity which he brought to art-songs. In later years, as he moved into the field of song-lecturing, he did great service to the cause of British folk-music.<ref name=EaglefieldHull1924/> His last recordings were made by the electric process for [[Columbia Records]]: his late recording of 'Poor old horse' is an affecting example.\n\nOn 24 January 1910 he appeared in the memorial concert at [[Queen's Hall]] for [[August Jaeger]] (Elgar's 'Nimrod'), singing a group of songs by [[Walford Davies]], and Hans Sachs's monologue from ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg|Die Meistersinger]]''.<ref>Elkin 1944, 41.</ref> He made his first appearance in [[Henry Joseph Wood|Henry Wood]]'s [[The Proms|Promenade Concerts]] at the Queen's Hall in October 1914 singing Stanford's ''Songs of the Sea'' with the [[Alexandra Palace]] Choral Society.<ref>Wood 1946, 295: Elkin 1944, 70.</ref> He had declined to fulfil an engagement to sing them there for the ''Stock Exchange Orchestral Society'' in 1907 on hearing that they still used the high English [[Pitch (music)|Concert pitch]].<ref>Elkin 1944, 104.</ref>\n\n== Competitions and festivals, teaching ==\nIn his later years Plunket Greene was busily involved in the organisation of music events and in teaching and administration. In 1923 he made his fifteenth voyage across the Atlantic (the first had been in 1893), on this occasion to act as a judge in Musical Competitions throughout Canada. From New York he went to [[Toronto]] by train to join [[Granville Bantock]]. This was to be at the five Festivals of [[Ontario]], Manitoba, [[Saskatchewan]], Alberta and [[British Columbia]]. This was the first Ontario Festival (Toronto) (with [[Robert Watkin-Mills]] and [[Boris Hambourg]] also in attendance), the 6th in [[Winnipeg]] (with [[Herbert Witherspoon]] and [[Cecil Forsyth]] assisting), where the Earl Grey trophy was competed for, the 16th in [[Edmonton]] (Alberta), with choirs from [[Lethbridge]] and [[Calgary]], and in [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]] they were with [[Herbert Howells]]. The promotion and encouragement of these events provided not only a great spectacle and opportunity for music-making, but also infused a competitive spirit into the works of choirs, singers and instrumentalists in the award of prizes (in the tradition begun at [[Kendal]], UK in c.1889), tending to the encouragement of excellence. Plunket Greene repeated the experience in Saskatchewan in 1931, together with [[Harold Samuel]], [[Maurice Jacobson]] and Hugh Roberton.<ref>''From Blue Danube to Shannon'', Chapters II and VII.</ref>\n\nAmong those to profit from his teaching was Sir [[Keith Falkner]], whom Plunket Greene coached in his famous interpretation of the ''Lamentation of Job'' in [[Hubert Parry|Parry's]] oratorio ''Job''.<ref>Brook 1958, 76.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nPlunkett Greene married [[Gwendoline Maud Parry Greene|Gwendolen Maud Parry]], [[Hubert Parry]]\u2019s younger daughter, in 1899. The couple had three children: [[Richard Plunket Greene]] (born 1901), [[David Plunket Greene]] (born 1904) and [[Olivia Plunket Greene]] (born 1907) who never married, despite a colorful youth. The marriage was an unhappy one, however, and they separated in 1920. Plunket Greene died on 19 August 1936, aged 71.

Although the episode number count continues to increment with these episodes, they are not officially part of any season, unlike in 2017 when the Summer episodes were considered part of Season 11. Thus, this serves as an in-between series until Season 14 premieres on August 20, 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPdKxlazD0&t=21s</ref> Additionally, these Summer episodes revert to the original format of one segment plus the accompanying ''Good Mythical More'', rather than the four and three segment format used for the past two seasons (12 and 13, respectively).\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n|-\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1333\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title =Will It Slip-N-Slide?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MxgJS3LBrw&t=19s</ref> As these additional shows continue to increment the overall number of episodes and still part of Season 14, the date of the season finale listed in the ''Overview'' section above this page will be the publish date of the last additional episode, not the original date, in order to avoid confusion.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1360\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title = WILL IT NACHO?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2019. Unlike last year, the additional videos don't increment the overall number of episodes but is still part of Season 16. Thus, those episodes will not count.

Although the episode number count continues to increment with these episodes, they are not officially part of any season, unlike in 2017 when the Summer episodes were considered part of Season 11. Thus, this serves as an in-between series until Season 14 premieres on August 20, 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPdKxlazD0&t=21s</ref> Additionally, these Summer episodes revert to the original format of one segment plus the accompanying ''Good Mythical More'', rather than the four and three segment format used for the past two seasons (12 and 13, respectively).\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#2226AF; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n|-\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1333\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title =Will It Slip-N-Slide?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2018.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MxgJS3LBrw&t=19s</ref> As these additional shows continue to increment the overall number of episodes and still part of Season 14, the date of the season finale listed in the ''Overview'' section above this page will be the publish date of the last additional episode, not the original date, in order to avoid confusion.\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Guest(s)\n! style=\"background:#27435A; color: #FFFFFF\"| Release date\n{{#invoke:Episode list|list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1360\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n | Title = WILL IT NACHO?

This season also added an additional week of episodes (or additional 5 episodes) after their original season finale episode to reminisce fan favorite moments of GMM in 2019. Unlike last year, the additional videos don't increment the overall number of episodes but is still part of Season 16. Thus, those episodes will not count.

{"title_page": "Ghost (game)", "text_new": "{{about|the word game|the board game|Ghosts (board game)}}\n\n'''Ghost''' (also known as '''Ghosts''' in ''Hoyle's Rules of Games'') is a written or spoken [[word game]] in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, and usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as three or four letters. The player who completes a word loses the round and earns a \"letter\" (as in the basketball game [[Variations of basketball#H-O-R-S-E|horse]]), with players being eliminated when they have been given all five letters of the word \"ghost\".\n\nGhost can be played by two or more players of any age and requires no equipment, although it can be played with pencil and paper instead of being spoken aloud.\n\nThe player whose turn it is may--instead of adding a letter--challenge the previous player to prove that the current fragment is actually the beginning of a word. If the challenged player can name such a word, the challenger loses the round; otherwise the challenged player loses the round. If a player bluffs, or completes a word without other players noticing, then play continues. When a round ends, play generally passes to the left.\n\nIn some versions of the game, players that obtain all the letters of \"ghost\" continue to participate by trying to distract other players and turn them into ghosts. If a player does not have all the letters of the word \"ghost\" and he or she talks to an existing ghost, they immediately become a ghost.

Each fragment must be the beginning of an actual word, and usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as three or four letters. The player who completes a word loses the round and earns a \"letter\" (as in the basketball game [[Variations of basketball#H-O-R-S-E|horse]]), with players being eliminated when they have been given all five letters of the word \"ghost\".\n\nGhost can be played by two or more players of any age and requires no equipment, although it can be played with pencil and paper instead of being spoken aloud.\n\nThe player whose turn it is may--instead of adding a letter--challenge the previous player to prove that the current fragment is actually the beginning of a word. If the challenged player can name such a word, the challenger loses the round; otherwise the challenged player loses the round. If a player bluffs, or completes a word without other players noticing, then play continues. When a round ends, play generally passes to the left.\n\nIn some versions of the game, players that obtain all the letters of \"ghost\" continue to participate by trying to distract other players and turn them into ghosts. If a player does not have all the letters of the word \"ghost\" and he or she talks to an existing ghost, they immediately become a ghost. This rule serves to accelerate games of Ghost with many players.
