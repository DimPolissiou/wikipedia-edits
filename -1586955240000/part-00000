In ~Kurukuru Shuffle!~, he transforms into Usamimi Kamen with My Melody's magic. Forced to become My Melo's super hero due to his actions in the first season, he absolutely hates becoming Usamimi Kamen, as he is often apathetic and unenergetic when My Melo summons him.

Appears in ~Kurukuru Shuffle!~ and replaces his brother as Kuromi's source for the Dark Power. Jun has a crush on Uta but is rejected several times.

Jun plays the electric guitar and is always seen carrying it. He also has a butler, Sebastan, who is Sebastian's younger brother.\n\n;{{nihongo|Mana Fujisaki|\u85e4\u5d0e \u771f\u83dc|Fujisaki Mana}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuu Sugimoto]]}}\nA tomboyish red-haired girl who has been one of Uta's friends since elementary school.

Throughout the show, she is shown wearing a pink hood that also covers her ears. With adequate cooking ability, My Melody is the one who prepares meals for Uta and her family. Her nickname is My Melo. The magic that comes from her tact can only be used as an antidote to Kuromi's spell. When she waves the tact, a small heart sticker attaches to an object and brings it to life. The animated object then helps to reverse the effects of Kuromi's magic. Sometimes, the animated object won't be able to perform the specific task it needs to. My Melody will then smile at it sweetly and say, \"[object name] Onegai?\" (\"[object name] Please?\"). This causes the enchanted object's power to intensify, sometimes increasing its size. Surprisingly, even Kuromi has become one of the things Melody used her magic on which was seen in one episode. \n\nAs a very cheerful individual, My Melody is never seen angry. She can be a bit scatterbrained and oblivious to things though. She also doesn't seem to have any affections for anybody the way Kuromi and Uta have for Keiichi, although she is quite fond of Rabbit Eared Mask. To travel from place to place, My Melody uses a pink umbrella which enables her to fly. This was until Kuromi stole and used it to go to Mary Land. Since then, she started sharing with Flat's umbrella. She regains it back in the second season.\n\nShe has two magical items. The first one is the Melody Tact, which she uses to cast magic by waving it like a maestro's baton. In ~Kurukuru Shuffle!~, the Melody Tact was upgraded into the Hyper Melody Tact by the king, but in Sukkiri\u266a, it was destroyed in the final battle, making it useless, although it was repaired a short time later by the Melody Box. The second is the Heart and Star Pendant, which appeared in Onegai My Melody Kirara\u2605, My Melody uses it to do magic along with Kirara.\n\n;{{nihongo|Flat|\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8|Furatto}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Miura]]}}\nA blue mouse with yellow ears who wears an orange or pink ribbon on his tail. He is the closest among My Melody's animal friends. Whenever there's trouble, especially a curse created by Kuromi's magic, My Melody sometimes casts a spell on Flat to deal with it. There have also been hints that Flat may have a crush on My Melody, for example blushing when she hugs him in episode 6. He also asked her out on a date in episode 29. (Which at first My Melo was surprised but eventually agreed.)\n\nFlat also has great [[social skills]] when it comes to interacting with the opposite gender. With these, he occasionally gives pointers to Kakeru when trying to contact Uta in certain situations.\n\n;{{nihongo|Piano|\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce|Piano}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]]}}\nPiano is a [[sheep]] with pink [[wool]]. Behind only to Flat, she is Melody's second-closest animal friend. Though she can't actually speak, she does have talent in playing keyboards. It was hinted in Onegai My Melody Kirara\u2605 that she also has good Knitting Skills, and in the first season that she is good at writing poetry. She is also Miki's animal best friend.\n\n;{{nihongo|King|\u738b\u69d8|\u014csama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hidenobu Kiuchi]]}}\nThe Ruler of Mary Land, who's an elephant and has a crush on Kanade. Whenever he expresses affection for Uta's older sister or any other attractive woman, his wife (also an elephant) causes lightning to strike at him. Despite his goofy looks and attitude, he is very wise and magic wise, he can detect the presence of the Spirit of Dark Power.\n\n;{{nihongo|Prince Sorara|\u30bd\u30e9\u30e9\u738b\u5b50|Sorara \u014dji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]]}}\nSorara is the prince of the Star Kingdom. Thirteen years old, he came to Mary Land alongside the Wishing Star after it crashed and scattering it to a million pieces. Although he looks human, he somehow transforms into a chick-like creature, much to his dismay. He's somehow bad-mouthed and rude, though he shows his softer side when he's around Kirara. Although he's stuck in Mary Land like Kirara, he made his temporary living place in one part of the town and sometimes he causes troubles to Kirara and My Melody then helping him get home to the Stars. In the end of the series, the Wishing Star is finally repaired and finally got back home, which resulted on repairing the portal back to the Human World.\n\n==Antagonists==\n;{{nihongo|Kuromi|\u30af\u30ed\u30df|Kuromi|extra2=/}} {{nihongo|Kurumi Nui|\u30af\u30eb\u30df\u30fb\u30cc\u30a4|Kurumi Nui}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]]}}\nKuromi is My Melody's Rival, a rabbit who wears a black joker's hat with a pink skull at the center of her forehead. The skull's facial expression changes to match Kuromi's mood. Wielding a magical artifact called the Melody Key, which is infused with dark dream-corrupting powers, Kuromi is trying to collect 100 Black Notes in order to resurrect the Spirit of Dark Power, in the hopes that it will destroy her enemies, especially My Melody. Her tail is a weak point wherein she would fall unconscious if someone were to step on it or pull it. \n\nShe is an escaped prisoner from Mary Land. She was arrested but it was later revealed that Kuromi committed crimes like stealing bread in order to feed Baku's poor family. When Kuromi was on trial, Baku tried to convince the judge that he too was responsible. But Kuromi claimed that Baku was lying, so that her friend wouldn't share a similar fate. What started her grudge towards My Melo was an incident where My Melo unknowingly tore a page from her [[Diary|journal]] to wipe Piano the sheep's nose. Since then, Kuromi has been writing down on it all the mishaps and unfavorable moments that My Melo has caused her (accidentally). More than 3,000 events written (6342 exactly at the start of the series), Kuromi sometimes reads them in front of My Melo, but My Melo seems oblivious to why Kuromi's so upset over them. Whenever My Melody does something to trigger Kuromi's frothing rage, she'll read an entry from the notebook, stating the entry number and cutting away into a flashback showcasing what happened. \n\nKuromi is the leader of a biker gang known as \"Kuromi's 5.\" Other members include a purple cat named Nyanmi, a pale orange dog named Wanmi, a white fox named Konmi, and a grey and white rat named Chumi. They all wear black and drive around in a menacing fashion.\n\nJust like Uta, Kuromi has affections for Hiiragi. Her affections for him seem somewhat stronger than Uta's, however. A running gag throughout the series involves Kuromi's strange fantasy sequences involving Hiiragi and sometimes his brother, Jun. In Sukkiri, Baku makes Kuromi a dakimakura with Hiiragi's face on it. In one episode, Kuromi used the power of the Melody Key to turn herself into a human being so she could dance with him, taking the pseudonym Kurumi Nui.  Hiiragi actually seemed to be very attracted to Kurumi Nui, but, unfortunately, the spell had a Cinderella-esque effect: if Kuromi did not return to the spell-casting circle before all the magical candles blew out, she'd be turned into a tapir like Baku.  Because of this, she had to run away in the middle of dancing with Hiiragi, but he kissed her hand in farewell. In the show's opening theme prior to this episode, Kuromi is seen in the rain under a blue umbrella (Uta is usually in this part). Kuromi also turns into Kurumi Nui in episode 31 of KuruKuru Shuffle and makes an appearance in episode 36 of the first series in part of Hiiragi's dream, though she has no speaking lines.\n\nBesides being desperate, Kuromi also has a bit of a good side. On Christmas Eve, she first refused to accept the gift her parent's gave because she was still displeased on why nobody, not even them, came to visit when she was imprisoned. But with it include a letter telling that her parents still cherished her and that they even tried to come inside the dungeon but weren't permitted. Deeply touched by this, Kuromi accepted the present. She then returned to Uta whom she ignored to help earlier. Combined with My Melo's magic with some from [[Santa Claus]], Kuromi helped summoned the spirit of Uta's deceased mother (how this person died isn't known).\n\nKuromi is quite lazy, angry and a bit of a glutton, but despite her tomboyish characteristics, she's also very feminine. Kuromi shows great interest in weddings, lolita fashion, and romance novels and manga. She enjoys napping and designing wedding dresses, though Baku has stated that he doesn't like her fashion sense. Kuromi considers herself to be high-maintenance, forcing Baku and anyone she casts dark magic on to call her \"Kuromi-sama\". She often refers to herself as \"pretty devil girl Kuromi-chan\". \n\n;{{nihongo|Baku|\u30d0\u30af|Baku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Noboru Maeda]]}}\nA purple [[tapir]] and Kuromi's sidekick with the ability to fly. He, in some episodes, appears to have a crush on Kuromi, and is often victim to Kuromi's anger. Kuromi is frequently very physically abusive to him, but regardless, she truly does love him, despite the fact that they're both animals, they have a master-pet relationship. \n\nLike Kuromi, Baku has a journal where he writes down his moments with her. Hiiragi burns it in the middle of the first season, but he somehow retrieves it in the second season when they break out of jail.\n\nHis birthday is confirmed to be on February 29. His name is a bit of a pun: in Japanese, baku could mean a tapir or a [[baku (spirit)|dream-eating creature of Japanese mythology]]. In one episode he has a crush on Uta. He does appear to have a conscience. On one occasion, he was seen delivering newspapers and giving rides to children. Baku has the ability to sniff out Black Notes, and whenever a new one is obtained, Kuromi skewers it with a magical stick and Baku eats it for safekeeping.  Baku first met Kuromi at a beach in Mari Land.  Baku usually says \"Zona\" at the end of his sentences, a lot like a catchphrase which is common of anime characters.\n\n;{{nihongo|Spirit of Dark Power (Dar-chan)|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u7cbe\uff08\u30c0\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff09|D\u0101kupaw\u0101 no sei (d\u0101-chan)}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hidenobu Kiuchi]]}}\nThe [[antagonist]] of all four series. A mysterious being that is able to inhabit those who tamper with the Dark Power or have powerful dreams. Because Kuromi's too lazy to say his entire name, she shortens it to \"Dar-chan\", much to his disgust. When he possesses individuals, they often have small changes in  appearance. When he possessed Baku, he gave off a sparkly glow. When he possessed Hiiragi, he gained slightly darker appearance, gaining red eyes and darker hair. As for Jun, he gained a much stranger style of clothing and many demon features.\n\n==Cameos==\n;{{Nihongo|[[Hello Kitty]]|\u30cf\u30ed\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30a3|Har\u014d Kiti}}, the mascot for [[Sanrio]], appears in the eyecatches of the first and second anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Berry and Cherry|\u3079\u30ea\u30fc&\u30c1\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc|Ber\u012b & cher\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]] (Berry), [[Fujiko Takimoto]] (Cherry)}}\nBerry and Cherry are two demons in Mary Land living in the world called {{nihongo|'''''Lloromannic'''''|\u30eb\u30ed\u30ed\u30de\u30cb\u30c3\u30af|Ruroromanikku}}, which is the name [[Cinnamoroll]] spelled backwards.

Her nickname is My Melo. The magic that comes from her tact can only be used as an antidote to Kuromi's spell. When she waves the tact, a small heart sticker attaches to an object and brings it to life. The animated object then helps to reverse the effects of Kuromi's magic. Sometimes, the animated object won't be able to perform the specific task it needs to. My Melody will then smile at it sweetly and say, \"[object name] Onegai?\" (\"[object name] Please?\"). This causes the enchanted object's power to intensify, sometimes increasing its size. Surprisingly, even Kuromi has become one of the things Melody used her magic on which was seen in one episode. \n\nAs a very cheerful individual, My Melody is never seen angry. She can be a bit scatterbrained and oblivious to things though. She also doesn't seem to have any affections for anybody the way Kuromi and Uta have for Keiichi, although she is quite fond of Rabbit Eared Mask. To travel from place to place, My Melody uses a pink umbrella which enables her to fly. This was until Kuromi stole and used it to go to Mary Land. Since then, she started sharing with Flat's umbrella. She regains it back in the second season.\n\nShe has two magical items. The first one is the Melody Tact, which she uses to cast magic by waving it like a maestro's baton. In ~Kurukuru Shuffle!~, the Melody Tact was upgraded into the Hyper Melody Tact by the king, but in Sukkiri\u266a, it was destroyed in the final battle, making it useless, although it was repaired a short time later by the Melody Box. The second is the Heart and Star Pendant, which appeared in Onegai My Melody Kirara\u2605, My Melody uses it to do magic along with Kirara.\n\n;{{nihongo|Flat|\u30d5\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8|Furatto}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kaori Miura]]}}\nA blue mouse with yellow ears who wears an orange or pink ribbon on his tail. He is the closest among My Melody's animal friends. Whenever there's trouble, especially a curse created by Kuromi's magic, My Melody sometimes casts a spell on Flat to deal with it. There have also been hints that Flat may have a crush on My Melody, for example blushing when she hugs him in episode 6. He also asked her out on a date in episode 29. (Which at first My Melo was surprised but eventually agreed.)\n\nFlat also has great [[social skills]] when it comes to interacting with the opposite gender. With these, he occasionally gives pointers to Kakeru when trying to contact Uta in certain situations.\n\n;{{nihongo|Piano|\u30d4\u30a2\u30ce|Piano}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]]}}\nPiano is a [[sheep]] with pink [[wool]]. Behind only to Flat, she is Melody's second-closest animal friend. Though she can't actually speak, she does have talent in playing keyboards. It was hinted in Onegai My Melody Kirara\u2605 that she also has good Knitting Skills, and in the first season that she is good at writing poetry. She is also Miki's animal best friend.\n\n;{{nihongo|King|\u738b\u69d8|\u014csama}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hidenobu Kiuchi]]}}\nThe Ruler of Mary Land, who's an elephant and has a crush on Kanade. Whenever he expresses affection for Uta's older sister or any other attractive woman, his wife (also an elephant) causes lightning to strike at him. Despite his goofy looks and attitude, he is very wise and magic wise, he can detect the presence of the Spirit of Dark Power.\n\n;{{nihongo|Prince Sorara|\u30bd\u30e9\u30e9\u738b\u5b50|Sorara \u014dji}}\n:{{voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]]}}\nSorara is the prince of the Star Kingdom. Thirteen years old, he came to Mary Land alongside the Wishing Star after it crashed and scattering it to a million pieces. Although he looks human, he somehow transforms into a chick-like creature, much to his dismay. He's somehow bad-mouthed and rude, though he shows his softer side when he's around Kirara. Although he's stuck in Mary Land like Kirara, he made his temporary living place in one part of the town and sometimes he causes troubles to Kirara and My Melody then helping him get home to the Stars. In the end of the series, the Wishing Star is finally repaired and finally got back home, which resulted on repairing the portal back to the Human World.\n\n==Antagonists==\n;{{nihongo|Kuromi|\u30af\u30ed\u30df|Kuromi|extra2=/}} {{nihongo|Kurumi Nui|\u30af\u30eb\u30df\u30fb\u30cc\u30a4|Kurumi Nui}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Junko Takeuchi]]}}\nKuromi is My Melody's Rival, a rabbit who wears a black joker's hat with a pink skull at the center of her forehead. The skull's facial expression changes to match Kuromi's mood. Wielding a magical artifact called the Melody Key, which is infused with dark dream-corrupting powers, Kuromi is trying to collect 100 Black Notes in order to resurrect the Spirit of Dark Power, in the hopes that it will destroy her enemies, especially My Melody. Her tail is a weak point wherein she would fall unconscious if someone were to step on it or pull it. \n\nShe is an escaped prisoner from Mary Land. She was arrested but it was later revealed that Kuromi committed crimes like stealing bread in order to feed Baku's poor family. When Kuromi was on trial, Baku tried to convince the judge that he too was responsible. But Kuromi claimed that Baku was lying, so that her friend wouldn't share a similar fate. What started her grudge towards My Melo was an incident where My Melo unknowingly tore a page from her [[Diary|journal]] to wipe Piano the sheep's nose. Since then, Kuromi has been writing down on it all the mishaps and unfavorable moments that My Melo has caused her (accidentally). More than 3,000 events written (6342 exactly at the start of the series), Kuromi sometimes reads them in front of My Melo, but My Melo seems oblivious to why Kuromi's so upset over them. Whenever My Melody does something to trigger Kuromi's frothing rage, she'll read an entry from the notebook, stating the entry number and cutting away into a flashback showcasing what happened. \n\nKuromi is the leader of a biker gang known as \"Kuromi's 5.\" Other members include a purple cat named Nyanmi, a pale orange dog named Wanmi, a white fox named Konmi, and a grey and white rat named Chumi. They all wear black and drive around in a menacing fashion.\n\nJust like Uta, Kuromi has affections for Hiiragi. Her affections for him seem somewhat stronger than Uta's, however. A running gag throughout the series involves Kuromi's strange fantasy sequences involving Hiiragi and sometimes his brother, Jun. In Sukkiri, Baku makes Kuromi a dakimakura with Hiiragi's face on it. In one episode, Kuromi used the power of the Melody Key to turn herself into a human being so she could dance with him, taking the pseudonym Kurumi Nui.  Hiiragi actually seemed to be very attracted to Kurumi Nui, but, unfortunately, the spell had a Cinderella-esque effect: if Kuromi did not return to the spell-casting circle before all the magical candles blew out, she'd be turned into a tapir like Baku.  Because of this, she had to run away in the middle of dancing with Hiiragi, but he kissed her hand in farewell. In the show's opening theme prior to this episode, Kuromi is seen in the rain under a blue umbrella (Uta is usually in this part). Kuromi also turns into Kurumi Nui in episode 31 of KuruKuru Shuffle and makes an appearance in episode 36 of the first series in part of Hiiragi's dream, though she has no speaking lines.\n\nBesides being desperate, Kuromi also has a bit of a good side. On Christmas Eve, she first refused to accept the gift her parent's gave because she was still displeased on why nobody, not even them, came to visit when she was imprisoned. But with it include a letter telling that her parents still cherished her and that they even tried to come inside the dungeon but weren't permitted. Deeply touched by this, Kuromi accepted the present. She then returned to Uta whom she ignored to help earlier. Combined with My Melo's magic with some from [[Santa Claus]], Kuromi helped summoned the spirit of Uta's deceased mother (how this person died isn't known).\n\nKuromi is quite lazy, angry and a bit of a glutton, but despite her tomboyish characteristics, she's also very feminine. Kuromi shows great interest in weddings, lolita fashion, and romance novels and manga. She enjoys napping and designing wedding dresses, though Baku has stated that he doesn't like her fashion sense. Kuromi considers herself to be high-maintenance, forcing Baku and anyone she casts dark magic on to call her \"Kuromi-sama\". She often refers to herself as \"pretty devil girl Kuromi-chan\". \n\n;{{nihongo|Baku|\u30d0\u30af|Baku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Noboru Maeda]]}}\nA purple [[tapir]] and Kuromi's sidekick with the ability to fly. He, in some episodes, appears to have a crush on Kuromi, and is often victim to Kuromi's anger. Kuromi is frequently very physically abusive to him, but regardless, she truly does love him, despite the fact that they're both animals, they have a master-pet relationship. \n\nLike Kuromi, Baku has a journal where he writes down his moments with her. Hiiragi burns it in the middle of the first season, but he somehow retrieves it in the second season when they break out of jail.\n\nHis birthday is confirmed to be on February 29. His name is a bit of a pun: in Japanese, baku could mean a tapir or a [[baku (spirit)|dream-eating creature of Japanese mythology]]. In one episode he has a crush on Uta. He does appear to have a conscience. On one occasion, he was seen delivering newspapers and giving rides to children. Baku has the ability to sniff out Black Notes, and whenever a new one is obtained, Kuromi skewers it with a magical stick and Baku eats it for safekeeping.  Baku first met Kuromi at a beach in Mari Land.  Baku usually says \"Zona\" at the end of his sentences, a lot like a catchphrase which is common of anime characters.\n\n;{{nihongo|Spirit of Dark Power (Dar-chan)|\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u7cbe\uff08\u30c0\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff09|D\u0101kupaw\u0101 no sei (d\u0101-chan)}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Hidenobu Kiuchi]]}}\nThe [[antagonist]] of all four series. A mysterious being that is able to inhabit those who tamper with the Dark Power or have powerful dreams. Because Kuromi's too lazy to say his entire name, she shortens it to \"Dar-chan\", much to his disgust. When he possesses individuals, they often have small changes in  appearance. When he possessed Baku, he gave off a sparkly glow. When he possessed Hiiragi, he gained slightly darker appearance, gaining red eyes and darker hair. As for Jun, he gained a much stranger style of clothing and many demon features.\n\n==Cameos==\n;{{Nihongo|[[Hello Kitty]]|\u30cf\u30ed\u30fc\u30ad\u30c6\u30a3|Har\u014d Kiti}}, the mascot for [[Sanrio]], appears in the eyecatches of the first and second anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Berry and Cherry|\u3079\u30ea\u30fc&\u30c1\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc|Ber\u012b & cher\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[K\u014dki Miyata]] (Berry), [[Fujiko Takimoto]] (Cherry)}}\nBerry and Cherry are two demons in Mary Land living in the world called {{nihongo|'''''Lloromannic'''''|\u30eb\u30ed\u30ed\u30de\u30cb\u30c3\u30af|Ruroromanikku}}, which is the name [[Cinnamoroll]] spelled backwards.

It is an essential part of the infrastructure of [[health care]]. Infection control and hospital epidemiology are akin to [[public health]] practice, practiced within the confines of a particular health-care delivery system rather than directed at society as a whole.

Sterilizers may be heat only, steam, or liquid chemical.<ref name=\"miller\">{{cite book |author=Miller, Chris H. |title=Infection control and management of hazardous materials for the dental team |edition=4th |publisher=Mosby Elsevier Health Science |year=2010 |chapter=11 }}</ref>\nEffectiveness of the sterilizer (e.g., a steam autoclave) is determined in three ways.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\nFirst, mechanical indicators and gauges on the machine itself indicate proper operation of the machine. Second heat sensitive indicators or tape on the sterilizing bags change color which indicate proper levels of heat or steam. And, third (most importantly) is biological testing in which a microorganism that is highly heat and chemical resistant (often the bacterial endospore) is selected as the standard challenge. If the process kills this microorganism, the sterilizer is considered to be effective.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\n\nSterilization, if performed properly, is an effective way of preventing [[bacteria]] from spreading. It should be used for the cleaning of the medical instruments or [[gloves]], and basically any type of medical item that comes into contact with the [[blood stream]] and sterile tissues.\n\nThere are four main ways in which such items can be sterilized: [[autoclave]] (by using high-pressure [[steam]]), dry [[heat]] (in an oven), by using chemical sterilants such as glutaraldehydes or [[formaldehyde]] solutions or by [[radiation]] (with the help of physical agents). The first two are the most used methods of sterilizations mainly because of their accessibility and availability. Steam sterilization is one of the most effective types of sterilizations, if done correctly which is often hard to achieve. Instruments that are used in [[health care facilities]] are usually sterilized with this method. The general rule in this case is that in order to perform an effective sterilization, the steam must get into contact with all the surfaces that are meant to be disinfected. On the other hand, dry heat sterilization, which is performed with the help of an oven, is also an accessible type of sterilization, although it can only be used to disinfect instruments that are made of [[metal]] or [[glass]]. The very high [[temperatures]] needed to perform sterilization in this way are able to melt the instruments that are not made of glass or metal.\n\nSteam sterilization is done at a temperature of 121 C (250 F) with a pressure of 209 kPa (15&nbsp;lbs/in2). In these conditions, rubber items must be sterilized for 20 minutes, and wrapped items 134 C with pressure of 310 kPa for 7 minutes. The time is counted once the temperature that is needed has been reached. Steam sterilization requires four conditions in order to be efficient: adequate contact, sufficiently high temperature, correct time and sufficient [[moisture]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/4morerh/4ip/IP_manual/11_Sterilization.pdf |title=Sterilization |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}</ref> Sterilization using steam can also be done at a temperature of 132 C (270 F), at a double pressure. Dry heat sterilization is performed at 170 C (340 F) for one hour or two hours at a temperature of 160 C (320 F). Dry heat sterilization can also be performed at 121 C, for at least 16 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |title=Eliminating microbes |accessdate=27 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724144955/http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChemical sterilization, also referred to as cold sterilization, can be used to sterilize instruments that cannot normally be disinfected through the other two processes described above. The items sterilized with cold sterilization are usually those that can be damaged by regular sterilization. Commonly, glutaraldehydes and formaldehyde are used in this process, but in different ways. When using the first type of disinfectant, the instruments are soaked in a 2\u20134% solution for at least 10 hours while a solution of 8% formaldehyde will sterilize the items in 24 hours or more. Chemical sterilization is generally more expensive than steam sterilization and therefore it is used for instruments that cannot be disinfected otherwise. After the instruments have been soaked in the chemical solutions, they are mandatory to be rinsed with sterile water which will remove the residues from the [[disinfectants]]. This is the reason why [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] and [[syringes]] are not sterilized in this way, as the residues left by the chemical solution that has been used to disinfect them cannot be washed off with [[water]] and they may interfere with the administered treatment. Although formaldehyde is less expensive than glutaraldehydes, it is also more irritating to the [[Human eyes|eyes]], [[Human skin|skin]] and [[respiratory tract]] and is classified as a potential [[carcinogen]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\"/>\n\nOther sterilization methods exist, though their efficiency is still controversial. These methods include [[gas]], UV, [[gas plasma]], and chemical sterilization with agents such as [[peroxyacetic acid]] or [[paraformaldehyde]].\n\n===Cleaning===\nInfections can be prevented from occurring in homes as well. In order to reduce their chances to contract an infection, individuals are recommended to maintain a good hygiene by washing their hands after every contact with questionable areas or bodily fluids and by disposing of [[waste|garbage]] at regular intervals to prevent [[Microorganism|germs]] from growing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |title=Preventing infections adequately |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610065935/http://www.preventinginfection.com/ |archive-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Disinfection===\nDisinfection uses liquid chemicals on surfaces and at room temperature to kill disease causing microorganisms. Ultraviolet light has also been used to disinfect the rooms of patients infected with ''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]'' after discharge.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/performance-feedback-ultraviolet-cleaning-device-and-dedicated-housekeeping-team |title=Performance feedback, ultraviolet cleaning device, and dedicated housekeeping team significantly improve room cleaning, reduce potential for spread of common, dangerous infection |date=2014-01-15 | accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref> Disinfection is less effective than sterilization because it does not kill bacterial endospores.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\n\n===Personal protective equipment===\n[[File:Disp-med-ppe.jpg|thumb|120px|Disposable PPE]]\n[[Personal protective equipment|Personal protective equipment (PPE)]] is specialized clothing or equipment worn by a worker for protection against a hazard. The hazard in a health care setting is exposure to blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids or aerosols that may carry infectious materials such as [[Hepatitis C]], [[HIV]], or other blood borne or bodily fluid [[pathogen]]. PPE prevents contact with a potentially infectious material by creating a physical barrier between the potential infectious material and the healthcare worker.<ref>Khalid M. \"Infection Prevention and Control: General Principles and Role of Microbiology Laboratory\".

Many or most of these items are [[disposable]] to avoid carrying infectious materials from one patient to another patient and to avoid difficult or costly [[disinfection]]. In the US, OSHA requires the immediate removal and disinfection or disposal of a worker's PPE prior to leaving the work area where exposure to infectious material took place.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10051#1910.1030(d)(2)(i) |publisher=[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] |title=Bloodborne Pathogens Regulations |at=1910.1030(d)(3)(vii)}}</ref>\n\nThe inappropriate use of PPE equipment such as gloves, has been linked to an increase in rates of the transmission of infection,<ref>https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/infection-control/does-glove-use-increase-the-risk-of-infection-19-09-2014/</ref> and the use of such must be compatible with the other particular hand hygiene agents used.<ref>https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/hand-hygiene/hand-hygiene-and-glove-issues</ref>\n\n===Antimicrobial surfaces===\n[[Microorganisms]] are known to survive on non-antimicrobial inanimate \u2018touch\u2019 surfaces (e.g., bedrails, over-the-bed trays, call buttons, bathroom hardware, etc.) for extended periods of time.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wilks SA |author2=Michels H |author3=Keevil CW |year=2005 |title=The survival of Escherichia coli O157 on a range of metal surfaces |journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=445\u2013454 |pmid=16253366 |doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.04.021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Michels HT |title=Anti-microbial characteristics of copper |journal=ASTM Standardization News |date=October 2006 |pages=28\u201331}}</ref> This can be especially troublesome in hospital environments where patients with [[immunodeficiencies]] are at enhanced risk for contracting nosocomial infections.\n\n{{main|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}\n\nProducts made with [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antimicrobial copper alloy]] ([[brass]]es, [[bronze]]s, [[cupronickel]], copper-nickel-zinc, and others) surfaces destroy a wide range of microorganisms in a short period of time.<ref name=\"Copper Touch Surfaces\">{{cite web |url=http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html |title=Copper touch surfaces |publisher=coppertouchsurfaces.org |access-date=30 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723235812/http://www.coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html |archive-date=23 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}{{medrs|date=September 2014}}</ref>\nThe [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has approved the registration of 355 different [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antimicrobial copper alloys]] and one synthetic copper-infused hard surface that kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' O157:H7, [[methicillin]]-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]), ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''Enterobacter aerogenes,'' and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in less than 2 hours of contact.

Determining the presence of a hospital acquired  infection requires an infection control practitioner (ICP) to review a patient's chart and see if the patient had the signs and symptom of an infection. Surveillance definitions exist for infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, pneumonia, surgical sites and gastroenteritis.\n\nSurveillance traditionally involved significant manual data assessment and entry in order to assess preventative actions such as isolation of patients with an infectious disease. Increasingly, computerized software solutions are becoming available that assess incoming risk messages from microbiology and other online sources. By reducing the need for data entry, software can reduce the data workload of ICPs, freeing them to concentrate on clinical surveillance.\n\nAs of 1998, approximately one third of healthcare acquired infections were preventable.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/3/98-0320 |publisher=CDC |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=September 1998 |author=Weinstein RA |title=Nosocomial Infection Update | doi = 10.3201/eid0403.980320 |pages=416\u2013420|pmc=2640303 |pmid=9716961 }}</ref> Surveillance and preventative activities are increasingly a priority for hospital staff.

Various forms of [[Isolation (health care)|isolation ]] exist, and are applied depending on the type of infection and agent involved, and its route of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission ]], to address the likelihood of spread via airborne particles or droplets, by direct skin contact, or via contact with body fluids.\n\nIn cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the [[incubation period]] has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, when needing to control an [[epidemic]].<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/panflu_ethic_guidelines.pdf Kathy Kinlaw, Robert Levine, \"Ethical Guidelines on Pandemic Influenza,\" ''CDC'', December 2006]</ref>\n\n==Outbreak investigation==\nWhen an unusual cluster of illness is noted, infection control teams undertake an investigation to determine whether there is a true [[disease outbreak]], a pseudo-outbreak (a result of contamination within the diagnostic testing process), or just random fluctuation in the frequency of illness.  If a true outbreak is discovered, infection control practitioners try to determine what permitted the outbreak to occur, and to rearrange the conditions to prevent ongoing propagation of the infection.  Often, breaches in good practice are responsible, although sometimes other factors (such as construction) may be the source of the problem.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Disease_outbreak#Outbreak_investigation|Outbreaks investigations]] have more than a single purpose. These investigations are carried out in order to prevent additional cases in the current outbreak, prevent future outbreaks, learn about a new disease or learn something new about an old disease. Reassuring the public, minimizing the economic and social disruption as well as teaching [[epidemiology]] are some other obvious objectives of outbreak investigations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|title=Conducting an Outbreak Investigation|accessdate=2010-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331173846/http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[WHO]], outbreak investigations are meant to detect what is causing the outbreak, how the pathogenic agent is transmitted, where it all started from, what is the carrier, what is the population at risk of getting infected and what are the risk factors.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Training in infection control and health care epidemiology==\nPractitioners can come from several different educational streams. Many begin as nurses, some as medical technologists (particularly in clinical microbiology), and some as physicians (typically infectious disease specialists). Specialized training in infection control and health care epidemiology are offered by the professional organizations described below. Physicians who desire to become infection control practitioners often are trained in the context of an infectious disease fellowship.\n\nIn the United States, Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology is a private company that certifies infection control practitioners based on their educational background and professional experience, in conjunction with testing their knowledge base with standardized exams. The credential awarded is CIC, Certification in Infection Control and Epidemiology.  It is recommended that one has 2 years of Infection Control experience before applying for the exam.

Sterilizers may be heat only, steam, or liquid chemical.<ref name=\"miller\">{{cite book |author=Miller, Chris H. |title=Infection control and management of hazardous materials for the dental team |edition=4th |publisher=Mosby Elsevier Health Science |year=2010 |chapter=11 }}</ref>\nEffectiveness of the sterilizer (e.g., a steam autoclave) is determined in three ways.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\nFirst, mechanical indicators and gauges on the machine itself indicate proper operation of the machine. Second heat sensitive indicators or tape on the sterilizing bags change color which indicate proper levels of heat or steam. And, third (most importantly) is biological testing in which a microorganism that is highly heat and chemical resistant (often the bacterial endospore) is selected as the standard challenge. If the process kills this microorganism, the sterilizer is considered to be effective.<ref name=\"miller\"/>\n\nSterilization, if performed properly, is an effective way of preventing [[bacteria]] from spreading. It should be used for the cleaning of the medical instruments or [[gloves]], and basically any type of medical item that comes into contact with the [[blood stream]] and sterile tissues.\n\nThere are four main ways in which such items can be sterilized: [[autoclave]] (by using high-pressure [[steam]]), dry [[heat]] (in an oven), by using chemical sterilants such as glutaraldehydes or [[formaldehyde]] solutions or by [[radiation]] (with the help of physical agents). The first two are the most used methods of sterilizations mainly because of their accessibility and availability. Steam sterilization is one of the most effective types of sterilizations, if done correctly which is often hard to achieve. Instruments that are used in [[health care facilities]] are usually sterilized with this method. The general rule in this case is that in order to perform an effective sterilization, the steam must get into contact with all the surfaces that are meant to be disinfected. On the other hand, dry heat sterilization, which is performed with the help of an oven, is also an accessible type of sterilization, although it can only be used to disinfect instruments that are made of [[metal]] or [[glass]]. The very high [[temperatures]] needed to perform sterilization in this way are able to melt the instruments that are not made of glass or metal.\n\nSteam sterilization is done at a temperature of 121 C (250 F) with a pressure of 209 kPa (15&nbsp;lbs/in2). In these conditions, rubber items must be sterilized for 20 minutes, and wrapped items 134 C with pressure of 310 kPa for 7 minutes. The time is counted once the temperature that is needed has been reached. Steam sterilization requires four conditions in order to be efficient: adequate contact, sufficiently high temperature, correct time and sufficient [[moisture]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\">{{cite web |url=http://www.reproline.jhu.edu/english/4morerh/4ip/IP_manual/11_Sterilization.pdf |title=Sterilization |date= |accessdate=27 July 2010 }}</ref> Sterilization using steam can also be done at a temperature of 132 C (270 F), at a double pressure. Dry heat sterilization is performed at 170 C (340 F) for one hour or two hours at a temperature of 160 C (320 F). Dry heat sterilization can also be performed at 121 C, for at least 16 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |title=Eliminating microbes |accessdate=27 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724144955/http://www.mansfield.ohio-state.edu/~sabedon/black12.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChemical sterilization, also referred to as cold sterilization, can be used to sterilize instruments that cannot normally be disinfected through the other two processes described above. The items sterilized with cold sterilization are usually those that can be damaged by regular sterilization. Commonly, glutaraldehydes and formaldehyde are used in this process, but in different ways. When using the first type of disinfectant, the instruments are soaked in a 2\u20134% solution for at least 10 hours while a solution of 8% formaldehyde will sterilize the items in 24 hours or more. Chemical sterilization is generally more expensive than steam sterilization and therefore it is used for instruments that cannot be disinfected otherwise. After the instruments have been soaked in the chemical solutions, they are mandatory to be rinsed with sterile water which will remove the residues from the [[disinfectants]]. This is the reason why [[Hypodermic needle|needles]] and [[syringes]] are not sterilized in this way, as the residues left by the chemical solution that has been used to disinfect them cannot be washed off with [[water]] and they may interfere with the administered treatment. Although formaldehyde is less expensive than glutaraldehydes, it is also more irritating to the [[Human eyes|eyes]], [[Human skin|skin]] and [[respiratory tract]] and is classified as a potential [[carcinogen]].<ref name=\"Sterilization\"/>\n\nOther sterilization methods exist, though their efficiency is still controversial.

Determining the presence of a hospital acquired  infection requires an infection control practitioner (ICP) to review a patient's chart and see if the patient had the signs and symptom of an infection. Surveillance definitions exist for infections of the bloodstream, urinary tract, pneumonia, surgical sites and gastroenteritis.\n\nSurveillance traditionally involved significant manual data assessment and entry in order to assess preventative actions such as isolation of patients with an infectious disease. Increasingly, computerized software solutions are becoming available that assess incoming risk messages from microbiology and other online sources. By reducing the need for data entry, software can reduce the data workload of ICPs, freeing them to concentrate on clinical surveillance.\n\nAs of 1998, approximately one third of healthcare acquired infections were preventable.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/3/98-0320 |publisher=CDC |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=September 1998 |author=Weinstein RA |title=Nosocomial Infection Update | doi = 10.3201/eid0403.980320 |pages=416\u2013420|pmc=2640303 |pmid=9716961 }}</ref> Surveillance and preventative activities are increasingly a priority for hospital staff.

Various forms of [[Isolation (health care)|isolation ]] exist, and are applied depending on the type of infection and agent involved, and its route of [[Transmission (medicine)|transmission ]], to address the likelihood of spread via airborne particles or droplets, by direct skin contact, or via contact with body fluids.\n\nIn cases where infection is merely suspected, individuals may be [[quarantined]] until the incubation period has passed and the disease manifests itself or the person remains healthy. Groups may undergo quarantine, or in the case of communities, a [[cordon sanitaire]] may be imposed to prevent infection from spreading beyond the community, or in the case of [[protective sequestration]], into a community. Public health authorities may implement other forms of [[social distancing]], such as school closings, when needing to control an [[epidemic]].<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/od/science/integrity/phethics/docs/panflu_ethic_guidelines.pdf Kathy Kinlaw, Robert Levine, \"Ethical Guidelines on Pandemic Influenza,\" ''CDC'', December 2006]</ref>\n\n==Outbreak investigation==\nWhen an unusual cluster of illness is noted, infection control teams undertake an investigation to determine whether there is a true [[disease outbreak]], a pseudo-outbreak (a result of contamination within the diagnostic testing process), or just random fluctuation in the frequency of illness.  If a true outbreak is discovered, infection control practitioners try to determine what permitted the outbreak to occur, and to rearrange the conditions to prevent ongoing propagation of the infection.  Often, breaches in good practice are responsible, although sometimes other factors (such as construction) may be the source of the problem.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Disease_outbreak#Outbreak_investigation|Outbreaks investigations]] have more than a single purpose. These investigations are carried out in order to prevent additional cases in the current outbreak, prevent future outbreaks, learn about a new disease or learn something new about an old disease. Reassuring the public, minimizing the economic and social disruption as well as teaching [[epidemiology]] are some other obvious objectives of outbreak investigations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|title=Conducting an Outbreak Investigation|accessdate=2010-07-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331173846/http://www.idready.org/slides/03outbreak-slides.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[WHO]], outbreak investigations are meant to detect what is causing the outbreak, how the pathogenic agent is transmitted, where it all started from, what is the carrier, what is the population at risk of getting infected and what are the risk factors.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Training in infection control and health care epidemiology==\nPractitioners can come from several different educational streams. Many begin as nurses, some as medical technologists (particularly in clinical microbiology), and some as physicians (typically infectious disease specialists). Specialized training in infection control and health care epidemiology are offered by the professional organizations described below. Physicians who desire to become infection control practitioners often are trained in the context of an infectious disease fellowship.\n\nIn the United States, Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology is a private company that certifies infection control practitioners based on their educational background and professional experience, in conjunction with testing their knowledge base with standardized exams. The credential awarded is CIC, Certification in Infection Control and Epidemiology.  It is recommended that one has 2 years of Infection Control experience before applying for the exam.

The current [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] palace was completed in 1818.\n\nThroughout its history the palace was a venue for important historical events in Polish, European and world history. In 1791, the facility hosted authors and advocates of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], the first modern European constitution. In 1818, the palace began its ongoing career as a governmental structure, when it became the seat of the Viceroy ([[Namiestnik of the Kingdom of Poland|''namiestnik'']]) of [[Congress Poland]]. Following Poland's resurrection after [[World War I]], in 1918, the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities and became the seat of the Council of Ministers. During World War II, it served the country's [[Germany|German]] occupiers as a ''Deutsches Haus'' and survived intact the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. After the war, it resumed its function as seat of the Polish Council of Ministers. On 14 May 1955, the [[Warsaw Pact]] was signed inside the Presidential Palace between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Bloc countries]]. Since July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland.\n\n==History==\nConstruction of the present-day Presidential Palace in Warsaw was begun in 1643 by Crown Great [[Hetman]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski]], owner of the town of [[Brody]] (80&nbsp;km. east of [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and of numerous ''[[latifundia]]'' situated in Poland's eastern borderlands; hence the palace's first name was \"''Pa\u0142ac Koniecpolskich''\"\u2014the \"[[Koniecpolski]] Palace\".<ref name=\"eguide\">{{in lang|en}} {{cite web |author = |url = http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=101&dz_id=12 |title = Presidential Palace |work = eGuide / Treasures of Warsaw on-line |publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> It was said that he owned so much landed property that he could cross the breadth of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] while spending every night in one of his own manors.

He leased out the palace to Franciszek Ryx to house a theater which staged plays and threw masked balls. During the [[Sejm Wielki|Four-Year Sejm]] of 1788-1792, he invited all the members of the four deliberating estates to dine there daily. Two meals were served every day: breakfast before the day's session, for 300 people, and dinner after the session. One of the most impressive feasts given by him was on St. Catherine's Day, November 25, 1789, the 25th anniversary of [[Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski, King of Poland|King Stanis\u0142aw August]]'s coronation, and commemorating [[Polish-Lithuanian Union|the Union]] of [[Lithuania]] with the [[Polish Crown]].

The first Viceroy, from 1815, was [[J\u00f3zef Zaj\u0105czek]] (1752\u20131820), former aide-de-champ to Hetman [[Franciszek Ksawery Branicki]], deputy to the Four-year Sejm, secretary of the [[Friends of the Constitution]] (i.e., of the [[May 3rd Constitution]]), a division commander during the Polish-Russian War of 1792, hero of the Battle of Ziele\u0144ce, a Polish [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]], a soldier in [[Jan Henryk D\u0105browski]]'s legions, a general of [[Napoleon]]'s. At the last he adopted a servile attitude toward [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], King of Poland and Tsar of Russia, who created him a duke in 1818. Zaj\u0105czek had lost a leg at the [[Berezina River]] and was carried about by his valets in an armchair.\n\n[[Image:2 Palac Prezydencki 33.jpg|thumb|Grand staircase]]\n\nBeginning in 1818 the palace was rebuilt in classicist style by the architect [[Chrystian Piotr Aigner]] (1756\u20131841).<ref name=\"eguide\" /> He extended the palace (its lower wings reached the line of buildings on [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]), placed a new grand staircase between the main body of the building and its northern wing, remodeled the palace facades, and redecorated the rooms on the first and second floors of the main body of the building. Because of its massive vaulting, the ground floor remained unchanged. Aigner had two associates: Camillo Landini, who sculpted the four stone lions guarding the palace courtyard on the Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie side, and Miko\u0142aj Monti, an Italian painter. The main body of the building was remodeled to the [[Corinthian order]] and ornamented with [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s, [[balustrade]] and stone [[statue]]s. Aigner is inseparably linked with the Viceregal (Polish: ''Namiestnikowski'') \u2014 today, Presidential\u2014Palace as the creator of its classicist exterior, which survives unchanged to this day.\n\nThe year 1852 brought disaster to the palace. A fire burned the main body of the building almost to the ground. Only charred walls remained. Reconstruction was entrusted to Alfons Kropiwnicki (1803\u20131881). The reconstruction of the palace was completed in 1856. The palace obtained the same architectural exterior as before the fire, but the interior was enriched with new decorative elements. The author of the room decorations was Boles\u0142aw Podczaszy\u0144ski.\n\n[[Image:Koniecpolski Palace.jpg|thumb|left|Viceregal Palace, with statue of [[Ivan Paskevich]], before 1900]]\n\nIn the rebuilt palace, gatherings of the Agricultural Society were held, and balls were organized when the tsars visited Poland. In 1870, a statue of [[Ivan Paskevich]] was unveiled there. In 1879, in the palace's colonnade hall, the inhabitants of Warsaw for the first time saw \"The [[Battle of Grunwald]]\", a historical painting by [[Jan Matejko]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Tarnowski Palace to the right (south) of the building was pulled down, and in 1899-1901 the luxurious [[Hotel Bristol in Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]] was built in its place, designed by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Marconi. One of the shareholders in the consortium that built the hotel was the famous pianist and post-World War I Polish prime minister, [[Ignacy Paderewski]].\n\nIn 1918 the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities, and renovation of the palace was entrusted to Marian Lalewicz. The building became the official seat of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (the Prime Minister) and of the Council of Ministers itself. The side wings housed the chancellery offices of the Council of Ministers. As restored by Lalewicz, the building was greatly admired by Warsaw's inhabitants and visitors. Germany's [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], when in February 1937 calling there on Prime Minister General [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]], took such a keen interest in the palace that he arrived late to his meeting with Polish Foreign Minister [[J\u00f3zef Beck]].\n\n[[File:Pomnik Ksi\u0119cia J\u00f3zefa Poniatowskiego w Warszawie 2019.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Equestrian statue]] of Prince [[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]]]]\n\nIn 1939 the palace suffered minimal damage. In 1941-1942 it was radically reconstructed into a ''Deutsches Haus'' by the Polish architects Janusz Nagorski and Jan Lukasik. In the course of the work, [[rococo]] ornamentation in the rooms overlooking the garden was renovated with great care. A couple of ''[[grisaille]]'' paintings were uncovered on the staircase, featuring eagle and weapon motifs. The Germans wanted to remove the eagles as Polish national emblems, but allowed them to remain after it was explained that these were Napoleonic eagles, a favorite motif of the French Empire period. On the ground floor of the right wing, a restaurant was put in, with wooden beam ceiling and a spacious cloakroom. The palace survived the [[Warsaw Uprising]] intact.\n\nAfter Warsaw's liberation, the palace was thoroughly reconstructed by Antoni Brusche and Antoni Jawornicki. In 1965 [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s classicist equestrian statue of Prince [[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]], which previously had stood before the now destroyed Polish General Staff building (the \"[[Saxon Palace]]\") on nearby [[Pi\u0142sudski Square]] (once known as \"[[Saxon Square]]\"), was relocated to the courtyard before the \"Viceroy's Palace.\"\n\nAfter World War II, the palace again served as the seat of the [[Council of Ministers of Poland|Council of Ministers]] until the latter moved to its current seat at the [[Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland|Chancellery]] on [[Ujazd\u00f3w Avenue]].\n\nSince July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the [[List of Presidents of Poland|President of the Republic of Poland]]<ref name=\"eguide\" /> replacing the smaller [[Belweder]] palace.  However, President [[Bronislaw Komorowski]] decided to move the residence back to Belweder, purportedly in honor of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and the early presidents of Poland, but the move was understood as an attempt to avoid confrontations with mourners of the late President, [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]], who was killed in an April 2010 air crash at [[Smolensk]], [[Russia]].\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"margin:2px auto; text-align:center\">\nImage:2 Palac Prezydencki 19.jpg|<center>Column Hall</center>\nImage:Palac_Prezydencki2.jpg|<center>Drawing Room</center>\nImage:POL palac prezydencki sala biala.jpg|<center>White Room</center>\nImage:POL palac prezydencki sala rokoko.jpg|<center>[[Rococo]] Room</center>\nImage:Sala Niebieska Pa\u0142ac Prezydencki w Warszawie.JPG|<center>The Blue Hall</center>\nImage:POL palac prezydencki jadalnia.jpg|<center>Dining Room</center>\nImage:Kaplica Pa\u0142ac Prezydencki.JPG|<center>Chapel</center>\nImage:POL palac prezydencki gabinet prezydenta.jpg|<center>President's Office</center>\nImage:POL palac prezydencki sala hetmanska.jpg|<center>Hetman's Room</center>\nImage:Presidental Palace in night illumination.jpg|<center>Illumination</center>\nImage:Palac_Prezydencki5.jpg|<center>Garden</center>\nImage:POL palac prezydencki oranzeria.jpg|<center>[[Orangery]]</center>\nImage:PalacPrezydencki(1).JPG|<center>A lion sculpture by Camillo Landini</center>\nImage:PilsPlac15 DSC0874.JPG|<center>Plaque commemorating [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]]'s first performance on 24 February 1818</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Monument to Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski in Warsaw]]\n* [[Pa\u0142ac Potockich|Potocki Palace]]\n* [[Carmelite Church, Warsaw|Carmelite Church]]\n* [[Cross in front of Presidential Palace in Warsaw]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Presidential Palace in Warsaw}}\n* {{in lang|pl}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20061205232232/http://wirtualnepodroze.dziennik.pl/palac_prezydencki/index.html Virtual Tour]\n\n{{Warsaw landmarks}}\n{{coord|52|14|34|N|21|00|57|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Palaces in Warsaw]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1643]]\n[[Category:Neoclassical architecture in Warsaw]]\n[[Category:Official residences in Poland]]\n[[Category:Presidential residences]]\n[[Category:1643 establishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n[[Category:Castles and palaces of the Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox building\n|image=Poland-00741 - Palace Prezydencki (31071435322).jpg\n|caption=[[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s [[Monument to Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski in Warsaw|statue]] of Prince [[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]] in front of the Presidential Palace\n|name=Presidential Palace\n|location_town=[[Warsaw]]\n|location_country=[[Poland]]\n|architect=[[Chrystian Piotr Aigner]] (1818)\n|client=[[Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski]] (1643)\n|address=[[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]] 46/48\n|construction_start_date=1643\n|completion_date=\n|date_demolished=\n|cost=\n|structural_system=\n|style=[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] (1818)\n|owner=[[Government of Poland]]\n}}\nThe '''Presidential Palace''' ([[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Pa\u0142ac Prezydencki'') is the official residence of the Polish [[Presidents of Poland|head of state and president]] alongside the [[Belweder Palace]], located in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]]. Originally constructed in 1643 as an aristocratic mansion, it was rebuilt and remodelled several times over the course of its existence by notable architects. The current [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] palace was completed in 1818.\n\nThroughout its history the palace was a venue for important historical events in Polish, European and world history. In 1791, the facility hosted authors and advocates of the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]], the first modern European constitution. In 1818, the palace began its ongoing career as a governmental structure, when it became the seat of the Viceroy ([[Namiestnik of the Kingdom of Poland|''namiestnik'']]) of [[Congress Poland]]. Following Poland's resurrection after [[World War I]], in 1918, the building was taken over by the newly reconstituted Polish authorities and became the seat of the Council of Ministers. During World War II, it served the country's [[Germany|German]] occupiers as a ''Deutsches Haus'' and survived intact the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. After the war, it resumed its function as seat of the Polish Council of Ministers. On 14 May 1955, the [[Warsaw Pact]] was signed inside the Presidential Palace between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Bloc countries]]. Since July 1994, the palace has been the official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland.\n\n==History==\nConstruction of the present-day Presidential Palace in Warsaw was begun in 1643 by Crown Great [[Hetman]] [[Stanis\u0142aw Koniecpolski]], owner of the town of [[Brody]] (80&nbsp;km. east of [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and of numerous ''[[latifundia]]'' situated in Poland's eastern borderlands; hence the palace's first name was \"''Pa\u0142ac Koniecpolskich''\"\u2014the \"[[Koniecpolski]] Palace\".<ref name=\"eguide\">{{in lang|en}} {{cite web |author = |url = http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=101&dz_id=12 |title = Presidential Palace |work = eGuide / Treasures of Warsaw on-line |publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 2008-07-24}}</ref> It was said that he owned so much landed property that he could cross the breadth of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] while spending every night in one of his own manors. The palace was not completed in the Hetman's lifetime, as he died unexpectedly in 1646 at his Brody residence, a few weeks after taking a young wife.\n\n[[File:Koniecpolski Palace by Dahlberg 1656.jpg|thumb|left|Koniecpolski Palace in 1656; it was burned down during the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]]]\n\nThe palace's architect was [[Constantino Tencalla]], architect to Poland's King [[Wladislaus IV of Poland|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] and designer of [[King Zygmunt's Column]], in front of the nearby Royal Castle, commemorating [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III of Poland]]. The palace was completed by Koniecpolski's son [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander]] in the style of a [[baroque]] residence, imitating those of northern Italy and [[Genoa]]. A view of the palace in a Warsaw panorama of 1656<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070220225552/http://www.zamek-krolewski.com.pl/awc131.htm ''The Eagle and Three Crowns'']</ref> by [[Erik Dahlberg]] confirms this.\n\nThe next owner of the palace was [[Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski]]\u2014Grand Crown Hetman and Crown Chancellor, and later the leader of [[Rokosz of Lubomirski|a rebellion against the king]]\u2014who bought the palace from [[Aleksander Koniecpolski (1620-1659)|Aleksander Koniecpolski]].\n\nIn 1674 the palace became, for the next 144 years, the property of the [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] family.\n\nIt was bought from descendants of Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski \u2014 [[Stanis\u0142aw Herakliusz Lubomirski]] and [[Hieronim Augustyn Lubomirski]] \u2014 by [[Micha\u0142 Kazimierz Radziwi\u0142\u0142]] of the [[Nie\u015bwie\u017c]]\u2013[[O\u0142yka]] line, whose wife [[Katarzyna Sobieska|Katarzyna]] was a sister of King [[Jan III Sobieski]].

He entrusted this task to the king's architect, Augustyn Locci.\n\n[[File:Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Palace Warsaw 1762.jpg|thumb|Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Palace in 1762]]\n\nThe next-to-last heir in tail of [[Nie\u015bwie\u017c]] and [[O\u0142yka]] was [[Karol Stanis\u0142aw \"Panie Kochanku\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], [[Vilnius Voivodeship|Voivode of Vilnius]], son of [[Micha\u0142 Kazimierz \"Rybe\u0144ko\" Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. He had inherited huge estates from his father and uncle which made him the wealthiest [[magnate]] in Poland in the second half of the 18th century, and one of the richest men in Europe. He leased out the palace to Franciszek Ryx to house a theater which staged plays and threw masked balls. During the [[Sejm Wielki|Four-Year Sejm]] of 1788-1792, he invited all the members of the four deliberating estates to dine there daily. Two meals were served every day: breakfast before the day's session, for 300 people, and dinner after the session. One of the most impressive feasts given by him was on St. Catherine's Day, November 25, 1789, the 25th anniversary of [[Stanislaus II Augustus Poniatowski, King of Poland|King Stanis\u0142aw August]]'s coronation, and commemorating [[Polish-Lithuanian Union|the Union]] of [[Lithuania]] with the [[Polish Crown]]. Four thousand guests were invited, and the feast cost over 2 million [[z\u0142oty]]s.\n\n[[Image:Bellotto Carmelite Church in Warsaw.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carmelite Church, Warsaw|Carmelite Church]] and Radziwi\u0142\u0142 Palace (right) in 1780, painting by [[Bernardo Bellotto]]]]\n\nOn the night of May 2\u20143, 1791, a conspiratorial group of members of the Four-Year Sejm who were bent on saving the Commonwealth met at the palace to strategize means to secure the adoption, next day, of the [[May 3rd Constitution]].

Modern Talking's sound; however, was rather different from their original 1980s sound after their reunion. The duo came back in 1998 switching from their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to 1990s uptempo Eurodance sound, which was in high demand in central Europe at the time.\n\nModern Talking, throughout their existence, have released 20 singles, 12 studio-albums, 17 international compilation-albums and two video albums containing their hit-videos.\nGlobal sales of Modern Talking, after the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, had reached 120 million singles and albums combined, making them the biggest-selling German music act in history.\n\n==Albums==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The duo have released their materials over a period of two separate time tables, first between 1984-1987, then the duo found itself reunified in 1998 and made a successful comeback releasing another batch of materials between 1998-2003. Modern Talking's sound; however, was rather different from their original 1980s sound after their reunion. The duo came back in 1998 switching from their original 1980s mellow Europop sound to 1990s uptempo Eurodance sound, which was in high demand in central Europe at the time.\n\nModern Talking, throughout their existence, have released 20 singles, 12 studio-albums, 17 international compilation-albums and two video albums containing their hit-videos.\nGlobal sales of Modern Talking, after the duo's second and final break-up in 2003, had reached 120 million singles and albums combined, making them the biggest-selling German music act in history.\n\n==Albums==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
