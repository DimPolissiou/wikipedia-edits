In 2011 Taskmaster got his first solo graphic novel collecting a four-issue story\u2014''Taskmaster: Unthinkable''.\n\nFollowing [[Marvel NOW!]], Taskmaster joined a new team of Secret Avengers.<ref name=\"CBTaskmaster\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/07/22/black-widow-who-is-taskmaster/|title=Black Widow: Who Is Taskmaster?|last=Lovett|first=Jamie|website=Comicbook|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723140950/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/07/22/black-widow-who-is-taskmaster/|archivedate=July 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2018}}\nTaskmaster is a mysterious figure believed to have been born in [[Brooklyn, New York City]]. He has the ability to mimic the physical movements of anyone he witnesses; writers differ on whether this counts as a \"super power\". He claims that he has had this ability since childhood. He works as a combat instructor and trains others to become lackeys for other villains by utilizing the techniques he has learned from his observation of superheroes and participates in mercenary jobs from time to time. Initially portrayed as a villain, he has also been shown training [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] and other neophyte superheroes at the behest of the US government. As a mercenary, he has no ideology except that of his employer. Due to his ability to imitate the techniques and armory of other heroes and villains, Taskmaster has occasionally been used to impersonate other characters.\n\nTony Masters first demonstrated unusual abilities during childhood. After watching a cowboy show on television, he found himself able to duplicate the sophisticated rope tricks he had just watched the cowboy perform. Psychiatrists, called in at the mother's request, determined that the boy had a form of [[photographic memory]] which they called \"photographic reflexes\". He employed his power several times during his youth for personal gain, most notably when he became a star quarterback of his high school football team after watching one pro football game. Upon graduation, he briefly considered a career as a crime fighter, but opted instead to be a professional criminal, which he perceived to be far more lucrative.<ref name=\"Av196\">''Avengers'' #196. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of numerous costumed heroes and villains (using archival television news broadcasts). He initially used his fighting skills to execute several successful grand larcenies, but he had not properly anticipated the dangers involved. He decided to use his stolen capital to establish a center for training aspiring criminals to turn into polished professionals. His goal was to become a supplier for criminal organizations around the world.\n\nDesigning a costume with a white cowl and skull mask, he took the name \"Taskmaster\" and began to train many thugs at criminal academies he had located around the United States. However, his existence was eventually revealed when Pernell Solomon of the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane (a front for one of these academies) used the school's resources to create a clone of himself when the administrator required an organ donation due to possessing an extremely rare blood type; the clone (learning of this fate) managed to contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Taskmaster captured [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] when the Avengers invaded the premises;<ref>''Avengers'' #195. Marvel Comics.</ref> but the Avengers followed, exposing his front operation. Taskmaster held his own against [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]], however, was subsequently forced to flee after a confrontation with [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] since his lack of experience with Jocasta's abilities made it impossible to predict the robot's next move.<ref name=\"Av196\"/> Taskmaster later established a new training academy in Manhattan, where he battled [[Spider-Man]] and Ant-Man, and then escaped.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later used a traveling carnival as a mobile base, where he battled [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and Ant-Man, and then escaped again.<ref>''Avengers'' #223. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next trained henchmen for the Black Abbott. Alongside Black Abbott, he battled Spider-Man and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], and escaped yet again.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #146. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDeciding to further explore the use of a circus as a front for his academy, Taskmaster took over yet another small outfit, and used it for many months to great success. However, while it was playing a small town in Ohio, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Vance Astrovik]] (who would later take the name Justice) assisted a government agent in foiling Taskmaster's activities. While escaping, Taskmaster was captured by a group of U.S. Secret Service agents and taken into custody.<ref>''The Thing'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> There is reason to believe that [[Red Skull]] was behind the Taskmaster's capture, since a group of normal men were able to capture him.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Through Douglas Rockwell (the head of the President's [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]]), Mr. Smith arranged for Taskmaster to train John Walker in order to make him appear to be the real Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #334. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to conceal Red Skull's involvement, Rockwell had the Commission work out a deal to have years taken off Taskmaster's sentence in return for training Walker. After Taskmaster successfully trained Walker, Red Skull arranged for him to escape from the Commission's detention center so he could continue training lackeys and Red Skull himself.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nHaving escaped the authorities, he set up a base in a derelict graveyard in Brooklyn, where he battled Spider-Man and then escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #308. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster then competed in a contest against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], where he battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #292\u2013293. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster's more skilled, successful, and notable students include such characters as [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]] (both Red Skull's henchmen), U.S. Agent, [[Hauptmann Deutschland]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] (Captain America's one-time girlfriend), [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]. On the other hand, Taskmaster also trains many of his students to serve as low-rent henchmen and cannon fodder. In his early appearances, Taskmaster mentions putting intellect-reducing drugs in the diet of his students. He also routinely sent groups of his more disappointing students to serve as \"sparring partners\" for Red Skull, routinely engaging several of them at a time and killing them all (Hauptmann Deutschland infiltrated the academy and used one such session as an opportunity to kidnap Red Skull). He has also employed other supervillains, such as when he hired [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] as his academy's [[calisthenics]] instructor.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn another occasion, Taskmaster was hired by the [[Triune Understanding]]\u2014a religious group secretly masterminding a smear campaign to paint the Avengers as being religiously and racially intolerant\u2014to stage an attack on a Triune facility. Posing as Captain America, he contacted [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]], Ant-Man, [[Silverclaw]] and [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]], claiming that he needed their help to destroy a Triune building containing a mind-control machine. Although they saw through his deception and subsequently defeated him\u2014thanks to Captain Marvel transforming into [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] mere milliseconds away from Taskmaster, thus causing a complete change of attack before Taskmaster could react\u2014the building was destroyed in the ensuing battle and Taskmaster escaped, leaving the heroes lacking any evidence of their story.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster continued to train numerous villains and thugs until the Avengers began to search out and shut down some of his academies across the United States. Taskmaster began to spend more time working as a mercenary in order to make up for the loss of profit. This led him to join [[Agency X]] at the behest of his love interest [[Sandi Brandenberg]], in missions from time to time, while continuing to teach at his academies around the world. More recently, Taskmaster is once again seen as a hired mercenary, contracted by the [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] to kill [[Moon Knight]] (Marc Spector). Taskmaster was misled with information that Moon Knight was broken, friendless and desiring death. During the conflict these factors all proved to be false as Marc's ex-girlfriend and butler came to Spector's defense and found the will to fight back. Despite his superior fighting abilities, Taskmaster was defeated. Moon Knight then carved off part of Taskmaster's facemask, though left him alive.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster also worked at training henchmen to copy fighting styles of specific heroes. Taskmaster unleashed [[Death-Shield|Deathshield]] (trained to fight like Captain America), [[Jagged Bow]] (trained to fight like Hawkeye), and [[Blood Spider]] (trained to fight like Spider-Man) to face off against Spider-Man and Solo. The three were defeated, while Taskmaster escaped yet again.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #367\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #367. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" broke out, Taskmaster was hired by the government and enrolled into a team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and given temporary amnesty to take down the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later battles the Secret Avengers in New York. He attempts to kill [[Invisible Woman|Susan \"Sue\" Storm]], only for [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to take the bullet. Enraged, Sue crushes him with an invisible telekinetic field, rendering him unconscious.<ref>''Civil War'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was sent to the Negative Zone Prison with the other \"Major-League\" members of the Thunderbolts army such as [[Lady Deathstrike]],{{Issue|date=December 2009}} but was apparently freed by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to regain his own reputation as a mercenary, Deadpool frees Taskmaster from his imprisonment to have a showdown with him while potential merc contractors watched from their captive position in a nearby prison. Taskmaster is again referred to as '''Tasky''' by Deadpool, and a fight ensues between him and the [[Handcuffs|manacled]] Deadpool. He mentions his professional ethics, but this simply comes down to deciding to simply maim his opponent rather than kill him. In the end, he is defeated by Deadpool who, in spite of the victory, fails to impress his captive audience. After being thanked for letting him win, Taskmaster tells Deadpool that he had not let him win, \"The truth is... You're that good. You've always been that good. Which won't get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional...\"<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster was given a full presidential pardon for his efforts in testing the security of the [[Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], in which he was able to break in and place Deputy Director [[Maria Hill]] in his sights. Though he was allowed to leave, a threatening message left in Hill's private bathroom revealed that if he ever desired, infiltrating [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] would be no difficult feat.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}\n\nTaskmaster replaces [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] as [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]'s drill instructor and is tasked with training registered superheroes for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Fifty State Initiative]]. Taskmaster would also be involved in [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]]'s cloning process inputting (via technology) the original's move set for the [[Scarlet Spider]]s as well as the move set of Spider-Man.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster is hired by Deadpool to help his old enemy and occasional friend defeat the Thunderbolts. Being disguised as Deadpool, he gets captured and is about to be beheaded when the real Deadpool saves him. Deadpool finally pays him, but he expresses annoyance at being paid from an ATM due to his major villain status.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Taskmaster is chosen to lead the Shadow Initiative after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], with their first mission to take down [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]]'s [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] cell in [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Along with [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], Taskmaster stealthily leads the group into the country, but they are soon discovered by HYDRA.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Norman Osborn]] appoints Taskmaster to train criminals for the new Initiative, to behave like heroes. His first task is to retrain [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Also, when [[Blastaar]] takes control of the [[Negative Zone]] prison 42, Taskmaster is ordered to lead a squad to take the prison back.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he gives [[Donyell Taylor|Night Thrasher]] a severe bullet wound to the head, allowing Osborn to take Night Thrasher prisoner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Emma Frost]] and [[Namor]] resign from the Cabal, Taskmaster is offered membership.<ref name=\"AV:TI31\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster was present at a meeting when Osborn discusses about Asgard.<ref>[[Brian Michael Bendis]] (w), [[Michael Lark]] (p), Stefano Gaudiano (i), ''Siege: The Cabal'' #1 (December 3, 2009), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23928 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: \"Siege: The Cabal\" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}</ref> He is severely wounded at the meeting as a result of an attack by [[Doctor Doom]]. While recovering in a hospital, Taskmaster declined to join the Cabal. Osborn cut the oxygen tank next to Taskmaster's bed, reminding him that it was Osborn who plucked him from obscurity. Taskmaster then agrees to join in the [[Siege (comics)|siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref name=\"AV:TI31\"/> During the battle, he fights with both versions of Captain America (Steve Rogers and [[Bucky Barnes]]).<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Asgard falls, Taskmaster finds Constrictor and the two beat a hasty retreat, but not before Taskmaster taunts Osborn about how Taskmaster helped Deadpool. After Osborn's defeat by Captain America and Iron Man, Taskmaster and Constrictor went back to mercenary work.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nA false rumor is spread that Taskmaster is leaking information about the criminal underworld to Rogers's new 'heroic' regime. A bounty of $1,000,000,000 is placed on the Taskmaster's head by the mysterious Org. The hordes of AIM, HYDRA, the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the Cyber Ninjas, the Black Choppers, the Trenchcoat Mafia, the Legions of the Living Lightning, the Militiamen, the [[Sons of the Serpent]], and the Inquisition take up the chase to claim the money. Taskmaster, ambushed in a small diner, manages to best his opponents. But the diner's waitress, Mercedes Merced, gets entangled in the saga and is included in the bounty. Taskmaster reveals to Mercedes that his powers cause him to lose his explicit memory, meaning that he cannot remember anything about his personal life, and the only way for the whole ordeal to be over is to re-discover Taskmaster's origins.<ref name=\"Taskmaster2-1\">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster and Mercedes' quest takes them to Mexico to battle the [[Don of the Dead (comics)|Don of the Dead]],<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and then to Bolivia to the village where everyone is Hitler. Inside an exact replica of Himmler's [[Wewelsburg]] Castle, Taskmaster regains his memories. He remembers being S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Tony Masters that had been sent to Bolivia to terminate Horst Gorscht, the Nazi scientist responsible for a corrupted version of the super-soldier serum. Gorscht had developed a new serum that could unlock the mind's potential to absorb knowledge instantaneously. With Gorscht's serum and test notes destroyed, Masters injected the last of the serum into himself. Having regained these memories, Taskmaster recognizes Mercedes' voice as being the same as 'The Hub', a mysterious voice who works for the Org. Taskmaster shoots Mercedes in the shoulder and threatens to kill her if she doesn't start talking. Mercedes reveals that the Org is a S.H.I.E.L.D. front, and that she is not only an agent, but also Taskmaster's wife. Miles above the Wewelsburg castle in an airship, the Minions' International Liberation Front (a secret group composed of henchmen from all of the major terrorist organizations), led by [[Redshirt (character)|Redshirt]] the Uber-Henchman, reveal their deception and plot to rule the criminal underground by using Taskmaster to lead them straight to the Org.<ref name=\"Taskmaster vol. 2 #3\"/> Redshirt leads the Minions' International Liberation Front (or the acronym MILF for short) into battle against the Taskmaster and Mercedes. Mercedes convinces the Taskmaster to trust her and work together to fend off the forces of MILF. During the battle, Taskmaster regains his memories of Mercedes and how he fell in love with her. Before they can reconcile, Taskmaster is attacked from behind by Redshirt who has genetically altered his body and mastered superior fighting skills to those of Taskmaster. Redshirt gains the upper hand as the pair push each other to the limits. Mercedes tries to intervene to protect her husband, but is quickly and effortlessly cast to one side. Enraged, Taskmaster attacks Redshirt and delivers a killing blow using Redshirt's own fighting style (which causes Taskmaster to lose his memories once more). Taskmaster, not recognizing Mercedes or his reasons for being there, flees and leaves Mercedes alone once more.{{issue|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Avengers Academy]] student [[Finesse (comics)|Finesse]] later seeks out Taskmaster, thinking that he may be her long-lost father. When she finds Taskmaster, Finesse ends up sparring with him. After much sparring, Taskmaster finally relents to tell Finesse that he very well might be her father, but that the powers to learn so much about others\u2019 movements and techniques have caused him to forget important things in life. Knowing he likely won\u2019t remember the conversation in a couple days, Taskmaster tells Finesse that he wanted to fight her so he might remember her.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\" storyline, Taskmaster comes to the aid of [[Alpha Flight]] when it comes to forming a resistance against the Unity Party that was formed by [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn order for the [[Masters of Evil]] to obtain the Crown of Wolves for the [[Shadow Council]], Max Fury hired Taskmaster to retrieve it only for Taskmaster to demand more money for the job and he hid in the Hole. The Secret Avengers went to the Hole in order to get the Crown of Wolves before Fury got his hands on it. This led to a fight between Taskmaster and [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Taskmaster escaped and returned the crown to Fury, only for Max to apparently kill Taskmaster when he asks for payment. When the crown's effects don't function for Max, Taskmaster takes the crown for himself, which saves his life by making him the Avatar for the Abyss.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Abyss spreads, the Secret Avengers members Venom and [[Eric O'Grady|Ant-Man]] are able to remove the crown and stop the spread, while Taskmaster and the Masters of Evil are left behind when the Avengers leave with Max in their custody.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #32\u201333. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe criminals of Bagalia imprison Taskmaster and are preparing to offer him up to the highest bidder. S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Secret Avengers come to rescue him and offer him a position. As their inside man, Taskmaster is part of the new High Council of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] as the Minister of Defense.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, [[Mentallo]] discovered that Mockingbird purposely missed any vitals and Taskmaster survived.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Taskmaster and Black Ant (Eric O'Grady's Life Model Decoy counterpart) found out what was done to Captain America to be made into a Hydra sleeper agent, they planned to have a parley with Maria Hill to discuss this with only for the new [[Madame Hydra]] (Elisa Sinclair) to get to them first.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Impressed with the fighting skills of the two of them, Madame Hydra made them bodyguards.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14.

The two of them defect from Hydra and free the captive [[Champions (2016 team)|Champions]]. When Taskmaster and Black Ant asks for them to put in a good word for them, [[Miles Morales|Spider-Man]] webs them up anyway.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster and Black Ant later attack [[Empire State University]] where [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] was teaching a class. As the inhibitor chip prevents Connors into turning into Lizard, Peter Parker sneaks off to become Spider-Man. During his fight with Black Ant and Taskmaster, Spider-Man is exposed to the Isotope Genome Accelerator that splits him from his Peter Parker side.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn a prelude to \"[[Hunted (comics)|Hunted]]\", Taskmaster and Black Ant work with [[Kraven the Hunter]] and [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] in capturing some animal-themed characters for his upcoming hunt.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> Black Ant and Taskmaster are talking about the Hunt. Taskmaster betrays Black Ant saying that Black Ant is a animal-themed villain and tasers Black Ant to get more money.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Lizard finds Taskmaster at the Pop-Up with No Name. Lizard proceeds to poisons him by slipping a poison into her beer. Lizard offers Taskmaster the antidote if he can take Lizard to Central Park. While traveling there, Lizard and Taskmaster defeat Vermin, freeing innocent bystanders. Taskmaster helps put a taser chip in Lizard's body, and takes him to Arcade.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #19.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster frees Lizard from his binds and Lizard tells Taskmaster that the poison will wear off in 24 hours.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster makes off with Black Ant before [[Darren Cross|Yellowjacket]], [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]] can take revenge on him. As they leave, Taskmaster states that Black Ant would've done the same for him. When Black Ant asks \"Do you mean the betrayal part or the rescue part?\" All Taskmaster can say is \"yeah!\"<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTaskmaster injected himself with [[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer|SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] Horst Gorscht's primer, an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid [[cortisol]] designed to unlock the mind's [[procedural memory]] potential. The Taskmaster thus gained the ability to absorb knowledge instantaneously. This ability is linked to his [[muscle memory]], allowing the Taskmaster to instantly replicate the physical movement of peak-level humans. Using these \"photographic reflexes\", the Taskmaster is highly skilled in various forms of combat, as an exceptional martial artist (mimicking [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Shang-Chi]]), a skilled swordsman ([[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]), a deadly accurate marksman ([[Captain America]] with a shield, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] with a bow and arrow, [[Punisher]] with firearms, and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] with various projectiles) as well as displaying a strenuously honed athletic ability ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]). Once the Taskmaster has mastered an opponent's physical movements, he can then predict his opponent's next attack. The only person shown capable of negating Taskmaster's abilities is [[Deadpool]], whose manic personality makes him nearly impossible to predict.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #2</ref> A side effect of the primer is severe [[declarative memory]] loss. The more implicit memories (i.e. knowledge and abilities) he learns, the more explicit memories (i.e. personal experience) he loses. Because of his explicit memory loss, the Org (Mercedes Merced) has acted as Taskmaster's surrogate memory, his banker, and his handler for his entire criminal career.<ref name=\"Taskmaster' 2011\"/>\n\nBy viewing a video in fast-forward, the Taskmaster can learn to replicate human movement at near-superhuman speed. However, this puts his body under intense strain and can only be used for short periods of time. He also has the ability to manipulate his vocal cords to mimic the voices of others. The Taskmaster was once shown to have [[aquaphobia]] (the fear of water), but later overcame his fears.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1\u20134 (2002)</ref>\n\n===Weaponry===\nAs he is able to replicate numerous fighting techniques, the Taskmaster carries an extensive arsenal of weapons on his person, most commonly using a sword and a replica of Captain America's shield. He also carries a bow and a quiver of arrows, a billy club, a lasso, [[nunchaku]], throwing darts, and various firearms. The Taskmaster once used a stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. device that was able to create various forms of weaponry (such as arrows and shields) using solid energy.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1 (2002)</ref>\n\n==The Org (Mercedes Merced)==\nThe Org is the secret criminal underground that links all criminal and terrorist organizations. In reality, Mercedes Merced is the Taskmaster\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, posing as the Org and the Hub (the voice of the Org), to guide him through his memory loss and gather intelligence on the criminal underworld. Mercedes is also the Taskmaster's wife, having been happily married while they were both [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members|agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] As a result of the Taskmaster's powers, his explicit memories of Mercedes were lost, and he had no recollection of being married.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\nWhen S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down by [[Norman Osborn]], Mercedes went rogue and continued her role as her husband's handler. However, when a billion-dollar bounty was placed on the Taskmaster's head by someone claiming to be the Org, Mercedes was forced to break her cover and battle alongside her husband against Redshirt and the Minions' International Liberation Front. Once their enemies were beaten, and the Taskmaster once again forgot who she was, Mercedes mournfully returned to her previous role.<ref name=\"Taskmaster' 2011\">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1\u20134 (2010\u20132011)</ref>\n\n==Known students==\n{{expand section|date=September 2018}}\nThe following characters have been trained by Taskmaster:\n\n* [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]<ref>''Agent X'' #1.

He first appears in \"Why I Hate The Gym\" where he's hired by [[Doctor Octopus]] and goes undercover as [[Physical education|gym teacher]] '''Coach Yeager''' to learn [[Spider-Man]]'s identity with [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Harry Osborn]] as suspects but is defeated when the web-slinger and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]], and then in \"Ultimate Deadpool\" where he has stolen encrypted information (superheroes' secret identities) while dealing with [[Deadpool]]'s unpredictable nature. During the \"New Warriors\" story arc, Taskmaster has his signature shield and a laser-sword. He strives to recruit fledgling young superheroes for his own [[Thunderbolts (comics)|sinister purposes]] and thus has regular conflict with Spider-Man. He first enlists the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] to retrieve a sample of the mass-produced [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, leading to two mercenaries' showdown with Spider-Man and Agent Venom. Taskmaster later hacks the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] information on different young heroes, successfully manipulating [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]] into his training program. Taskmaster next tries to steal the [[Iron Spider]] armor by impersonating S.H.I.E.L.D. official Stan and recruit [[Amadeus Cho]] into his cause, losing the Iron Spider armor and gets defeated by Spider-Man and Iron Spider. After obtaining Doc Ock's notes, Taskmaster manipulated the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] onto his side. He then tries to recruit [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] while [[Kraven the Hunter]] wants to sacrifice [[Zabu]] for immortality but both are foiled by Spider-Man and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. After months of planning, Taskmaster leads his team to infiltrate the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]]. He has his team 'thin the herd' of the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]] and manipulates the [[New Warriors]] into freeing [[Sinister Six|several supervillains]] led by the Green Goblin (who hired Taskmaster) but Cloak & Dagger are left for dead and defect to Spider-Man's side.

In the episode \"Mask of the Panther\", Taskmaster and his henchmen have stolen a hyper-cannon on their airplane until the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] crashes their heist. The resulting flight causes the damaged hyper-cannon to explode as Black Panther places Taskmaster in the same ensnaring trap as his henchmen.

He has the ability to mimic the physical movements of anyone he witnesses; writers differ on whether this counts as a \"super power\". He claims that he has had this ability since childhood. He works as a combat instructor and trains others to become lackeys for other villains by utilizing the techniques he has learned from his observation of superheroes and participates in mercenary jobs from time to time. Initially portrayed as a villain, he has also been shown training [[U.S. Agent (comics)|U.S. Agent]] and other neophyte superheroes at the behest of the US government. As a mercenary, he has no ideology except that of his employer. Due to his ability to imitate the techniques and armory of other heroes and villains, Taskmaster has occasionally been used to impersonate other characters.\n\nTony Masters first demonstrated unusual abilities during childhood. After watching a cowboy show on television, he found himself able to duplicate the sophisticated rope tricks he had just watched the cowboy perform. Psychiatrists, called in at the mother's request, determined that the boy had a form of [[photographic memory]] which they called \"photographic reflexes\". He employed his power several times during his youth for personal gain, most notably when he became a star quarterback of his high school football team after watching one pro football game. Upon graduation, he briefly considered a career as a crime fighter, but opted instead to be a professional criminal, which he perceived to be far more lucrative.<ref name=\"Av196\">''Avengers'' #196. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe then began a program of observing the fighting techniques of numerous costumed heroes and villains (using archival television news broadcasts). He initially used his fighting skills to execute several successful grand larcenies, but he had not properly anticipated the dangers involved. He decided to use his stolen capital to establish a center for training aspiring criminals to turn into polished professionals. His goal was to become a supplier for criminal organizations around the world.\n\nDesigning a costume with a white cowl and skull mask, he took the name \"Taskmaster\" and began to train many thugs at criminal academies he had located around the United States. However, his existence was eventually revealed when Pernell Solomon of the Solomon Institute for the Criminally Insane (a front for one of these academies) used the school's resources to create a clone of himself when the administrator required an organ donation due to possessing an extremely rare blood type; the clone (learning of this fate) managed to contact the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Taskmaster captured [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] when the Avengers invaded the premises;<ref>''Avengers'' #195. Marvel Comics.</ref> but the Avengers followed, exposing his front operation. Taskmaster held his own against [[Captain America]] and [[Iron Man]], however, was subsequently forced to flee after a confrontation with [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]] since his lack of experience with Jocasta's abilities made it impossible to predict the robot's next move.<ref name=\"Av196\"/> Taskmaster later established a new training academy in Manhattan, where he battled [[Spider-Man]] and Ant-Man, and then escaped.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #103. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later used a traveling carnival as a mobile base, where he battled [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] and Ant-Man, and then escaped again.<ref>''Avengers'' #223. Marvel Comics.</ref> He next trained henchmen for the Black Abbott. Alongside Black Abbott, he battled Spider-Man and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], and escaped yet again.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #146. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDeciding to further explore the use of a circus as a front for his academy, Taskmaster took over yet another small outfit, and used it for many months to great success. However, while it was playing a small town in Ohio, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Vance Astrovik]] (who would later take the name Justice) assisted a government agent in foiling Taskmaster's activities. While escaping, Taskmaster was captured by a group of U.S. Secret Service agents and taken into custody.<ref>''The Thing'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> There is reason to believe that [[Red Skull]] was behind the Taskmaster's capture, since a group of normal men were able to capture him.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Through Douglas Rockwell (the head of the President's [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]]), Mr. Smith arranged for Taskmaster to train John Walker in order to make him appear to be the real Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #334. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to conceal Red Skull's involvement, Rockwell had the Commission work out a deal to have years taken off Taskmaster's sentence in return for training Walker. After Taskmaster successfully trained Walker, Red Skull arranged for him to escape from the Commission's detention center so he could continue training lackeys and Red Skull himself.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nHaving escaped the authorities, he set up a base in a derelict graveyard in Brooklyn, where he battled Spider-Man and then escaped.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #308. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster then competed in a contest against [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]], where he battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #292\u2013293. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster's more skilled, successful, and notable students include such characters as [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] and [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]] (both Red Skull's henchmen), U.S. Agent, [[Hauptmann Deutschland]], [[Diamondback (Rachel Leighton)|Diamondback]] (Captain America's one-time girlfriend), [[Spymaster (comics)|Spymaster]], [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]. On the other hand, Taskmaster also trains many of his students to serve as low-rent henchmen and cannon fodder. In his early appearances, Taskmaster mentions putting intellect-reducing drugs in the diet of his students. He also routinely sent groups of his more disappointing students to serve as \"sparring partners\" for Red Skull, routinely engaging several of them at a time and killing them all (Hauptmann Deutschland infiltrated the academy and used one such session as an opportunity to kidnap Red Skull). He has also employed other supervillains, such as when he hired [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] as his academy's [[calisthenics]] instructor.{{Issue|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn another occasion, Taskmaster was hired by the [[Triune Understanding]]\u2014a religious group secretly masterminding a smear campaign to paint the Avengers as being religiously and racially intolerant\u2014to stage an attack on a Triune facility. Posing as Captain America, he contacted [[Carol Danvers|Warbird]], Ant-Man, [[Silverclaw]] and [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]], claiming that he needed their help to destroy a Triune building containing a mind-control machine. Although they saw through his deception and subsequently defeated him\u2014thanks to Captain Marvel transforming into [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] mere milliseconds away from Taskmaster, thus causing a complete change of attack before Taskmaster could react\u2014the building was destroyed in the ensuing battle and Taskmaster escaped, leaving the heroes lacking any evidence of their story.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster continued to train numerous villains and thugs until the Avengers began to search out and shut down some of his academies across the United States. Taskmaster began to spend more time working as a mercenary in order to make up for the loss of profit. This led him to join [[Agency X]] at the behest of his love interest [[Sandi Brandenberg]], in missions from time to time, while continuing to teach at his academies around the world. More recently, Taskmaster is once again seen as a hired mercenary, contracted by the [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] to kill [[Moon Knight]] (Marc Spector). Taskmaster was misled with information that Moon Knight was broken, friendless and desiring death. During the conflict these factors all proved to be false as Marc's ex-girlfriend and butler came to Spector's defense and found the will to fight back. Despite his superior fighting abilities, Taskmaster was defeated. Moon Knight then carved off part of Taskmaster's facemask, though left him alive.<ref>''Moon Knight'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster also worked at training henchmen to copy fighting styles of specific heroes. Taskmaster unleashed [[Death-Shield|Deathshield]] (trained to fight like Captain America), [[Jagged Bow]] (trained to fight like Hawkeye), and [[Blood Spider]] (trained to fight like Spider-Man) to face off against Spider-Man and Solo. The three were defeated, while Taskmaster escaped yet again.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #367\">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #367. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" broke out, Taskmaster was hired by the government and enrolled into a team of [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and given temporary amnesty to take down the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>''Civil War'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later battles the Secret Avengers in New York. He attempts to kill [[Invisible Woman|Susan \"Sue\" Storm]], only for [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] to take the bullet. Enraged, Sue crushes him with an invisible telekinetic field, rendering him unconscious.<ref>''Civil War'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was sent to the Negative Zone Prison with the other \"Major-League\" members of the Thunderbolts army such as [[Lady Deathstrike]],{{Issue|date=December 2009}} but was apparently freed by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Cable and Deadpool'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to regain his own reputation as a mercenary, Deadpool frees Taskmaster from his imprisonment to have a showdown with him while potential merc contractors watched from their captive position in a nearby prison. Taskmaster is again referred to as '''Tasky''' by Deadpool, and a fight ensues between him and the [[Handcuffs|manacled]] Deadpool. He mentions his professional ethics, but this simply comes down to deciding to simply maim his opponent rather than kill him. In the end, he is defeated by Deadpool who, in spite of the victory, fails to impress his captive audience. After being thanked for letting him win, Taskmaster tells Deadpool that he had not let him win, \"The truth is... You're that good. You've always been that good. Which won't get you a cup of coffee until you figure out how to be a professional...\"<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster was given a full presidential pardon for his efforts in testing the security of the [[Helicarrier|S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier]], in which he was able to break in and place Deputy Director [[Maria Hill]] in his sights. Though he was allowed to leave, a threatening message left in Hill's private bathroom revealed that if he ever desired, infiltrating [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] would be no difficult feat.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}\n\nTaskmaster replaces [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] as [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]'s drill instructor and is tasked with training registered superheroes for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Fifty State Initiative]]. Taskmaster would also be involved in [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]]'s cloning process inputting (via technology) the original's move set for the [[Scarlet Spider]]s as well as the move set of Spider-Man.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nTaskmaster is hired by Deadpool to help his old enemy and occasional friend defeat the Thunderbolts. Being disguised as Deadpool, he gets captured and is about to be beheaded when the real Deadpool saves him. Deadpool finally pays him, but he expresses annoyance at being paid from an ATM due to his major villain status.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Taskmaster is chosen to lead the Shadow Initiative after the [[Skrull]] [[Secret Invasion|invasion]], with their first mission to take down [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]]'s [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] cell in [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Along with [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]] and [[Komodo (comics)|Komodo]], Taskmaster stealthily leads the group into the country, but they are soon discovered by HYDRA.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Norman Osborn]] appoints Taskmaster to train criminals for the new Initiative, to behave like heroes. His first task is to retrain [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref> Also, when [[Blastaar]] takes control of the [[Negative Zone]] prison 42, Taskmaster is ordered to lead a squad to take the prison back.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he gives [[Donyell Taylor|Night Thrasher]] a severe bullet wound to the head, allowing Osborn to take Night Thrasher prisoner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28. Marvel Comics.</ref> When [[Emma Frost]] and [[Namor]] resign from the Cabal, Taskmaster is offered membership.<ref name=\"AV:TI31\">''Avengers: The Initiative'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster was present at a meeting when Osborn discusses about Asgard.<ref>[[Brian Michael Bendis]] (w), [[Michael Lark]] (p), Stefano Gaudiano (i), ''Siege: The Cabal'' #1 (December 3, 2009), [[New York, NY]]: [[Marvel Comics]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23928 |title=STORMING HEAVEN: \"Siege: The Cabal\" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] News |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=September 27, 2010 }}</ref> He is severely wounded at the meeting as a result of an attack by [[Doctor Doom]]. While recovering in a hospital, Taskmaster declined to join the Cabal. Osborn cut the oxygen tank next to Taskmaster's bed, reminding him that it was Osborn who plucked him from obscurity. Taskmaster then agrees to join in the [[Siege (comics)|siege]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref name=\"AV:TI31\"/> During the battle, he fights with both versions of Captain America (Steve Rogers and [[Bucky Barnes]]).<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Asgard falls, Taskmaster finds Constrictor and the two beat a hasty retreat, but not before Taskmaster taunts Osborn about how Taskmaster helped Deadpool. After Osborn's defeat by Captain America and Iron Man, Taskmaster and Constrictor went back to mercenary work.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nA false rumor is spread that Taskmaster is leaking information about the criminal underworld to Rogers's new 'heroic' regime. A bounty of $1,000,000,000 is placed on the Taskmaster's head by the mysterious Org. The hordes of AIM, HYDRA, the [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]], [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]], the Cyber Ninjas, the Black Choppers, the Trenchcoat Mafia, the Legions of the Living Lightning, the Militiamen, the [[Sons of the Serpent]], and the Inquisition take up the chase to claim the money. Taskmaster, ambushed in a small diner, manages to best his opponents. But the diner's waitress, Mercedes Merced, gets entangled in the saga and is included in the bounty. Taskmaster reveals to Mercedes that his powers cause him to lose his explicit memory, meaning that he cannot remember anything about his personal life, and the only way for the whole ordeal to be over is to re-discover Taskmaster's origins.<ref name=\"Taskmaster2-1\">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster and Mercedes' quest takes them to Mexico to battle the [[Don of the Dead (comics)|Don of the Dead]],<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and then to Bolivia to the village where everyone is Hitler. Inside an exact replica of Himmler's [[Wewelsburg]] Castle, Taskmaster regains his memories. He remembers being S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Tony Masters that had been sent to Bolivia to terminate Horst Gorscht, the Nazi scientist responsible for a corrupted version of the super-soldier serum. Gorscht had developed a new serum that could unlock the mind's potential to absorb knowledge instantaneously. With Gorscht's serum and test notes destroyed, Masters injected the last of the serum into himself. Having regained these memories, Taskmaster recognizes Mercedes' voice as being the same as 'The Hub', a mysterious voice who works for the Org. Taskmaster shoots Mercedes in the shoulder and threatens to kill her if she doesn't start talking. Mercedes reveals that the Org is a S.H.I.E.L.D. front, and that she is not only an agent, but also Taskmaster's wife. Miles above the Wewelsburg castle in an airship, the Minions' International Liberation Front (a secret group composed of henchmen from all of the major terrorist organizations), led by [[Redshirt (character)|Redshirt]] the Uber-Henchman, reveal their deception and plot to rule the criminal underground by using Taskmaster to lead them straight to the Org.<ref name=\"Taskmaster vol. 2 #3\"/> Redshirt leads the Minions' International Liberation Front (or the acronym MILF for short) into battle against the Taskmaster and Mercedes. Mercedes convinces the Taskmaster to trust her and work together to fend off the forces of MILF. During the battle, Taskmaster regains his memories of Mercedes and how he fell in love with her. Before they can reconcile, Taskmaster is attacked from behind by Redshirt who has genetically altered his body and mastered superior fighting skills to those of Taskmaster. Redshirt gains the upper hand as the pair push each other to the limits. Mercedes tries to intervene to protect her husband, but is quickly and effortlessly cast to one side. Enraged, Taskmaster attacks Redshirt and delivers a killing blow using Redshirt's own fighting style (which causes Taskmaster to lose his memories once more). Taskmaster, not recognizing Mercedes or his reasons for being there, flees and leaves Mercedes alone once more.{{issue|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Avengers Academy]] student [[Finesse (comics)|Finesse]] later seeks out Taskmaster, thinking that he may be her long-lost father. When she finds Taskmaster, Finesse ends up sparring with him. After much sparring, Taskmaster finally relents to tell Finesse that he very well might be her father, but that the powers to learn so much about others\u2019 movements and techniques have caused him to forget important things in life. Knowing he likely won\u2019t remember the conversation in a couple days, Taskmaster tells Finesse that he wanted to fight her so he might remember her.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\" storyline, Taskmaster comes to the aid of [[Alpha Flight]] when it comes to forming a resistance against the Unity Party that was formed by [[Master of the World (comics)|Master of the World]].<ref>''Alpha Flight'' vol. 4 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn order for the [[Masters of Evil]] to obtain the Crown of Wolves for the [[Shadow Council]], Max Fury hired Taskmaster to retrieve it only for Taskmaster to demand more money for the job and he hid in the Hole. The Secret Avengers went to the Hole in order to get the Crown of Wolves before Fury got his hands on it. This led to a fight between Taskmaster and [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #30. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, Taskmaster escaped and returned the crown to Fury, only for Max to apparently kill Taskmaster when he asks for payment. When the crown's effects don't function for Max, Taskmaster takes the crown for himself, which saves his life by making him the Avatar for the Abyss.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #31. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the Abyss spreads, the Secret Avengers members Venom and [[Eric O'Grady|Ant-Man]] are able to remove the crown and stop the spread, while Taskmaster and the Masters of Evil are left behind when the Avengers leave with Max in their custody.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #32\u201333.

S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Secret Avengers come to rescue him and offer him a position. As their inside man, Taskmaster is part of the new High Council of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] as the Minister of Defense.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2.

Marvel Comics.</ref> However, [[Mentallo]] discovered that Mockingbird purposely missed any vitals and Taskmaster survived.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Taskmaster and Black Ant (Eric O'Grady's Life Model Decoy counterpart) found out what was done to Captain America to be made into a Hydra sleeper agent, they planned to have a parley with Maria Hill to discuss this with only for the new [[Madame Hydra]] (Elisa Sinclair) to get to them first.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Impressed with the fighting skills of the two of them, Madame Hydra made them bodyguards.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #14.

Lizard offers Taskmaster the antidote if he can take Lizard to Central Park. While traveling there, Lizard and Taskmaster defeat Vermin, freeing innocent bystanders. Taskmaster helps put a taser chip in Lizard's body, and takes him to Arcade.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #19.HU. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster frees Lizard from his binds and Lizard tells Taskmaster that the poison will wear off in 24 hours.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> Taskmaster makes off with Black Ant before [[Darren Cross|Yellowjacket]], [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]], [[Razorback (comics)|Razorback]], [[Toad (comics)|Toad]], and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]] can take revenge on him. As they leave, Taskmaster states that Black Ant would've done the same for him. When Black Ant asks \"Do you mean the betrayal part or the rescue part?\" All Taskmaster can say is \"yeah!\"<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTaskmaster injected himself with [[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer|SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] Horst Gorscht's primer, an elaborate modification of the adrenal steroid [[cortisol]] designed to unlock the mind's [[procedural memory]] potential. The Taskmaster thus gained the ability to absorb knowledge instantaneously. This ability is linked to his [[muscle memory]], allowing the Taskmaster to instantly replicate the physical movement of peak-level humans. Using these \"photographic reflexes\", the Taskmaster is highly skilled in various forms of combat, as an exceptional martial artist (mimicking [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], [[Shang-Chi]]), a skilled swordsman ([[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]), a deadly accurate marksman ([[Captain America]] with a shield, [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] with a bow and arrow, [[Punisher]] with firearms, and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] with various projectiles) as well as displaying a strenuously honed athletic ability ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]). Once the Taskmaster has mastered an opponent's physical movements, he can then predict his opponent's next attack. The only person shown capable of negating Taskmaster's abilities is [[Deadpool]], whose manic personality makes him nearly impossible to predict.<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 2 #2</ref> A side effect of the primer is severe [[declarative memory]] loss. The more implicit memories (i.e. knowledge and abilities) he learns, the more explicit memories (i.e. personal experience) he loses. Because of his explicit memory loss, the Org (Mercedes Merced) has acted as Taskmaster's surrogate memory, his banker, and his handler for his entire criminal career.<ref name=\"Taskmaster' 2011\"/>\n\nBy viewing a video in fast-forward, the Taskmaster can learn to replicate human movement at near-superhuman speed. However, this puts his body under intense strain and can only be used for short periods of time. He also has the ability to manipulate his vocal cords to mimic the voices of others. The Taskmaster was once shown to have [[aquaphobia]] (the fear of water), but later overcame his fears.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1\u20134 (2002)</ref>\n\n===Weaponry===\nAs he is able to replicate numerous fighting techniques, the Taskmaster carries an extensive arsenal of weapons on his person, most commonly using a sword and a replica of Captain America's shield. He also carries a bow and a quiver of arrows, a billy club, a lasso, [[nunchaku]], throwing darts, and various firearms. The Taskmaster once used a stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. device that was able to create various forms of weaponry (such as arrows and shields) using solid energy.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 1 #1 (2002)</ref>\n\n==The Org (Mercedes Merced)==\nThe Org is the secret criminal underground that links all criminal and terrorist organizations. In reality, Mercedes Merced is the Taskmaster\u2019s S.H.I.E.L.D. handler, posing as the Org and the Hub (the voice of the Org), to guide him through his memory loss and gather intelligence on the criminal underworld. Mercedes is also the Taskmaster's wife, having been happily married while they were both [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members|agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]] As a result of the Taskmaster's powers, his explicit memories of Mercedes were lost, and he had no recollection of being married.<ref>''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #4</ref>\n\nWhen S.H.I.E.L.D. was shut down by [[Norman Osborn]], Mercedes went rogue and continued her role as her husband's handler. However, when a billion-dollar bounty was placed on the Taskmaster's head by someone claiming to be the Org, Mercedes was forced to break her cover and battle alongside her husband against Redshirt and the Minions' International Liberation Front. Once their enemies were beaten, and the Taskmaster once again forgot who she was, Mercedes mournfully returned to her previous role.<ref name=\"Taskmaster' 2011\">''Taskmaster'' vol. 2 #1\u20134 (2010\u20132011)</ref>\n\n==Known students==\n{{expand section|date=September 2018}}\nThe following characters have been trained by Taskmaster:\n\n* [[Agent X (Marvel Comics)|Agent X]]<ref>''Agent X'' #1.

He first appears in \"Why I Hate The Gym\" where he's hired by [[Doctor Octopus]] and goes undercover as [[Physical education|gym teacher]] '''Coach Yeager''' to learn [[Spider-Man]]'s identity with [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Harry Osborn]] as suspects but is defeated when the web-slinger and [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]], and then in \"Ultimate Deadpool\" where he has stolen encrypted information (superheroes' secret identities) while dealing with [[Deadpool]]'s unpredictable nature. During the \"New Warriors\" story arc, Taskmaster has his signature shield and a laser-sword. He strives to recruit fledgling young superheroes for his own [[Thunderbolts (comics)|sinister purposes]] and thus has regular conflict with Spider-Man. He first enlists the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] to retrieve a sample of the mass-produced [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote, leading to two mercenaries' showdown with Spider-Man and Agent Venom. Taskmaster later hacks the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] information on different young heroes, successfully manipulating [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]] into his training program. Taskmaster next tries to steal the [[Iron Spider]] armor by impersonating S.H.I.E.L.D. official Stan and recruit [[Amadeus Cho]] into his cause, losing the Iron Spider armor and gets defeated by Spider-Man and Iron Spider. After obtaining Doc Ock's notes, Taskmaster manipulated the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] onto his side. He then tries to recruit [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] while [[Kraven the Hunter]] wants to sacrifice [[Zabu]] for immortality but both are foiled by Spider-Man and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. After months of planning, Taskmaster leads his team to infiltrate the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]]. He has his team 'thin the herd' of the [[New Warriors|S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees]] and manipulates the [[New Warriors]] into freeing [[Sinister Six|several supervillains]] led by the Green Goblin (who hired Taskmaster) but Cloak & Dagger are left for dead and defect to Spider-Man's side. As the escaped supervillains fight the New Warriors and the Goblin retrieves the [[Siege Perilous]], Taskmaster personally fights Spider-Man one-on-one but eventually defeated by the web-slinger.

In the episode \"Mask of the Panther\", Taskmaster and his henchmen have stolen a hyper-cannon on their airplane until the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] crashes their heist. The resulting flight causes the damaged hyper-cannon to explode as Black Panther places Taskmaster in the same ensnaring trap as his henchmen.

After all his challenges are completed, Taskmaster, impressed by Spider-Man's skills, eventually decides to engage him in two separate fights. Despite his advanced fighting techniques and weapons, as well as being able to copy several of Spider-Man's moves, Taskmaster is ultimately defeated by the web-slinger and reveals to him that he was hired by a mysterious organization to see if Spider-Man was worth recruiting, before using a [[smoke bomb]] to vanish without trace.\n* Taskmaster will appear in ''[[Avengers (2020 video game)|Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/11/18661450/square-enix-avengers-game-villain-taskmaster |title=Marvel confirms the identity of the villain in Square Enix\u2019s Avengers game |newspaper=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=June 11, 2019 |first=Susana |last=Polo}}</ref> This version of is a former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who nows runs a private mercenary group working for a mysterious employer.

It originally served the towns of [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], [[Hampton, New Brunswick|Hampton]] and much of rural [[Kings County, New Brunswick|Kings County]], though today is mostly populated by students from Quispamsis. This is due in part to the opening of [[Hampton High School (Hampton, New Brunswick)|Hampton High School]] in 1992 which served the town of Hampton and much of rural Kings County. [[Rothesay High School]] was then opened in 1997 to serve the town of [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]]. Following Mr. Bishop, the next principal was Robert Munro, and the current principal of Kennebecasis Valley High School is JoEllen Jensen.\n\n==Events==\n\n===Rip Seeley Memorial Basketball Game===\nEach year KV's Varsity basketball teams compete against their rival [[Rothesay High School|Rothesay High]] in this Memorial Basketball Game. The location of the game alternates each year between the KV and Rothesay Gyms. The girls varsity teams play their game first followed by the boys game. Proceeds from the game go toward a scholarship for a student athlete.\n\n===Miller Bowl, Filler-bowl and PJ bowl===\nSince 2008, when rival school Rothesay High opened the Arther Miller fields, there has been a memorial football game. The first two of the first four years of this tradition, the games were hosted at Arther Miller field. The following two seasons the games were hosted at KVHS on its own field, Usher Miller field. KVHS won each of the four games played against Rothesay High. In recent years, variations of Miller Bowl have arisen in its stead, carrying titles such as Filler Bowl and Papa John's. These are intended to honour the tradition of Miller Bowl while complying with new restrictions placed on KVHS's football team which prevent them from playing against Rothesay High after having risen to the 12-man league following two consecutive championship wins in the 10-man league. In 2012 they had the Filler bowl against Fredericton High, as they were the first team that played KV at home that season. The following season they hosted the first Papa Johns bowl (as it is sponsored by Papa Johns Pizza) against Saint John High as the coaches and players of KV knew Saint John High School was their true rival in 12 man. The PJ bowl continues to be an exciting game for fans and players alike and is normally a very close game.\n\n===Riverboat Basketball Tournament===\nThe Riverboat Basketball Tournament is an event that is eagerly awaited by the student body. It showcases the varsity boys and girls basketball teams from KVHS, as well as many rival schools such as Rothesay High School, St. Stephen High School, Fredericton High School, and Woodstock High School. In recent years the tournament has expanded to include teams from other Canadian provinces such as Nova Scotia, and Quebec, and from the state of Maine. It is tradition that one boys game and one girls game takes place during class time, which allows the majority of the student body to attend and cheer on the home team. Students are charged $1 to leave class and attend the game, with proceeds supporting the athletes.\n\n===Campus Market===\nSince 2003, KVHS has had an annual fair which students taking the 'Entrepreneurship 110' course participate in. The market consists of students thinking up an idea of a product they want to sell and then constructing a business plan for that product. These students miss all of their morning classes to run their own table in the cafeteria to sell their products to passing students, as well as students whose classes have signed up to come visit the market during class time. In the past, students from Rothesay High's entrepreneurship class have been invited to partake as well. The market takes place mid-December, and as a result many of the products often relate to Christmas and the holidays.\n\n===Pink Day===\nOne day of each year, every student wears pink clothing to school in support of breast cancer research. Despite being entirely optional, it's very uncommon to see a student dressed in anything other than pink on this day, as it has become a celebrated tradition. Each student and teacher donates one dollar to the breast cancer foundation for a walk around the school, ending with a pep-rally at which the students vote by cheering for the most pink and best dressed student. The costumes prepared for this competition are intentionally ridiculous and over the top, with an older student doing backflips in a pink-painted gas mask famously winning two years in a row.\n\n===Event Realization===\nKVHS has a dynamic student council known as the Leadership Team which plans and executes most events that take place at the school, also largely filling the role of a social committee. They can be seen planning, promoting, and setting up school events. The KVHS News team, which launched in 2011, provides information on school affairs and such upcoming events to students over a weekly video broadcast with the aim of encouraging an already high rate of student involvement.\n\n==Athletic achievements==\n* In the fall of 2010, KVHS became home to the Usher Miller turf field. This is an artificial surface with lights. It will be the home field for 4 soccer teams, 1 football team, 1 field hockey team and 2 rugby teams.\n* In 1999 the Varsity Men's Soccer team won the Provincial AAA championship.\n* In 2001 the Varsity Men's Soccer team won the Provincial AAA championship.\n* In 2001 the Varsity Girls Rugby team won the Provincial AAA championship.\n* In 2002 the Varsity Girls Rugby team won the Provincial AAA championship.\n* In 2003 the Varsity Girls Rugby team won the Provincial AAA championship.\n* In 2006 the Boys and Gils Curling teams won the Provincial NBIAA titles.\n* In 2005 the Varsity Football team won the provincial AA championship completing their unexpected second straight undefeated season.\n* In 2006 the Mixed Curling team won the Provincial NBIAA title.\n* In 2007 the girls field hockey team won their second consecutive provincial title.\n* In 2008 the JV Girls Basketball team defended their provincial title.\n* In 2008 the Mixed Curling team won the provincial NBIAA title for a second time respectively.\n* In 2010 the Varsity Football team won the provincial 10-Man AAA championship over [[Rothesay High School]].\n* In 2011 the Varsity girls Rugby team won the Provincial AAA championships over Simonds High School.\n* In 2011 the Varsity Football team won the provincial 10-Man AAA championship over [[\u00c9cole Mathieu-Martin]] 49-48(2OT).\n* In 2013 the Varsity girls Rugby team won the Provincial AAA championships\n* In 2014 the Varsity girls Soccer team won the provincial championship.\n* In 2014 the Varsity girls Field Hockey won the provincial championship.\n* In the fall of 2017, the Crusaders football team took home the 10-Man Provincial Championship with a 23-21 victory over the St. Malachy\u2019s high school Saints.\n\n==Academic achievements==\n* * KV's Crusaders were National Champions on CBC's [[SmartAsk]] trivia competition in 2002 and came second in the following year.\n* In 2011, the KVHS [[Reach for the Top]] team defended their title at the national championship, topping off a 14-0 record at the national championship. They are only the second school in the history of the tournament to win back-to-back championships and have finished in the top three for five straight years. Their 28-game winning streak at Nationals (2010 and 2011) is the longest in Reach history. \n*In 2010, the KVHS [[Reach for the Top]] team won the national championship.  KV is the second team from New Brunswick to win the title in the 45-year history of the game.  The team was 60-0 in all games played including national, provincial, and invitational (UTS Event) play.  This was their fourth consecutive top-3 finish at Nationals. \n* Between April 2004 and November 2011, the KVHS Reach for the Top team won 273 consecutive games (40 consecutive tournaments) in New Brunswick. This is considered to be the longest streak ever in any province.\n*In April 2015, the KVHS [[Reach for the Top]] team won the UTS [[University of Toronto Schools]] championship among many other teams competing in a close competition.\n*In May 2015, the KVHS [[Reach for the Top]] team came in second place in the National Championship.\n*In May 2016, the KVHS [[Reach for the Top]] team won the national championship.\n*In May 2017, two KVHS students competed in the \"nationals\" for the Canadian Parents for French National Speech Competition <ref>http://nb.cpf.ca/actvities/youth-activities/concours-dart-oratoire/</ref>\n\n==Artistic achievements==\nKVHS is known in New Brunswick for their success at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928001228/http://www.nbdramafest.com/main.html New Brunswick Drama festival] every year. The theatre program was started by the original principal William Bishop. Suzanne Doyle-Yerxa then ran the theatre program at the school from 1977 to 2010 before her retirement in June 2010. That year, a scholarship was commemorated under her name: [http://www.suzannedoyleyerxa.com/ The Suzanne Doyle-Yerxa award]. It is awarded to a student who plans to pursue the performing arts or creative arts as a post secondary study. KVHS has also received attention for its strong visual arts and music programs.\n\n== Notable Alumni ==\n\nChris Lee, NHL Referee\n\n[[Randy Jones (ice hockey)]], former NHL player\n\nMatt Marr, finalist on [[So You Think You Can Dance Canada (season 4)]]\n\nJ.

It was not until the [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat]] that we discovered \"a world we did not know\", explains Antoine Blanca, a diplomat for the French [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]]. According to him, solidarity with the Chilean left was \"the first challenge worthy of the name, against Washington, of an International which, until then, had done everything to appear subject to American strategy and NATO\". Subsequently, notably under the leadership of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], the SI supported the [[sandinists|sandinistas]] in Nicaragua and other movements in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in their struggle against US-supported dictatorships.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Les enfants cach\u00e9s du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Pinochet.
