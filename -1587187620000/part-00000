A value of zero indicates complete equality (for example, if each household received the same amount of income), and a value of one indicates complete inequality (for example, if a single household received all the income). Thus, a Gini coefficient that increases over time indicates rising income inequality.\" \n\n\"The Gini coefficient can also be interpreted as a measure of one-half of the average difference in income between every pair of households in the population, divided by the average income of the total population. For example, the Gini coefficient of 0.513 for 2016 indicates that the average difference in income between pairs of households in that year was equal to 102.6 percent (twice 0.513) of average household income in 2016, or about $70,700 (adjusted to account for differences in household size). Similarly, the Gini coefficient of 0.521 projected for 2021 indicates that the average difference in income between pairs of households would equal 104.2 percent (twice 0.521) of average household income in 2021, or about $77,800 (in 2016 dollars).\"{{ r | CBO_IE_Fcst | p=22-24 }}\n\n[[File:U.S. Top 1%25 Income Shares, CBO and PSZ Data 1979-2016.png|thumb|238x238px|Top 1% share of US income pre-tax (blue and orange) and after-tax (green).<ref name=\"PSZ_2016data\">{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/|title=Distributional National Accounts|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"CBO_2016\" />]]\n[[File:Income inequality panel - v1.png|alt=|thumb|238x238px|Four charts that describe trends in income inequality in the United States.

Thus, a Gini coefficient that increases over time indicates rising income inequality.\" \n\n\"The Gini coefficient can also be interpreted as a measure of one-half of the average difference in income between every pair of households in the population, divided by the average income of the total population. For example, the Gini coefficient of 0.513 for 2016 indicates that the average difference in income between pairs of households in that year was equal to 102.6 percent (twice 0.513) of average household income in 2016, or about $70,700 (adjusted to account for differences in household size). Similarly, the Gini coefficient of 0.521 projected for 2021 indicates that the average difference in income between pairs of households would equal 104.2 percent (twice 0.521) of average household income in 2021, or about $77,800 (in 2016 dollars).\"{{ r | CBO_IE_Fcst | p=22-24 }}\n\n[[File:U.S. Top 1%25 Income Shares, CBO and PSZ Data 1979-2016.png|thumb|238x238px|Top 1% share of US income pre-tax (blue and orange) and after-tax (green).<ref name=\"PSZ_2016data\">{{cite web|url=http://gabriel-zucman.eu/usdina/|title=Distributional National Accounts|accessdate=October 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"CBO_2016\" />]]\n[[File:Income inequality panel - v1.png|alt=|thumb|238x238px|Four charts that describe trends in income inequality in the United States.

Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured over a number of years should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income.

For example, Federal Reserve Economist Thomas Garrett wrote in 2010: \"It is important to understand that income inequality is a byproduct of a well-functioning capitalist economy.

A wary eye should be cast on policies that aim to shrink the income distribution by redistributing income from the more productive to the less productive simply for the sake of 'fairness.'\"<ref name=\"not-so-bad\">{{cite web|url=https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/inside-the-vault/spring-2010/us-income-inequality-its-not-so-bad|title=U.S. Income Inequality: It's Not So Bad|last=Garrett|first=Thomas A.|date=Spring 2010|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis}}</ref> Alternatively, bipartisan political majorities have supported redistributive policies such as the EITC.\n\nEconomists have proposed various approaches to reducing income inequality.

The impacts of those polieices varies as the policy regime changes. CBO reported in 2011 that: \"The equalizing effect of transfers declined over the 1979\u20132007 period primarily because the distribution of transfers became less progressive. The equalizing effect of federal taxes also declined over the period, in part because the amount of federal taxes shrank as a share of market income and in part because of changes in the progressivity of the federal tax system.\"<ref name=\"cbo.gov\"/>\n\nCBO income statistics show the growing importance of these items. In 1980, in-kind benefits and employer and government spending on health insurance accounted for just 6% of the after-tax incomes of households in the middle one-fifth of the distribution. By 2010 these in-kind income sources represented 17% of middle class households' after-tax income. Post-tax income items are increasing faster than pre-tax items. As a result of these programs, the spendable incomes of poor and middle-class families have been better insulated against recession-driven losses than the incomes of Americans in the top 1%.

Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical.<ref>Crick's 31 December 1961 letter to Jacque Monod cited above.</ref> Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the [[alpha helix]] by Linus Pauling in 1951,<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 158\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 147.</ref> but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 176\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 161.</ref>\n\nEver cautious, she wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that she routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA. In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, [[Max Perutz]], gave Crick a copy of a report written for a [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=Ruth |title=The Politics of Women's Biology |date=1990 |publisher=Rutgers State University |isbn=0-8135-1490-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 60] |url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 }}</ref>\n\nSince Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King's, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin's diffraction photographs by Gosling.

It is also quoted by both Maddox, p 204, and Olby.</ref> This was also one day after Franklin's two A-DNA papers had reached ''Acta Crystallographica''. Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin's biographer [[Brenda Maddox]] on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King's.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\">Maddox, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain how long it took for Gosling to inform Franklin at Birkbeck, but her original 17 March B-DNA manuscript does not reflect any knowledge of the Cambridge model. Franklin did modify this draft later before publishing it as the third in the trio of 25 April 1953 ''Nature'' articles. On 18 March,<ref>In contrast to his other letters to Crick, Wilkins dated this one.</ref> in response to receiving a copy of their preliminary manuscript, Wilkins penned the following: \"I think you're a couple of old rogues, but you may well have something\".<ref>\"Old rogues\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California at San Diego, and was posted as part of their web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p. 208, and Olby.</ref>\n\nWeeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model.<ref>10 April 1953 Franklin postcard to Crick asking permission to view model. The original is in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego.</ref> Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson\u2013Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She is reported to have commented, \"It's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?\" As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson\u2013Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.<ref>Holt, J. (2002).</ref>\n\nCrick and Watson then published their model in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 25 April 1953 in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging \"having been stimulated by a general knowledge of\" Franklin and Wilkins' \"unpublished\" contribution.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |authors=Watson, J.

Her new laboratories were housed in 21 Torrington Square, one of a pair of dilapidated and cramped Georgian houses containing several different departments; Franklin frequently took Bernal to task over the careless attitudes of some of the other laboratory staff, notably after workers in the pharmacy department flooded her first-floor laboratory with water on one occasion.<ref>Brown, Andrew, ''J. D. Bernal, the sage of science'' (2005), Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp. 353\u2013355.</ref>\n\nDespite the parting words of Bernal to stop her interest in nucleic acids, she helped Gosling to finish his thesis, although she was no longer his official supervisor.

She again used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV), an [[RNA virus]]. Her meeting with Aaron Klug in early 1954 led to a longstanding and successful collaboration. Klug had just then earned his PhD from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and joined Birkbeck in late 1953. In 1955 Franklin published her first major works on TMV in ''Nature'', in which she described that all TMV virus particles were of the same length.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=RE. |title=Structure of Tobacco Mosaic Virus |journal=Nature |year=1955 |volume=175 |issue=4452 |pages=379\u2013381 |doi=10.1038/175379a0 |pmid=14356181 |bibcode=1955Natur.175..379F}}</ref> This was in direct contradiction to the ideas of the eminent virologist [[Norman Pirie]], though her observation ultimately proved correct.<ref>Maddox, p. 252.</ref>\n\nFranklin assigned the study of the complete structure of TMV to her PhD student Holmes.

She obtained Bernal's consent in July 1957, though serious concerns were raised after she disclosed her intentions to research live, instead of killed, polio virus at Birkbeck. Eventually, Bernal arranged for the virus to be safely stored at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] during the group's research. With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.<ref>Brown, p. 359.</ref>\n\nAfter Franklin's death, [[Aaron Klug|Klug]] succeeded her as group leader, and he, Finch and Holmes continued researching the structure of the polio virus. They eventually succeeded in obtaining extremely detailed X-ray images of the virus. In June 1959, Klug and Finch published the group's findings, revealing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry, and in the same paper suggested the possibility for all spherical viruses to possess the same symmetry, as it permitted the greatest possible number (60) of identical structural units.<ref>Brown, pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> The team moved to the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], Cambridge in 1962,<ref>Glynn, p. 153.</ref> and the old Torrington Square laboratories were demolished four years later, in May 1966.<ref>Brown, p. 466.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFranklin was best described as an [[agnostic]]. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own line of thinking. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused to believe in the [[existence of God]], and remarked, \"Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn't She?\"<ref>Glynn, p. 12.</ref> She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940:\n{{quote|[S]cience and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life&nbsp;... I do not accept your definition of faith i.e. belief in life after death&nbsp;... Your faith rests on the future of yourself and others as individuals, mine in the future and fate of our successors. It seems to me that yours is the more selfish&nbsp;...<ref>Glynn, p. 62.</ref> [as to] the question of a creator. A creator of what?&nbsp;... I see no reason to believe that a creator of protoplasm or primeval matter, if such there be, has any reason to be interested in our insignificant race in a tiny corner of the universe.<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\">Maddox, p. 61.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, she did not abandon Jewish traditions. As the only Jewish student at Lindores School, she had Hebrew lessons on her own while her friends went to church.<ref>Glynn, p. 19.</ref> She joined the Jewish Society while in her first term at Newnham College, Cambridge, out of respect of her grandfather's request.<ref>Glynn, p. 44.</ref> Franklin confided to her sister that she was \"always consciously a Jew\".<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\"/>\n\nFranklin loved travelling abroad, particularly [[trekking]]. She first \"qualified\" at Christmas 1929 for a vacation at [[Menton]], France, where her grandfather went to escape English winter.<ref>Glynn, p. 16.</ref> Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave her a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle at that time as \"vastly superior to that of English\".<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 33\">Polcovar, p. 33.</ref> In contrast, she described English people as having \"vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 59.</ref> Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home.<ref>Glynn, p. 33.</ref> In another instance, she trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. She slipped off on a slope, and was barely rescued.<ref>Glynn, p. 79.</ref> But she wrote to her mother, \"I am quite sure I could wander happily in France forever. I love the people, the country and the food.\"<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\">Polcovar, p. 41.</ref>\n\nShe made several professional trips to US, and was particularly jovial among her American friends and constantly displayed her sense of humour. William Ginoza of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] later recalled that she was the opposite of Watson's description of her, and as Maddox comments, Americans enjoyed her \"sunny side\".<ref>Maddox, p. 277.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The Double Helix,'' Watson provides his first-person account of the search for and discovery of DNA. He paints a sympathetic but sometimes critical portrait of Franklin. He praises her intellect and scientific acumen, but portrays her as difficult to work with and careless with her appearance. After introducing her in the book as \"Rosalind,\" he writes that he and his male colleagues usually referred to her as \"Rosy\", the name people at King's College London used behind her back.<ref>Watson, p. 16.</ref> She did not want to be called by that name because she had a great-aunt Rosy. In the family, she was called \"Ros\".<ref>Glynn, p. 157.</ref> To others, she was simply \"Rosalind\". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied \"I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind\", adding \"Most definitely not ''Rosy''.\"<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\">Maddox, p. 288.</ref>\n\nShe often expressed her political views. She initially blamed [[Winston Churchill]] for inciting the war, but later admired him for his speeches. She actively supported Professor [[John Ryle (physician)|John Ryle]] as an independent candidate for parliament in 1940, but he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\">Glynn, p. 52.</ref>\n\nShe did not seem to have an intimate relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth<ref name=genealogy/> and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with [[Ralph Miliband]] but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, but she did not understand the intention.<ref>Maddox, p. 261.</ref> She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress.<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\"/> Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her \"intelligence and beauty\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 51.</ref> According to [[Anne Sayre]], Franklin did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this{{when|date=February 2020}}. Mering wept when he visited her later,<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\"/> and destroyed all her letters.{{when|date=February 2020}}<ref>Maddox, p. 287.</ref>\n\nHer closest personal affair was probably with her once post-doctoral student [[Donald Caspar]]. In 1956, she visited him at his home in Colorado after her tour to [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she was known to remark later that Caspar was one \"she might have loved, might have married\". In her letter to Sayre, she described him as \"an ideal match\".<ref>Maddox, p. 283.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nIn mid-1956, while on a work-related trip to the United States, Franklin first began to suspect a health problem. While in New York she found difficulty in zipping her skirt; her stomach had bulged. Back in London she consulted Mair Livingstone, who asked her, \"You're not pregnant?\" to which she retorted, \"I wish I were.\" Her case was marked \"URGENT\".<ref>Maddox, p. 284.</ref> An operation on 4 September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen.<ref>Maddox, p. 285.</ref> After this period and other periods of hospitalization, Franklin spent time convalescing with various friends and family members. These included Anne Sayre, Francis Crick, his wife Odile, with whom Franklin had formed a strong friendship,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\"/> and finally with the Roland and Nina Franklin family where Rosalind's nieces and nephews bolstered her spirits.\n\nFranklin chose not to stay with her parents because her mother's uncontrollable grief and crying upset her too much. Even while undergoing cancer treatment, Franklin continued to work, and her group continued to produce results \u2013 seven papers in 1956 and six more in 1957.<ref>Maddox, p. 292.</ref> At the end of 1957, Franklin again fell ill and she was admitted to the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]. On 2 December, she made her will. She named her three brothers as executors and made her colleague Aaron Klug the principal beneficiary, who would receive \u00a33,000 and her Austin car. Her other friends Mair Livingstone would get \u00a32,000, Anne Piper \u00a31,000, and her nurse Miss Griffith \u00a3250. The remainder of the estate was to be used for charities.<ref>Maddox, p. 301.</ref>\n\nShe returned to work in January 1958, and she was given a promotion to Research Associate in Biophysics on 25 February.<ref>Maddox, p. 302.</ref> She fell ill again on 30 March, and she died on 16 April 1958, in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1958 5c 257 CHELSEA \u2013 Rosalind E.

She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule. However, Watson, at the time ignorant of the chemistry, failed to comprehend the crucial information, and this led to construction of a wrong model.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Everson |first1=Ted |title=The Gene: A Historical Perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=978-0-313-33449-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever/page/85 85] |url=https://archive.org/details/genehistoricalpe0000ever|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nThe other contribution included an X-ray photograph of B-DNA (called ''[[Photo 51]]'')<ref>Maddox, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref> taken by Franklin's student Gosling that was briefly shown to Watson by Wilkins in January 1953,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 196\">Maddox, p. 196.</ref><ref>Crick (1988), p. 67.</ref> and a report written for an MRC biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952 which was shown by Perutz at the Cavendish Laboratory to both Crick and Watson.

A preliminary version of much of the important material contained in the 1952 December MRC report had been presented by Franklin in a talk she had given in November 1951, which Watson had attended but not understood.<ref name=\"Maddox 199\"/><ref>Watson (1969).</ref>\n\nThe Perutz letter was as said one of three letters, published with letters by Wilkins and Watson, which discussed their various contributions. Watson clarified the importance of the data obtained from the MRC report as he had not recorded these data while attending Franklin's lecture in 1951. The upshot of all this was that when Crick and Watson started to build their model in February 1953 they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, and which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King's. It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model,<ref>Maddox, p. 316.</ref> but Gosling asserted in his 2013 interview that, \"Yes. Oh, she did know about that.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Attar |first1=N |title=Raymond Gosling: the man who crystallized genes |journal=Genome Biology |year=2013 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=402 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-402|pmid=23651528 |pmc=3663117}}</ref>\n\n====Recognition of her contribution to the model of DNA====\nUpon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure.<ref>Wilkins, p. 213.</ref> Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model.<ref>Wilkins, p. 214.</ref> He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery.<ref>Wilkins, p. 226.</ref> There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\"/>\n\nIndeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the ''Acta ''articles in press, or most easily, the third ''Nature'' paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. \"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\".<ref>Maddox, pp. 316\u2013317, and other parts of the epilogue.</ref>\n\nFifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, ''The Double Helix'', although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript.<ref>Watson, J.D. (1968), pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \"Winner Take All\" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.<ref>Sayre, A. (1975), pp. 156\u2013167.</ref>\n\nSayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College London\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of ''Nature'', served as the principal evidence:\n{{quote|\"Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication\".<ref name=\"FG\">{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=Rosalind E. |authorlink1=Rosalind Franklin |last2=Gosling |first2=R.

In her lecture notes, Franklin wrote the following:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sayre |first1=Anne |title=Rosalind Franklin and DNA |date=2000 |publisher=W. W.

Franklin chose the data rich \"A\" form while Wilkins selected the \"B\" form<ref name=\"Maddox 155\"/><ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 158\">Wilkins, p. 158.</ref> because, according to his self-written biography, Wilkins' preliminary pictures had hinted it might be [[helix|helical]]. The X-ray diffraction pictures, including the landmark ''[[Photo 51]]'' taken by Franklin's student  Gosling at this time,<ref name=\"Gosling_obit\" /> have been called by [[John Desmond Bernal]] as \"amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken\".<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 153\"/>\n\nBy the end of 1951 it was generally accepted at King's that the B form of DNA was a [[helix]], but after she had recorded an asymmetrical image in May 1952, Franklin became unconvinced that the A form of DNA was a helix.<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 176\">Wilkins, p. 176.</ref> In July 1952, as a practical joke on Wilkins (who frequently expressed his view that both forms of DNA were helical), Franklin and Gosling produced a funeral notice regretting the 'death' of helical crystalline DNA (A-DNA).<ref>Wilkins, p. 182.</ref> During 1952, they worked at applying the [[Patterson function]] to the X-ray pictures of DNA they had produced.<ref>Maddox, p. 168.</ref> This was a long and labour-intensive approach but would yield significant insight into the structure of the molecule.<ref>Maddox, p. 169.</ref><ref>Wilkins, pp. 232\u2013233.</ref>\n\nBy January 1953, Franklin had reconciled her conflicting data, concluding that both DNA forms had two helices, and had started to write a series of three draft manuscripts, two of which included a double helical DNA backbone (see below). Her two A-DNA manuscripts reached ''[[Acta Crystallographica]]'' in [[Copenhagen]] on 6 March 1953, one day before Crick and Watson had completed their model on B-DNA. She must have mailed them while the Cambridge team was building their model, and certainly had written them before she knew of their work.<ref name=\"Maddox 199\">Maddox, p. 199.</ref> On 8 July 1953 she modified one of these \"in proof\" ''Acta'' articles, \"in light of recent work\" by the King's and Cambridge research teams.<ref>Franklin and Gosling (1953).

Since Wilkins was not in his office, Watson went to Franklin's lab with his urgent message that they should all collaborate before Pauling discovered his error. The unimpressed Franklin became angry when Watson suggested she did not know how to interpret her own data. Watson hastily retreated, backing into Wilkins who had been attracted by the commotion. Wilkins commiserated with his harried friend and then showed Watson Franklin's DNA X-ray image.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hubbard |first1=Ruth |title=Women, Science, and Technology |date=2013 |publisher=Taylor and Francis |location=Hoboken |isbn=978-1-135-05542-4 |page=269 |edition=3rd |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=unO_AAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA269&dq=Wilkins%20Watson%20Franklin%20X-ray&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter=Science, Power, Gender: How DNA Became the Book of Life}}</ref> Watson, in turn, showed Wilkins a prepublication manuscript by Pauling and Corey, which contained a DNA structure remarkably like their first incorrect model.<ref>Yockey, pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\n====DNA research====\nIn February 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] of the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge University]] had started to build a [[molecular model]] of the B form of DNA using data similar to that available to both teams at King's. Much of their data was derived directly from research done at King's by Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin's research was completed by February 1953, ahead of her move to Birkbeck, and her data was critical.<ref>Crick's 31 December 1961 letter to Jacque Monod cited above.</ref> Model building had been applied successfully in the elucidation of the structure of the [[alpha helix]] by Linus Pauling in 1951,<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 158\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 147.</ref> but Franklin was opposed to prematurely building theoretical models, until sufficient data were obtained to properly guide the model building. She took the view that building a model was to be undertaken only after enough of the structure was known.<ref name=\"Wilkins, p. 176\" /><ref>Maddox, p. 161.</ref>\n\nEver cautious, she wanted to eliminate misleading possibilities. Photographs of her Birkbeck work table show that she routinely used small molecular models, although certainly not ones on the grand scale successfully used at Cambridge for DNA. In the middle of February 1953, Crick's thesis advisor, [[Max Perutz]], gave Crick a copy of a report written for a [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] biophysics committee visit to King's in December 1952, containing many of Franklin's crystallographic calculations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=Ruth |title=The Politics of Women's Biology |date=1990 |publisher=Rutgers State University |isbn=0-8135-1490-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 60] |url=https://archive.org/details/politicsofwomens00hubb/page/60 }}</ref>\n\nSince Franklin had decided to transfer to Birkbeck College and Randall had insisted that all DNA work must stay at King's, Wilkins was given copies of Franklin's diffraction photographs by Gosling. By 28 February 1953, Watson and Crick felt they had solved the problem enough for Crick to proclaim (in the local pub) that they had \"found the secret of life\".<ref>\"The Double Helix\", p. 115.</ref> However, they knew they must complete their model before they could be certain.<ref>\"The Double Helix\", p. 60.</ref>\n\nWatson and Crick finished building their model on 7 March 1953, one day before they received a letter from Wilkins stating that Franklin was finally leaving and they could put \"all hands to the pump\".<ref>\"All hands to the pump\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego, and was posted as part of their Web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p 204, and Olby.</ref> This was also one day after Franklin's two A-DNA papers had reached ''Acta Crystallographica''. Wilkins came to see the model the following week, according to Franklin's biographer [[Brenda Maddox]] on 12 March, and allegedly informed Gosling on his return to King's.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\">Maddox, p. 207.</ref>\n\nIt is uncertain how long it took for Gosling to inform Franklin at Birkbeck, but her original 17 March B-DNA manuscript does not reflect any knowledge of the Cambridge model. Franklin did modify this draft later before publishing it as the third in the trio of 25 April 1953 ''Nature'' articles. On 18 March,<ref>In contrast to his other letters to Crick, Wilkins dated this one.</ref> in response to receiving a copy of their preliminary manuscript, Wilkins penned the following: \"I think you're a couple of old rogues, but you may well have something\".<ref>\"Old rogues\" letter is preserved in the Crick archives at the University of California at San Diego, and was posted as part of their web collection. It is also quoted by both Maddox, p. 208, and Olby.</ref>\n\nWeeks later, on 10 April, Franklin wrote to Crick for permission to see their model.<ref>10 April 1953 Franklin postcard to Crick asking permission to view model. The original is in the Crick archives at the University of California, San Diego.</ref> Franklin retained her scepticism for premature model building even after seeing the Watson\u2013Crick model, and remained unimpressed. She is reported to have commented, \"It's very pretty, but how are they going to prove it?\" As an experimental scientist, Franklin seems to have been interested in producing far greater evidence before publishing-as-proven a proposed model. As such, her response to the Watson\u2013Crick model was in keeping with her cautious approach to science.<ref>Holt, J. (2002).</ref>\n\nCrick and Watson then published their model in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 25 April 1953 in an article describing the double-helical structure of DNA with only a footnote acknowledging \"having been stimulated by a general knowledge of\" Franklin and Wilkins' \"unpublished\" contribution.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |authors=Watson, J.

She obtained Bernal's consent in July 1957, though serious concerns were raised after she disclosed her intentions to research live, instead of killed, polio virus at Birkbeck. Eventually, Bernal arranged for the virus to be safely stored at the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]] during the group's research. With her group, Franklin then commenced deciphering the structure of the polio virus while it was in a crystalline state. She attempted to mount the virus crystals in capillary tubes for X-ray studies, but was forced to end her work due to her rapidly failing health.<ref>Brown, p. 359.</ref>\n\nAfter Franklin's death, [[Aaron Klug|Klug]] succeeded her as group leader, and he, Finch and Holmes continued researching the structure of the polio virus. They eventually succeeded in obtaining extremely detailed X-ray images of the virus. In June 1959, Klug and Finch published the group's findings, revealing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry, and in the same paper suggested the possibility for all spherical viruses to possess the same symmetry, as it permitted the greatest possible number (60) of identical structural units.<ref>Brown, pp. 360\u2013361.</ref> The team moved to the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], Cambridge in 1962,<ref>Glynn, p. 153.</ref> and the old Torrington Square laboratories were demolished four years later, in May 1966.<ref>Brown, p. 466.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nFranklin was best described as an [[agnostic]]. Her lack of religious faith apparently did not stem from anyone's influence, rather from her own line of thinking. She developed her scepticism as a young child. Her mother recalled that she refused to believe in the [[existence of God]], and remarked, \"Well, anyhow, how do you know He isn't She?\"<ref>Glynn, p. 12.</ref> She later made her position clear, now based on her scientific experience, and wrote to her father in 1940:\n{{quote|[S]cience and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life&nbsp;... I do not accept your definition of faith i.e. belief in life after death&nbsp;... Your faith rests on the future of yourself and others as individuals, mine in the future and fate of our successors. It seems to me that yours is the more selfish&nbsp;...<ref>Glynn, p. 62.</ref> [as to] the question of a creator. A creator of what?&nbsp;... I see no reason to believe that a creator of protoplasm or primeval matter, if such there be, has any reason to be interested in our insignificant race in a tiny corner of the universe.<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\">Maddox, p. 61.</ref>}}\n\nHowever, she did not abandon Jewish traditions. As the only Jewish student at Lindores School, she had Hebrew lessons on her own while her friends went to church.<ref>Glynn, p. 19.</ref> She joined the Jewish Society while in her first term at Newnham College, Cambridge, out of respect of her grandfather's request.<ref>Glynn, p. 44.</ref> Franklin confided to her sister that she was \"always consciously a Jew\".<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 61\"/>\n\nFranklin loved travelling abroad, particularly [[trekking]]. She first \"qualified\" at Christmas 1929 for a vacation at [[Menton]], France, where her grandfather went to escape English winter.<ref>Glynn, p. 16.</ref> Her family frequently spent vacations in Wales or Cornwall. A trip to France in 1938 gave her a lasting love for France and its language. She considered the French lifestyle at that time as \"vastly superior to that of English\".<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 33\">Polcovar, p. 33.</ref> In contrast, she described English people as having \"vacant stupid faces and childlike complacency\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 59.</ref> Her family was almost stuck in Norway in 1939, as World War II was declared on their way home.<ref>Glynn, p. 33.</ref> In another instance, she trekked the French Alps with Jean Kerslake in 1946, which almost cost her her life. She slipped off on a slope, and was barely rescued.<ref>Glynn, p. 79.</ref> But she wrote to her mother, \"I am quite sure I could wander happily in France forever. I love the people, the country and the food.\"<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\">Polcovar, p. 41.</ref>\n\nShe made several professional trips to US, and was particularly jovial among her American friends and constantly displayed her sense of humour. William Ginoza of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] later recalled that she was the opposite of Watson's description of her, and as Maddox comments, Americans enjoyed her \"sunny side\".<ref>Maddox, p. 277.</ref>\n\nIn his book ''The Double Helix,'' Watson provides his first-person account of the search for and discovery of DNA. He paints a sympathetic but sometimes critical portrait of Franklin. He praises her intellect and scientific acumen, but portrays her as difficult to work with and careless with her appearance. After introducing her in the book as \"Rosalind,\" he writes that he and his male colleagues usually referred to her as \"Rosy\", the name people at King's College London used behind her back.<ref>Watson, p. 16.</ref> She did not want to be called by that name because she had a great-aunt Rosy. In the family, she was called \"Ros\".<ref>Glynn, p. 157.</ref> To others, she was simply \"Rosalind\". She made it clear to an American visiting friend Dorothea Raacke, while sitting with her at Crick's table in [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] pub in Cambridge: Raacke asked her how she was to be called and she replied \"I'm afraid it will have to be Rosalind\", adding \"Most definitely not ''Rosy''.\"<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\">Maddox, p. 288.</ref>\n\nShe often expressed her political views. She initially blamed [[Winston Churchill]] for inciting the war, but later admired him for his speeches. She actively supported Professor [[John Ryle (physician)|John Ryle]] as an independent candidate for parliament in 1940, but he was unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\">Glynn, p. 52.</ref>\n\nShe did not seem to have an intimate relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth<ref name=genealogy/> and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with [[Ralph Miliband]] but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, but she did not understand the intention.<ref>Maddox, p. 261.</ref> She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had a wife and a mistress.<ref name=\"Polcovar, p. 41\"/> Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her \"intelligence and beauty\".<ref>Polcovar, p. 51.</ref> According to [[Anne Sayre]], Franklin did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this{{when|date=February 2020}}. Mering wept when he visited her later,<ref name=\"Glynn, p. 52\"/> and destroyed all her letters.{{when|date=February 2020}}<ref>Maddox, p. 287.</ref>\n\nHer closest personal affair was probably with her once post-doctoral student [[Donald Caspar]]. In 1956, she visited him at his home in Colorado after her tour to [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she was known to remark later that Caspar was one \"she might have loved, might have married\". In her letter to Sayre, she described him as \"an ideal match\".<ref>Maddox, p. 283.</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\nIn mid-1956, while on a work-related trip to the United States, Franklin first began to suspect a health problem. While in New York she found difficulty in zipping her skirt; her stomach had bulged. Back in London she consulted Mair Livingstone, who asked her, \"You're not pregnant?\" to which she retorted, \"I wish I were.\" Her case was marked \"URGENT\".<ref>Maddox, p. 284.</ref> An operation on 4 September of the same year revealed two tumours in her abdomen.<ref>Maddox, p. 285.</ref> After this period and other periods of hospitalization, Franklin spent time convalescing with various friends and family members. These included Anne Sayre, Francis Crick, his wife Odile, with whom Franklin had formed a strong friendship,<ref name=\"Maddox, p. 288\"/> and finally with the Roland and Nina Franklin family where Rosalind's nieces and nephews bolstered her spirits.\n\nFranklin chose not to stay with her parents because her mother's uncontrollable grief and crying upset her too much. Even while undergoing cancer treatment, Franklin continued to work, and her group continued to produce results \u2013 seven papers in 1956 and six more in 1957.<ref>Maddox, p. 292.</ref> At the end of 1957, Franklin again fell ill and she was admitted to the [[Royal Marsden Hospital]]. On 2 December, she made her will. She named her three brothers as executors and made her colleague Aaron Klug the principal beneficiary, who would receive \u00a33,000 and her Austin car. Her other friends Mair Livingstone would get \u00a32,000, Anne Piper \u00a31,000, and her nurse Miss Griffith \u00a3250. The remainder of the estate was to be used for charities.<ref>Maddox, p. 301.</ref>\n\nShe returned to work in January 1958, and she was given a promotion to Research Associate in Biophysics on 25 February.<ref>Maddox, p. 302.</ref> She fell ill again on 30 March, and she died on 16 April 1958, in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], London,<ref>GRO Register of Deaths: JUN 1958 5c 257 CHELSEA \u2013 Rosalind E.

She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. Franklin was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule.

A preliminary version of much of the important material contained in the 1952 December MRC report had been presented by Franklin in a talk she had given in November 1951, which Watson had attended but not understood.<ref name=\"Maddox 199\"/><ref>Watson (1969).</ref>\n\nThe Perutz letter was as said one of three letters, published with letters by Wilkins and Watson, which discussed their various contributions. Watson clarified the importance of the data obtained from the MRC report as he had not recorded these data while attending Franklin's lecture in 1951. The upshot of all this was that when Crick and Watson started to build their model in February 1953 they were working with critical parameters that had been determined by Franklin in 1951, and which she and Gosling had significantly refined in 1952, as well as with published data and other very similar data to those available at King's. It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model,<ref>Maddox, p. 316.</ref> but Gosling asserted in his 2013 interview that, \"Yes. Oh, she did know about that.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Attar |first1=N |title=Raymond Gosling: the man who crystallized genes |journal=Genome Biology |year=2013 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=402 |doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-4-402|pmid=23651528 |pmc=3663117}}</ref>\n\n====Recognition of her contribution to the model of DNA====\nUpon the completion of their model, Crick and Watson had invited Wilkins to be a co-author of their paper describing the structure.<ref>Wilkins, p. 213.</ref> Wilkins turned down this offer, as he had taken no part in building the model.<ref>Wilkins, p. 214.</ref> He later expressed regret that greater discussion of co-authorship had not taken place as this might have helped to clarify the contribution the work at King's had made to the discovery.<ref>Wilkins, p. 226.</ref> There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953. Some, including Maddox, have explained this citation omission by suggesting that it may be a question of circumstance, because it would have been very difficult to cite the unpublished work from the MRC report they had seen.<ref name=\"Maddox 207\"/>\n\nIndeed, a clear timely acknowledgment would have been awkward, given the unorthodox manner in which data were transferred from King's to Cambridge. However, methods were available. Watson and Crick could have cited the MRC report as a personal communication or else cited the ''Acta ''articles in press, or most easily, the third ''Nature'' paper that they knew was in press. One of the most important accomplishments of Maddox's widely acclaimed biography is that Maddox made a well-received case for inadequate acknowledgement. \"Such acknowledgement as they gave her was very muted and always coupled with the name of Wilkins\".<ref>Maddox, pp. 316\u2013317, and other parts of the epilogue.</ref>\n\nFifteen years after the fact, the first clear recitation of Franklin's contribution appeared as it permeated Watson's account, ''The Double Helix'', although it was buried under descriptions of Watson's (often quite negative) regard towards Franklin during the period of their work on DNA. This attitude is epitomized in the confrontation between Watson and Franklin over a preprint of Pauling's mistaken DNA manuscript.<ref>Watson, J.D. (1968), pp. 95\u201396.</ref> Watson's words impelled Sayre to write her rebuttal, in which the entire chapter nine, \"Winner Take All\" has the structure of a legal brief dissecting and analyzing the topic of acknowledgement.<ref>Sayre, A. (1975), pp. 156\u2013167.</ref>\n\nSayre's early analysis was often ignored because of perceived feminist overtones in her book. Watson and Crick did not cite the X-ray diffraction work of Wilkins and Franklin in their original paper, though they admit having \"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College London\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In fact, Watson and Crick cited no experimental data at all in support of their model. Franklin and Gosling's publication of the DNA X-ray image, in the same issue of ''Nature'', served as the principal evidence:\n{{quote|\"Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication\".<ref name=\"FG\">{{cite journal |last1=Franklin |first1=Rosalind E. |authorlink1=Rosalind Franklin |last2=Gosling |first2=R.

The [[Kennedy Space Center]] will remain at stage 3, with one member of the workforce that has tested positive but given mandatory telework policy the individual had not been on site for over a week prior to symptoms.\n\nAt Stage 4, mandatory telework is in effect for all personnel, with the exception of limited personnel required for mission-essential work and to care-take, maintain the safety and security of the facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/bridenstine/2020/03/24/march-24-update-on-nasa-response-to-coronavirus/|title=March 24 Update on NASA Response to Coronavirus \u2013 Administrator Jim Bridenstine|website=blogs.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325035806/https://blogs.nasa.gov/bridenstine/2020/03/24/march-24-update-on-nasa-response-to-coronavirus/|archive-date=2020-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Companies====\nSmall aerospace companies such as [[Bigelow Aerospace]] have collapsed as a result of the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/bigelow-aerospace-lays-off-entire-workforce/|title=Bigelow Aerospace lays off entire workforce|date=March 23, 2020|website=SpaceNews.com}}</ref> Larger companies such as [[SpaceX]] and [[Boeing]] remain somewhat economically unaffected, apart from extra safety precautions and measures for their employees to limit the spread of the virus in their workplaces.\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[European Space Agency]] has ordered many of its science and technology facilities' workforce to also telework as much as possible.\n\nRecent developments, including strengthened restrictions by national, regional and local authorities across Europe and the first positive test result for COVID-19 within the workforce at the [[European Space Operations Centre]], have led the agency to restrict on-site personnel at its mission control centres even further.\n\nESA's Director of Operations - Rolf Densing, has strongly recommended mission personnel to reduce activity of scientific missions, especially on interplanetary spacecraft.\n\nThe affected spacecraft are currently in stable orbits and long mission durations, so turning off their science instruments and placing them into a largely unattended safe configuration for a certain period will have a negligible impact on their overall mission performance.\n\nAmong the affected missions are:\n\n*[[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] \u2013 A four-spacecraft mission launched in 2000, orbiting Earth to investigate our planet's magnetic environment and how it is forged by the solar wind, the stream of charged particles constantly released by the Sun;\n*[[ExoMars]] Trace Gas Orbiter \u2013 Launched in 2016, the spacecraft is in orbit around Mars, where it has been investigating the planet's atmosphere and providing data relay for landers on the surface;\n*[[Mars Express]] \u2013 Launched in 2003, the workhorse orbiter has been imaging the Martian surface and sampling the planet's atmosphere for over one and a half decades;\n*[[Solar Orbiter]] \u2013 ESA's newest science mission, launched in February 2020 and currently en route to its science operations orbit around the Sun.\n\nESA's Director of Science - G\u00fcnther Hasinger, commented: \u201cIt was a difficult decision, but the right one to take. Our greatest responsibility is the safety of people, and I know all of us in the science community understand why this is necessary\".\n\nThe temporary reduction in personnel on site will also allow the ESOC teams to concentrate on maintaining spacecraft safety for all other missions involved, in particular, the Mercury explorer [[BepiColombo]], which is on its way to the innermost planet in the [[Solar System]] and will require some on-site support around its scheduled Earth flyby on 10 April.\n\nThe challenging manoeuvre, which will use Earth's gravity to adjust BepiColombo's trajectory as it cruises towards Mercury, will be performed by a very small number of engineers and in full respect of social distancing and other health and hygiene measures required by the current situation. Commissioning and first check-out operations of scientific instruments on the recently launched Solar Orbiter, which had begun last month, have been temporarily suspended.\n\nESA expects to resume these operations in the near future, in line with the development of the coronavirus situation. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter will continue its journey towards the Sun, with the first Venus flyby to take place in December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_scales_down_science_mission_operations_amid_pandemic|title=ESA scales down science mission operations amid pandemic|website=esa.int|access-date=2020-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324133913/http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_scales_down_science_mission_operations_amid_pandemic|archive-date=2020-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[JAXA]] space and science operations largely remain unaffected.

A small number of staff have been authorized to attend the sites to provide an essential service such as maintenance of animal facilities or data services. All other staff have been instructed to stay at home. EMBL has also cancelled all visits to sites by non-staff groups. This includes physical participation in the Courses and Conferences programme at Heidelberg, the EMBL-EBI Training courses, and all other seminars, courses and public visits at all sites. Meanwhile, the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] is creating a European COVID-19 Data Platform for data/information exchange. The goal is to collect and share rapidly available research data to enable synergies, cross-fertilisation and use of diverse data sets with different degrees of aggregation, validation and/or completeness. The platform is envisaged to consist of two connected components, the SARS-CoV-2 Data Hubs organising the flow of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak sequence data and providing comprehensive open data sharing for the European and global research communities, and one broader COVID-19 Portal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/lab-matters/corona-updates/|title=EMBL's response to the coronavirus outbreak}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embl.org/news/science/embl-ebi-leads-international-collaboration-to-share-covid-19-research-data/?_ga=2.135566577.1552695299.1585763730-859685221.1575360586|title=EMBL-EBI leads International collaboration to share COVID-19 research data}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/pathogens/covid-19|title=EMBL-EBI COVID-19 Data Platform}}</ref>\n\nThe [[World Meteorological Organization]] expressed concern about the observation system.

The [[Kennedy Space Center]] will remain at stage 3, with one member of the workforce that has tested positive but given mandatory telework policy the individual had not been on site for over a week prior to symptoms.\n\nAt Stage 4, mandatory telework is in effect for all personnel, with the exception of limited personnel required for mission-essential work and to care-take, maintain the safety and security of the facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/bridenstine/2020/03/24/march-24-update-on-nasa-response-to-coronavirus/|title=March 24 Update on NASA Response to Coronavirus \u2013 Administrator Jim Bridenstine|website=blogs.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325035806/https://blogs.nasa.gov/bridenstine/2020/03/24/march-24-update-on-nasa-response-to-coronavirus/|archive-date=2020-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Companies====\nSmall aerospace companies such as [[Bigelow Aerospace]] have collapsed as a result of the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/bigelow-aerospace-lays-off-entire-workforce/|title=Bigelow Aerospace lays off entire workforce|date=March 23, 2020|website=SpaceNews.com}}</ref> Larger companies such as [[SpaceX]] and [[Boeing]] remain somewhat economically unaffected, apart from extra safety precautions and measures for their employees to limit the spread of the virus in their workplaces.\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[European Space Agency]] has ordered many of its science and technology facilities' workforce to also telework as much as possible.\n\nRecent developments, including strengthened restrictions by national, regional and local authorities across Europe and the first positive test result for COVID-19 within the workforce at the [[European Space Operations Centre]], have led the agency to restrict on-site personnel at its mission control centres even further.\n\nESA's Director of Operations - Rolf Densing, has strongly recommended mission personnel to reduce activity of scientific missions, especially on interplanetary spacecraft.\n\nThe affected spacecraft are currently in stable orbits and long mission durations, so turning off their science instruments and placing them into a largely unattended safe configuration for a certain period will have a negligible impact on their overall mission performance.\n\nAmong the affected missions are:\n\n*[[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] \u2013 A four-spacecraft mission launched in 2000, orbiting Earth to investigate our planet's magnetic environment and how it is forged by the solar wind, the stream of charged particles constantly released by the Sun;\n*[[ExoMars]] Trace Gas Orbiter \u2013 Launched in 2016, the spacecraft is in orbit around Mars, where it has been investigating the planet's atmosphere and providing data relay for landers on the surface;\n*[[Mars Express]] \u2013 Launched in 2003, the workhorse orbiter has been imaging the Martian surface and sampling the planet's atmosphere for over one and a half decades;\n*[[Solar Orbiter]] \u2013 ESA's newest science mission, launched in February 2020 and currently en route to its science operations orbit around the Sun.\n\nESA's Director of Science - G\u00fcnther Hasinger, commented: \u201cIt was a difficult decision, but the right one to take. Our greatest responsibility is the safety of people, and I know all of us in the science community understand why this is necessary\".\n\nThe temporary reduction in personnel on site will also allow the ESOC teams to concentrate on maintaining spacecraft safety for all other missions involved, in particular, the Mercury explorer [[BepiColombo]], which is on its way to the innermost planet in the [[Solar System]] and will require some on-site support around its scheduled Earth flyby on 10 April.\n\nThe challenging manoeuvre, which will use Earth's gravity to adjust BepiColombo's trajectory as it cruises towards Mercury, will be performed by a very small number of engineers and in full respect of social distancing and other health and hygiene measures required by the current situation. Commissioning and first check-out operations of scientific instruments on the recently launched Solar Orbiter, which had begun last month, have been temporarily suspended.\n\nESA expects to resume these operations in the near future, in line with the development of the coronavirus situation. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter will continue its journey towards the Sun, with the first Venus flyby to take place in December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_scales_down_science_mission_operations_amid_pandemic|title=ESA scales down science mission operations amid pandemic|website=esa.int|access-date=2020-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324133913/http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_scales_down_science_mission_operations_amid_pandemic|archive-date=2020-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[JAXA]] space and science operations largely remain unaffected.
