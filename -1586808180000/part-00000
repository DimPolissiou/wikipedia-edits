It controlled Allied ground operations in northern [[Burma]]. For most of its existence NCAC was commanded by [[United States Army|US Army]] General [[Joseph Stilwell|Joseph \"Vinegar Joe\" Stilwell]] (who concurrently held more senior command positions). In 1945 after Stilwell was recalled, his deputy, Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan|Daniel Sultan]], was promoted to and assumed command.\n\n[[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese National Army]] personnel constituted most of the combat units within NCAC.\n\nWhile it was initially intended that NCAC would operate as an integral part of the [[British 11th Army Group]], Stilwell refused to work under General [[George Giffard]] and was made subordinate to the Supreme Commander of SEAC, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]].\n\n==Composition==\nIn 1942, Northern Combat Area Command was formed at [[Ramgarh Cantonment]], in India, from [[X Force]]:  units (including the [[Chinese 22nd Division|22nd]] and [[Chinese 38th Division|38th]] Divisions), which had [[Japanese capture of Burma|retreated out of Burma]]. After its arrival in India, X Force was reinforced \u2013 eventually becoming the [[New 1st Army]] \u2013 a [[corps|corps-level]] formation. It was re-equipped at [[United Kingdom|British]] expense and re-trained by US Army instructors.\n\nFor the [[Burma Campaign 1944|campaigning season of early 1944]], NCAC was augmented with [[Merrill's Marauders]] \u2013 a brigade-sized formation created by the US Army for commando-type operations in Burma. During 1944, NCAC forced the [[Japanese 18th Division]] to retreat out of northern Burma and US Army engineering battalions, assisted by [[India]]n laborers built the [[Ledo Road]] \u2013 which joined the northern end of the [[Burma Road]] and reestablished [[line of communications|communications]] between India and China. Towards the end of 1944, NCAC was reinforced by the [[British 36th Infantry Division]].\n\nIn 1945, under Sultan's command, NCAC \u2013 which now included the Chinese [[New 6th Army]] \u2013 aided in the drive to retake the rest of Burma.\n\n==Campaigns==\nThe main combat power of NCAC, at least in terms of numbers were its Chinese divisions. When British and Chinese forces had been bundled out of Burma at the start of 1942, some Chinese forces had been obliged to retreat to [[India]], rather than to [[China]]. It was from these formations that the genesis of NCAC came.\n\nMany times during World War II, British and American commanders in India were frustrated by their Chinese allies. A combination of fickleness and over-centralisation by the Chinese [[generalissimo]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the limited training of the Chinese forces meant that they often failed to live up to their potential. However, the Chinese forces in NCAC were considerably better than their contemporaries in China itself. Greater access to American equipment and training and less influence from the Chinese leadership meant the four Chinese divisions in NCAC could be trusted a great deal more in combat.\n\nHowever, it was not only from NCAC's divisions that trouble sprang. Its first commander was an extremely controversial character. Stilwell had first been posted to China as Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-shek. However, as the campaign in Burma developed, he also took on a role there. The [[United States Army|US Army]] established the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China Burma India Theater]] (CBI Theater), and placed Stilwell in command. The CBI Theater was not supposed to be an operational headquarters. It was merely supposed to be in charge of the administration of the American military formations in China, Burma and India. However, Stilwell often broke the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] and communicated directly with the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] on operational matters, when all such communications were supposed to go to Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] the [[South East Asia Command|Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia]] and also on taking operational control of NCAC through General [[George Giffard]] commander of [[British 11th Army Group|11th Army Group]].\n\nThe initial idea was that as General Stilwell would be commanding several Chinese divisions which would attack out of India from the West and with the large but amorphous Yunnan armies attacking out of China from the East, he would be commanding a large army. So his command should be placed under 11th Army Group at the same level as the [[British Fourteenth Army|Fourteenth]] which was under the command of General [[William Slim]]. The attacks could then be co-ordinated at Army Group level.\n\n{{quote|Stilwell, however bitterly resisted [being under Giffard's command]. To watch Stilwell, when hard pressed, shift his opposition from one of the several strong-points he held by virtue of his numerous Allied, American and Chinese offices, to another was a lesson in mobile offensive-defence.|William Slim.{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=205}} }}\n\nAt a meeting to sort out the operational chain of command for the three fronts in Burma, Stilwell astonished everyone by saying \"I am prepared to come under General  Slim's operational control until I get to [[Kamaing]]\".{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=207}} Rather than sack him, Mountbatten reluctantly agreed to this, but it was a dangerous compromise. It created a complicated chain of command where Slim theoretically had to report to two different commanders. Giffard for Fourteenth Army actions and Mountbatten for Stilwell's formations. Under a general less gifted than Slim this could have caused serious problems, if Slim had not been able to command Stilwell at an operational level without disagreement (which given Stilwell's proven track record was more than likely). But at an operational level Slim was able to work with Stilwell and \"this illogical command set-up worked surprisingly well\".{{sfn|Slim|1956|p=207}}\n\nThe reason why it was essential that there was one operational commander for the three fronts, North, Central and Southern, was so that the intended attacks in late 1944 could be co-ordinated to prevent the Japanese concentrating large numbers of reserves for a counterattack on any one front.\n\nStilwell thus had four different jobs to perform, which required him to be in different places at once. For example, as Chief of Staff to Chiang, he was often needed in [[Chungking]], the Chinese capital, and as Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was needed at HQ South East Asia Command at [[Kandy]] in [[Ceylon]] and as NCAC commander he was required to be relatively near the frontline in Burma. His personality also caused problems. Stilwell clashed frequently with the commander of the 11th Army Group, General Giffard, and would not accept being under his command, instead insisting that NCAC came directly under the Supreme Commander. As Deputy Allied Supreme Commander he was Giffard's superior but as operational commander of NCAC Giffard was his superior, as the two men did not get on this inevitablely lead to conflict and confusion.\n\nNCAC's first months were frustrating, as the time was for all Allied formations in the theater. Its first real success did not come until the 1943-44 campaigning season. The [[Chindits]] had been dropped behind enemy lines after the end of the 1943 monsoon to cause havoc by cutting communications. This they did, but the original operational plan failed for a number of reasons. In the end, they were sent northwards into NCAC's area of operations.\n\nAt the time, NCAC's main job was to capture the town of [[Myitkyina]], as a prelude to connecting the [[Ledo Road]] to the [[Burma Road]] and reestablishing land communications to China.  During the offensive, NCAC intelligence staff serving under General Stilwell repeatedly underestimated Japanese troop strength in Burma.{{sfn|George|1981|p=492}}{{sfn|Tuchman|2001|p=450}}  A thrust from the northwest by NCAC was meeting with some success, but Stilwell also needed to use the Chindits in his plan. However, he not only used them, but misused them. The Chindits were designed as a light raiding force, not as conventional infantry. They had negligible artillery support, and were much smaller in number than equivalent conventional formations. However, Stilwell insisted on using them as conventional infantry. He assigned them the task of [[Battle of Mogaung|capturing Mogaung]] south of Myitkyina, which was strongly held by the Japanese. The Chindits succeeded in their task, but had horrendous casualties. Even then Stilwell was not finished. He demanded still further miracles from the Chindits and their commander Brigadier [[Walter David Alexander Lentaigne|Lentaigne]]. Reduced to the equivalent of less than a battalion, the Chindits assisted in the final assault on Myitkyina before finally bein flown out to India as a completely broken force, almost to a man. The American equivalent of the Chindits, [[Merrill's Marauders]] also suffered from the same treatment during the campaign, consistently being asked to perform missions that were beyond their power without superhuman effort.\n\nAfter the fall of Myitkyina, only a small area of Japanese territory separated NCAC from the Chinese forces. As the 1944 monsoon ended, NCAC opened an offensive. It had been reinforced with the [[British 36th Infantry Division]], which gave it a considerably increased punch. However, the [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|Japanese 33rd Army]] under General [[Masaki Honda]] performed a very creditable delaying action against the forces attacking them. The Japanese were outnumbered several times, but still managed to hold the Chinese forces at bay for several months. In the end, it was events on the main front further south that forced them to withdraw, as they were in danger of being cut off from their supply lines. 36th Division was used to support the left wing of the [[British Fourteenth Army|Fourteenth Army]] under Lieutenant General [[William Slim]].\n\nIn October 1944, due to personal disagreements with Chiang, Stilwell was recalled to the [[United States]] by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]]. His former role was split as was the CBI Theater:\n*  Lieutenant General [[Raymond Albert Wheeler|Raymond Wheeler]] became Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia.\n*  Major General [[Albert Coady Wedemeyer|Albert Wedemeyer]] became Chief of Staff to ''Chiang Kai-shek'' and commander of the U.S. Forces, China Theater (USFCT).\n* Lieutenant General [[Daniel Isom Sultan]] was promoted from deputy commander of CBI to become commander of the U.S. Forces, India-Burma Theater (USFIBT) and commander of the NCAC.\n\nHis replacements were not only less abrasive characters, but as they each concentrated on one area there was less institutional conflict and confusion.\n\nNCAC's main role in the last few months of the war was to support the British main offensive further south, and to further improve the Burma Road to allow more supplies to get into China.\n\nAfter the war, NCAC was quickly disbanded. It had achieved its objectives, but the route to those objectives was strewn with command problems and missed opportunities.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|South-East Asian Theatre]]\n* [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation |last=George |first=John |year=1981 |title=Shots Fired In Anger |publisher=NRA Press}}\n*{{citation |last=Slim |first=William |authorlink=William Slim |year=1956 |title=Defeat into Victory|location=London |publisher=Cassell }}\n*Tuchman, Barbara W.

{"title_page": "Regnecentralen", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Regnecentralen logo.svg|thumb|Logo of Regnecentralen]]\n'''Regnecentralen''' ('''RC''') was the first [[Denmark|Danish]] [[computer]] company, founded on October 12, 1955. Through the 1950s and 1960s, they designed a series of computers, originally for their own use, and later to be sold commercially. Descendants of these systems sold well into the 1980s. They also developed a series of high-speed [[paper tape]] machines, and produced [[Data General Nova]] machines under license.\n\n==Genesis==\n\nWhat would become RC began as an advisory board formed by the Danish ''Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber'' (''Academy of Applied Sciences'') to keep abreast of developments in modern electronic [[Computer|computing devices]] taking place in other countries. After several years in the advisory role, in 1952 they decided to form a computing [[service bureau]] for Danish government, military and research uses. Led by Niels Ivar Bech, the group was also given the details of the [[BESK]] machine being designed at the Swedish Mathematical Center (Matematikmaskinnamndens Arbetsgrupp).\n\nThe group decided to build their own version of the BESK to run the bureau, and formed Regnecentralen in October 1955 to complete and run the machine. The result was the [[DASK]], a [[vacuum tube]]-based machine that completed construction in 1956 and went into full operation in February 1957. DASK was followed in 1961 by the fully [[transistor]]ized GIER, used for similar tasks. GIER is an acronym for \"[[Geod\u00e6tisk Institut]]s Elektroniske Regnemaskine\" (Institute of Geodetics Electronic Calculator) and was introduced there on September 14, 1961. GIER proved to be a useful machine, and went on to be used at many Danish universities. Bech also sold GIER machines to the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, starting with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Bulgaria]], and later [[Romania]], the [[East Germany]], and [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nRC was also home to [[Peter Naur]], and DASK and GIER became well known for their role in the development of the famous programming language [[ALGOL]]. After the first European ALGOL conference in 1959, RC began an effort to produce a series of compilers, completing one for the DASK in September 1961. A version for the GIER followed in August 1962. Christian Andersen and Peter Schyum Poulsen, another RC employee, wrote the first introductory text on the language, ''Everyman's Desk ALGOL'', in 1961.\n\n==Peripheral business==\n\nTo support higher throughput at their own service bureau, RC developed several high-speed [[input/output]] devices. One of their most popular was the [[RC 2000]] [[paper tape]] reader, introduced in 1963. Feeding the tape at 5 meters per second, the 2000 could read 2,000 characters per second (CPS), storing the results in a buffer while the computer periodically read the data back out instead of stopping the tape to wait for the computer to get ready. The machine was later upgraded as the RC 2500, increasing speed to almost 7 meters a second, improving read speed to 2500 CPS. The RC 2000/2500 became a major product for RC during the 1960s, selling 1,500 examples around the world.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, they designed a series of computers, originally for their own use, and later to be sold commercially. Descendants of these systems sold well into the 1980s. They also developed a series of high-speed [[paper tape]] machines, and produced [[Data General Nova]] machines under license.\n\n==Genesis==\n\nWhat would become RC began as an advisory board formed by the Danish ''Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber'' (''Academy of Applied Sciences'') to keep abreast of developments in modern electronic [[Computer|computing devices]] taking place in other countries. After several years in the advisory role, in 1952 they decided to form a computing [[service bureau]] for Danish government, military and research uses. Led by Niels Ivar Bech, the group was also given the details of the [[BESK]] machine being designed at the Swedish Mathematical Center (Matematikmaskinnamndens Arbetsgrupp).\n\nThe group decided to build their own version of the BESK to run the bureau, and formed Regnecentralen in October 1955 to complete and run the machine. The result was the [[DASK]], a [[vacuum tube]]-based machine that completed construction in 1956 and went into full operation in February 1957. DASK was followed in 1961 by the fully [[transistor]]ized GIER, used for similar tasks. GIER is an acronym for \"[[Geod\u00e6tisk Institut]]s Elektroniske Regnemaskine\" (Institute of Geodetics Electronic Calculator) and was introduced there on September 14, 1961. GIER proved to be a useful machine, and went on to be used at many Danish universities. Bech also sold GIER machines to the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, starting with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Bulgaria]], and later [[Romania]], the [[East Germany]], and [[Yugoslavia]].\n\nRC was also home to [[Peter Naur]], and DASK and GIER became well known for their role in the development of the famous programming language [[ALGOL]]. After the first European ALGOL conference in 1959, RC began an effort to produce a series of compilers, completing one for the DASK in September 1961. A version for the GIER followed in August 1962. Christian Andersen and Peter Schyum Poulsen, another RC employee, wrote the first introductory text on the language, ''Everyman's Desk ALGOL'', in 1961.\n\n==Peripheral business==\n\nTo support higher throughput at their own service bureau, RC developed several high-speed [[input/output]] devices. One of their most popular was the [[RC 2000]] [[paper tape]] reader, introduced in 1963. Feeding the tape at 5 meters per second, the 2000 could read 2,000 characters per second (CPS), storing the results in a buffer while the computer periodically read the data back out instead of stopping the tape to wait for the computer to get ready. The machine was later upgraded as the RC 2500, increasing speed to almost 7 meters a second, improving read speed to 2500 CPS. The RC 2000/2500 became a major product for RC during the 1960s, selling 1,500 examples around the world. Several related devices were added to the line, including a high-speed punch and a dedicated data conversion machine that would \"massage\" data between formats to ease the burden on the host computer.\n\nIn 1964 Regnecentralen was taken public.

The [[RC 4000]] design emerged in 1966 and was completed for the factory the next year.

He had a good leap which compensated for his lack of height. It was after the retirement of Peter Knights and David O'Halloran he switched to full back . It was that position in which he won his first All-Australian selection in 1987.\n\nA defender, Langford won four premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991. He captained the club in the 1994 season and earned a second [[All-Australian]] selection.\n\nHe holds a place on the interchange bench in Hawthorn's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nLate in his career, Langford moved to [[Sydney]] where he worked as an accountant, commuting to Melbourne to training and play with his club.

He had a good leap which compensated for his lack of height. It was after the retirement of Peter Knights and David O'Halloran he switched to full back . It was that position in which he won his first All-Australian selection in 1987.\n\nA defender, Langford won four premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991. He captained the club in the 1994 season and earned a second [[All-Australian]] selection.\n\nHe holds a place on the interchange bench in Hawthorn's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nLate in his career, Langford moved to [[Sydney]] where he worked as an accountant, commuting to Melbourne to training and play with his club.

{"title_page": "Papal States under Pope Pius IX", "text_new": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.  It is opinionated, claiming to convey the opinions of the Pope's \nsubjects at the time. The text is available a no cost from [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref>\n\n==Pius' internal administration==\nPius IX was not only Pope, but until 1870 also the [[Sovereign]] Ruler of the [[Papal States]]. His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities.

The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX.

Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas.

In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.

His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|thumb|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy.

In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCommerce and trade:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}

There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\" />\n\nThe hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur. These anastomoses exist between the femoral artery or profunda femoris and the gluteal vessels.<ref name=\"Clemente-227\">Clemente (2006), p 227</ref>\n\n=== Muscles and movements ===\n{{Main|Muscles of the hip}}\n\nThe hip muscles act on three mutually perpendicular main axes, all of which pass through the center of the [[femur head|femoral head]], resulting in three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and three pair of principal directions: [[Flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] around a transverse axis (left-right); [[lateral rotation]] and [[medial rotation]] around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] and [[adduction]] around a sagittal axis (forward-backward);<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 386</ref> and a combination of these movements (i.e. [[Anatomical terms of motion#Other special motions|circumduction]], a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).<ref name=\"Platzer-200\" />\nSome of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.<ref name=Platzer_244>{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=244\u2013246}}</ref><ref name=\"Platzer-244\">Platzer (2004), pp 244-246</ref>\nAdditionally, the [[Inferior gemellus muscle|inferior]] and [[Superior gemellus muscle|superior gemelli]] may be termed ''triceps coxae'' together with the [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]], and their function simply is to assist the latter muscle.<ref name=\"Platzer-238\">Platzer (2004), p 238</ref>\n\nThe movements of the hip joint is thus performed by a series of muscles which are here presented in order of importance<ref name=\"Platzer-244\" /> with the range of motion from the neutral zero-degree position<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\" /> indicated:\n\n* '''Lateral''' or '''external rotation''' (30\u00b0 with the hip extended, 50\u00b0 with the hip flexed): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]; [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]; dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[iliopsoas]] (including [[psoas major muscle|psoas major]] from the vertebral column); [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|brevis]], and [[Adductor minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.\n* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40\u00b0): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].\n* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20\u00b0): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].\n* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140\u00b0): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.\n* '''Abduction''' (50\u00b0 with hip extended, 80\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.\n* '''Adduction''' (30\u00b0 with hip extended, 20\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nA [[hip fracture]] is a  [[bone fracture|break]] that occurs in the upper part of the femur.<ref name=AO2009>{{Cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|title=Hip Fractures|date=April 2009|website=OrthoInfo - AAOS|access-date=2017-09-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629225405/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Symptoms may include pain around the hip particularly with movement and shortening of the leg.<ref name=AO2009/> The hip joint can be replaced by a [[prosthesis]] in a [[hip replacement]] operation due to fractures or illnesses such as [[osteoarthritis]].

Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.\n\nThe female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Slide2DAD.JPG|Hip joint.

The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.\n* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head. The other system lines up with a system in the femur stretching from the medial part of the femoral shaft to the superior part of the femoral head.<ref name=\"Palastanga-353\">Palastanga (2006), p 353</ref><!-- - ref for entire section above - -->\n\nOn the lateral side of the hip joint the [[fascia lata]] is strengthened to form the [[iliotibial tract]] which functions as a tension band and reduces the bending loads on the proximal part of the femur.<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-367\" />\n\n=== Capsule ===\n{{Main|Capsule of hip joint}}\nThe capsule attaches to the hip bone outside the acetabular lip which thus projects into the capsular space. On the femoral side, the distance between the head's cartilaginous rim and the capsular attachment at the base of the neck is constant, which leaves a wider extracapsular part of the neck at the back than at the front.<ref>Because the neck is wider in front than at the back.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Platzer-198\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=198}}</ref>\n\nThe strong but loose fibrous capsule of the hip joint permits the hip joint to have the second largest range of movement (second only to the [[shoulder]]) and yet support the weight of the body, arms and head.\n\nThe capsule has two sets of fibers: longitudinal and circular.\n\n* The circular fibers form a collar around the femoral neck called the [[zona orbicularis]].\n* The longitudinal retinacular fibers travel along the neck and carry blood vessels.\n\n=== Ligaments ===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Gray339.png\n| width1 = 100\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Gray340.png\n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Extracapsular ligaments.

Left hip joint from within pelvis with the acetabular floor removed (left); right hip joint with capsule removed, anterior aspect (right).\n}}\nThe hip joint is reinforced by four ligaments, of which three are extracapsular and one intracapsular.\n\nThe '''extracapsular''' ligaments are the [[Iliofemoral ligament|iliofemoral]], [[ischiofemoral ligament|ischiofemoral]], and [[pubofemoral ligament]]s attached to the bones of the pelvis (the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]], [[ischium]], and [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] respectively). All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nIn the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-200\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>\nThe [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it. The zona orbicularis acts like a buttonhole on the femoral head and assists in maintaining the contact in the joint.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nAll three ligaments become taut when the joint is extended - this stabilises the joint, and reduces the energy demand of muscles when standing <ref>[http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/ teachmeanatomy.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103005842/http://teachmeanatomy.net/lower-limb/the-hip-joint/ |date=2013-01-03 }}. teachmeanatomy.net.

It is only stretched when the hip is dislocated, and may then prevent further displacement.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nIt is not that important as a ligament but can often be vitally important as a conduit of a small artery to the head of the femur, that is, the {{visible anchor|foveal artery}}.<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/825363-overview#aw2aab6b2b4 Hip Fracture in Emergency Medicine] at Medscape.

There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\" />\n\nThe hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur. These anastomoses exist between the femoral artery or profunda femoris and the gluteal vessels.<ref name=\"Clemente-227\">Clemente (2006), p 227</ref>\n\n=== Muscles and movements ===\n{{Main|Muscles of the hip}}\n\nThe hip muscles act on three mutually perpendicular main axes, all of which pass through the center of the [[femur head|femoral head]], resulting in three [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and three pair of principal directions: [[Flexion]] and [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] around a transverse axis (left-right); [[lateral rotation]] and [[medial rotation]] around a longitudinal axis (along the thigh); and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abduction]] and [[adduction]] around a sagittal axis (forward-backward);<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\">''Thieme Atlas of Anatomy'' (2006), p 386</ref> and a combination of these movements (i.e. [[Anatomical terms of motion#Other special motions|circumduction]], a compound movement in which the leg describes the surface of an irregular cone).<ref name=\"Platzer-200\" />\nSome of the hip muscles also act on either the vertebral joints or the knee joint, that with their extensive areas of origin and/or insertion, different part of individual muscles participate in very different movements, and that the range of movement varies with the position of the hip joint.\n<ref name=Platzer_244>{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=244\u2013246}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Platzer-244\">Platzer (2004), pp 244-246</ref>\nAdditionally, the [[Inferior gemellus muscle|inferior]] and [[Superior gemellus muscle|superior gemelli]] may be termed ''triceps coxae'' together with the [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]], and their function simply is to assist the latter muscle.<ref name=\"Platzer-238\">Platzer (2004), p 238</ref>\n\nThe movements of the hip joint is thus performed by a series of muscles which are here presented in order of importance<ref name=\"Platzer-244\" /> with the range of motion from the neutral zero-degree position<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-386\" /> indicated:\n\n* '''Lateral''' or '''external rotation''' (30\u00b0 with the hip extended, 50\u00b0 with the hip flexed): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]]; [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]; dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[iliopsoas]] (including [[psoas major muscle|psoas major]] from the vertebral column); [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|brevis]], and [[Adductor minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.\n* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40\u00b0): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].\n* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20\u00b0): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].\n* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140\u00b0): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.\n* '''Abduction''' (50\u00b0 with hip extended, 80\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.\n* '''Adduction''' (30\u00b0 with hip extended, 20\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nA [[hip fracture]] is a  [[bone fracture|break]] that occurs in the upper part of the femur.<ref name=AO2009>{{Cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|title=Hip Fractures|date=April 2009|website=OrthoInfo - AAOS|access-date=2017-09-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629225405/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Symptoms may include pain around the hip particularly with movement and shortening of the leg.<ref name=AO2009/> The hip joint can be replaced by a [[prosthesis]] in a [[hip replacement]] operation due to fractures or illnesses such as [[osteoarthritis]].

Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.\n\nThe female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Slide2DAD.JPG|Hip joint.
