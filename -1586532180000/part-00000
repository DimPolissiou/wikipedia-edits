There are several fortresses remaining from the [[Parthian Empire]] and [[Sasanian Empire]], and many older cemeteries scattered throughout the province. During this era, Mazandaran was part of Hyrcania, which was one of the important provinces.\nIn 662 CE, ten years after the death of [[Yazdegerd III]] the last Sasanian emperor, a large Muslim army under the command of Hassan ibn Ali invaded Tabarestan.\n\nWith the advent of the Sasanian Empire, the King of Mazandaran (Tabaristan and [[Padashkhwargar]]) was Gushnasp,<ref name=\"EIS\">Minorsky, V.; Vasmer, R. \"Mazandaran\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''.

A short-lived Alid Shiite state collapsed before the subsequent take-over by the [[Ziyarid]] princes. Mazandaran, unlike much of the rest of the Iranian Plateau maintained a Zoroastrian majority until the 12th century, thanks to its isolation and hardy population which fought against the Caliph's armies for centuries.\nDuring the post-Islamic period the local dynasties fell into three classes: local families of pre-Islamic origin; the \u02bfAlid sayyid; and local families of secondary importance.<ref name=\"EIS\"/>\n[[File:Alavids-map.png|thumb|262px|Map of the Mazandaran [[Alavid]] emirate (864-929 AD).]]\nThe Bawandids, who claimed descent from Kawus, provided three dynasties.<ref name=\"EIS\"/> The first dynasty (665\u20131007) was overthrown on the conquest of Tabaristan by the Ziyarid Kabus b.

The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged the westernmost parts of [[Gorgan]] as well as Mazandaran and [[Gilan Province|Gilan]], taking slaves and goods.\n\nIn the Safavid era Mazandaran was settled by very large amounts of [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Circassians]], [[Armenians]], and other [[Peoples of the Caucasus]], whose descendants still live or linger across Mazandaran. Towns, villages and neighbourhoods in Mazandaran still bear the name \"Gorji\" (i.e., Georgian) in them, although most of the large amounts of [[Georgians]], and [[Circassians]] are already assimilated into the mainstream Mazandaranis. The history of Georgian settlement is described by [[Iskandar Beg Munshi]], the author of the 17th century [[History of Alam Aray Abbasi|Tarikh-e Alam-Ara-ye Abbasi]], and both the Circassian and Georgian settlements by [[Pietro Della Valle]], among other authors.<ref>Pietro Della Valle, Viaggi, 3 vols. in 4 parts, ''Rome, 1658\u201363''; tr.

[[Pietro della Valle]], who visited a town near [[Firuzkuh]] in Mazandaran, noted that [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani women]] never wore the veil and didn't hesitate to talk to foreigners.

The [[Alborz]] Mountain Range surrounds the coastal strip and plains of the Caspian Sea.\nFrom the geographical point of view, Mazandaran province is divided into two parts i.e. coastal plain and the mountainous area. The Alborz Mountain Range like a huge wall has surrounded the coastal strip and plains of the Caspian Sea. Due to permanent sea breeze and local winds of the southern and eastern coasts of the Caspian Sea, sandy hills are formed, causing the appearance of a low natural barrier between the sea and plain.\nThere is often snowfall in the [[Alborz]] regions, which run parallel to the [[Mazandaran Sea|Caspian Sea]]'s southern coast, dividing the province into many isolated valleys. The province enjoys a moderate, subtropical climate with an average temperature of 25&nbsp;\u00b0C in summer and about 8&nbsp;\u00b0C in winter.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.\n[[File:William Christopher Macdonald.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]], 4th [[List of McGill University people#List of chancellors|Chancellor of McGill University]], created a Chair in Architecture at McGill in 1896.]]\n\nIn 1896, [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J. Turner]] joined the faculty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/nobbs|title=Legacy of Nobbs, History by Norbert Schoenauer|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, [[Ramsay Traquair (architect)|Ramsay Traquair]] became the new director of the School. He designed the Baillie library window and the flag above the [[McCall MacBain Arts Building|Arts Building]] at McGill, which still remain today.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/traquair|title= Legacy of Traquair, History by Norbert Schoenauer|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/McGillLibrary-cac_finding-aid_ramsay-traquair-book1-guide-18112/page/n21/mode/2up|title=Ramsay Traquair and his successors : guide to the Archive|date=1987|publisher=Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art, McGill University|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Arts Building, McGill University.jpg|thumb|upright|The McGill flag, designed by [[Ramsay Traquair (architect)|Ramsay Traquair]] and presented to McGill in 1921, flown above the [[McCall MacBain Arts Building|Arts Building]].]]\n\nIn 1921, the School had its first \"sketching school\" in [[Quebec City]], a tradition that has been carried on annually to various destinations since as a credited course. [[Arthur Lismer]], a founding member of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], taught this course at the School for over a decade starting in 1941.<ref name=Lismer>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/library/channels/event/exhibition-arthur-lismers-mcgill-sketchbook-240235|title=Exhibition: Arthur Lismer\u2019s McGill Sketchbook|publisher=McGill Library|year=2015|accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1939, Turner succeeded Traquair, who had completed a 26-year tenure as director of the School. At this time, the principal of McGill, [[Lewis Williams Douglas]], considered phasing out architectural education at the university due to low enrollment; however he faced a great deal of backlash from Turner and several famous architects from Montreal, and eventually abandoned the idea. Among these architects was [[Ernest Cormier]], who taught at the School from 1919 to 1920.<ref name=Cormier>{{cite web|url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/culture/clmhc-hsmbc/res/doc/information-backgrounder/Ernest_Cormier|title=Ernest Cormier (1885-1980)|publisher=Parks Canada|accessdate=23 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nUnder Turner's tenure, the door to co-ed education was opened, and in 1943 [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]] became the School's first female graduate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/turner|title=Legacy of Turner, History by Norbert Schoenauer|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> Wisnicki would also become the fourth female member of the [[Ontario Association of Architects]], which was founded in 1889.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ontario Association of Architects|journal=Canadian Architect and Builder|date=April 1889|volume=2|issue=4|page=40|url=https://archive.org/stream/canadianarchitec01onta#page/n29/mode/1up|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Mid-century===\nFollowing the retirement of Turner as director of the School of Architecture, [[John Bland (architect)|John Bland]] became director in 1941. In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school. \n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design. He and Bland established the first post-graduate architecture and planning program in Canada. Enrollment had grown from 23 students in 1941 to 133 full-time students in the 1949/1950 academic year.<ref name=McGillForties>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/forties|title=The School with John Bland:1940s, History by Norbert Schoenauer|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> Beginning in this academic year, the professional program was extended to six years, with first-year students following the engineering curriculum.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, three new teachers were added to the faculty, including Hazen Sise and Guy Desbarats who would later found [[Arcop]] with Fred Lebensold, [[Ray Affleck]], and [[Dimitri Dimakopoulos]]&nbsp;\u2013 all former students or teachers of the School.<ref name=Arcop />\n\nEnrollment was steady during the 1950s due to the limitations of physical space, but a four-story expansion of the McConnell Building in the 1960s allowed for growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/fifties|title=The School with John Bland:1950s, History by Norbert Schoenauer|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, [[Moshe Safdie]] published his master's thesis which became the basis for [[Habitat 67]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} That year, McGill Professor Douglas Shadbolt left the School to found the first architecture program at the Nova Scotia Technical College (later known as [[Technical University of Nova Scotia|Technical University of Nova Scotia]] [TUNS]) in [[Halifax, Canada|Halifax]], and 8 years later founded the School of Architecture (later the Azrieli School of Architecture and Urbanism) at [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa, Ontario|Ottawa]].<ref name=Shadbolt>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/douglas-shadbolt|title=Douglas Shadbolt|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|author=Michael McMordie|date=16 December 2013|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, [[John C.

Later that year, the graduate planning program was reorganized by Professor David Farley, which resulted in the establishment of the independent School of Urban Planning on the fourth floor of the [[Macdonald-Harrington Building]]. Over the next decade and a half, the School changed directorship three times, with Professor Norbert Schoenauer heading the School from 1972 until 1975, Professor Derek Drummond from 1975 until 1985 and Professor Bruce Anderson in 1985.<ref name=Highlights /> \n\nIn 1987, the School moved from the Engineering building to the Macdonald-Harrington Building. Macdonald-Harrington was initially named the Macdonald Chemistry Building but was renamed after Bernard Harrington, the building's first chemistry professor. The building is one of the many donations made by [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William Macdonald]] and was designed by Sir Andrew Taylor to accommodate the Departments of Chemistry and Mining in 1896. The building was renovated for architecture and urban planning students by architects [[Arcop]] in 1987.<ref name=CAC />\n\nIn 1989, the PhD in Architecture was introduced as an ''ad hoc'' program. In 1990, Derek Drummond returned for another six years as the School's director, replaced by Professor David Covo in 1996. In 1997, the PhD program was officially approved by the Minister of Education as the first in Canada,<ref name=CanadianArchitect /> and the School had its first PhD graduate, Lily Chi. In 1999, the professional BArch degree was replaced by the new MArchI professional degree, leaving the undergraduate BSc in architecture. Two years later, the School graduated its first class in the MArchI program.<ref name=Highlights /> \n\nIn 2003, philanthropist [[David Azrieli]] endowed an annual lecture at the School, called the [[McGill School of Architecture#Lecture Series|David J. Azrieli Lecture Series]], which has attracted many celebrity [[starchitect|starchitects]] to the School, including seven [[Pritzker Prize]] laureates. \n\nAfter an 11-year tenure as director, Covo stepped down and Professor [[Michael Jemtrud]] became director of the School in 2007.

The library was renamed the Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art during the 1940s after the family of sculptor [[Dinah Lauterman]] donated in her memory. \n\nThe library contains over 79,000 monographs and journal subscriptions, and has a substantial collection of over 3000 rare books from 1511 to 2009 housed in the [[Rare Books and Special Collections Library]] at McGill. This includes a fine collection of original works by [[G.&nbsp;B. Piranesi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/resources/library|title=Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture|accessdate=12 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Centre Canadien Architecture Montreal.JPG|thumb|220px|right|[[Canadian Centre for Architecture]], view of Shaughnessy House.]]\n====Canadian Centre for Architecture====\nStudents are always welcome to visit the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture|Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA)]], which houses one of the largest architectural design collections in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2019/02/the-government-of-canada-supports-the-canadian-centre-for-architecture.html|title=The Government of Canada supports the Canadian Centre for Architecture|publisher=Government of Canada|date=11 February 2019|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> just a 20-minute walk away from the downtown campus.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School. In some studios, the ratio can be as high as 8:1, such as is the case for the undergraduate class of 2021.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.\n[[File:William Christopher Macdonald.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]], 4th [[List of McGill University people#List of chancellors|Chancellor of McGill University]], created a Chair in Architecture at McGill in 1896.]]\n\nIn 1896, [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M. McLeod and Frank Peder. Professor Capper gave all lectures in architecture, and Henry F. Armstrong, the only other full-time professor, taught art classes and modelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Blackader and H.&nbsp;E. Shorey. He divided the four-year course into two streams, the BArch degree and the BSc degree in Architectural Engineering. Three new staff were hired in 1906, and three years later, [[Philip J.

At this time, the principal of McGill, [[Lewis Williams Douglas]], considered phasing out architectural education at the university due to low enrollment; however he faced a great deal of backlash from Turner and several famous architects from Montreal, and eventually abandoned the idea.

In 1945, a new five-year program was adopted for the next two decades. After the [[World War Two|war]], the School of Architecture increased its staff and doubled its physical accommodation due to the surge in university enrollment. This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students. By 1947, the School had become so cramped that a former Victorian residential building on University Street was vacated to make room for the School's students.<ref name=McGillForties />\n\nAround this time, Professor Frederic Lasserre of McGill's School of Architecture left the university to establish a new School of Architecture at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sala.ubc.ca/about/history|title=History|publisher=University of British Columbia School of Architecture + Landscape Architecture|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref> and invited McGill Architecture graduates [[Catherine Mary Wisnicki]], [[Peter Oberlander]] and [[Arthur Erickson]] to teach at his new school. \n\nIn 1946, [[Harold Spence-Sales]] was appointed Associate Professor of Design. He and Bland established the first post-graduate architecture and planning program in Canada.

Later that year, the graduate planning program was reorganized by Professor David Farley, which resulted in the establishment of the independent School of Urban Planning on the fourth floor of the [[Macdonald-Harrington Building]].

Macdonald-Harrington was initially named the Macdonald Chemistry Building but was renamed after Bernard Harrington, the building's first chemistry professor. The building is one of the many donations made by [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William Macdonald]] and was designed by Sir Andrew Taylor to accommodate the Departments of Chemistry and Mining in 1896. The building was renovated for architecture and urban planning students by architects [[Arcop]] in 1987.<ref name=CAC />\n\nIn 1989, the PhD in Architecture was introduced as an ''ad hoc'' program. In 1990, Derek Drummond returned for another six years as the School's director, replaced by Professor David Covo in 1996. In 1997, the PhD program was officially approved by the Minister of Education as the first in Canada,<ref name=CanadianArchitect /> and the School had its first PhD graduate, Lily Chi. In 1999, the professional BArch degree was replaced by the new MArchI professional degree, leaving the undergraduate BSc in architecture. Two years later, the School graduated its first class in the MArchI program.<ref name=Highlights /> \n\nIn 2003, philanthropist [[David Azrieli]] endowed an annual lecture at the School, called the [[McGill School of Architecture#Lecture Series|David J.

Blackader, one of the first students to study at the School of Architecture whose life was cut short during World War&nbsp;I. The library was renamed the Blackader-Lauterman Library of Architecture and Art during the 1940s after the family of sculptor [[Dinah Lauterman]] donated in her memory. \n\nThe library contains over 79,000 monographs and journal subscriptions, and has a substantial collection of over 3000 rare books from 1511 to 2009 housed in the [[Rare Books and Special Collections Library]] at McGill. This includes a fine collection of original works by [[G.&nbsp;B.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades. In the 2010\u20132011 academic year, there were 687 applications with portfolios to the undergraduate BSc Architecture program with only 51 spaces, giving an overall applications to enrolments ratio of 7.42%.<ref name=Admissions>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.13 Section 2.0: Academic Programs, Teaching and Learning | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> With the exception of the new Bioengineering degree at McGill, for Quebec [[CEGEP]] students, admissions to the School of Architecture represent the highest average [[R score]] of students accepted into the Faculty of Engineering<ref>{{cite web| url=https://info.publicintelligence.net/McGillSoA-AUR.pdf| title=McGill School of Architecture: 2011 Cyclical Academic Unit Review, p.39 Section 2.7.1 Admissions | year=2011 |accessdate=16 January 2020}}</ref> however in contrast to the high average R score, the lowest score admitted can sometimes be closer to the engineering average due to the importance of the portfolio in the admissions process.\n\nThe School of Architecture has one of the highest percentages of female representation at McGill, with an overall ratio of female-to-male students of approximately 2:1. As of fall&nbsp;2019, there were 119 female and 44 male undergraduate students, and 54 female and 36 male graduate students enrolled at the School. In some studios, the ratio can be as high as 8:1, such as is the case for the undergraduate class of 2021.<ref name=Enrollment />\n\n==Lecture series==\nEach year, the School of Architecture presents public lectures, exhibitions and symposia showcasing leading architects and important figures in the field. These lectures are organized by various individuals and organizations affiliated with the School. Lecture Series include lunchtime \"Brown Bag\" lectures organized by the McGill Architecture Students' Association, evening lectures sponsored by local Montreal firms such as Provencher Roy & [[NEUF Architect(e)s]],<ref name=LectureSeries /> and most notably, the annual [[David Azrieli|David J.

The line climbs the western flank of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], using [[Zig zag (railway)|railway zig zags]] to gain height. It was opened by the not for profit Zig Zag Railway Co-op.

The ITSR gave Zig Zag Co-operative additional time to develop a safety improvement plan in order to comply with the Act, that took effect for all heritage railway operators from 1 January 2007.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Rail Safety Act, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transportregulator.nsw.gov.au/rail/publications/presentations_papers/Safety_Regulation_Heritage_Operators_discussion.pdf/view |title=Discussion paper: Safety regulation of heritage railway operators|date=November 2007|work=Independent Transport Safety and Reliability Regulator|publisher=NSW Government|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2011 an incident occurred resulting in a collision between a maintenance vehicle and a two-car rail motor, between Clarence and Top Points stations. Travelling in opposite directions and carrying one passenger (in the [[Hy-rail]]) plus one driver of each rail vehicle, two injuries were sustained and the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. A subsequent investigation by the Office of Transport Safety Investigations found that the principal error was miscommunication. The inquiry also identified that a number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications; operational safe working errors; the delayed notification of the accident; poor maintenance of registers; passengers travelling in the driver's cab; fatigue; and excess speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otsi.nsw.gov.au/rail/Interim-Factual-Statement-Zig-Zag-Collision-2011-04-01.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Office of Transport Safety Investigations|work=Rail Safety Investigation Report|title=Collision between Hi-Rail and Rail Motor, Zig Zag Railway, Clarence: 1 April 2011|year=2011|accessdate=20 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom March 2012 only railcars could be operated and in June 2012 the ITSR ordered a cessation of all services until a number of safety issues were addressed.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/update-zig-zag-railway Update on Zig Zag Railway] Transport for NSW 6 September 2012</ref> The railway was then aiming to resume services in October 2013.<ref>[http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/1497845/zig-zag-railway-postpones-reopening/ Zig Zag Railway postpones reopening] ''Lithgow Mercury'' 14 May 2013</ref>\n\n=== Bushfire and Storm Damage ===\n{{main|2013 New South Wales bushfires}}\nThe Railway was severely damaged by the 'State Mine Fire', part of the [[2013 New South Wales bushfires|October 2013 bushfires]]. The Railway suffered millions of dollars of damage which included ten passenger carriages, four accommodation carriages, a nearly completed shower block and meal room destroyed and a spare parts centre and the machine shop and workshop badly damaged. Electrical equipment to operate signals was totally destroyed as was the repeater tower for the safety radio communication system and the internal telephone lines and exchange. One thousand new [[railway sleeper]]s were also lost as was the caretaker's converted accommodation carriage. The caretaker was \"lucky to escape with her life\" according to the Zig Zag's then CEO Michael Forbes. Much of the damage was suffered by original railway equipment from the 1920s. At that time it was estimated that the railway would take a full year to recover from the State Mine Fire.\nHeavy rain then caused subsequent damage to an embankment near the western end of the Clarence tunnel, the platform area at Top Points, and to the run around loop track at Bottom Points. \nIn September 2017 restoration of vehicles and infrastructure were still being undertaken and hopes were for recommencement of services as soon as safe and practical.\nDue to the complexity of repairs and reinstatement infrastructure, the re-opening was hoped for late 2019, but all hopes were dashed with the damage from the 2019 bushfire.<ref>[http://www.zigzagrailway.com.au/ Zig Zag Railway] Zig Zag Railway</ref> The railway\u2019s website has updates on the redevelopment.<ref name=\"2013 fire damage\">{{cite web| last=Holliday| first=Rebekah| title=Fire tears through iconic Zig Zag Railway| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/fire-tears-through-iconic-zig-zag-railway-20131019-2vt6v.html| date=19 October 2013 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| accessdate=19 October 2013 | quote=... we've had fires before but this is the first one that's gone through the workshop, the first time we've suffered damage to this extent.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pillans|first1=Laura|title=What next for the Zig Zag Railway?|url=http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/2816806/what-next-for-the-zig-zag-railway/|website=[[Lithgow Mercury]]|accessdate=7 May 2017|language=en|date=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Former schedule==\nPrior to the suspension of services in 2012, the Zig Zag Railways was unique in New South Wales being the only heritage operator to run every day except Christmas Day. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays railmotors were operated. Every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday a steam loco with train would operate with Sunday having a two train timetable. Special events included [[Day out with Thomas]] and a [[Hogwarts Express|Wizards Express]] event held a couple of times per year. During most school holidays steam services ran every day. Passengers could join the service at Bottom Points where [[Zig Zag railway station]] is served by [[NSW TrainLink]] services from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] or at Clarence which is adjacent to the Chifley Road/[[Bells Line of Road]].\n\n==Locomotives and rolling stock==\nThe locomotives and rolling stock on the Zig Zag Railway have been mainly sourced from [[Queensland Railways]] but there are also items from the [[South Australian Railways]] and [[AN Tasrail|TasRail]].\n\nThe collection includes [[Queensland Railways 2000 class rail motor]]s, Queensland Railways Evans carriages, Tasmanian Diesel locos, South Australian end platform carriages and several older carriages and a considerable number of freight style vehicles that are used for demonstration trains, fire fighting, and track and infrastructure repair and maintenance.\n\n===Steam locomotives===\n[[File:ZigZag 218.jpg|thumb|[[Queensland AC16 class locomotive|218]] ''The Yank'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These include fuel and water tank cars, hopper wagons, flat wagons and covered and louvered vans. These vehicles have been sourced from NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania.\nIt also had one HiRail vehicle (Can operate on road or rail)\n\n==Film use==\nIn 2003 the railway was used in the production of the [[Hollywood]] film [[Stealth (film)|''Stealth'']].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stealth (2005)|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382992/}}</ref> The area stood in for mountainous regions in [[North Korea]] and locomotives were specially painted with Korean [[Hangul|Chosongul (Hangul)]] characters.\n\n==2019 bushfire==\nIn late December 2019 the Zig Zag Railway was hit by the Gospers Mountain bushfire.\nThe station buildings and most of the rolling stock survived, with the exception of a few already vandalised carriages.

The ITSR gave Zig Zag Co-operative additional time to develop a safety improvement plan in order to comply with the Act, that took effect for all heritage railway operators from 1 January 2007.<ref>{{Cite Legislation AU|NSW|act||Rail Safety Act, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transportregulator.nsw.gov.au/rail/publications/presentations_papers/Safety_Regulation_Heritage_Operators_discussion.pdf/view |title=Discussion paper: Safety regulation of heritage railway operators|date=November 2007|work=Independent Transport Safety and Reliability Regulator|publisher=NSW Government|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2011 an incident occurred resulting in a collision between a maintenance vehicle and a two-car rail motor, between Clarence and Top Points stations. Travelling in opposite directions and carrying one passenger (in the [[Hy-rail]]) plus one driver of each rail vehicle, two injuries were sustained and the collision caused a minor misalignment of the track. A subsequent investigation by the Office of Transport Safety Investigations found that the principal error was miscommunication. The inquiry also identified that a number of other factors were found to have contributed to the collision, particularly a lack of radio communications; operational safe working errors; the delayed notification of the accident; poor maintenance of registers; passengers travelling in the driver's cab; fatigue; and excess speed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otsi.nsw.gov.au/rail/Interim-Factual-Statement-Zig-Zag-Collision-2011-04-01.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Office of Transport Safety Investigations|work=Rail Safety Investigation Report|title=Collision between Hi-Rail and Rail Motor, Zig Zag Railway, Clarence: 1 April 2011|year=2011|accessdate=20 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom March 2012 only railcars could be operated and in June 2012 the ITSR ordered a cessation of all services until a number of safety issues were addressed.<ref>[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/update-zig-zag-railway Update on Zig Zag Railway] Transport for NSW 6 September 2012</ref> The railway was then aiming to resume services in October 2013.<ref>[http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/1497845/zig-zag-railway-postpones-reopening/ Zig Zag Railway postpones reopening] ''Lithgow Mercury'' 14 May 2013</ref>\n\n=== Bushfire and Storm Damage ===\n{{main|2013 New South Wales bushfires}}\nThe Railway was severely damaged by the 'State Mine Fire', part of the [[2013 New South Wales bushfires|October 2013 bushfires]]. The Railway suffered millions of dollars of damage which included ten passenger carriages, four accommodation carriages, a nearly completed shower block and meal room destroyed and a spare parts centre and the machine shop and workshop badly damaged. Electrical equipment to operate signals was totally destroyed as was the repeater tower for the safety radio communication system and the internal telephone lines and exchange. One thousand new [[railway sleeper]]s were also lost as was the caretaker's converted accommodation carriage. The caretaker was \"lucky to escape with her life\" according to the Zig Zag's then CEO Michael Forbes. Much of the damage was suffered by original railway equipment from the 1920s. At that time it was estimated that the railway would take a full year to recover from the State Mine Fire.\nHeavy rain then caused subsequent damage to an embankment near the western end of the Clarence tunnel, the platform area at Top Points, and to the run around loop track at Bottom Points. \nIn September 2017 restoration of vehicles and infrastructure were still being undertaken and hopes were for recommencement of services as soon as safe and practical.\nDue to the complexity of repairs and reinstatement infrastructure, the re-opening was hoped for late 2019, but all hopes were dashed with the damage from the 2019 bushfire.<ref>[http://www.zigzagrailway.com.au/ Zig Zag Railway] Zig Zag Railway</ref> The railway\u2019s website has updates on the redevelopment.<ref name=\"2013 fire damage\">{{cite web| last=Holliday| first=Rebekah| title=Fire tears through iconic Zig Zag Railway| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/fire-tears-through-iconic-zig-zag-railway-20131019-2vt6v.html| date=19 October 2013 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| accessdate=19 October 2013 | quote=... we've had fires before but this is the first one that's gone through the workshop, the first time we've suffered damage to this extent.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pillans|first1=Laura|title=What next for the Zig Zag Railway?|url=http://www.lithgowmercury.com.au/story/2816806/what-next-for-the-zig-zag-railway/|website=[[Lithgow Mercury]]|accessdate=7 May 2017|language=en|date=15 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Former schedule==\nPrior to the suspension of services in 2012, the Zig Zag Railways was unique in New South Wales being the only heritage operator to run every day except Christmas Day. On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Sundays railmotors were operated. Every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday a steam loco with train would operate with Sunday having a two train timetable. Special events included [[Day out with Thomas]] and a [[Hogwarts Express|Wizards Express]] event held a couple of times per year. During most school holidays steam services ran every day. Passengers could join the service at Bottom Points where [[Zig Zag railway station]] is served by [[NSW TrainLink]] services from [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]] or at Clarence which is adjacent to the Chifley Road/[[Bells Line of Road]].\n\n==Locomotives and rolling stock==\nThe locomotives and rolling stock on the Zig Zag Railway have been mainly sourced from [[Queensland Railways]] but there are also items from the [[South Australian Railways]] and [[AN Tasrail|TasRail]].\n\nThe collection includes [[Queensland Railways 2000 class rail motor]]s, Queensland Railways Evans carriages, Tasmanian Diesel locos, South Australian end platform carriages and several older carriages and a considerable number of freight style vehicles that are used for demonstration trains, fire fighting, and track and infrastructure repair and maintenance.\n\n===Steam locomotives===\n[[File:ZigZag 218.jpg|thumb|[[Queensland AC16 class locomotive|218]] ''The Yank'']]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

'''Cloth modeling''' is the term used for simulating cloth within a computer program, usually in the context of [[3D computer graphics]]. The main approaches used for this may be classified into three basic types: geometric, physical, and particle/energy.\n\n== Background ==\n\nMost models of cloth are based on \"particles\" of mass connected in some manner of mesh. [[Newtonian Physics]] is used to model each particle through the use of a \"black box\" called a [[physics engine]]. This involves using the basic law of motion (Newton's Second Law):\n\n: <math>\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}</math>\n\nIn all of these models, the goal is to find the position and shape of a piece of fabric using this basic equation and several other methods.\n\n== Geometric methods ==\n\n[http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Weil.html Andr\u00e9 Weil] pioneered the first of these, the geometric technique, in 1986.<ref name=\"tutorial\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20010425201247/http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/5445/cloth.html Tutorial on Cloth Modeling]</ref> His work was focused on approximating the look of cloth by treating cloth like a collection of cables and using [[Hyperbolic cosine]] (catenary) curves. Because of this, it is not suitable for dynamic models but works very well for stationary or single-frame renders.<ref name=\"tutorial\"/> This technique creates an underlying shape out of single points; then, it parses through each set of three of these points and maps a catenary curve to the set. It then takes the lowest out of each overlapping set and uses it for the render.\n\n== Physical methods ==\n\nThe second technique treats cloth like a grid work of particles connected to each other by springs. Whereas the geometric approach accounted for none of the inherent stretch of a woven material, this physical model accounts for stretch (tension), stiffness, and weight:\n\n: <math>E(Particle_{i,j}) = k_{s}E_{s,i,j} + k_{b}E_{b,i,j} + k_{g}E_{g,i,j}</math>\n\n* s terms are elasticity (by [[Hooke's Law]])\n* b terms are bending\n* g terms are gravity (see [[standard gravity|Acceleration due to gravity]])\n\nNow we apply the basic principle of [[mechanical equilibrium]] in which all bodies seek lowest energy by differentiating this equation to find the minimum energy.\n\n== Particle/energy methods ==\n\nThe last method is more complex than the first two. The particle technique takes the physical methods a step further and supposes that we have a network of particles interacting directly. Rather than springs, the energy interactions of the particles are used to determine the cloth's shape. An energy equation that adds onto the following is used:\n\n: <math>U_{Total} = U_{Repel} + U_{Stretch} + U_{Bend} + U_{Trellis} + U_{Gravity}</math>\n\n* The energy of repelling is an artificial element we add to prevent cloth from intersecting itself.\n* The energy of stretching is governed by [[Hooke's law]] as with the Physical Method.\n* The energy of bending describes the stiffness of the fabric\n* The energy of trellising describes the shearing of the fabric (distortion within the plane of the fabric)\n* The energy of gravity is based on [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity]]\n\nTerms for energy added by any source can be added to this equation, then derive and find minima, which generalizes our model. This allows for modeling cloth behavior under any circumstance, and since the cloth is treated as a collection of particles its behavior can be described with the dynamics provided in our physics engine.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Soft body dynamics]]\n* [[Classical mechanics]]\n* [[Physics engine]]\n* [[Rigid body dynamics]]\n* [[Stretched grid method]]\n\n== References ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070211131507/http://davis.wpi.edu/~matt/courses/cloth/ Cloth Modeling]\n*<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Weil.html|title=Andr\u00e9 Weil (1906-1998)|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2019-04-26}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]\n[[Category:Conceptual models]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Cloth Simulation.ogv|thumb|Cloth Simulation in [[Blender (software)|Blender]] with Cycles.]]\nCloth is a woven or felted fabric made from wool, cotton, or a similar fiber.

Through a period called socialism the rule of the proletariat will take charge of getting rid of the last vestiges of capitalism, and help to make the revolution worldwide. Once the private propriety have been abolished worldwide, the state will not longer be useful and will disappear, because the government only exists to protect the dominant class, effectively dominating with violence and fear the submitted class, but there will not be classes anymore, and therefore none will require to dominate anyone. Instead organisations of workers will manage the production of things, but no organisation will have any military power, neither police force nor prisons.\n\nThe main principle of Marx's theory is that the material conditions limit the spiritual conditions. People will not be violent but respecting, peaceful and altruistic, because the material conditions will finally allow them to be so. They will no longer need to live just aiming to earn money, but to live to develop themselves spiritually. With the material problems solved, and everyone receiving education and being provided the appropriate circumstances for their intellectual development, there will not any problems, and society will work getting from each one what one has the capacity to give and providing to each one what one needs.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Leon Trotsky]] argued that a proletariat [[world revolution]] would lead to world peace.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1914/war/ | first = Leon | last = Trotsky | title = War and the International | year = 1914 | publisher = Marxists}}.</ref>\n\n===Democratic peace theory===\nProponents of the [[democratic peace theory]] claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |publisher=M Tholyoke |title=International relations |contribution=Ray |place=USA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |archivedate=17 February 2008 }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/smith/dempeace.PDF |publisher=New York University |place=USA |last=Smith |title=Politics |contribution=Democracy & peace}}.</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/2486355 |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |accessdate=31 July 2013 |author=M\u00fcller, Harald and Jonas Wolff |booktitle=5th Pan-European International Relations ConferenceThe Hague |date=September 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |work=ForeignAffairs.org |date=1 November 2005 |title=Fareview essay |first=John M, IV |last=Owen |id=Iraq and the democratic peace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221155722/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |archivedate=21 December 2005 }}.</ref>\n\nThere are, however, several [[List of wars between democracies|wars between democracies]] that have taken place, historically.\n\n===Capitalism peace theory===\nIn her essay \"The Roots of War\", [[Ayn Rand]] held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in history\u2014a period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world\u2014from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, with the exceptions of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870), the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), which notably occurred in perhaps the most liberal economy in the world at the beginning of the industrial revolution.\n\n===Cobdenism===\nProponents of [[Cobdenism]] claim that by removing tariffs and creating international [[free trade]] wars would become impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming [[self-sufficient]], which is a requirement for long wars.\n\nHowever, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is [[World War I]], during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a [[war economy]].\n\nMore generally, free trade\u2014while not making wars impossible\u2014can make wars, and restrictions on trade caused by wars, very costly for international companies with production, research, and sales in many different nations. Thus, a powerful lobby\u2014unless there are only national companies\u2014will argue against wars.\n\n===Mutual assured destruction===\n[[Mutual assured destruction]] is a [[doctrine]] of military strategy in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapons]] by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm | publisher = Nuclear files | title = Strategy | contribution = Mutual Assured Destruction}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Col.

The [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]] also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to [[sources of international law]] as well as to unite the strength of independent countries in order to maintain international peace and [[international security|security]]. All treaties on [[international human rights law]] make reference to or consider \"the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and \"peace in the world\".\n\n===Globalization===\n[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] saw a trend in national politics by which [[city-states]] and [[nation-states]] have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the [[European Union]] following suit, suggesting that further [[globalization]] will bring about a [[world state]].\n\n===<span lang=\"az-latn\">Self</span>-organized peace===\nWorld peace has been depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behaviors that inhibit the institutionalization of power and ensuing violence.  The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a [[Self-organization|self-organized]] network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is [[thought experiment]], namely [[backcasting]], enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation or age demographic. Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging from the Internet around [[open-source model|open-source]] projects, including [[Wikipedia]], and the evolution of other [[social media]].\n\n===Economic norms theory===\n[[Michael Mousseau|Economic norms theory]] links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal [[clientelism|clientelist]] economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.<ref name = \"Mousseau 2009\">{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | contribution = The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace | title = International Security | volume = 33 | number = 4 | date = Spring 2009 | pages = 52\u201386}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | author-mask = 8 | contribution = Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror | title = International Security | volume = 27 | number = 3 | date = Winter 2002\u20132003 | pages = 5\u201329}}.</ref>\n\nThrough most of human history, societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. [[Michael Mousseau]] argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of [[bounded rationality]], people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.<ref name = \"Mousseau 2003\">{{Citation | first = Michael |last= Mousseau |author-mask = 8 | year = 2003 |title= The Nexus of Market Society, Liberal Preferences, and Democratic Peace: Interdisciplinary Theory and Evidence | journal= International Studies Quarterly | volume= 47 |number= 4 |pages= 483\u2013510 | doi=10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00276.x|citeseerx= 10.1.1.321.7034 }}.</ref>\n\nMarket-oriented socio-economies are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state. This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract \u2013 that is, liberal democracy. Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone's rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad. In fact, nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues<ref name = \"Mousseau 2003\" /> and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.<ref name = \"Mousseau 2009\" />\n\nEconomic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth.<ref>[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]]. 1970. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. Chicago : University of Chicago.</ref> In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the \"social market\" economy, which is in everyone's interests. One proposed mechanism for world peace involves consumer purchasing of renewable and equitable local food and power sources involving [[artificial photosynthesis]] ushering in a period of social and ecological harmony known as the [[Sustainocene]].\n\n=== Nonkilling Global Political Science ===\n[[Nonkilling]], popularized in the 2002 book ''[[Nonkilling Global Political Science]]'' by [[Glenn D. Paige]], builds on [[nonviolence]] theory and encompasses the concepts of [[peace]] (absence of war and conditions conducive to war), [[nonviolence]] (psychological, physical, and structural), and [[ahimsa]] (noninjury in thought, word and deed). Nonkilling provides a distinct approach characterized by the measurability of its goals and the open-ended nature of its realization. it can be quantified and related to specific causes, for example by following a public health perspective (prevention, intervention and post-traumatic transformation toward the progressive eradication of killing).<ref>{{Cite book|last=DeGue|first=Sarah|title=Toward a nonkilling paradigm|last2=Mercy|first2=James A.|date=2009|publisher=Center for Global Nonkilling|others=Pim, Jo\u00e1m Evans.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-9822983-1-2|edition=1st|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|pages=388|chapter=Nonkilling public health|oclc=463312339}}</ref>\n\n==International Day of Peace==\nThe [[International Day of Peace]], sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to [[peace education]], i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.\n\n==Religious views==\n[[File:Mt.

''Letters to Students'': LETTER NO. 92, July 1918. [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|TRF]], CA, USA (various editions/publishers)</ref>]]\nMany religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith===\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity}}\nThe central aim of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, \"the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ...\" In his writings, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h described two distinct stages of world peace \u2013 a lesser peace and a most great peace.\n\nThe lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will, and that Bah\u00e1'\u00ed influence on the process is relatively minor.\n\nThe most great peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity \u2013 a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other's existence. The Bah\u00e1'\u00eds view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teachings, principles and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', written by the [[Universal House of Justice]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/363 363\u2013364] |url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/363 }}</ref>\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|Buddhism}}\nMany [[Buddhist]]s believe that world peace can only be achieved if we first establish [[peace]] within our minds. The idea is that [[anger]] and other negative states of [[mind]] are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[peace]] and [[harmony]] only if we abandon negative emotions such as anger in our minds and cultivate positive emotions such as love and [[compassion]].  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n[[Peace pagoda]]s are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typically of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organisation [[Nipponzan Myohoji]]. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo and [[Lumbini]].\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Main|Christian pacifism}}\nThe basic Christian ideal specifies that [[peace]] can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:\n\n{{quote|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.|{{bibleref|John|14:27|NIV}}}}\n\nAs [[christological]]ly interpreted from {{bibleref|Isaiah|2|NIV}}, whereupon the  \"Word of the Lord\" is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be 'nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore'. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works in direct light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned [[Sermon on the Mount]], where [[forgiveness|forgiving]] those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.\n\nHowever, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:\n\n{{quote|Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.|{{bibleverse|Matt|10:34\u201336|NIV}}}}\n\nMany Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the \"new earth\" that is promised in Christian scripture such as {{bibleref|Revelation|21|NIV}}.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] religious conception of \"[[Consecration of Russia]]\", related to the Church's high-priority [[Our Lady of F\u00e1tima|F\u00e1tima]] [[Marian apparitions]], promises a temporary ''world peace'' as a result of this process being fulfilled, though before the coming of the [[Antichrist]]. This period of temporary peace is called ''the triumph of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]''.\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{Main|Hinduism}}\nTraditionally, [[Hinduism]] has adopted an ancient [[Sanskrit]] phrase ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam|Vasudhaiva kutumbakam]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/showthread.php?t=969&page=3|title=Dharmic Wisdom Quotes \u2013 Page 3|publisher=}}</ref> which translates as \"The world is one family\". The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. World peace is hence only achieved through internal means\u2014by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n===Islam===\n{{Main|Islamic Peace}}\n\nAccording to [[Islamic eschatology]], the whole world will be united under the leadership of prophet [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] in his [[second coming]].<ref>Bukhari, Kitab Ahadith al-Ambiya; Bab: Nuzul 'Isa Ibn Maryam; Muslim, Bab: Bayan Nuzul 'Isa; Tirmidhi, Abwab-al-Fitan; Bab Fi Nuzul 'Isa; Musnad Ahmad, Marwiyat Abu Huraira.http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/M_fop/fop11.htm</ref> At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in likeness of [[paradise]].\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Judaism}}\n\nThe concept of ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Repairing the World) is central to modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. ''Tikkun olam'' is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, ''Tikkun olam'' would result in the beginning of the [[Messianic Age]]. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, in [[Jewish messianism]] it is considered that at some future time a ''Messiah'' (literally \"a King appointed by God\") will rise up to bring all Jews back to the [[Land of Israel]], followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity.<ref>Rambam, [[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot Melachim, ch. 11\u201312</ref> This idea originates from passages in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Talmud]].\n{{quote|And he shall judge between the nations and reprove many peoples, and they shall beat their [[Swords to ploughshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift the sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:4|JPR}}}}\n\n===Jainism===\n{{Main|Jainism}}\n[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]]. They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahvira [[Jiyo aur Jeeno Do]]. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as [[Gujarat]], have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian.<ref>Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998</ref> Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, [[Virchand Gandhi]]: \"May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies.\"<ref>Useful instructions, In Matter religious, moral and others by Motilal M. Munishi, 1904</ref> As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{Main|Sikhism}}\nPeace comes from God.  Meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, there can be no worship without performing good deeds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}</ref> Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat kar\u014d]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''[[cha\u1e5bd\u012b kal\u0101]]'', or ''optimistic'' \u2013 ''resilience'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing\u2014''[[va\u1e47\u1e0d chakk\u014d]]''\u2014through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''[[Langar (Sikhism)|la\u1e45gar]]''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''[[Selfless service|s\u0113v\u0101]]''). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers. As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n==Economic implications==\nA report in June 2015 on the [[Global Peace Index]] highlighted that the impact of violence on the global economy reached US$14.3&nbsp;trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33161837|title=Global conflicts 'cost 13% of world GDP'|work=BBC News}}</ref> The report also found that the economic cost of violence is 13.4% of world GDP, equal to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK combined.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report|title=Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report|author=Mark Anderson|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}} \n* [[Amity-Enmity Complex]]\n*[[Armistice]]\n*[[Ceasefire]]\n*[[Family Federation for World Peace and Unification]]\n*[[Global peace system]]\n* [[Global policeman]]\n*[[Inner peace]]\n*[[Interfaith dialogue]]\n*[[International community]]\n*[[International human rights law]]\n*[[International security]]\n*[[International Day of Non-Violence]]\n*[[International Day of Peace]]\n*[[List of anti-war organizations]]\n*[[List of civil rights leaders]]\n*[[List of ongoing military conflicts]]\n*[[List of peace activists]]\n*[[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n*[[Nonviolence]]\n*[[Pacifism]]\n*[[Peace movement]]\n*[[Peace One Day]]\n*[[Peace treaty]]\n*[[Peace walk]]\n*[[Perpetual peace]]\n*[[Philosophy of happiness]]\n*[[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]]\n*[[University for Peace]]\n*[[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]\n*[[War resister]]\n*[[War Resisters' International]]\n*[[World Peace Council]]\n*[[World Peace Foundation]]\n*[[World Peace Marathon]]\n*[[World union for peace and fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.bsworldpeace.org/ Association Bernadette Strebel World Peace]\n* [http://www.gusp.org Global Union of Scientists for Peace]\n* [http://www.mindmeister.com/18150212?title=peace-in-the-world Peace in the World]\n* [http://www.teamworldpeace.org Team World Peace]\n* [[Allaman Castle|The Castle of Peace]]\n* [https://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/index.shtml The Resolutions]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131104180329/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N08/484/53/PDF/N0848453.pdf?OpenElement UN Resolution re: Poverty]\n* [http://www.usip.org/ US Institute of Peace]\n* [http://www.wagingpeace.org/ Waging Peace]\n* [http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/consciousness_as_a_field.html World Peace Group]\n* [http://www.worldpeaceinprogress.com World Peace in Progress]\n* [http://worldpeacemarathon.com/ World Peace Marathon ]\n* [https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/behavioural/book/978-1-4419-9519-3 World Peace writings]\n* [http://www3.telus.net/public/t5837479/index1.htm Social Phenomena]\n{{anti-war}}\n{{Human rights}}\n* [https://archives-manuscripts.dartmouth.edu/repositories/2/resources/1596 Belno M.

This idea of world [[nonviolence]] is one motivation for people and nations to willingly cooperate, either voluntarily or by virtue of a system of governance that has this objective. Different cultures, religions, philosophies, and organizations have varying concepts on how such a state would come about.\n\nVarious religious and secular organizations have the stated aim of achieving world peace through addressing [[human rights]], technology, [[peace education|education]], engineering, medicine or [[diplomat|diplomacy]] used as an end to all forms of fighting. Since 1945, the [[United Nations]] and the five [[permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] ([[China]], [[France]], [[Russia]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]) have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war or declarations of war. Nonetheless, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.\n\n==World peace theories==\n{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}\n\nMany theories as to how world peace could be achieved have been proposed. Several of these are listed below.\n===Peace through strength===\n{{Main|Peace through strength}}\n\nThe term is traced back to the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] (reigned AD 117 \u2013 138) but the concept is as old as recorded history. In 1943, at the peak of [[World War II]], the founder of the [[Paneuropean Union]], [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]], argued that after the war the United States is bound to take \"command of the skies\" to ensure the lasting world peace:\n{{quote|\nBut the inauguration of such a glorious century of peace demands from us abandonment of old conceptions of peace. The new Angel of Peace must no longer be pictured as a charming but helpless lady with an olive branch in her hand, but like the Goddess of Justice with a balance in her left and a sword in her right; or like the Archangel Michael, with a fiery sword and wings of steel, fighting the devil to restore and protect the peace of heaven.<ref>''Crusade for Pan-Europe'', (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1943), p 299, 305.</ref>}}\nIn fact, near the entrance to the headquarters of the [[Strategic Air Command|SAC]] at [[Offutt Air Force Base]] stands a large sign with a SAC emblem and its motto: \"Peace is our profession.\"<ref>Cited in [[Thomas S.

Through a period called socialism the rule of the proletariat will take charge of getting rid of the last vestiges of capitalism, and help to make the revolution worldwide. Once the private propriety have been abolished worldwide, the state will not longer be useful and will disappear, because the government only exists to protect the dominant class, effectively dominating with violence and fear the submitted class, but there will not be classes anymore, and therefore none will require to dominate anyone. Instead organisations of workers will manage the production of things, but no organisation will have any military power, neither police force nor prisons.\n\nThe main principle of Marx's theory is that the material conditions limit the spiritual conditions. People will not be violent but respecting, peaceful and altruistic, because the material conditions will finally allow them to be so. They will no longer need to live just aiming to earn money, but to live to develop themselves spiritually. With the material problems solved, and everyone receiving education and being provided the appropriate circumstances for their intellectual development, there will not any problems, and society will work getting from each one what one has the capacity to give and providing to each one what one needs.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Leon Trotsky]] argued that a proletariat [[world revolution]] would lead to world peace.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1914/war/ | first = Leon | last = Trotsky | title = War and the International | year = 1914 | publisher = Marxists}}.</ref>\n\n===Democratic peace theory===\nProponents of the [[democratic peace theory]] claim that strong empirical evidence exists that democracies never or rarely wage war against each other.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |publisher=M Tholyoke |title=International relations |contribution=Ray |place=USA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217032515/http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ray.htm |archivedate=17 February 2008 }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/politics/faculty/smith/dempeace.PDF |publisher=New York University |place=USA |last=Smith |title=Politics |contribution=Democracy & peace}}.</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://www.academia.edu/2486355 |title=Dyadic Democratic Peace Strikes Back |accessdate=31 July 2013 |author=M\u00fcller, Harald and Jonas Wolff |booktitle=5th Pan-European International Relations ConferenceThe Hague |date=September 2004}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |work=ForeignAffairs.org |date=1 November 2005 |title=Fareview essay |first=John M, IV |last=Owen |id=Iraq and the democratic peace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221155722/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20051101fareviewessay84611/john-m-owen-iv/iraq-and-the-democratic-peace.html |archivedate=21 December 2005 }}.</ref>\n\nThere are, however, several [[List of wars between democracies|wars between democracies]] that have taken place, historically.\n\n===Capitalism peace theory===\nIn her essay \"The Roots of War\", [[Ayn Rand]] held that the major wars of history were started by the more controlled economies of the time against the freer ones and that capitalism gave mankind the longest period of peace in history\u2014a period during which there were no wars involving the entire civilized world\u2014from the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 to the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, with the exceptions of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870), the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898), and the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), which notably occurred in perhaps the most liberal economy in the world at the beginning of the industrial revolution.\n\n===Cobdenism===\nProponents of [[Cobdenism]] claim that by removing tariffs and creating international [[free trade]] wars would become impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming [[self-sufficient]], which is a requirement for long wars.\n\nHowever, free trade does not prevent a nation from establishing some sort of emergency plan to become temporarily self-sufficient in case of war or that a nation could simply acquire what it needs from a different nation. A good example of this is [[World War I]], during which both Britain and Germany became partially self-sufficient. This is particularly important because Germany had no plan for creating a [[war economy]].\n\nMore generally, free trade\u2014while not making wars impossible\u2014can make wars, and restrictions on trade caused by wars, very costly for international companies with production, research, and sales in many different nations. Thus, a powerful lobby\u2014unless there are only national companies\u2014will argue against wars.\n\n===Mutual assured destruction===\n[[Mutual assured destruction]] is a [[doctrine]] of military strategy in which a full-scale use of [[nuclear weapons]] by two opposing sides would effectively result in the destruction of both belligerents.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm | publisher = Nuclear files | title = Strategy | contribution = Mutual Assured Destruction}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Col.

The [[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]] also aims to further the adoption of fundamental human rights, to respect obligations to [[sources of international law]] as well as to unite the strength of independent countries in order to maintain international peace and [[international security|security]]. All treaties on [[international human rights law]] make reference to or consider \"the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and \"peace in the world\".\n\n===Globalization===\n[[Gordon B. Hinckley]] saw a trend in national politics by which [[city-states]] and [[nation-states]] have unified and suggests that the international arena will eventually follow suit. Many countries such as China, Italy, the United States, Australia, Germany, India and Britain have unified into single nation-states with others like the [[European Union]] following suit, suggesting that further [[globalization]] will bring about a [[world state]].\n\n===<span lang=\"az-latn\">Self</span>-organized peace===\nWorld peace has been depicted as a consequence of local, self-determined behaviors that inhibit the institutionalization of power and ensuing violence.  The solution is not so much based on an agreed agenda, or an investment in higher authority whether divine or political, but rather a [[Self-organization|self-organized]] network of mutually supportive mechanisms, resulting in a viable politico-economic social fabric. The principal technique for inducing convergence is [[thought experiment]], namely [[backcasting]], enabling anyone to participate no matter what cultural background, religious doctrine, political affiliation or age demographic. Similar collaborative mechanisms are emerging from the Internet around [[open-source model|open-source]] projects, including [[Wikipedia]], and the evolution of other [[social media]].\n\n===Economic norms theory===\n[[Michael Mousseau|Economic norms theory]] links economic conditions with institutions of governance and conflict, distinguishing personal [[clientelism|clientelist]] economies from impersonal market-oriented ones, identifying the latter with permanent peace within and between nations.<ref name = \"Mousseau 2009\">{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | contribution = The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace | title = International Security | volume = 33 | number = 4 | date = Spring 2009 | pages = 52\u201386}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | author-mask = 8 | contribution = Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror | title = International Security | volume = 27 | number = 3 | date = Winter 2002\u20132003 | pages = 5\u201329}}.</ref>\n\nThrough most of human history, societies have been based on personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. [[Michael Mousseau]] argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are in a constant state of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of [[bounded rationality]], people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.<ref name = \"Mousseau 2003\">{{Citation | first = Michael |last= Mousseau |author-mask = 8 | year = 2003 |title= The Nexus of Market Society, Liberal Preferences, and Democratic Peace: Interdisciplinary Theory and Evidence | journal= International Studies Quarterly | volume= 47 |number= 4 |pages= 483\u2013510 | doi=10.1046/j.0020-8833.2003.00276.x|citeseerx= 10.1.1.321.7034 }}.</ref>\n\nMarket-oriented socio-economies are integrated not with personal ties but the impersonal force of the market where most individuals are economically dependent on trusting strangers in contracts enforced by the state. This creates loyalty to a state that enforces the rule of law and contracts impartially and reliably and provides equal protection in the freedom to contract \u2013 that is, liberal democracy. Wars cannot happen within or between nations with market-integrated economies because war requires the harming of others, and in these kinds of economies everyone is always economically better off when others in the market are also better off, not worse off. Rather than fight, citizens in market-oriented socio-economies care deeply about everyone's rights and welfare, so they demand economic growth at home and economic cooperation and human rights abroad. In fact, nations with market-oriented socio-economies tend to agree on global issues<ref name = \"Mousseau 2003\" /> and not a single fatality has occurred in any dispute between them.<ref name = \"Mousseau 2009\" />\n\nEconomic norms theory should not be confused with classical liberal theory. The latter assumes that markets are natural and that freer markets promote wealth.<ref>[[Milton Friedman|Friedman, Milton]]. 1970. ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]''. Chicago : University of Chicago.</ref> In contrast, Economic norms theory shows how market-contracting is a learned norm, and state spending, regulation, and redistribution are necessary to ensure that almost everyone can participate in the \"social market\" economy, which is in everyone's interests. One proposed mechanism for world peace involves consumer purchasing of renewable and equitable local food and power sources involving [[artificial photosynthesis]] ushering in a period of social and ecological harmony known as the [[Sustainocene]].\n\n=== Nonkilling Global Political Science ===\n[[Nonkilling]], popularized in the 2002 book ''[[Nonkilling Global Political Science]]'' by [[Glenn D. Paige]], builds on [[nonviolence]] theory and encompasses the concepts of [[peace]] (absence of war and conditions conducive to war), [[nonviolence]] (psychological, physical, and structural), and [[ahimsa]] (noninjury in thought, word and deed). Nonkilling provides a distinct approach characterized by the measurability of its goals and the open-ended nature of its realization. it can be quantified and related to specific causes, for example by following a public health perspective (prevention, intervention and post-traumatic transformation toward the progressive eradication of killing).<ref>{{Cite book|last=DeGue|first=Sarah|title=Toward a nonkilling paradigm|last2=Mercy|first2=James A.|date=2009|publisher=Center for Global Nonkilling|others=Pim, Jo\u00e1m Evans.|year=2009|isbn=978-0-9822983-1-2|edition=1st|location=Honolulu, Hawaii|pages=388|chapter=Nonkilling public health|oclc=463312339}}</ref>\n\n==International Day of Peace==\nThe [[International Day of Peace]], sometimes called World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It is dedicated to peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, and can be celebrated by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone. The International Day of Peace was established in 1981 by the United Nations General Assembly. Two decades later, in 2001, the General Assembly unanimously voted to designate the day as a day of preventing violence and a cease-fire. The celebration of this day is recognized by many nations and people. In 2013, for the first time, the day has been dedicated to [[peace education]], i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war sustainably.\n\n==Religious views==\n[[File:Mt.

''Letters to Students'': LETTER NO. 92, July 1918. [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|TRF]], CA, USA (various editions/publishers)</ref>]]\nMany religions and religious leaders have expressed a desire for an end to violence.\n\n===Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith===\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity}}\nThe central aim of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] is the establishment of the unity of the peoples of the world. [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, stated in no uncertain terms, \"the fundamental purpose animating the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity of the human race ...\" In his writings, Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h described two distinct stages of world peace \u2013 a lesser peace and a most great peace.\n\nThe lesser peace is essentially a collective security agreement between the nations of the world. In this arrangement, nations agree to protect one another by rising up against an aggressor nation, should it seek the usurpation of territory or the destruction of its neighbors. The lesser peace is limited in scope and is concerned with the establishment of basic order and the universal recognition of national borders and the sovereignty of nations. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe that the lesser peace is taking place largely through the operation of the Divine Will, and that Bah\u00e1'\u00ed influence on the process is relatively minor.\n\nThe most great peace is the eventual end goal of the lesser peace and is envisioned as a time of spiritual and social unity \u2013 a time when the peoples of the world genuinely identify with and care for one another, rather than simply tolerating one other's existence. The Bah\u00e1'\u00eds view this process as taking place largely as a result of the spread of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teachings, principles and practices throughout the world. The larger world peace process and its foundational elements are addressed in the document ''[[The Promise of World Peace]]'', written by the [[Universal House of Justice]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |year=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=978-1-85168-184-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/363 363\u2013364] |url=https://archive.org/details/conciseencyclope0000smit/page/363 }}</ref>\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{Main|Buddhism}}\nMany [[Buddhist]]s believe that world peace can only be achieved if we first establish [[peace]] within our minds. The idea is that [[anger]] and other negative states of [[mind]] are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[peace]] and [[harmony]] only if we abandon negative emotions such as anger in our minds and cultivate positive emotions such as love and [[compassion]].  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n[[Peace pagoda]]s are monuments that are built to symbolize and inspire world peace and have been central to the peace movement throughout the years. These are typically of Buddhist origin, being built by the Japanese Buddhist organisation [[Nipponzan Myohoji]]. They exist around the world in cities such as London, Vienna, New Delhi, Tokyo and [[Lumbini]].\n\n===Christianity===\n{{Main|Christian pacifism}}\nThe basic Christian ideal specifies that [[peace]] can only come by the Word and love of God, which is perfectly demonstrated in the life of Christ:\n\n{{quote|Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.|{{bibleref|John|14:27|NIV}}}}\n\nAs [[christological]]ly interpreted from {{bibleref|Isaiah|2|NIV}}, whereupon the  \"Word of the Lord\" is established on the earth, the material human-political result will be 'nation not taking up sword against nation; nor will they train for war anymore'. Christian world peace necessitates the living of a proactive life replete with all good works in direct light of the Word of God. The details of such a life can be observed in the Gospels, especially the historically renowned [[Sermon on the Mount]], where [[forgiveness|forgiving]] those who do wrong things against oneself is advocated among other pious precepts.\n\nHowever, not all Christians expect a lasting world peace on this earth:\n\n{{quote|Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law\u2014a man's enemies will be the members of his own household.|{{bibleverse|Matt|10:34\u201336|NIV}}}}\n\nMany Christians believe that world peace is expected to be manifest upon the \"new earth\" that is promised in Christian scripture such as {{bibleref|Revelation|21|NIV}}.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] religious conception of \"[[Consecration of Russia]]\", related to the Church's high-priority [[Our Lady of F\u00e1tima|F\u00e1tima]] [[Marian apparitions]], promises a temporary ''world peace'' as a result of this process being fulfilled, though before the coming of the [[Antichrist]]. This period of temporary peace is called ''the triumph of the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary|Immaculate Heart]]''.\n\n===Hinduism===\n{{Main|Hinduism}}\nTraditionally, [[Hinduism]] has adopted an ancient [[Sanskrit]] phrase ''[[Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam|Vasudhaiva kutumbakam]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindudharmaforums.com/showthread.php?t=969&page=3|title=Dharmic Wisdom Quotes \u2013 Page 3|publisher=}}</ref> which translates as \"The world is one family\". The essence of this concept is the observation that only base minds see dichotomies and divisions. The more we seek wisdom, the more we become inclusive and free our internal spirit from worldly illusions or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]''. World peace is hence only achieved through internal means\u2014by liberating ourselves from artificial boundaries that separate us all.  As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n===Islam===\n{{Main|Islamic Peace}}\n\nAccording to [[Islamic eschatology]], the whole world will be united under the leadership of prophet [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] in his [[second coming]].<ref>Bukhari, Kitab Ahadith al-Ambiya; Bab: Nuzul 'Isa Ibn Maryam; Muslim, Bab: Bayan Nuzul 'Isa; Tirmidhi, Abwab-al-Fitan; Bab Fi Nuzul 'Isa; Musnad Ahmad, Marwiyat Abu Huraira.http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/M_fop/fop11.htm</ref> At that time love, justice and peace will be so abundant that the world will be in likeness of [[paradise]].\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Judaism}}\n\nThe concept of ''[[Tikkun olam]]'' (Repairing the World) is central to modern [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. ''Tikkun olam'' is accomplished through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, as well as through example persuading the rest of the world to behave morally. According to some views, ''Tikkun olam'' would result in the beginning of the [[Messianic Age]]. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual [[Mashiach|Messiah]]. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/mashiach.htm|title=Judaism 101: Mashiach: The Messiah|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, in [[Jewish messianism]] it is considered that at some future time a ''Messiah'' (literally \"a King appointed by God\") will rise up to bring all Jews back to the [[Land of Israel]], followed by everlasting global peace and prosperity.<ref>Rambam, [[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot Melachim, ch. 11\u201312</ref> This idea originates from passages in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Talmud]].\n{{quote|And he shall judge between the nations and reprove many peoples, and they shall beat their [[Swords to ploughshares|swords into plowshares]] and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift the sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.|{{bibleref|Isaiah|2:4|JPR}}}}\n\n===Jainism===\n{{Main|Jainism}}\n[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Compassion for all life, human and non-human]], is central to [[Jainism]]. They have adopted the wordings of Lord Mahvira [[Jiyo aur Jeeno Do]]. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment; to kill any person, no matter what crime he may have committed, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is a religion that requires monks and laity, from all its sects and traditions, to be vegetarian. Some Indian regions, such as [[Gujarat]], have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination have also become vegetarian.<ref>Titze, Kurt, Jainism: A Pictorial Guide to the Religion of Non-Violence, Mohtilal Banarsidass, 1998</ref> Famous quote on world peace as per Jainism by a 19th-century Indian legend, [[Virchand Gandhi]]: \"May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies.\"<ref>Useful instructions, In Matter religious, moral and others by Motilal M. Munishi, 1904</ref> As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n===Sikhism===\n{{Main|Sikhism}}\nPeace comes from God.  Meditation, the means of communicating with God, is unfruitful without the noble character of a devotee, there can be no worship without performing good deeds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Angela|title=Movement and Change|year=1997|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780174370673|page=46}}</ref> Guru Nanak stressed now ''[[kirat kar\u014d]]'': that a Sikh should balance work, worship, and charity, and should defend the rights of all creatures, and in particular, fellow human beings. They are encouraged to have a ''[[cha\u1e5bd\u012b kal\u0101]]'', or ''optimistic'' \u2013 ''resilience'', view of life. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing\u2014''[[va\u1e47\u1e0d chakk\u014d]]''\u2014through the distribution of free food at Sikh [[gurdwara]]s (''[[Langar (Sikhism)|la\u1e45gar]]''), giving charitable donations, and working for the good of the community and others (''[[Selfless service|s\u0113v\u0101]]''). Sikhs believe that no matter what race, sex, or religion one is, all are equal in God's eyes. Men and women are equal and share the same rights, and women can lead in prayers. As with all [[Dharmic religions]] (Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism), [[ahimsa]] (avoidance of violence) is a central concept.\n\n==Economic implications==\nA report in June 2015 on the [[Global Peace Index]] highlighted that the impact of violence on the global economy reached US$14.3&nbsp;trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-33161837|title=Global conflicts 'cost 13% of world GDP'|work=BBC News}}</ref> The report also found that the economic cost of violence is 13.4% of world GDP, equal to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK combined.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/16/global-cost-conflict-reaches-14tn-says-report|title=Global cost of conflict reaches $14.3tn, says report|author=Mark Anderson|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}} \n* [[Amity-Enmity Complex]]\n*[[Armistice]]\n*[[Ceasefire]]\n*[[Family Federation for World Peace and Unification]]\n*[[Global peace system]]\n* [[Global policeman]]\n*[[Inner peace]]\n*[[Interfaith dialogue]]\n*[[International community]]\n*[[International human rights law]]\n*[[International security]]\n*[[International Day of Non-Violence]]\n*[[International Day of Peace]]\n*[[List of anti-war organizations]]\n*[[List of civil rights leaders]]\n*[[List of ongoing military conflicts]]\n*[[List of peace activists]]\n*[[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n*[[Nonviolence]]\n*[[Pacifism]]\n*[[Peace movement]]\n*[[Peace One Day]]\n*[[Peace treaty]]\n*[[Peace walk]]\n*[[Perpetual peace]]\n*[[Philosophy of happiness]]\n*[[Preamble to the United Nations Charter]]\n*[[University for Peace]]\n*[[Utopian and dystopian fiction]]\n*[[War resister]]\n*[[War Resisters' International]]\n*[[World Peace Council]]\n*[[World Peace Foundation]]\n*[[World Peace Marathon]]\n*[[World union for peace and fundamental human rights and the rights of peoples]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.bsworldpeace.org/ Association Bernadette Strebel World Peace]\n* [http://www.gusp.org Global Union of Scientists for Peace]\n* [http://www.mindmeister.com/18150212?title=peace-in-the-world Peace in the World]\n* [http://www.teamworldpeace.org Team World Peace]\n* [[Allaman Castle|The Castle of Peace]]\n* [https://www.un.org/en/sc/documents/resolutions/index.shtml The Resolutions]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131104180329/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N08/484/53/PDF/N0848453.pdf?OpenElement UN Resolution re: Poverty]\n* [http://www.usip.org/ US Institute of Peace]\n* [http://www.wagingpeace.org/ Waging Peace]\n* [http://www.worldpeacegroup.org/consciousness_as_a_field.html World Peace Group]\n* [http://www.worldpeaceinprogress.com World Peace in Progress]\n* [http://worldpeacemarathon.com/ World Peace Marathon ]\n* [https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/behavioural/book/978-1-4419-9519-3 World Peace writings]\n* [http://www3.telus.net/public/t5837479/index1.htm Social Phenomena]\n{{anti-war}}\n{{Human rights}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Peace}}\n[[Category:Peace|*]]\n[[Category:Global citizenship]]\n", "name_user": "Igrallert", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:added link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace"}
