The Court's opinion explored the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and the history of civil writs to conclude that the writ for unpaid child support gave the police the authority to arrest Phillips and to conduct a search incident to arrest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201414660.pdf |title=United States v.

Sec'y, U.S. Dept. of Health & Human Servs. '' (11th Cir. 2014). In a unanimous order, a panel of the Eleventh Circuit enjoined the Secretary of HHS from enforcing the contraception mandate against Catholic television network EWTN.  Judge Pryor specially concurred, explaining why, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby, EWTN had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].  The concurrence is particularly notable because Judge Pryor noted that he parted ways with decisions of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits on the subject \"because the decisions of those courts are wholly unpersuasive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/files/201412696order.pdf |title=Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v.

On behalf of a unanimous panel, Pryor rejected the due process challenge brought by R.J. Reynolds to the application, as res judicata, of the previous determinations on liability made by a Florida jury in an unorthodox class action against the tobacco companies in the 1990s.  The panel concluded that it was required to give full faith and credit to the decision of the Florida trial court, as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court and that the application of full faith and credit did not violate the tobacco company's due process rights because R.J. Reynolds had been given notice and an opportunity to be heard throughout the litigation.  The opinion is particularly notable for a colorful paragraph at its conclusion discussing the intractable problem of tobacco litigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201213500.op2.pdf |title=Walker v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion vacating a settlement award in a class action relating to debt-settlement services.  The court concluded that the magistrate judge had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve the settlement because unnamed class members are not parties whose consent is required for adjudication by a magistrate judge.  But the court also concluded that the magistrate judge had abused its discretion when it approved a settlement that provided no monetary relief to the class members because he found that the defendants could not pay such monetary relief, but no evidence supported that finding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201211887.pdf |title=Day v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion reversing the convictions of four defendants for drug-trafficking in the territorial waters of Panama because the Act that criminalized their behavior exceeded the authority of Congress under the Offences against the Law of Nations Clause of the Constitution.  The opinion is the first in-depth interpretation of the constitutional provision by a federal circuit court.  Judge Rosemary Barkett specially concurred in the judgment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201114049.pdf|title=United States v. Bellaizac-Hurtado|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''United States v. Shaygan'' (11th Cir. 2011).  Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion vacating an award of over $600,000 in attorney's fees and costs against the United States and the public reprimand of two federal prosecutors.  The court explained that the prosecution was objectively reasonable and did not warrant sanctions under the Hyde Amendment.  The court also concluded that the district court had violated the due process rights of the federal prosecutors when it denied them notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200912129.pdf|title=United States v.

Orlando'' (11th Cir. 2011).  Writing for a unanimous en banc court, Pryor rejected an as-applied challenge by Orlando Food Not Bombs to a municipal ordinance that restricted the frequency of its feedings of homeless persons in parks located within a 2-mile radius of the Orlando City Hall.  The court assumed, without deciding, that the feeding of homeless persons constituted expressive conduct and determined that the ordinance, as applied to Orlando Food Not Bombs, constituted a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction and a reasonable regulation of expressive conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200816788op2.pdf|title=First Vagabonds Church of God v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion granting a writ of mandamus to substitute an Assistant Administrator of the EPA for the appearance of the Administrator in a case about the ecology of the Everglades.  The panel explained that the district court had abused its discretion in ordering the appearance of the agency head and encroached on the separation of powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201014535.pdf|title=In re United States|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Scott v. Roberts'' (11th Cir. 2010).  Pryor wrote for a unanimous panel reversing the district court and preliminarily restraining the enforcement of a Florida law that provided a dollar-for-dollar subsidy to a candidate's opponent once that candidate exceeded a statutory expenditure limit.  The panel concluded that Rick Scott, then-candidate in the Republican primary for the Governor of Florida, had made a substantial showing of likelihood of success on the merits because, even if the law served compelling state interests, the law was not the least restrictive means of serving those interests.  Scott went on to win the Republican primary and the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201013211.pdf|title=Scott v. Roberts|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups'' (11th Cir. 2009).  Pryor wrote for a unanimous panel upholding a Georgia law that required all registered voters in Georgia to present a government-issued photo identification to be allowed to vote in person.  The law also required Georgia to issue, free of charge, a \"Georgia voter identification card\" to any registered Georgia voter who lacked an acceptable form of identification.  The panel concluded that the NAACP and voters had standing to challenge the law, but that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to enjoin the law because the burdens on voters from the law were insignificant and the state had legitimate interests in preventing voter fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200714664.pdf|title=Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Pelphrey v. Cobb County'' (11th Cir. 2008). Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion, joined by Judge [[Charles R. Wilson (judge)|Charles R. Wilson]], affirming the district court ruling that sectarian prayers used to open commission meetings did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] as long as the prayer opportunity was not exploited to proselytize or to advance or disparage any particular faith or belief.  [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Donald Middlebrooks]] dissented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200713611.pdf|title=Pelphrey v.

Opinion affirmed district court ruling that a local ordinance limiting the placement of [[adult entertainment]] establishments was constitutional.

The police caught Phillips, a convicted felon, with a firearm while they were arresting him on a civil writ of bodily attachment for his failure to pay child support. The Court's opinion explored the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment and the history of civil writs to conclude that the writ for unpaid child support gave the police the authority to arrest Phillips and to conduct a search incident to arrest.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201414660.pdf |title=United States v.

Judge Pryor specially concurred, explaining why, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby, EWTN had shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits under the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].  The concurrence is particularly notable because Judge Pryor noted that he parted ways with decisions of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits on the subject \"because the decisions of those courts are wholly unpersuasive.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/files/201412696order.pdf |title=Eternal Word Television Network, Inc. v.

On behalf of a unanimous panel, Pryor rejected the due process challenge brought by R.J. Reynolds to the application, as res judicata, of the previous determinations on liability made by a Florida jury in an unorthodox class action against the tobacco companies in the 1990s.  The panel concluded that it was required to give full faith and credit to the decision of the Florida trial court, as interpreted by the Florida Supreme Court and that the application of full faith and credit did not violate the tobacco company's due process rights because R.J. Reynolds had been given notice and an opportunity to be heard throughout the litigation.  The opinion is particularly notable for a colorful paragraph at its conclusion discussing the intractable problem of tobacco litigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201213500.op2.pdf |title=Walker v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion vacating a settlement award in a class action relating to debt-settlement services.  The court concluded that the magistrate judge had subject-matter jurisdiction to approve the settlement because unnamed class members are not parties whose consent is required for adjudication by a magistrate judge.  But the court also concluded that the magistrate judge had abused its discretion when it approved a settlement that provided no monetary relief to the class members because he found that the defendants could not pay such monetary relief, but no evidence supported that finding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201211887.pdf |title=Day v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion reversing the convictions of four defendants for drug-trafficking in the territorial waters of Panama because the Act that criminalized their behavior exceeded the authority of Congress under the Offences against the Law of Nations Clause of the Constitution.  The opinion is the first in-depth interpretation of the constitutional provision by a federal circuit court.  Judge Rosemary Barkett specially concurred in the judgment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201114049.pdf|title=United States v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion vacating an award of over $600,000 in attorney's fees and costs against the United States and the public reprimand of two federal prosecutors.  The court explained that the prosecution was objectively reasonable and did not warrant sanctions under the Hyde Amendment.  The court also concluded that the district court had violated the due process rights of the federal prosecutors when it denied them notice of the charges and an opportunity to be heard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200912129.pdf|title=United States v.

Orlando'' (11th Cir. 2011).  Writing for a unanimous en banc court, Pryor rejected an as-applied challenge by Orlando Food Not Bombs to a municipal ordinance that restricted the frequency of its feedings of homeless persons in parks located within a 2-mile radius of the Orlando City Hall.  The court assumed, without deciding, that the feeding of homeless persons constituted expressive conduct and determined that the ordinance, as applied to Orlando Food Not Bombs, constituted a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction and a reasonable regulation of expressive conduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200816788op2.pdf|title=First Vagabonds Church of God v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion granting a writ of mandamus to substitute an Assistant Administrator of the EPA for the appearance of the Administrator in a case about the ecology of the Everglades.  The panel explained that the district court had abused its discretion in ordering the appearance of the agency head and encroached on the separation of powers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201014535.pdf|title=In re United States|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Scott v. Roberts'' (11th Cir. 2010).  Pryor wrote for a unanimous panel reversing the district court and preliminarily restraining the enforcement of a Florida law that provided a dollar-for-dollar subsidy to a candidate's opponent once that candidate exceeded a statutory expenditure limit.  The panel concluded that Rick Scott, then-candidate in the Republican primary for the Governor of Florida, had made a substantial showing of likelihood of success on the merits because, even if the law served compelling state interests, the law was not the least restrictive means of serving those interests.  Scott went on to win the Republican primary and the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/201013211.pdf|title=Scott v. Roberts|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups'' (11th Cir. 2009).  Pryor wrote for a unanimous panel upholding a Georgia law that required all registered voters in Georgia to present a government-issued photo identification to be allowed to vote in person.  The law also required Georgia to issue, free of charge, a \"Georgia voter identification card\" to any registered Georgia voter who lacked an acceptable form of identification.  The panel concluded that the NAACP and voters had standing to challenge the law, but that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to enjoin the law because the burdens on voters from the law were insignificant and the state had legitimate interests in preventing voter fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200714664.pdf|title=Common Cause/Georgia v. Billups|publisher=}}</ref>\n* ''Pelphrey v. Cobb County'' (11th Cir. 2008). Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion, joined by Judge [[Charles R. Wilson (judge)|Charles R. Wilson]], affirming the district court ruling that sectarian prayers used to open commission meetings did not violate the [[Establishment Clause]] as long as the prayer opportunity was not exploited to proselytize or to advance or disparage any particular faith or belief.  [[U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Donald Middlebrooks]] dissented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200713611.pdf|title=Pelphrey v.

Pryor wrote the majority (2\u20131) opinion, joined by Judge Birch, upholding the convictions of [[Cuban_Five|five Cuban spies (\"The Cuban Five\")]] for espionage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200117176.opn3.pdf|title=United States v.

Opinion affirmed district court ruling that a local ordinance limiting the placement of [[adult entertainment]] establishments was constitutional. The opinion was notable for Pryor's quote of a line from [[The B-52's]] song \"[[Love Shack]]\" in describing the proposed establishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/pub/files/200315685.pdf|title=Zibtluda LLC v.

He attended Catholic [[parochial school]]s and played basketball in high school.

He received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in 1966, and M.S. in biology from the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1976. In 1981 he earned a PhD in biobehavioral sciences from the University of Connecticut, where his adviser was [[Benson Ginsburg|Benson E. Ginsburg]], a founder and leader of modern behavior genetics. His thesis was on the behavioral development of wolves and resulted in two publications:\n* \"Induction of normal behavior in wolves with restricted rearing\", ''Behavioral and Neural Biology'', 33, pp.&nbsp;133\u201362 (1981)\n* \"Development and stability of personality characteristics in prepubertal wolves\", ''Journal of Comparative Psychology'', pp.&nbsp;97, 99\u2013106 (1983)\n\nMacDonald completed a post-doctoral fellowship with Ross Parke in the psychology department of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1983. MacDonald and Parke's work there resulted in three publications:\n* \"Bridging the gap: Parent-child play interactions and peer interactive competence\", ''Child Development'', 55, 1265\u201377 (1984)\n* \"Parent-child physical play: The effects of sex and age of children and parents\", ''Sex Roles'', 15, 367\u201378 (1986)\n* \"Parent-child physical play with rejected, neglected and popular boys\", ''Developmental Psychology'', 23, 705\u201311 (1987)\n\nMacDonald joined the Department of Psychology at [[California State University, Long Beach]] (CSU-LB) in 1985, and became a full professor in 1995.

He proposes that Judaism is a '''group evolutionary strategy'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> to enhance the ability of Jews to outcompete non-Jews for resources. Using the term \"Jewish ethnocentrism\", he argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior, as manifested in a series of influential intellectual movements. MacDonald says that not all Jews in all circumstances display the traits he identifies.<ref name=\"understanding3\"/>\n\nMacDonald published a series of three articles in ''The Occidental Quarterly'' on the alleged similarities between [[neoconservatism]] and other movements that he claims are Jewish-dominated.

The company also operated [[Network Chorley]] which provided transport around the local Chorley area until 2012.\n\nIn 2015, after Stagecoach re branded their Liverpool services as Stagecoach Merseyside, Stagecoach in Lancashire was re branded as Stagecoach in Chorley, Stagecoach in Preston and simply Stagecoach.\n\nIn September 2015, Stagecoach announced the purchase of 24 [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] buses, in the '[[Stagecoach Gold]] Specification' for the ''Route 125'' between [[Bolton]] and [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].

The other vehicles were transferred to [[Stagecoach in Preston]].\n\nIn October 2015, Stagecoach took over John Fishwick & Sons services 111, 115 and 119 until 8 April 2016.\n\nStagecoach trail ran a Stagecoach Gold service on ''Route 125'' on 17 October 2015, the full fleet entered service on 16 November 2015.\n\nStagecoach lost funding from [[Lancashire County Council]] in 2016 and consequently had to cancel and revise many routes in the [[Chorley]] area. The college services '''109, 109A and 115''' were withdrawn and have since been operated by Tyrers of Adlington.\n\n[[Stagecoach North West|Stagecoach in Chorley]]'s business was heavily affected by Lancashire County Council funding cuts and many routes have been withdrawn.\n\nStagecoach shortened the Route 109A that ran to Preston from Chorley in December 2018, the route now terminates in [[Leyland, Lancashire|Leyland.]]\n\nIn June 2019 Stagecoach announced that they were ceasing to operate the 109A service after losing funding from Lancashire County Council.\n\nFollowing the removal of the service 109A Stagecoach begin running two new services, the 118 and 119 between Chorley, Collingwood Road and Astley Village.\n\nIn September 2019 a bus driver for Stagecoach caused controversy online after being filmed driving a 125 service the wrong way round a roundabout in Chorley.\n\n[[File:StagecoachMMCNL.jpg|thumb|An [[Alexander Dennis]] [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMC|Enviro400MMC]] soon to be introduced on Route 125.]]\n\nStagecoach are due to replace the buses serving the Route 125 in 2020.\n\n<br />\n\n===Stagecoach in Merseyside===\n{{main|Glenvale Transport|Stagecoach in Merseyside}}\nStagecoach in Merseyside was the trading name of Glenvale Transport Ltd, which was purchased by Stagecoach in 2005. The original company was formed in 2001 following [[Arriva]]'s takeover of [[MTL (transport company)|MTL Group]] in 2000 and was ordered by the [[Competition Commission]] to sell the Gillmoss depot to avoid Arriva owning a monopoly of services in [[Merseyside]]. Stagecoach failed in an original attempt to obtain the depot in 2001, losing out to [[Glenvale Transport]]. Stagecoach bought Glenvale Transport in 2005 beating off competition from rivals [[FirstGroup]], [[Go-Ahead Group]] and [[Transdev Blazefield]].\n\n===Stagecoach Merseyside & South Lancashire===\nIn August 2011, Stagecoach Group announced plans to re-structure their UK Bus operations in the North West of England with the former [[Stagecoach North West]] operations, which consisted of Stagecoach in Cumbria, Stagecoach in Lancashire and Stagecoach in Lancaster. The re-structuring saw Stagecoach North West split up into two halves, with Cumbria and Lancaster operations merging into [[Stagecoach Cumbria & North Lancashire]] and Stagecoach in Merseyside merging with Stagecoach in Lancashire.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2011/2011-08-16.aspx\n|title=Stagecoach announces UK Bus Regional Management Appointments\n|publisher=Stagecoach Group\n|accessdate=18 February 2012}}</ref> The other Stagecoach operation in the North West of England, [[Stagecoach Manchester]], remained unaffected and continues as a separate operation.\n\n===Stagecoach in Chester and Wirral===\n{{main|First Chester & The Wirral}}\nIn November 2012, Stagecoach Group announced they had agreed a deal to purchase the operations of [[First Chester & The Wirral]] from [[FirstGroup]] for \u00a34.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u00a34.5million bus buyout for Stagecoach in region|url=http://www.chesterfirst.co.uk/news/117553/-4-5million-bus-buyout-for-stagecoach-in-region.aspx|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=Chester First|date=12 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111225535/http://www.chesterfirst.co.uk/news/117553/-4-5million-bus-buyout-for-stagecoach-in-region.aspx|archivedate=11 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The deal included the two main depots in Chester and [[Rock Ferry]], as well as a depot in [[Wrexham]] used for school services, plus 110 buses and 290 employees. The purchase was made through Stagecoach's Merseyside subsidiary, Glenvale Transport, bringing the Chester & Wirral operations under Stagecoach Merseyside. It was Stagecoach's second purchase from FirstGroup, following the purchase of [[First Greater Manchester]]'s Wigan depot in October 2012.\n\nThe takeover was confirmed to be completed on 13 January 2013<ref name=keepingyouintheloop /> with Stagecoach originally using ex-First buses and ticket machines before re-painting existing buses, bringing in old fleet vehicles from other areas and bringing in new buses and ticket machines.\nAll ex-first routes are now run by Stagecoach buses, carrying their own livery.\n\n==Depots==\n* [[Chester]] (Saighton Lane)\n*[[Chorley]] (Outstation.
