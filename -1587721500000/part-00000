Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.'''\n\n== '''Why do we use it?''' ==\n'''It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).'''\n\n== '''Where does it come from?''' ==\n'''Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.'''\n\n'''The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.'''\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Islamic period===\nIn excavations of the site of Tell Azaz, considerable quantities of ceramics from the early and middle Islamic periods were found.<ref name=\"Eger88\">Eger, p. 88.</ref> Despite the importance of Azaz as indicated by archaeological finds, the settlement was rarely mentioned in Islamic texts prior to the 12th century.

The case, ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Supreme Court decided in 2 Live Crew's favor, greatly expanding the doctrine of fair use and extending its protections to parodies created for profit. It is considered a seminal fair use decision.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Matt|title=Commerce versus art: The transformation of fair use|journal=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=March 1995|volume=39|issue=2|pages=190\u2013199|doi=10.1080/08838159509364298}}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

In 1999, the song was honored with a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] and was named one of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]'s [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked it #224 on their list of the \"[[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].\" On May 14, 2008, The [[Library of Congress]] selected the song for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]].\n\n===Lawsuit against 2 Live Crew===\n{{Further|Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.}}\nIn 1989, rap group [[2 Live Crew]] recorded a [[parody]] of the Orbison song, using the alternate title \"Pretty Woman\", for their album ''[[As Nasty As They Wanna Be#As Clean As They Wanna Be|As Clean As They Wanna Be]]''. 2 Live Crew [[sampling (music)|sample]]d the distinctive [[bassline]] from the Orbison song, but replaced the original lyrics with talk about a hairy woman and her bald-headed friend and their appeal to the singer, as well as denunciation of a \"two-timing woman.\"\n\nOrbison's publisher, [[Acuff-Rose Music]] sued 2 Live Crew on the basis that the [[fair use]] doctrine did not permit reuse of their [[copyright]]ed material for profit. The case, ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'' went all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]. The Supreme Court decided in 2 Live Crew's favor, greatly expanding the doctrine of fair use and extending its protections to parodies created for profit. It is considered a seminal fair use decision.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Matt|title=Commerce versus art: The transformation of fair use|journal=Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media|date=March 1995|volume=39|issue=2|pages=190\u2013199|doi=10.1080/08838159509364298}}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

It was preceded by a synth-driven intro titled \"Intruder\". For the video of the single, the two songs were joined, giving a running-time of 4:34. This was done to lengthen the song in order to fit the video's running time.\n\nIn the [[music video]], the band members dress as a samurai (bassist [[Michael Anthony (musician)|Michael Anthony]]), Tarzan (drummer [[Alex Van Halen]]), a cowboy (guitarist [[Eddie Van Halen]]), and [[Napoleon]] (frontman [[David Lee Roth]]). Per a hunchbacked onlooker's request, they rescue a captive girl (played by transgender entertainer [[International Chrysis]]). It was one of the first videos banned by [[MTV]], due to its opening sequence, where the captive girl is tied up and fondled against her will by a pair of little people.

Following the death of his father in 1922, Alec and his mother moved to the UK in 1923. Alec studied engineering at [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] in London. He failed his mathematics exams three times and subsequently called [[pure mathematics]] 'the enemy of every creative genius'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]], Alec decided to enter the [[University of London External Programme]] to complete his university education.\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Issigonis Lightweight Special (1938).ogg\n |title        =1938 Issigonis Lightweight Special at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009\n |type         =sound\n<!-- |style        =float:left;clear:none -->\n}}\nIssigonis went into the motor industry as an engineer and designer working for [[Humber Limited|Humber]] and competed successfully in motor racing during the 1930s and 1940s.  \nStarting around 1930, he raced a supercharged \"Ulster\" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]], later fitting it with a front axle of his own design, leading to employment at [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]. This greatly modified machine was replaced with a radical special completed in 1939, constructed of plywood laminated in aluminium sheeting. The suspension was also of advanced design, with trailing arm front suspension attached to a steel cross-member, and swing axle rear, all with rubber springs made of catapult elastic. This car was remarkably light, weighing 587&nbsp;lb, of which the engine contributed 252&nbsp;lb. By the time the chassis had been completed (hard labour\u2014it was all done by hand, no power tools), Issigonis had moved to [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]], but Austin supplied a \"works\" specification supercharged side-valve engine. Issigonis usually won, even when entered in the 1100cc class if there was no 750cc category. Most events entered were sprints, but he also raced at circuits.\n\nIn 1936, he moved to Morris Motors Limited at Cowley working on an independent front suspension system for the [[Morris 10]]. The war prevented this design from going into production but it was later used on the [[MG Y-type]]. He worked on various projects for Morris through the war and towards its end started work on an advanced post war car codenamed ''Mosquito'' that became the [[Morris Minor]], which was produced from 1948 until 1971. In 1952, just as BMC was formed by the merger of Morris and Austin, he moved to [[Alvis Cars]] where he designed an advanced saloon with all-aluminium V-8 engine, and experimented with interconnected [[independent suspension]] systems. This prototype was never manufactured because its cost was beyond Alvis's resources.\n\nAt the end of 1955, Issigonis was recruited back into BMC, this time into the Austin plant at Longbridge, by its chairman [[Leonard Lord|Sir Leonard Lord]], to design a new model family of three cars. The XC (experimental car) code names assigned for the new cars were ''XC/9001'', for a large comfortable car, ''XC/9002'', for a medium-sized family car, and ''XC/9003'', for a small town car. During 1956 Issigonis concentrated on the larger two cars, producing several prototypes for testing.\n\nHowever, at the end of 1956, following fuel rationing brought about by the [[Suez Crisis]], Issigonis was ordered by Lord to bring the smaller car, ''XC/9003'', to production as quickly as possible. By early 1957, prototypes were running, and by mid-1957 the project was given an official drawing office project number (''ADO15'') so that the thousands of drawings required for production could be produced. In August 1959 the car was launched as the Morris Mini Minor and the Austin Seven, which soon became known as the Austin Mini. In later years, the car would become known simply as the ''[[Mini]]''. Due to time pressures, the interconnected suspension system that Issigonis had planned for the car was replaced by an equally novel, but cruder, rubber cone system designed by [[Alex Moulton]]. The Mini went on to become the best selling British car in history with a production run of 5.3&nbsp;million cars. This ground-breaking design, with its [[front wheel drive]], [[transverse engine]], sump gearbox, 10-inch wheels, and phenomenal space efficiency, was still being manufactured in 2000 and has been the inspiration for almost all small front-wheel drive cars produced since the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, with the Mini gaining popularity, Issigonis was promoted to Technical Director of BMC. He continued to be responsible for his original ''XC'' projects.  ''XC/9002'' became ''ADO16'' and was launched as the [[Morris 1100]] with the [[Hydrolastic]] interconnected suspension system in August 1962.  ''XC/9001'' became ''ADO17'' and was launched, also with the Hydrolastic suspension system, as the [[Austin 1800]] in October 1964.The same principle was carried over for his next production car the [[Austin Maxi]], However, by then he had become more aware of the cost considerations of vehicle manufacture and in service warranty costs which were crippling BMC. It certainly appeared by the Maxi development era that Issigonis wanted to \"do his own thing\" as cost cutting and development costs spiraled. He would instead research work on his [[Mini]] replacement the 9X with its compact [[transverse engine]].\nWith the creation of [[British Leyland]] in 1969, new chairman [[Lord Stokes]] quickly sidelined Issigonis and made him into what was termed \"Special Developments Director\", replacing him with Harry Webster as the new Technical Director (Small/Medium cars). Stokes was heard on his appointment to say: \"We'll sharp sort this bloke Issigonis out!\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIssigonis was nicknamed \"the Greek god\" by his contemporaries.<ref

Constantine studied in England. Alec's mother, Hulda Prokopp, could trace her origins back to [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] (now part of Germany). It was through his mother's kinships that Issigonis was a [[first cousin once removed]] to [[BMW]] (and more briefly [[Volkswagen]]) director [[Bernd Pischetsrieder]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bardsley, Gillian|title=Issigonis: The Official Biography|publisher=Icon Books|isbn=1-84046-687-1}}</ref>\n\nBecause Alec and his parents were British subjects, they were evacuated to Malta by [[Royal Marines|British Royal Marines]] in September 1922, ahead of the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]] and the Turkish capture of Smyrna at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]]. Following the death of his father in 1922, Alec and his mother moved to the UK in 1923. Alec studied engineering at [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]] in London. He failed his mathematics exams three times and subsequently called [[pure mathematics]] 'the enemy of every creative genius'.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} After [[University of Surrey|Battersea Polytechnic]], Alec decided to enter the [[University of London External Programme]] to complete his university education.\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Issigonis Lightweight Special (1938).ogg\n |title        =1938 Issigonis Lightweight Special at Goodwood Festival of Speed 2009\n |type         =sound\n<!-- |style        =float:left;clear:none -->\n}}\nIssigonis went into the motor industry as an engineer and designer working for [[Humber Limited|Humber]] and competed successfully in motor racing during the 1930s and 1940s.  \nStarting around 1930, he raced a supercharged \"Ulster\" [[Austin 7|Austin Seven]], later fitting it with a front axle of his own design, leading to employment at [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]]. This greatly modified machine was replaced with a radical special completed in 1939, constructed of plywood laminated in aluminium sheeting. The suspension was also of advanced design, with trailing arm front suspension attached to a steel cross-member, and swing axle rear, all with rubber springs made of catapult elastic. This car was remarkably light, weighing 587&nbsp;lb, of which the engine contributed 252&nbsp;lb. By the time the chassis had been completed (hard labour\u2014it was all done by hand, no power tools), Issigonis had moved to [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]], but Austin supplied a \"works\" specification supercharged side-valve engine. Issigonis usually won, even when entered in the 1100cc class if there was no 750cc category. Most events entered were sprints, but he also raced at circuits.\n\nIn 1936, he moved to Morris Motors Limited at Cowley working on an independent front suspension system for the [[Morris 10]]. The war prevented this design from going into production but it was later used on the [[MG Y-type]]. He worked on various projects for Morris through the war and towards its end started work on an advanced post war car codenamed ''Mosquito'' that became the [[Morris Minor]], which was produced from 1948 until 1971. In 1952, just as BMC was formed by the merger of Morris and Austin, he moved to [[Alvis Cars]] where he designed an advanced saloon with all-aluminium V-8 engine, and experimented with interconnected [[independent suspension]] systems. This prototype was never manufactured because its cost was beyond Alvis's resources.\n\nAt the end of 1955, Issigonis was recruited back into BMC, this time into the Austin plant at Longbridge, by its chairman [[Leonard Lord|Sir Leonard Lord]], to design a new model family of three cars. The XC (experimental car) code names assigned for the new cars were ''XC/9001'', for a large comfortable car, ''XC/9002'', for a medium-sized family car, and ''XC/9003'', for a small town car. During 1956 Issigonis concentrated on the larger two cars, producing several prototypes for testing.\n\nHowever, at the end of 1956, following fuel rationing brought about by the [[Suez Crisis]], Issigonis was ordered by Lord to bring the smaller car, ''XC/9003'', to production as quickly as possible. By early 1957, prototypes were running, and by mid-1957 the project was given an official drawing office project number (''ADO15'') so that the thousands of drawings required for production could be produced. In August 1959 the car was launched as the Morris Mini Minor and the Austin Seven, which soon became known as the Austin Mini. In later years, the car would become known simply as the ''[[Mini]]''. Due to time pressures, the interconnected suspension system that Issigonis had planned for the car was replaced by an equally novel, but cruder, rubber cone system designed by [[Alex Moulton]]. The Mini went on to become the best selling British car in history with a production run of 5.3&nbsp;million cars. This ground-breaking design, with its [[front wheel drive]], [[transverse engine]], sump gearbox, 10-inch wheels, and phenomenal space efficiency, was still being manufactured in 2000 and has been the inspiration for almost all small front-wheel drive cars produced since the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1961, with the Mini gaining popularity, Issigonis was promoted to Technical Director of BMC. He continued to be responsible for his original ''XC'' projects.  ''XC/9002'' became ''ADO16'' and was launched as the [[Morris 1100]] with the [[Hydrolastic]] interconnected suspension system in August 1962.  ''XC/9001'' became ''ADO17'' and was launched, also with the Hydrolastic suspension system, as the [[Austin 1800]] in October 1964.The same principle was carried over for his next production car the [[Austin Maxi]], However, by then he had become more aware of the cost considerations of vehicle manufacture and in service warranty costs which were crippling BMC. It certainly appeared by the Maxi development era that Issigonis wanted to \"do his own thing\" as cost cutting and development costs spiraled. He would instead research work on his [[Mini]] replacement the 9X with its compact [[transverse engine]].\nWith the creation of [[British Leyland]] in 1969, new chairman [[Lord Stokes]] quickly sidelined Issigonis and made him into what was termed \"Special Developments Director\", replacing him with Harry Webster as the new Technical Director (Small/Medium cars). Stokes was heard on his appointment to say: \"We'll sharp sort this bloke Issigonis out!\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIssigonis was nicknamed \"the Greek god\" by his contemporaries.<ref

Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in [[cook stove]]s known as ''chullah'' or ''chulha'' piece in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of challahs. It affects our lungs. In air pollution there are harmful gases that are present in air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green stoves to replace chullahs|date=December 3, 2009|publisher=The Times of India|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-03/india/28096828_1_biomass-climate-renewable-energy-sources}}</ref> The air pollution is also the main cause of the [[Asian brown cloud]] which is delaying the start of the [[monsoon]]. Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\n\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuel-wood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agricultural waste and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent.<ref name=\"cifor2002\">{{cite book|title=Fuelwood Studies in India: Myth and Reality|author =Devendra Pandey|year=2002|isbn=979-8764-92-7|publisher=Center for International Forestry Research|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/Fuelwood.pdf}}</ref> The overall contribution of fuelwood, including [[sawdust]] and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.<ref name=\"cifor2002\" /> India burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States; the fuelwood quality in India is different from the dry firewood of the United States; and, the Indian stoves in use are less efficient, thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent.\n\n===Fuel adulteration===\nSome Indian taxis and [[auto rickshaw|auto-rickshaws]] run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.<ref name=fuela>{{cite web|title=Urban Air Pollution, Catching gasoline ad diesel adulteration|year=2002|publisher=The World Bank|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/13/000094946_02083104140124/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf}}</ref> Some [[adulterants]] increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax.\n\nAs fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper [[hydrocarbon]] into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20\u201330 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\n\nAdulterated fuel increases [[tailpipe emissions]] of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions \u2014 which fall into the category of unregulated emissions \u2014 of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well-known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline, its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and \nPM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\n[[Traffic congestion]] is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused by several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometre of available roads, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos due to poor enforcement of traffic laws.\n\nTraffic congestion reduces the average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal that vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. An average trip speeds between 20 and 40 kilometres per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometres per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 and 20 kilometres per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometres per hour.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Real-World CO2 Impacts of Traffic Congestion |journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board |author1=Matthew Barth |author2=Kanok Boriboonsomsin |date=November 2009 |doi=10.3141/2058-20 |volume=2058 |pages=163\u2013171 |url=http://trb.metapress.com/content/n622635366032635/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530124628/http://trb.metapress.com/content/n622635366032635/ |archivedate=2016-05-30 }}</ref> Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\n\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other Indian cities is extreme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gridlocked Delhi: six years of career lost in traffic jams|date=September 5, 2010|publisher=India Today|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gridlocked-delhi-six-years-of-career-lost-in-jams/1/111506.html}}</ref> The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometres per hour; a 10-kilometre trip can take 30 minutes, or more.

These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\n\nThe key findings of India's central pollution control board are:<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL AIR QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMME|year=2011|publisher=Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India|url=http://cpcbenvis.nic.in/airpollution/finding.htm}}</ref>\n\n*Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by the government.\n*A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Lucknow]], [[Bhopal]] during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of CNG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\n*A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\n*Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\n*The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions. In other words, India's air quality worsens in winter months, and improves with the onset of monsoon season.\n*The average annual [[Air pollution|SOx and NOx]] emissions level and periodic violations in industrial areas of India were significantly and surprisingly lower than the emission and violations in residential areas of India\n*Of the four major Indian cities, air pollution was consistently worse in [[Delhi]], every year over 5-year period (2004\u20132018).

When it burns, it produces smoke and numerous indoor air pollutants at concentrations 5 times higher than coal.]]\n\n=== Fuel and biomass burning ===\n[[File:The rural stove,smoky,pollution,TamilNadu-230.jpeg|thumb|250px|A rural  aburo stove using biomass cakes, fuelwood and trash as cooking fuel. Surveys suggest over 100 million households in India use such stoves (chullahs) every day, 2\u20133 times a day. Clean burning fuels and electricity are unavailable in rural parts and small towns of India because of poor rural highways and limited energy generation infrastructure.]]\n\nFuel wood and [[biomass]] burning is the primary reason for [[Asian brown cloud|near-permanent haze and smoke]] observed above rural and urban India, and in satellite pictures of the country. Fuelwood and biomass cakes are used for cooking and general heating needs. These are burnt in [[cook stove]]s known as ''chullah'' or ''chulha'' piece in some parts of India. These cook stoves are present in over 100 million Indian households, and are used two to three times a day, daily. Some reports, including one by the World Health Organization, claim 300,000 to 400,000 people die of indoor air pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning in India because of biomass burning and use of challahs. It affects our lungs. In air pollution there are harmful gases that are present in air.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green stoves to replace chullahs|date=December 3, 2009|publisher=The Times of India|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-03/india/28096828_1_biomass-climate-renewable-energy-sources}}</ref> The air pollution is also the main cause of the [[Asian brown cloud]] which is delaying the start of the [[monsoon]]. Burning of biomass and firewood will not stop unless electricity or clean burning fuel and combustion technologies become reliably available and widely adopted in rural and urban India.\n\nIndia is the world's largest consumer of fuelwood, agricultural waste and biomass for energy purposes. From the most recent available nationwide study, India used 148.7 million tonnes coal replacement worth of fuel-wood and biomass annually for domestic energy use. India's national average annual per capita consumption of fuel wood, agricultural waste and biomass cakes was 206 kilogram coal equivalent.<ref name=\"cifor2002\">{{cite book|title=Fuelwood Studies in India: Myth and Reality|author =Devendra Pandey|year=2002|isbn=979-8764-92-7|publisher=Center for International Forestry Research|url=http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/Fuelwood.pdf}}</ref> The overall contribution of fuelwood, including [[sawdust]] and wood waste, was about 46% of the total, the rest being agri waste and biomass dung cakes. Traditional fuel (fuelwood, crop residue and dung cake) dominates domestic energy use in rural India and accounts for about 90% of the total. In urban areas, this traditional fuel constitutes about 24% of the total.<ref name=\"cifor2002\" /> India burns tenfold more fuelwood every year than the United States; the fuelwood quality in India is different from the dry firewood of the United States; and, the Indian stoves in use are less efficient, thereby producing more smoke and air pollutants per kilogram equivalent.\n\n===Fuel adulteration===\nSome Indian taxis and [[auto rickshaw|auto-rickshaws]] run on adulterated fuel blends. Adulteration of gasoline and diesel with lower-priced fuels is common in South Asia, including India.<ref name=fuela>{{cite web|title=Urban Air Pollution, Catching gasoline ad diesel adulteration|year=2002|publisher=The World Bank|url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2002/09/13/000094946_02083104140124/Rendered/PDF/multi0page.pdf}}</ref> Some [[adulterants]] increase emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, worsening urban air pollution. Financial incentives arising from differential taxes are generally the primary cause of fuel adulteration. In India and other developing countries, gasoline carries a much higher tax than diesel, which in turn is taxed more than kerosene meant as a cooking fuel, while some solvents and lubricants carry little or no tax.\n\nAs fuel prices rise, the public transport driver cuts costs by blending the cheaper [[hydrocarbon]] into highly taxed hydrocarbon. The blending may be as much as 20\u201330 percent. For a low wage driver, the adulteration can yield short term savings that are significant over the month. The consequences to long term air pollution, quality of life and effect on health are simply ignored. Also ignored are the reduced life of vehicle engine and higher maintenance costs, particularly if the taxi, auto-rickshaw or truck is being rented for a daily fee.\n\nAdulterated fuel increases [[tailpipe emissions]] of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), [[Nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) and particulate matter (PM). Air toxin emissions \u2014 which fall into the category of unregulated emissions \u2014 of primary concern are benzene and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), both well-known carcinogens. Kerosene is more difficult to burn than gasoline, its addition results in higher levels of HC, CO and \nPM emissions even from catalyst-equipped cars. The higher sulfur level of kerosene is another issue.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\n[[Traffic congestion]] is severe in India's cities and towns. Traffic congestion is caused by several reasons, some of which are: increase in number of vehicles per kilometre of available roads, a lack of intra-city divided-lane highways and intra-city expressways networks, lack of inter-city expressways, traffic accidents and chaos due to poor enforcement of traffic laws.\n\nTraffic congestion reduces the average traffic speed. At low speeds, scientific studies reveal that vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, a study in the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. An average trip speeds between 20 and 40 kilometres per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometres per hour. At average trip speeds between 5 and 20 kilometres per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometres per hour.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Real-World CO2 Impacts of Traffic Congestion |journal=Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board |author1=Matthew Barth |author2=Kanok Boriboonsomsin |date=November 2009 |doi=10.3141/2058-20 |volume=2058 |pages=163\u2013171 |url=http://trb.metapress.com/content/n622635366032635/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160530124628/http://trb.metapress.com/content/n622635366032635/ |archivedate=2016-05-30 }}</ref> Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.\n\nTraffic gridlock in Delhi and other Indian cities is extreme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gridlocked Delhi: six years of career lost in traffic jams|date=September 5, 2010|publisher=India Today|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gridlocked-delhi-six-years-of-career-lost-in-jams/1/111506.html}}</ref> The average trip speed on many Indian city roads is less than 20 kilometres per hour; a 10-kilometre trip can take 30 minutes, or more. At such speeds, vehicles in India emit air pollutants 4 to 8 times more than they would with less traffic congestion; Indian vehicles also consume a lot more carbon footprint fuel per trip, than they would if the traffic congestion was less.

These are target air pollutants for regular monitoring at 308 operating stations in 115 cities/towns in 25 states and 4 Union Territories of India. The monitoring of meteorological parameters such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity and temperature has also been integrated with the monitoring of air quality. The monitoring of these pollutants is carried out for 24 hours (4-hourly sampling for gaseous pollutants and 8-hourly sampling for particulate matter) with a frequency of twice a week, to yield 104 observations in a year.\n\nThe key findings of India's central pollution control board are:<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL AIR QUALITY MONITORING PROGRAMME|year=2011|publisher=Ministry of Environment & Forests, Government of India|url=http://cpcbenvis.nic.in/airpollution/finding.htm}}</ref>\n\n*Most Indian cities continue to violate India's and world air quality PM10 targets. Respirable particulate matter pollution remains a key challenge for India. Despite the general non-attainment, some cities showed far more improvement than others. A decreasing trend has been observed in PM10 levels in cities like Solapur and Ahmedabad over the last few years. This improvement may be due to local measures taken to reduce sulphur in diesel and stringent enforcement by the government.\n*A decreasing trend has been observed in sulphur dioxide levels in residential areas of many cities such as [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Lucknow]], [[Bhopal]] during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced clean fuel standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood, and the use of CNG instead of diesel in certain vehicles.\n*A decreasing trend has been observed in nitrogen dioxide levels in residential areas of some cities such as Bhopal and Solapur during last few years. The decreasing trend in sulphur dioxide levels may be due to recently introduced vehicle emission standards, and the increasing use of LPG as domestic fuel instead of coal or fuelwood.\n*Most Indian cities greatly exceed acceptable levels of suspended particulate matter. This may be because of refuse and biomass burning, vehicles, power plant emissions, industrial sources.\n*The Indian air quality monitoring stations reported lower levels of PM10 and suspended particulate matter during monsoon months possibly due to wet deposition and air scrubbing by rainfall. Higher levels of particulates were observed during winter months possibly due to lower mixing heights and more calm conditions.

The signal processing steps in JPEG XR are the same for both lossless and lossy coding. This makes the lossless mode simple to support and enables the \"trimming\" of some bits from a lossless compressed image to produce a lossy compressed image.\n; Tile structure support: A JPEG XR coded image can be segmented into ''tile'' regions.  The data for each region can be decoded separately. This enables rapid access to parts of an image without needing to decode the entire image. When a type of tiling referred to as \"soft tiling\" is used, the tile region structuring can be changed without fully decoding the image and without introducing additional distortion.\n; Support for more color accuracy: JPEG XR supports a wide variety of image color representations in addition to the conventional 8-bit-per-sample [[YUV]] (formally [[YCbCr]]) [[4:2:0]] encoding that is typically used for the original JPEG standard.\n: For support of images using an [[RGB color space]], JPEG XR includes an internal conversion to the [[YCoCg]] color space, and supports a variety of bit depth and color representation packing schemes. These can be used with and without an accompanying alpha channel for shape masking and semi-transparency support, and some of them have much higher precision than what has typically been used for image coding. They include:\n:* Low bit-depth packings of RGB into 16 bits per pixel using 5 bits for each channel or 5 bits for red and blue and 6 bits for green\n:* 8 bits per component (sometimes called [[24-bit color|true color]]) packed into 24 or 32 bits per pixel\n:* 10 bits per component in a 32 bit packed representation (one of several higher-precision varieties of color representation known as [[deep color]])\n:* 16 bits per component as integers, fixed-point numbers, or half-precision floating-point numbers packed into 48 or 64 bits\n:* 32 bits per component as fixed-point numbers or full-precision floating point numbers packed into 96 or 128 bits (for which lossless coding is not supported due to the excessively high precision)\n: JPEG XR also supports 16-bit per component (64-bit per pixel) integer [[CMYK color model]].<ref name=\"ms-billcrow-pixelformat1\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/billcrow/archive/2006/06/19/636858.aspx|title=Pixel Formats (Part 1: Unsigned Integers)|last=Crow|first=Bill|work=Bill Crow's Digital Imaging & Photography Blog|publisher=Microsoft Developer Network|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=26 October 2009}}</ref>\n: 16-bit and 32-bit fixed point color component codings are also supported in JPEG XR.  In such encodings, the most-significant 4 bits of each color channel are treated as providing additional \"headroom\" and \"toe room\" beyond the range of values that represents the nominal black-to-white signal range.\n: Moreover, 16-bit and 32-bit floating point color component codings are supported in JPEG XR. In these cases the image is interpreted as floating point data, although the JPEG XR encoding and decoding steps are all performed using only integer operations (to simplify the compression processing).\n: The shared-exponent floating point color format known as [[RGBE image format|RGBE]] ([[Radiance (software)|Radiance]]) is also supported, enabling more faithful storage of [[High dynamic range imaging|High Dynamic Range (HDR) images]].\n: In addition to RGB and CMYK formats, JPEG XR also supports [[grayscale]] and multi-[[Channel (digital image)|channel]] color encodings with an arbitrary number of channels.\n: The color representations, in most cases, are transformed to an internal color representation. The transformation is entirely reversible, so that this color transformation step does not introduce distortion and thus lossless coding modes can be supported.\n; Transparency map support: An [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] may be present to represent transparency, so that alpha blending overlay capability is enabled.\n; Compressed-domain image modification: In JPEG XR, full decoding of the image is unnecessary for converting an image from a lossless to lossy encoding, reducing the fidelity of a lossy encoding, or reducing the encoded image resolution.\n: Full decoding is also unnecessary for certain editing operations such as cropping, horizontal or vertical flips, or [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] rotations.\n: The tile structure for access to image regions can also be changed without full decoding and without introducing distortion.\n; Metadata support: A JPEG XR image file may optionally contain an embedded [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] color profile, to achieve consistent color representation across multiple devices.\n: [[Exif]] and [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] metadata formats are also supported.\n\n===Container format===\nOne file [[container format (digital)|container format]] that can be used to store JPEG XR image data is specified in Annex A of the JPEG XR standard.  It is a [[TIFF]]-like format using a table of ''[[Image File Directory]]'' (IFD) tags. A JPEG XR file contains image data, optional alpha channel data, metadata, optional [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] metadata stored as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF/XML]], and optional [[Exif]] metadata, in IFD tags. The image data is a contiguous self-contained chunk of data. The optional alpha channel, if present, can be compressed as a separate image record, enabling decoding of the image data independently of transparency data in applications which do not support transparency.  (Alternatively, JPEG XR also supports an \"interleaved\" alpha channel format in which the alpha channel data is encoded together with the other image data in a single compressed codestream.)\n\nBeing TIFF-based, this format inherits all of the limitations of the TIFF format including the 4 GB file-size limit, which according to the HD Photo specification \"will be addressed in a future update\".<ref name=\"WMPspec\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/wmphoto.mspx\n| title=Windows Media Photo Specification\n| accessdate=2016-10-05\n}}</ref>\n\nNew work has been started in the JPEG committee to enable the use of JPEG XR image coding within the JPX file storage format \u2014 enabling use of the JPIP protocol, which allows interactive browsing of networked images.<ref name=\"July09PR\"/> Additionally, a Motion JPEG XR specification was approved as an ISO standard for motion (video) compression in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpeg.org/newsrel28.html|title=JPEG launches Innovations group, new book \" JPEG 2000 Suite \" published|publisher=jpeg.org|date=19 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925193937/http://jpeg.org/newsrel28.html|archivedate=25 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Compression algorithm===\n[[File:Comparison between JPEG, JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR.png|thumb|right|350px|Comparison between JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and JPEG.]]\nJPEG XR's design<ref name=\"T832\"/><ref name=\"SPIEoverview\">S.

JPEG XR also supports lossless and lossy compression of floating-point image data (by representing the floating-point values in an [[IEEE 754]]-like format, and encoding them as though they were integers) and [[RGBE image format|RGBE]] imagery.\n* [[JFIF]] and other typical image encoding practices specify a linear transformation from RGB to [[YCbCr]], which is slightly lossy in practice because of [[roundoff error]].

This gives the transform a [[wavelet]]-like multi-resolution hierarchy and improves its compression capability.\n* The [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]], the frequency transformation used by JPEG, is slightly lossy because of roundoff error. JPEG XR uses a type of integer transform employing a [[lifting scheme]].<ref name=\"LiftingTransform\">C. Tu, S. Srinivasan, [[Gary Sullivan (engineer)|G. J. Sullivan]], S.

In fact, it is a particular realization of a larger family of binary-friendly multiplier-less transforms called the binDCT.<ref name=binDCT>{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=Jie|author2=Trac D.

Its purpose is to improve compression capability and reduce [[compression artifact|block-boundary artifacts]] at low bitrates. At high bitrates, where such artifacts are typically not a problem, the prefiltering can be omitted to reduce encoding and decoding time. The overlap filtering is constructed using integer operations following a [[lifting scheme]], so that it is also lossless. When appropriately combined, the POT and the PCT in JPEG-XR form a lapped transform.<ref name=prepost>{{cite journal|last=Tran|first=Trac D.|author2=Jie Liang |author3=Chengjie Tu |title=Lapped transform via time-domain pre- and post-filtering|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=2003|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1557\u20131571|doi=10.1109/TSP.2003.811222|citeseerx=10.1.1.7.8314}}</ref>\n* In JPEG, the image DC coefficients of the DCT blocks are predicted by applying DC prediction from the left neighbor transform block, and no other coeffients are predicted. In JPEG XR, 4 \u00d7 4 blocks are grouped into macroblocks of 16 \u00d7 16 samples, and the 16 DC coefficients from the 4 \u00d7 4 blocks of each macroblock are passed through another level of frequency transformation, leaving three types of coefficients to be entropy coded: the macroblock DC coefficients (called DC), macroblock-level AC coefficients (called \"lowpass\"), and lower-level AC coefficients (called AC).  Prediction of coefficient values across transform blocks is applied to the DC coefficients and to an additional row or column of AC coefficients as well.\n* JPEG XR supports the encoding of an image by decomposing it into smaller individual rectangular ''tile'' area regions.  Each tile area can be decoded independently from the other areas of the picture.  This allows fast access to spatial areas of pictures without decoding the entire picture.\n* JPEG XR's entropy coding phase is more adaptive and complex than JPEG's, involving a DC and AC coefficient prediction scheme, adaptive coefficient reordering (in contrast to JPEG's fixed zigzag ordering), and a form of adaptive Huffman coding for the coefficients themselves.\n* JPEG uses a single quantization step size per DC/AC component per color plane per image. JPEG XR allows a selection of DC quantization step sizes on a ''tile'' region basis, and allows lowpass and AC quantization step sizes to vary from macroblock to macroblock.\n* Because all encoding phases except quantization are lossless, JPEG XR is lossless when all quantization coefficients are equal to 1. This is not true of JPEG. JPEG defines a separate lossless mode which does not use the DCT, but it is not implemented by [[libjpeg]] and therefore not widely supported.\n\nThe HD Photo bitstream specification claims that \"HD Photo offers image quality comparable to [[JPEG-2000]] with computational and memory performance more closely comparable to JPEG\", that it \"delivers a lossy compressed image of better perceptive quality than JPEG at less than half the file size\", and that \"lossless compressed images \u2026 are typically 2.5 times smaller than the original uncompressed data\".\n\n==Software support==\nA reference software implementation of JPEG XR has been published as ITU-T Recommendation T.835 and ISO/IEC International Standard 29199-5.\n\nThe following notable software products natively support JPEG XR:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In 2011, they published a technical report describing the workflow architecture for the use of JPEG XR images in applications (ITU-T T.Sup2 | ISO/IEC TR 29199-1).\n\n==Description==\n\n===Capabilities===\nJPEG XR is an image file format that offers several key improvements over [[JPEG]], including:<ref name=\"ms-billcrow-jpegxr\">{{cite web|title=JPEG XR is Now an International Standard|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/billcrow/archive/2007/03.aspx|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|work=[[MSDN Blogs|Microsoft Developer Network blogs]], Bill Crow's blog|last=Bill|first=Crow|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n; Better compression:\n: JPEG XR file format supports higher compression ratios in comparison to JPEG for encoding an image with equivalent quality.\n; Lossless compression:\n: JPEG XR also supports [[lossless compression]]. The signal processing steps in JPEG XR are the same for both lossless and lossy coding. This makes the lossless mode simple to support and enables the \"trimming\" of some bits from a lossless compressed image to produce a lossy compressed image.\n; Tile structure support:\n: A JPEG XR coded image can be segmented into ''tile'' regions.  The data for each region can be decoded separately. This enables rapid access to parts of an image without needing to decode the entire image. When a type of tiling referred to as \"soft tiling\" is used, the tile region structuring can be changed without fully decoding the image and without introducing additional distortion.\n; Support for more color accuracy:\n: JPEG XR supports a wide variety of image color representations in addition to the conventional 8-bit-per-sample [[YUV]] (formally [[YCbCr]]) [[4:2:0]] encoding that is typically used for the original JPEG standard.\n: For support of images using an [[RGB color space]], JPEG XR includes an internal conversion to the [[YCoCg]] color space, and supports a variety of bit depth and color representation packing schemes. These can be used with and without an accompanying alpha channel for shape masking and semi-transparency support, and some of them have much higher precision than what has typically been used for image coding. They include:\n:* Low bit-depth packings of RGB into 16 bits per pixel using 5 bits for each channel or 5 bits for red and blue and 6 bits for green\n:* 8 bits per component (sometimes called [[24-bit color|true color]]) packed into 24 or 32 bits per pixel\n:* 10 bits per component in a 32 bit packed representation (one of several higher-precision varieties of color representation known as [[deep color]])\n:* 16 bits per component as integers, fixed-point numbers, or half-precision floating-point numbers packed into 48 or 64 bits\n:* 32 bits per component as fixed-point numbers or full-precision floating point numbers packed into 96 or 128 bits (for which lossless coding is not supported due to the excessively high precision)\n: JPEG XR also supports 16-bit per component (64-bit per pixel) integer [[CMYK color model]].<ref name=\"ms-billcrow-pixelformat1\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/billcrow/archive/2006/06/19/636858.aspx|title=Pixel Formats (Part 1: Unsigned Integers)|last=Crow|first=Bill|work=Bill Crow's Digital Imaging & Photography Blog|publisher=Microsoft Developer Network|date=1 June 2006|accessdate=26 October 2009}}</ref>\n: 16-bit and 32-bit fixed point color component codings are also supported in JPEG XR.  In such encodings, the most-significant 4 bits of each color channel are treated as providing additional \"headroom\" and \"toe room\" beyond the range of values that represents the nominal black-to-white signal range.\n: Moreover, 16-bit and 32-bit floating point color component codings are supported in JPEG XR. In these cases the image is interpreted as floating point data, although the JPEG XR encoding and decoding steps are all performed using only integer operations (to simplify the compression processing).\n: The shared-exponent floating point color format known as [[RGBE image format|RGBE]] ([[Radiance (software)|Radiance]]) is also supported, enabling more faithful storage of [[High dynamic range imaging|High Dynamic Range (HDR) images]].\n: In addition to RGB and CMYK formats, JPEG XR also supports [[grayscale]] and multi-[[Channel (digital image)|channel]] color encodings with an arbitrary number of channels.\n: The color representations, in most cases, are transformed to an internal color representation. The transformation is entirely reversible, so that this color transformation step does not introduce distortion and thus lossless coding modes can be supported.\n; Transparency map support:\n: An [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] may be present to represent transparency, so that alpha blending overlay capability is enabled.\n; Compressed-domain image modification:\n: In JPEG XR, full decoding of the image is unnecessary for converting an image from a lossless to lossy encoding, reducing the fidelity of a lossy encoding, or reducing the encoded image resolution.\n: Full decoding is also unnecessary for certain editing operations such as cropping, horizontal or vertical flips, or [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] rotations.\n: The tile structure for access to image regions can also be changed without full decoding and without introducing distortion.\n; Metadata support:\n: A JPEG XR image file may optionally contain an embedded [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] color profile, to achieve consistent color representation across multiple devices.\n: [[Exif]] and [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] metadata formats are also supported.\n\n===Container format===\nOne file [[container format (digital)|container format]] that can be used to store JPEG XR image data is specified in Annex A of the JPEG XR standard.  It is a [[TIFF]]-like format using a table of ''[[Image File Directory]]'' (IFD) tags. A JPEG XR file contains image data, optional alpha channel data, metadata, optional [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] metadata stored as [[Resource Description Framework|RDF/XML]], and optional [[Exif]] metadata, in IFD tags. The image data is a contiguous self-contained chunk of data. The optional alpha channel, if present, can be compressed as a separate image record, enabling decoding of the image data independently of transparency data in applications which do not support transparency.  (Alternatively, JPEG XR also supports an \"interleaved\" alpha channel format in which the alpha channel data is encoded together with the other image data in a single compressed codestream.)\n\nBeing TIFF-based, this format inherits all of the limitations of the TIFF format including the 4 GB file-size limit, which according to the HD Photo specification \"will be addressed in a future update\".<ref name=\"WMPspec\">{{cite web\n| url=http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/wmphoto.mspx\n| title=Windows Media Photo Specification\n| accessdate=2016-10-05\n}}</ref>\n\nNew work has been started in the JPEG committee to enable the use of JPEG XR image coding within the JPX file storage format \u2014 enabling use of the JPIP protocol, which allows interactive browsing of networked images.<ref name=\"July09PR\"/> Additionally, a Motion JPEG XR specification was approved as an ISO standard for motion (video) compression in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpeg.org/newsrel28.html|title=JPEG launches Innovations group, new book \" JPEG 2000 Suite \" published|publisher=jpeg.org|date=19 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925193937/http://jpeg.org/newsrel28.html|archivedate=25 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Compression algorithm===\n[[File:Comparison between JPEG, JPEG 2000 and JPEG XR.png|thumb|right|350px|Comparison between JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and JPEG.]]\nJPEG XR's design<ref name=\"T832\"/><ref name=\"SPIEoverview\">S.

JPEG XR also supports lossless and lossy compression of floating-point image data (by representing the floating-point values in an [[IEEE 754]]-like format, and encoding them as though they were integers) and [[RGBE image format|RGBE]] imagery.\n* [[JFIF]] and other typical image encoding practices specify a linear transformation from RGB to [[YCbCr]], which is slightly lossy in practice because of [[roundoff error]]. JPEG XR specifies a lossless colorspace transformation, namely [[YCoCg#The lifting-based YCoCg-R variation|YCoCg-R]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Analysis of BSDL-based content adaptation for JPEG 2000 and HD Photo (JPEG XR) |url=https://www.slideshare.net/wmdeneve/analysis-of-bsdlbased-content-adaptation-for-jpeg-2000-and-hd-photo-jpeg-xr-5152654/7  |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=JPEG XR - Microsoft Research |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/jpeg-xr/}}</ref>, given (for RGB) by:<ref>{{cite web |title=Recommendation T.832 (06/2019) |url=https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.832 |at=p. 185 Table D.6 \u2013 Pseudocode for function FwdColorFmtConvert1()}}</ref>\n::<math>V = B - R\\,</math><!-- \"Except when swappedRBflag is equal to 1,\" standard says -->\n::<math>U = G - R - \\left\\lceil \\frac{V}{2} \\right\\rceil</math><!-- \"Except when swappedRBflag is equal to 1,\" standard says -->\n::<math>Y = G - \\left\\lceil \\frac{U}{2} \\right\\rceil</math>\n\n* While JPEG uses 8 \u00d7 8 blocks for its frequency transformation, JPEG XR primarily uses 4 \u00d7 4 block transforms. (2 \u00d7 4 and 2 \u00d7 2 transformations are also defined for special cases involving [[chroma subsampling]]; encoder options include YUV_444, YUV_422, YUV_420, and a monochrome Y_only.)<ref name=\"DPK\">{{cite web|url=https://jxrlib.codeplex.com/SourceControl/latest|title=JPEG XR Device Porting Kit Specification|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|work=JPEGXR_DPK_Spec_1.0.doc|year=2013|accessdate=2014-03-15}}</ref>\n* While JPEG uses a single transformation stage, JPEG XR applies its 4 \u00d7 4 core transform in a two-level hierarchical fashion within 16 \u00d7 16 ''macroblock'' regions.  This gives the transform a [[wavelet]]-like multi-resolution hierarchy and improves its compression capability.\n* The [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]], the frequency transformation used by JPEG, is slightly lossy because of roundoff error. JPEG XR uses a type of integer transform employing a [[lifting scheme]].<ref name=\"LiftingTransform\">C. Tu, S. Srinivasan, [[Gary Sullivan (engineer)|G. J. Sullivan]], S. Regunathan, and [[Rico Malvar|H. S. Malvar]],  \"[http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=794594 Low-complexity Hierarchical Lapped Transform for Lossy-to-Lossless Image Coding in JPEG XR / HD Photo]\",  ''SPIE Applications of Digital Image Processing XXXI'', [[SPIE]] Proceedings, volume 7073, paper 70730C, August 2008.</ref> The required transform, called the Photo Core Transform (PCT), resembles a 4 \u00d7 4 DCT but is lossless (exactly invertible). In fact, it is a particular realization of a larger family of binary-friendly multiplier-less transforms called the binDCT.<ref name=binDCT>{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=Jie|author2=Trac D. Tran|title=Fast multiplierless approximations of the DCT with the lifting scheme|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=2001|volume=49|issue=12|pages=3032\u20133044|doi=10.1109/78.969511|citeseerx=10.1.1.7.4480}}</ref>\n* JPEG XR allows an optional overlap prefiltering step, called the Photo Overlap Transform (POT), before each of its 4 \u00d7 4 core transform PCT stages.<ref name=\"LiftingTransform\"/> The filter operates on 4 \u00d7 4 blocks which are offset by 2 samples in each direction from the 4 \u00d7 4 core transform blocks. Its purpose is to improve compression capability and reduce [[compression artifact|block-boundary artifacts]] at low bitrates. At high bitrates, where such artifacts are typically not a problem, the prefiltering can be omitted to reduce encoding and decoding time. The overlap filtering is constructed using integer operations following a [[lifting scheme]], so that it is also lossless. When appropriately combined, the POT and the PCT in JPEG-XR form a lapped transform.<ref name=prepost>{{cite journal|last=Tran|first=Trac D.|author2=Jie Liang |author3=Chengjie Tu |title=Lapped transform via time-domain pre- and post-filtering|journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing|date=2003|volume=51|issue=6|pages=1557\u20131571|doi=10.1109/TSP.2003.811222|citeseerx=10.1.1.7.8314}}</ref>\n* In JPEG, the image DC coefficients of the DCT blocks are predicted by applying DC prediction from the left neighbor transform block, and no other coeffients are predicted. In JPEG XR, 4 \u00d7 4 blocks are grouped into macroblocks of 16 \u00d7 16 samples, and the 16 DC coefficients from the 4 \u00d7 4 blocks of each macroblock are passed through another level of frequency transformation, leaving three types of coefficients to be entropy coded: the macroblock DC coefficients (called DC), macroblock-level AC coefficients (called \"lowpass\"), and lower-level AC coefficients (called AC).  Prediction of coefficient values across transform blocks is applied to the DC coefficients and to an additional row or column of AC coefficients as well.\n* JPEG XR supports the encoding of an image by decomposing it into smaller individual rectangular ''tile'' area regions.  Each tile area can be decoded independently from the other areas of the picture.  This allows fast access to spatial areas of pictures without decoding the entire picture.\n* JPEG XR's entropy coding phase is more adaptive and complex than JPEG's, involving a DC and AC coefficient prediction scheme, adaptive coefficient reordering (in contrast to JPEG's fixed zigzag ordering), and a form of adaptive Huffman coding for the coefficients themselves.\n* JPEG uses a single quantization step size per DC/AC component per color plane per image. JPEG XR allows a selection of DC quantization step sizes on a ''tile'' region basis, and allows lowpass and AC quantization step sizes to vary from macroblock to macroblock.\n* Because all encoding phases except quantization are lossless, JPEG XR is lossless when all quantization coefficients are equal to 1. This is not true of JPEG. JPEG defines a separate lossless mode which does not use the DCT, but it is not implemented by [[libjpeg]] and therefore not widely supported.\n\nThe HD Photo bitstream specification claims that \"HD Photo offers image quality comparable to [[JPEG-2000]] with computational and memory performance more closely comparable to JPEG\", that it \"delivers a lossy compressed image of better perceptive quality than JPEG at less than half the file size\", and that \"lossless compressed images \u2026 are typically 2.5 times smaller than the original uncompressed data\".\n\n==Software support==\nA reference software implementation of JPEG XR has been published as ITU-T Recommendation T.835 and ISO/IEC International Standard 29199-5.\n\nThe following notable software products natively support JPEG XR:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

After committing several [[rape]]/[[murder]]s with BOB, MIKE had a religious epiphany and repented, cutting off his own arm to rid himself of a tattoo that read \"Fire Walk With Me\", which symbolized being touched by \"The devilish one\". BOB had an identical tattoo on his arm. BOB, however, would not repent. MIKE has spent years trying to find and stop BOB.\n\nIn contrast with BOB, MIKE only ever appears in the visual form of his host, traveling shoe salesman Phillip Michael Gerard. Gerard lost his arm in a car accident. He also had a tattoo of the word \"mom\" on his arm.\n\n==Television series==\nAfter [[FBI]] Special Agent [[Dale Cooper]] comes to Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of [[Laura Palmer]], MIKE appears to Cooper in a dream, explaining his and BOB's history, but in a way that is not immediately clear.

After committing several [[rape]]/[[murder]]s with BOB, MIKE had a religious epiphany and repented, cutting off his own arm to rid himself of a tattoo that read \"Fire Walk With Me\", which symbolized being touched by \"The devilish one\". BOB had an identical tattoo on his arm. BOB, however, would not repent. MIKE has spent years trying to find and stop BOB.\n\nIn contrast with BOB, MIKE only ever appears in the visual form of his host, traveling shoe salesman Phillip Michael Gerard. Gerard lost his arm in a car accident. He also had a tattoo of the word \"mom\" on his arm.\n\n==Television series==\nAfter [[FBI]] Special Agent [[Dale Cooper]] comes to Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of [[Laura Palmer]], MIKE appears to Cooper in a dream, explaining his and BOB's history, but in a way that is not immediately clear. He shows Cooper a vision of BOB as he appeared in life. Later, Cooper, Deputy Hawk, and Sheriff Truman locate Philip Gerard, who is at the time unable to give them any information.

{"title_page": "H\u00f8ve", "text_new": "'''H\u00f8ve''' is a village in northwest [[Zealand]] with fewer than 200 inhabitants (2011). H\u00f8ve is located near [[Sejer\u00f8]] Bay, five kilometers north of [[Asn\u00e6s]], 17 kilometers southwest of [[Nyk\u00f8bing Sj\u00e6lland]], and 25 kilometers northwest of [[Holb\u00e6k]]. The village is part of [[Odsherred Municipality]] and is in Asn\u00e6s Parish.\n[[File:hoeve esterhoej.jpg|thumb|210px|View from Esterh\u00f8j over H\u00f8ve and Lammefjorden]]\n\n== H\u00f8ve and the surrounding nature ==\nH\u00f8ve is where the road from [[Asn\u00e6s]] meets the main road stretching from Nyk\u00f8bing to Slagelse. Next to H\u00f8ve at 89 meters above sea level is [[Esterh\u00f8j]], an ancient burial mound, which has views over Sejer\u00f8 Bay and much of Lammefjorden. At the top of Esterh\u00f8j is a memorial stone commemorating the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] in 1920. In earlier times, H\u00f8ve, like many other villages, had an active commercial life \u2013 there was a coop, a butcher, a baker, a painter, and even a little museum. Although these are gone, one can still buy specialty products such as stoves, curtains, and dried flowers.\n\nAbout a kilometer north of H\u00f8ve is H\u00f8ve beach. Earlier, the area down around Sejer\u00f8 Bay was grasslands, where animals went to graze, but now the beach is surrounded by woods and summerhouses. H\u00f8ve forest is quite small, but has a variety of conifers that were originally planted to prevent sand drifting, and beech trees on the moraine hills. The beach itself is popular swimming location. In the eastern end of the forest is a little campsite, while in the northern end, one can visit a summer restaurant.\n\n== Culture ==\nH\u00f8ve Friskole lies in the village's southern outskirts, overlooking Sejer\u00f8 Bay. The school was established in 1874 by a group of parents in H\u00f8ve and the surrounding region, and was inspired by the grundtvig-koldske school of thought. There are approximately 130 students at the school, which lends itself as a natural meeting place. The school's sports hall frequently doubles as a party room.\n\nThe grave site of Ole Olsen, the creator of [[Nordisk Film]], can be found a bit outside of H\u00f8ve, about 100 meters west of Esterh\u00f8j. The grave is perhaps inspired by the nearby Esterh\u00f8j, as it's shaped like an ancient burial mound. However, the grave's young age is revealed, as the door on the south side provides access to a peek inside the burial chamber. Through a small window, one can glimpse the urns that hold the remains of the famous filmmaker and his wife. The grave site is most easily accessed if one parks one's bike or car at the foot of Esterh\u00f8j and takes a short journey on foot.\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120829152651/http://www.hoeve-friskole.dk/index.php H\u00f8ve Friskole]\n* [http://www.hoeve-camping.dk/ H\u00f8ve Camping]\n* [http://www.hoeve-skov.dk/ H\u00f8ve Skovpavillon]\n\n{{coord|55.835|11.487|type:city_region:DK|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hove}}\n[[Category:Villages in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Odsherred Municipality]]\n", "text_old": "'''H\u00f8ve''' is a village in northwest [[Zealand]] with fewer than 200 inhabitants (2011).
