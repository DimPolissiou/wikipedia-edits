They all study in Lawrence College in Murree. Saad's family comprises his father, Brigadier (later Major General) Faraz Inam, who serves in the army, his mother and sister, Rahmeen, an aspiring artist. Shahzain belongs to a rich village family and is the closest to his grandfather, Malik Allahyar. Shariq's family consists of his sister, Ghazala and his widowed mother. Shehryar's father is a bandmaster. They often bunk college together at night and once caught by their hostel warden, Firdous Baig.\n\nOn the other hand, there is Dua and Rani. Rani is a vivacious girl, who comes from a rich village family. After three years, she is yet to pass her Intermediate exams, which she ultimately doesn't. Dua comes from Rawalpindi and is seen visiting her cousins, Aisha and Raheel in Murree. Raheel is obnoxious and is over-protective of Dua, which she immensely dislikes and tries to avoid him.\n\nDespite receiving warnings from the headmaster of the college, the SSG still bunk college and this time, they accidentally run into Dua and her cousins. Saad immediately recognizes Dua, while Shariq and Shehryar run away from the scene. Saad tells Shahzain that he had seen Dua twice before and has a crush on her but he didn't have the courage to tell her about his feelings. Shahzain encourages Saad to go after her and get to know her name since he didn't.\n\nThe next day, they met Dua again after Shariq spots her with her cousins and tells the other three, who immediately rushes to her. As Shahzain and Shehryar begin to introduce themselves to Dua and tell her about Saad, Raheel pushes Saad, thinking he was harassing Dua and a physical fight follows. The police arrive and take Saad and Raheel into custody, while Shahzain and Shehryar flee, later joined by Shariq.\n\nDua's parents file a complaint against Saad, in the name of harassment. This causes a rift between the SSG. Shariq refuses to be involved in their tactics anymore. Saad slaps Shahzain, because he made a fuss in front of Dua. In the end, Saad, Shahzain and Shehryar were rusticated from the hostel. Since Sharq wasn't directly involved in the incident, no action was taken against him.\n\nThe four friends now go on to lead their separate lives. Shahzain doesn't show up for his exams and slowly transforms into an angry young man. Saad is confused between choosing Army or Medical as his profession but ultimately joins army after finding Dua submitting her application at the same college where he went. Later they meet at a park by accident. Dua softens up when she overhears him scolding his pet Zoro for running after her.\n\nShahzain and Shehryar then visit Saad, wanting to reconcile but Saad humiliates the two and ask them to leave. Saad later departs for PMA (Pakistan Military Academy). Upon arriving at PMA, Saad meets Gulzar Hussain and develops a good friendship with him. \n\nOn the other hand, Shahzain gets married to Rani. Shahzain only invites Shariq and Shehryar for his wedding yet gets angry when he hears the two talking about Saad. Shariq and Shrehyar leave realizing that Shahzain only viewed them as commodities and not friends. \n\nIn their next meeting Saad and Dua were confronted by Raheel (Dua's cousin). Dua walks off angrily and goes home. Raheel proposes to Dua for marriage but Dua refuses and tells her father to trust her that Saad is just a friend. She then tells Saad she won't contact him until they both establish their careers. Raheel's parents then invite Dua's parents and insist on their marriage but Dua's father refuses. On the way home, Dua's parents have a road accident. Dua's father passes away and her mother becomes disabled. Her cousin blackmails her into marrying him as he finds out she is adopted. Dua agrees but then expose him in front of his parents. Dua and her mother shift to Abbottabad to live near her medical college. Saad is shown to pass out of PMA with a sword of honour. Later he finds about Dua's father. \n\nShahzain is shown to be contesting in the by elections. Shariq's [[YouTube]] channel has been so well established that he is offered a job as a news anchor at a well-established channel. He accepts the job after declining at first and selects Ramsha (a former news reporter who became friends with Shariq) as producer of his show.\n\nShahzain wins his elections and becomes an MNA. Shariq achieves success as a news anchor. After passing out from PMA, Saad starts his army duties and visits Dua. He helps Dua in setting up her new home. They grow closer to each other and eventually meet each other's parents. Saad starts planning his wedding and bumps into Shahzain while completing a wedding-related task. They both hug each other and reconcile their differences. \n\nMeanwhile, Shehryar is appointed as an Assistant Commissioner and works with Shariq to help free one of their college friends who has been wrongly imprisoned due to a mafia gang. Shariq and Shehryar manage to successfully free him. All the four friends get together for Saad's wedding and are seen teasing Saad. On the night of the wedding, it is revealed that Dua has been appointed as an army doctor and walks down the aisle in her uniform leaving Saad in awe.\n\n==Series Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Season\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" rowspan=\"2\" | No. of episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" | Originally broadcast <small>([[Pakistan]])</small>\n|-\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" | First episode\n! style=\"padding: 0 8px\" | Last episode\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"|\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 25\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{start date|df=yes|2019|9|22}}\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| {{end date|df==yes|2020|3|15}}\n\n|-\n\n|}\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Osman Khalid Butt.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Osman Khalid Butt]]\n[[File:Ahmed Ali Akbar at an event in Islamabad.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Ahmed Ali Akbar]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

{"title_page": "List of National Roads in Belgium", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n[[File:N227 belgique.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[N227 road (Belgium)|N227 in Belgium]]]]\n\nThe '''national roads of [[Belgium]]''' are roads that cover the whole of the country; some of the roads are provincial and communal. The use of the national roads is free; they are open to all vehicles, but some are for cars only.\n\nSince the [[State reform in Belgium#1980: The second state reform|second state reform]] in 1980, the networks of national roads have been managed by the federal regions, depending on the region in which they are located.\n\nIn general the road names are linked to the surrounding areas; most of these are linked to historical references. For example, the N3 around Li\u00e8ge is known as the \"Road to Brussels\" in the west of the city and the \"Road to Fl\u00e9ron\" in the east of the city. Another example is around Brussels, where the N2 is known as the \"Road to Leuven\" (\"Chauss\u00e9e de Louvain\" in French, \"Leuvensesteenweg\" in Dutch).\n\nThe numbering of the roads is grouped into four networks of roads:\n* The roads N1 to N9 are large connections, starting from Brussels to the borders of the country in each direction. These roads are numbered clockwise.\n* In between are roads with numbers N10, N20, N30, etc., which are short connections between two N roads of the first network and located in different provinces.\n* There are other important roads having numbers N11, N12, etc., up to N99.\n* Lastly, there are local N roads with three digits.\n\nMost of the roads of the third and fourth networks have a first digit that identifies the province: N1xx for Antwerp, N2xx for ex Brabant, N3xx for West Flanders, N4xx for East Flanders, N5xx for Hainaut, N6xx for Li\u00e8ge, N7xx for Limburg, N8xx for Luxemburg and N9xx for Namur. This first digit corresponds with the [[NIS code]] of the provinces.\n\nSome short roads have the number of another N road suffixed with a letter of the alphabet. These are usually a short road connecting to an N road, a part of that N road, or a road that can be taken as an alternative to that N road.\n\n== First network ==\nThe first network consists of national roads, each starting from the capital [[Brussels]] and forming a clockwise star.\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n!<abbr>Num.</abbr>\n!Route\n|-\n![[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]]\n|[[Brussels]] \u2013 [[Antwerp]] \u2013 ''[[Breda]] (The Netherlands)''\n|-\n![[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Hasselt]] \u2013 ''[[Maastricht]] (The Netherlands)''\n|-\n![[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Leuven]] \u2013 [[Li\u00e8ge]] \u2013 ''[[Aachen]] (Germany)''\n|-\n![[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Namur]] \u2013 [[Arlon]] \u2013 ''(route de Luxembourg)''\n|-\n![[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Charleroi]] \u2013 ''[[Reims]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N6 road (Belgium)|N6]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Mons]] \u2013 ''[[Maubeuge]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N7 road (Belgium)|N7]]\n|[[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] \u2013 [[Tournai]] \u2013 ''[[Lille]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Kortrijk]] \u2013 [[Ypres|Ieper]] \u2013 [[Koksijde]]\n|-\n![[N9 road (Belgium)|N9]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Ghent]] \u2013 [[Bruges]] \u2013 [[Ostend]]\n|}\n\n== Second network ==\nThe second network groups the national roads that are linked to major cities and towns of Belgium, excluding Brussels.\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n!<abbr>Num.</abbr>\n!Route\n|-\n![[N10 road (Belgium)|N10]]\n|[[Mortsel]] \u2013 [[Diest]]\n|-\n![[N20 road (Belgium)|N20]]\n|[[Hasselt]] \u2013 [[Li\u00e8ge]]\n|-\n![[N30 road (Belgium)|N30]]\n|Li\u00e8ge \u2013 [[Bastogne]]\n|-\n![[N40 road (Belgium)|N40]]\n|[[Arlon]] \u2013 [[Mons]]\n|-\n![[N50 road (Belgium)|N50]]\n|Mons \u2013 [[Bruges]]\n|-\n![[N60 road (Belgium)|N60]]\n|[[Ghent]] \u2013 [[Peruwelz]] \u2013 ''[[Valenciennes]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N70 road (Belgium)|N70]]\n|Ghent \u2013 [[Antwerp]]\n|-\n![[N80 road (Belgium)|N80]]\n|[[Hasselt]] \u2013 [[Namur]]\n|-\n![[N90 road (Belgium)|N90]]\n|Mons \u2013 [[Charleroi]] \u2013 Namur \u2013 Li\u00e8ge\n|}\n\n== Third network ==\nThe third network is composed of provincial national roads.

The use of the national roads is free; they are open to all vehicles, but some are for cars only.\n\nSince the [[State reform in Belgium#1980: The second state reform|second state reform]] in 1980, the networks of national roads have been managed by the federal regions, depending on the region in which they are located.\n\nIn general the road names are linked to the surrounding areas; most of these are linked to historical references. For example, the N3 around Li\u00e8ge is known as the \"Road to Brussels\" in the west of the city and the \"Road to Fl\u00e9ron\" in the east of the city. Another example is around Brussels, where the N2 is known as the \"Road to Leuven\" (\"Chauss\u00e9e de Louvain\" in French, \"Leuvensesteenweg\" in Dutch).\n\nThe numbering of the roads is grouped into four networks of roads:\n* The roads N1 to N9 are large connections, starting from Brussels to the borders of the country in each direction. These roads are numbered clockwise.\n* In between are roads with numbers N10, N20, N30, etc., which are short connections between two N roads of the first network and located in different provinces.\n* There are other important roads having numbers N11, N12, etc., up to N99.\n* Lastly, there are local N roads with three digits.\n\nMost of the roads of the third and fourth networks have a first digit that identifies the province: N1xx for Antwerp, N2xx for ex Brabant, N3xx for West Flanders, N4xx for East Flanders, N5xx for Hainaut, N6xx for Li\u00e8ge, N7xx for Limburg, N8xx for Luxemburg and N9xx for Namur. This first digit corresponds with the [[NIS code]] of the provinces.\n\nSome short roads have the number of another N road suffixed with a letter of the alphabet. These are usually a short road connecting to an N road, a part of that N road, or a road that can be taken as an alternative to that N road.\n\n== First network ==\nThe first network consists of national roads, each starting from the capital [[Brussels]] and forming a clockwise star.\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n!<abbr>Num.</abbr>\n!Route\n|-\n![[N1 road (Belgium)|N1]]\n|[[Brussels]] \u2013 [[Antwerp]] \u2013 ''[[Breda]] (The Netherlands)''\n|-\n![[N2 road (Belgium)|N2]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Hasselt]] \u2013 ''[[Maastricht]] (The Netherlands)''\n|-\n![[N3 road (Belgium)|N3]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Leuven]] \u2013 [[Li\u00e8ge]] \u2013 ''[[Aachen]] (Germany)''\n|-\n![[N4 road (Belgium)|N4]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Namur]] \u2013 [[Arlon]] \u2013 ''(route de Luxembourg)''\n|-\n![[N5 road (Belgium)|N5]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Charleroi]] \u2013 ''[[Reims]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N6 road (Belgium)|N6]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Mons]] \u2013 ''[[Maubeuge]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N7 road (Belgium)|N7]]\n|[[Halle, Belgium|Halle]] \u2013 [[Tournai]] \u2013 ''[[Lille]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N8 road (Belgium)|N8]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Kortrijk]] \u2013 [[Ypres|Ieper]] \u2013 [[Koksijde]]\n|-\n![[N9 road (Belgium)|N9]]\n|Brussels \u2013 [[Ghent]] \u2013 [[Bruges]] \u2013 [[Ostend]]\n|}\n\n== Second network ==\nThe second network groups the national roads that are linked to major cities and towns of Belgium, excluding Brussels.\n{| class=\"wikitable alternance\"\n!<abbr>Num.</abbr>\n!Route\n|-\n![[N10 road (Belgium)|N10]]\n|[[Mortsel]] \u2013 [[Diest]]\n|-\n![[N20 road (Belgium)|N20]]\n|[[Hasselt]] \u2013 [[Li\u00e8ge]]\n|-\n![[N30 road (Belgium)|N30]]\n|Li\u00e8ge \u2013 [[Bastogne]]\n|-\n![[N40 road (Belgium)|N40]]\n|[[Arlon]] \u2013 [[Mons]]\n|-\n![[N50 road (Belgium)|N50]]\n|Mons \u2013 [[Bruges]]\n|-\n![[N60 road (Belgium)|N60]]\n|[[Ghent]] \u2013 [[Peruwelz]] \u2013 ''[[Valenciennes]] (France)''\n|-\n![[N70 road (Belgium)|N70]]\n|Ghent \u2013 [[Antwerp]]\n|-\n![[N80 road (Belgium)|N80]]\n|[[Hasselt]] \u2013 [[Namur]]\n|-\n![[N90 road (Belgium)|N90]]\n|Mons \u2013 [[Charleroi]] \u2013 Namur \u2013 Li\u00e8ge\n|}\n\n== Third network ==\nThe third network is composed of provincial national roads.

The station, which is owned by the Butler County Radio Network, operates at 97.7 [[MHz]] with an [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] of 4.6 [[watt|kw]] and is licensed to [[Butler, Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Beginnings==\n===As WISR-FM===\n\nWLER-FM's beginnings, like most FM's, were rather humble.  The station began as WISR-FM, when the AM license had been issued for those same call letters when the license was first granted in 1941.  The ownership at that time, Butler Broadcasting Company, chose to turn the license back to the FCC after having the FM license failed to make any kind of an impact financially.\n\n===As WBUT-FM===\n\nHowever, the license was recovered years later by [[WISR]]'s AM crosstown competitor, [[WBUT]], returning to the air in 1959.  The station operated as WBUT-FM for many years until the late 1970s, when the call letters were changed to WLER-FM, and the station began to originate more of its own separate programming, though much of it was done through voice-tracked automation on a 10-inch reel tape-based automation system constructed by owners Bob and Ron Brandon.  The station was an adult contemporary formatted station for much of its existence, using music and personalities provided by Concept Productions, based in Roseville, California.

The station, which is owned by the Butler County Radio Network, operates at 97.7 [[MHz]] with an [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] of 4.6 [[watt|kw]] and is licensed to [[Butler, Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Beginnings==\n===As WISR-FM===\n\nWLER-FM's beginnings, like most FM's, were rather humble.  The station began as WISR-FM, when the AM license had been issued for those same call letters when the license was first granted in 1941.  The ownership at that time, Butler Broadcasting Company, chose to turn the license back to the FCC after having the FM license failed to make any kind of an impact financially.\n\n===As WBUT-FM===\n\nHowever, the license was recovered years later by [[WISR]]'s AM crosstown competitor, [[WBUT]], returning to the air in 1959.  The station operated as WBUT-FM for many years until the late 1970s, when the call letters were changed to WLER-FM, and the station began to originate more of its own separate programming, though much of it was done through voice-tracked automation on a 10-inch reel tape-based automation system constructed by owners Bob and Ron Brandon.  The station was an adult contemporary formatted station for much of its existence, using music and personalities provided by Concept Productions, based in Roseville, California.  The procedure of voice-tracking was a relatively new concept at the time, before becoming standard practice in the late 90's.  The presentation of the voice-tracked announcers led many to believe that Steve Tyler, Dave Ware, and Terry Nelson were all on-site.  The station simulcast from 6 to 8am during morning drive and during the last three hours of the day before signing off at 10pm.  <!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wler 90's logo.jpg|thumb|Former WLER logo, used from 1997 to 2003.]]   --><!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wler 2000 logo.jpg|thumb|Former WLER logo, used from 2003 until 2006, when its present logo was adopted]]   --><!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:WLER old logo.jpg|thumb|Former WLER logo, used from the mid-1980s until 1997]] -->\n\n===As WLER-FM and format changes to hot adult contemporary & adult contemporary===\n\nWLER saw its biggest change in the spring of 2006, when the WBUT simulcast ended and the station began to take on a more [[Hot AC|Adult]] [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR (Top 40)]]-oriented approach.

On July 2, 1867, a detachment of the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)]] was massacred; second lieutenant Lyman S. Kidder in command of the party, a sergeant, a corporal, eight privates and an Indian guide lost their lives. They were carrying dispatches for Lieutenant Colonel [[George Custer]]. Later, Custer found evidence of a running battle along Beaver Creek, which led to a ravine where the remains were found. They had been killed by [[Cheyenne]] and/or [[Sioux]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]].<ref>Johnson, Randy and Nancy P. Allen. \"Find Custer!

A man named Clark showed up in the county in 1887 proposing to create a new town to settle the dispute. The new town was to be named Goodland. A vote for the county seat was held among the county population and Goodland won with 872 of the 1495 votes cast while with Eustis received 611 and Voltaire received 12. Citizens of Eustis declared that the votes were unfair but the state department said that nothing could be done as all the voting was complete. The [[Supreme Court of Kansas|Supreme Court]] of [[Kansas]] considered various proceedings but did not change the outcome of the vote. Eustis refused to yield the county records it held until January 13, 1888, when an armed group from Goodland seized the records and sent them to the new county seat.<ref>Parker, Tony.

On July 2, 1867, a detachment of the [[2nd Cavalry Regiment (United States)]] was massacred; second lieutenant Lyman S. Kidder in command of the party, a sergeant, a corporal, eight privates and an Indian guide lost their lives. They were carrying dispatches for Lieutenant Colonel [[George Custer]]. Later, Custer found evidence of a running battle along Beaver Creek, which led to a ravine where the remains were found. They had been killed by [[Cheyenne]] and/or [[Sioux]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]].<ref>Johnson, Randy and Nancy P. Allen. \"Find Custer!

A man named Clark showed up in the county in 1887 proposing to create a new town to settle the dispute. The new town was to be named Goodland. A vote for the county seat was held among the county population and Goodland won with 872 of the 1495 votes cast while with Eustis received 611 and Voltaire received 12. Citizens of Eustis declared that the votes were unfair but the state department said that nothing could be done as all the voting was complete. The [[Supreme Court of Kansas|Supreme Court]] of [[Kansas]] considered various proceedings but did not change the outcome of the vote. Eustis refused to yield the county records it held until January 13, 1888, when an armed group from Goodland seized the records and sent them to the new county seat.<ref>Parker, Tony.

The town's geographic location has made it an important trade link between Bosnia and the east. For instance, the main road connecting [[Sarajevo]] and [[Belgrade]] runs through the city. The medieval fort known as [[Kula grad]] was built in the early 7th century and still stands on the Mla\u0111evac mountainous range overlooking the Drina Valley.\n\n===Ottoman rule===\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, Zvornik was the capital of the [[Sanjak of Zvornik]] (an administrative region) within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]]. This was primarily the case because of the city's crucial role in the economy and the strategic importance of the city's location.

It is located in entity of [[Republika Srpska]], on the left bank of the [[Drina]] river. As of 2013, it has a population of 58,856 inhabitants.\n\nThe town of [[Mali Zvornik]] (\"little Zvornik\") lies directly across the river in [[Serbia]]. Kula Grad, a village that is part of Zvornik municipality, is home to a Middle Age fort, [[Zvornik fortress]], built in the 12th century.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Durch Bosnien und die Herzegovina kreuz und quer; Wanderungen (1897) (14779343384).jpg|thumb|Zvornik in 1897|287x287px]]\n{{unsourced|section|date=September 2016}}\nZvornik is first mentioned in 1410, although it was known as ''Zvonik'' (\"bell tower\") at that time. The town's geographic location has made it an important trade link between Bosnia and the east. For instance, the main road connecting [[Sarajevo]] and [[Belgrade]] runs through the city. The medieval fort known as [[Kula grad]] was built in the early 7th century and still stands on the Mla\u0111evac mountainous range overlooking the Drina Valley.\n\n===Ottoman rule===\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, Zvornik was the capital of the [[Sanjak of Zvornik]] (an administrative region) within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]]. This was primarily the case because of the city's crucial role in the economy and the strategic importance of the city's location. The Sanjak of Zvornik was one of six Ottoman sanjaks with most developed [[shipbuilding]] (besides the sanjaks of [[Sanjak of Vidin|Vidin]], [[Sanjak of Nicopolis|Nicopolis]], [[Sanjak of Pojega|Po\u017eega]], [[Sanjak of Smederevo|Smederevo]] and [[Sanjak of Moha\u010d|Moha\u010d]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Godis\u0306njak grada Beograda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVTjAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=7 September 2013|year=1979|publisher=Beogradske novine|page=35|quote=\u0418\u043f\u0430\u043a \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u045a\u0430 \u0431\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a\u0430: \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0459\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438, \u0437\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0445\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438.}}</ref> In 1806, Zvornik was home to [[Mehmed-beg Kulenovi\u0107]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[Ustasha]] troops of the fascist [[Independent State of Croatia]] occupied Zvornik, along with most of Bosnia, in April 1941.
