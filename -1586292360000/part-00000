Although this generalization about being allergic to all fruit based on experiences with one fruit could be correct in some cases, it may not be correct in all.

This categorization is a foundational aspect of generalizing.\n\n== '''Research on Generalization''' ==\nIn scientific studies looking at generalization, a generalization gradient is often used. This tool is used to measure how often and how much animals or humans respond to certain stimuli, depending on whether the stimuli are perceived to be similar or different. The curvilinear shape of the gradient is achieved by placing the perceived similarity of a stimulus on the x-axis and the strength of the response on the y-axis.<ref>Boddez, Y., Bennett, M. P., van Esch, S., & Beckers, T. (2017). Bending rules: the shape of the perceptual generalisation gradient is sensitive to inference rules.

(2019, September 30). Generalization. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.britannica.com/topic/generalization</nowiki></ref>\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that generalization is a fundamental and naturally occurring learning process for humans. 9-month-old infants require very few (sometimes only 3) experiences with a category before learning to generalize. In fact, infants generalize so well during early stages of development (such as learning to recognize specific sounds as language) that it can be hard for them to discriminate between variations of the generalized stimuli at later stages of development (such as failing to distinguish between the subtly different sounds of similar phonemes). One potential explanation for why children are such efficient learners is that they operate in accordance with the goal of making their world more predictable, therefore encouraging them to hold strongly to generalizations that effectively help them to navigate their environment.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nSome evidence suggests that children are born with innate processes for accurately generalizing things. For example, children tend to generalize based on taxonomic rather than thematic similarities (an experience with one ball leads to the child identifying other ball-shaped objects as \u201cball\u201d rather than labeling a bat as \u201cball\u201d because a bat is used to hit a ball).<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nWakefield, Hall, James, and Goldin (2018) found that children are more flexible in generalizing new verbs when they are taught the verb by observing gestures as opposed to being taught by performing the action themselves.<ref>Wakefield, E. M., Hall, C., James, K. H., & Goldin, M. S. (2018). Gesture for generalization: gesture facilitates flexible learning of words for actions on objects. Developmental Science, 21(5), 1. https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12656</ref> When helping a child learn a new word, providing more examples of the word increases the child\u2019s capacity to generalize the word to different contexts and situations. Furthermore, writing interventions for grade-school students yield better results when the intervention actively targets generalization as an outcome.<ref>Hier, B. O., Eckert, T. L., Viney, E.

T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> For example, generalization is an important part of how humans learn to trust unfamiliar people<ref>FeldmanHall, O., Dunsmoor, J. E., Tompary, A., Hunter, L. E., Todorov, A., & Phelps, E. A. (2018). Stimulus generalization as a mechanism for learning to trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115(7). doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715227115</ref> and a necessary element in language acquisition.<ref>Arnon, I., & Clark, E. V. (Eds.). (2011). ''Experience, variation and generalization: Learning a first language''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://ebookcentral.proquest.com</nowiki></ref>\n\nFor a person who lacked the capacity to generalize from one experience to the next, every instance of a dog would be completely separated from other instances of dogs, so prior experience would do nothing to help the person know how to interact with this seemingly new stimulus.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> In fact, even if the person experienced the very same dog multiple times, he or she would have no way of knowing what to expect and it would be as if the individual were encountering a dog for the very first time. Therefore, generalization is a valuable and integral part of learning and everyday life.\n\nGeneralization is shown to have implications on the use of the [[spacing effect]] in educational settings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley A.|title=The Spacing Effect in Children's Generalization of Knowledge: Allowing Children Time to Forget Promotes Their Ability to Learn|journal=Child Development Perspectives|date=September 2014|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163\u2013168|doi=10.1111/cdep.12079}}</ref> In the past, it was thought that the information forgotten between periods of learning when implementing [[spaced presentation]] inhibited generalization. In more recent years, this forgetting has been seen as promoting generalization through repetition of information during each occasion of spaced learning. The effects of gaining [[Long-term memory|long-term]] generalization knowledge through spaced learning can be compared with that of massed learning (lengthy and all at once; for example, cramming the night before an exam)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=312|edition=2nd}}</ref> in which a person only gains [[Short-term memory|short-term]] knowledge, decreasing the likelihood of establishing generalization.\n\nGeneralization is also considered to be an important factor in [[procedural memory]], such as the near-automatic memory processes necessary for driving a car.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> Without being able to generalize from previous experiences driving, a person would essentially need to relearn how to drive every time he or she encountered a new street.\n\nNot all of generalization\u2019s effects are beneficial, however. An important part of learning is knowing when ''not'' to generalize, which is called discrimination learning. Were it not for discrimination learning, humans and animals would struggle to respond correctly to different situations.<ref>Cherry, K. (2019, November 26). How stimulus generalization influences learning. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-stimulus-generalization-2795885</nowiki></ref> For example, a dog may be trained to come to its owner when it hears a whistle. If the dog generalizes this training, it may not discriminate between the sound of the whistle and other stimuli, so it would come running to its owner when it hears any high-pitched noise.\n\n== '''Fear Generalization''' ==\nA specific type of generalization, fear generalization, occurs when a person associates fears learned in the past through [[classical conditioning]] to similar situations, events, people, and objects in their present. This is important for the survival of the organism; humans and animals need to be able to assess aversive situations and respond appropriately based on generalizations made from past experiences.<ref>Asok, A., Kandel, E.

Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest studies about fear generalization in humans was conducted by Watson and Raynor (1920): the [[Little Albert experiment]]. In their study, an infant known as Little Albert was exposed to various kinds of animals, none of which elicited a fear response from Little Albert. However, after 7 pairings of a white rat and the sound of a hammer clanging against a steel bar (which did elicit a fear response), the 11-month old child began to cry and try to get away from the white rat even without the loud noise. Months later, additional trials showed that Little Albert had generalized his fear response to things that were similar to the white rat, including a dog, a rabbit, and a fur coat.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives.

Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> The hippocampus seems to be more involved in the development of context fear generalization (developing a generalized fear for a specific environment) than stimulus fear generalization (such as Little Albert\u2019s acquisition of a fear response to white, furry objects). The amygdala, which is associated with all types of emotional responses, is fundamental in developing a classically conditioned fear response to either a stimulus or the context in which it is found.<ref>Banich, M.

Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.britannica.com/topic/generalization</nowiki></ref>\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that generalization is a fundamental and naturally occurring learning process for humans. 9-month-old infants require very few (sometimes only 3) experiences with a category before learning to generalize. In fact, infants generalize so well during early stages of development (such as learning to recognize specific sounds as language) that it can be hard for them to discriminate between variations of the generalized stimuli at later stages of development (such as failing to distinguish between the subtly different sounds of similar phonemes). One potential explanation for why children are such efficient learners is that they operate in accordance with the goal of making their world more predictable, therefore encouraging them to hold strongly to generalizations that effectively help them to navigate their environment.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nSome evidence suggests that children are born with innate processes for accurately generalizing things. For example, children tend to generalize based on taxonomic rather than thematic similarities (an experience with one ball leads to the child identifying other ball-shaped objects as \u201cball\u201d rather than labeling a bat as \u201cball\u201d because a bat is used to hit a ball).<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nWakefield, Hall, James, and Goldin (2018) found that children are more flexible in generalizing new verbs when they are taught the verb by observing gestures as opposed to being taught by performing the action themselves.<ref>Wakefield, E. M., Hall, C., James, K. H., & Goldin, M. S. (2018). Gesture for generalization: gesture facilitates flexible learning of words for actions on objects. Developmental Science, 21(5), 1. https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.12656</ref> When helping a child learn a new word, providing more examples of the word increases the child\u2019s capacity to generalize the word to different contexts and situations. Furthermore, writing interventions for grade-school students yield better results when the intervention actively targets generalization as an outcome.<ref>Hier, B. O., Eckert, T. L., Viney, E. A., & Meisinger, E. (2019). Generalization and maintenance effects of writing fluency intervention strategies for elementary-age students: A randomized controlled trial.

T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> For example, generalization is an important part of how humans learn to trust unfamiliar people<ref>FeldmanHall, O., Dunsmoor, J. E., Tompary, A., Hunter, L. E., Todorov, A., & Phelps, E. A. (2018). Stimulus generalization as a mechanism for learning to trust. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 115(7). doi: 10.1073/pnas.1715227115</ref> and a necessary element in language acquisition.<ref>Arnon, I., & Clark, E. V. (Eds.). (2011). ''Experience, variation and generalization: Learning a first language''. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://ebookcentral.proquest.com</nowiki></ref>\n\nFor a person who lacked the capacity to generalize from one experience to the next, every instance of a dog would be completely separated from other instances of dogs, so prior experience would do nothing to help the person know how to interact with this seemingly new stimulus.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> In fact, even if the person experienced the very same dog multiple times, he or she would have no way of knowing what to expect and it would be as if the individual were encountering a dog for the very first time. Therefore, generalization is a valuable and integral part of learning and everyday life.\n\nGeneralization is shown to have implications on the use of the [[spacing effect]] in educational settings.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vlach|first1=Haley A.|title=The Spacing Effect in Children's Generalization of Knowledge: Allowing Children Time to Forget Promotes Their Ability to Learn|journal=Child Development Perspectives|date=September 2014|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163\u2013168|doi=10.1111/cdep.12079}}</ref> In the past, it was thought that the information forgotten between periods of learning when implementing [[spaced presentation]] inhibited generalization. In more recent years, this forgetting has been seen as promoting generalization through repetition of information during each occasion of spaced learning. The effects of gaining [[Long-term memory|long-term]] generalization knowledge through spaced learning can be compared with that of massed learning (lengthy and all at once; for example, cramming the night before an exam)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gluck|first1=Mark A.|last2=Mercado|first2=Eduardo|last3=Myers|first3=Catherine E.|title=Learning and memory : from brain to behavior|date=2014|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9781429240147|page=312|edition=2nd}}</ref> in which a person only gains [[Short-term memory|short-term]] knowledge, decreasing the likelihood of establishing generalization.\n\nGeneralization is also considered to be an important factor in [[procedural memory]], such as the near-automatic memory processes necessary for driving a car.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> Without being able to generalize from previous experiences driving, a person would essentially need to relearn how to drive every time he or she encountered a new street.\n\nNot all of generalization\u2019s effects are beneficial, however. An important part of learning is knowing when ''not'' to generalize, which is called discrimination learning. Were it not for discrimination learning, humans and animals would struggle to respond correctly to different situations.<ref>Cherry, K. (2019, November 26). How stimulus generalization influences learning. Retrieved from <nowiki>https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-stimulus-generalization-2795885</nowiki></ref> For example, a dog may be trained to come to its owner when it hears a whistle. If the dog generalizes this training, it may not discriminate between the sound of the whistle and other stimuli, so it would come running to its owner when it hears any high-pitched noise.\n\n== '''Fear Generalization''' ==\nA specific type of generalization, fear generalization, occurs when a person associates fears learned in the past through [[classical conditioning]] to similar situations, events, people, and objects in their present. This is important for the survival of the organism; humans and animals need to be able to assess aversive situations and respond appropriately based on generalizations made from past experiences.<ref>Asok, A., Kandel, E.

T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest studies about fear generalization in humans was conducted by Watson and Raynor (1920): the [[Little Albert experiment]]. In their study, an infant known as Little Albert was exposed to various kinds of animals, none of which elicited a fear response from Little Albert. However, after 7 pairings of a white rat and the sound of a hammer clanging against a steel bar (which did elicit a fear response), the 11-month old child began to cry and try to get away from the white rat even without the loud noise. Months later, additional trials showed that Little Albert had generalized his fear response to things that were similar to the white rat, including a dog, a rabbit, and a fur coat.<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref>\n\nBrain regions involved in fear generalization include the [[Amygdala]] and the [[Hippocampus]].<ref>Banich, M. T., Dukes, P., & Caccamise, D. (2010). Generalization of knowledge: Multidisciplinary perspectives. Psychology Press.</ref> The hippocampus seems to be more involved in the development of context fear generalization (developing a generalized fear for a specific environment) than stimulus fear generalization (such as Little Albert\u2019s acquisition of a fear response to white, furry objects). The amygdala, which is associated with all types of emotional responses, is fundamental in developing a classically conditioned fear response to either a stimulus or the context in which it is found.<ref>Banich, M.
