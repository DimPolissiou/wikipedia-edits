through a variety of mechanisms, however, the way in which [[inflammation]] is created does not greatly influence cancer risk.<ref name=\"Franks_2012\" /> Rather, the cancer risk is largely dependent on the fact that all autoimmune diseases increase chronic [[inflammation]] which has been linked to cancer.<ref name=\"Franks_2012\" /> Below are some autoimmune diseases most commonly linked to cancer including [[Coeliac disease|celiac disease]], [[inflammatory bowel disease]] ([[Crohn's disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]]), [[multiple sclerosis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and

of immune tolerance to ingested [[gluten]], found primarily in wheat, barley, and rye.<ref name=\"Franks_2012\" /> This explains the increased risk of gastrointestinal cancers, as the gastrointestinal tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus, all areas that the ingested gluten would traverse in digestion.<ref name=\"Franks_2012\" /> The incidence of

When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.\n\nSome infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules.

When any one of these mechanisms fail, it is possible to have a reservoir of self-reactive cells that become functional within the immune system. The mechanisms of preventing self-reactive T cells from being created take place through negative selection process within the [[thymus]] as the T cell is developing into a mature immune cell.\n\nSome infections, such as ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', have [[antigen]]s that are similar (but not identical) to our own self-molecules. In this case, a normal immune response to ''C. jejuni'' can result in the production of antibodies that also react to a lesser degree with gangliosides of myelin sheath surrounding peripheral nerves' axons (i.e., [[Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9]]).

They are the only Scottish club that believe voting rules don't apply to them, and believe they can withdraw and change votes at will to 'play God' with other teams fortunes. Founded in 1893, they are nicknamed \"The Dark Blues\" or \"The Dee\". The club plays its home matches at [[Dens Park]].\n\nThe club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of [[Bob Shankly]], Dundee won the [[Scottish Football League]] title in [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1962]], before reaching the semi-finals of the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]]. Dundee has won the [[Scottish Cup]] once, and won the [[Scottish League Cup]] three times.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of Dundee F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\n\nDundee F.C. was formed in 1893 by the merger of two local clubs, [[Dundee East End F.C.|East End]] and [[Dundee Our Boys F.C.|Our Boys]], with the intention of gaining election to the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL). Their application was successful and they played their first League game on 12 August 1893 at [[West Craigie Park]], securing a 3\u20133 draw against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Dundee struggled during the first 10 years of their existence. Their best league position was fifth which they achieved in seasons 1895\u201396 and 1896\u201397. They also reached the semi-finals of the [[Scottish Cup]] in 1894\u201395 and 1897\u201398, losing to [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] respectively. On 26 October 1895 Dundee lost a league game by a record score of 0\u201311 to [[History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)|Celtic]] in Glasgow. On 1 January 1894 Dundee defeated [[Newton Heath F.C.|Newton Heath]] (the future Manchester United) 2\u20131 at their then [[Carolina Port]] ground in Dundee. Carolina Port also hosted the first international football match held in Dundee on [[1895-96 British Home Championship|21 March 1896]] when Scotland defeated Wales 4\u20130. Dundee's goalkeeper [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Frank Barrett]], midfielder [[List of Scotland international footballers (5\u201324 caps)|Sandy Keillor]] and inside-forward [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Bill Thomson]] were all capped for Scotland during this early period of the club's history. Things began to improve for Dundee with the beginning of the new century. In 1899 they moved from Carolina Port to their present ground of [[Dens Park]]. In season [[1902\u201303 in Scottish football|1902\u201303]] they finished runners-up in the league championship to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. (In season 1902\u201303 Dundee allowed 12 league goals against, which remains the fewest goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.)\n\nDundee were also league runners-up in 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|1908\u201309]] by just 1 point. In the 10 seasons from 1902 to 1903 Dundee lost just 16 league games at Dens Park out of 154 played and were unbeaten at home during season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]]. Although ultimate success eluded Dundee in the league the club achieved success in the Scottish Cup. In season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]] Dundee won their first trophy by defeating Clyde in the [[1909\u201310 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup Final]]. (Dundee took three games to beat [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the semi-final and then the same number to defeat [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]].) The winning goal in the second replay was scored by [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John 'Sailor' Hunter]]. In season [[1910\u201311 Scottish Cup|1910\u201311]] Dundee defeated [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20131 at Dens Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-final but lost to [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]] in the semi-final. The beginning of the First World War and the call-up of many players for military duty drastically curtailed football in Britain from 1914 and in [[List of Dundee F.C. seasons|1917]] Dundee and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] were both asked to withdraw from the league due to increasing transport costs for the other league clubs. In 1919 league football recommenced and good home form once again propelled Dundee up the league. They finished 4th in seasons [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201320]], [[1920\u201321 in Scottish football|1920\u201321]] and [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322]], and were unbeaten at home during season 1921\u201322. However, they could not make the breakthrough to win the league championship.\n\n[[Dave Halliday]] had played on the left wing for his previous clubs, his hometown side [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. Halliday went to Dundee in 1921 where Scotland internationalist Alec Troup played left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to [[centre forward]] with prolific results; he finished as Scottish top scorer in the [[1923\u201324 in Scottish football|1923\u201324 season]] with 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances. This remains the club record all-time seasonal league goal scoring record. Halliday top scored in England's top division in 1928-29 to become the most recent of only 2 players to be outright top scorer in Scotland and England. With Halliday Dundee reached the [[1924\u201325 Scottish Cup]] final eliminating the holders en route, the [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] side of [[Hughie Gallacher]]. Dundee led [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 1-0 at half time in the final before losing out to a last minute [[Jimmy McGrory]] winner. Halliday top scored for Dundee in that cup run. In end of season tours with Dundee, Halliday scored doubles against each of [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. Halliday scored 103 goals in 147 league and cup appearances for the Dee. He then moved South to set scoring records in England where other teams profited from Dundee's decision to convert Halliday to centre-forward.<ref name=qoslegend>[http://www.qosfc.com/legend-1048 Dave Halliday full career profile on www.qosfc.com]</ref>\n\n===Mid 20th century===\n\n[[File:Dundee FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Dundee in the Scottish League.]]The post-Second World War period was a golden era for Dundee Football Club. Having been relegated on the eve of war, the Dark Blues started in 1946 in the first official season in the second tier but within five years they were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and won their first trophy in forty-one years.\n\nBack to back 'B\u2019 Division titles earned George Anderson's Dundee promotion in 1947 and just two years later they were within a whisker of becoming Champions of Scotland. Silverware was not far away however as after spending a world record transfer fee of \u00a323,500 on [[Billy Steel]], much to the chagrin of modern-day supporters of the club \u2013 at least some anyway \u2013 who resented the aspect of finance in football and wish instead for 'homegrown' talent, they won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 in one of the most exciting finals Hampden has ever seen.\n\nTwelve months later Dundee were back at Hampden to become the first side to retain the League Cup and in between these two victories appeared in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The Dark Blue side of the era included players such as Bill Brown, Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie, Alfie Boyd, Bobby Flavell and Billy Steel.\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 Scottish Cup]] Dundee suffered a shock 1\u20130 defeat to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Fraserburgh F.C.|Fraserburgh]]. This is widely regarded as Dundee's most embarrassing defeat in their history.\n\n===1960s \u2013 Dundee's golden age===\n\n[[Bob Shankly]] (brother of [[Bill Shankly]]) was appointed manager in 1959. Dundee won the league title of Scotland's top division, then called the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], in the [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1961\u201362 season]]. With players such as Bobby Cox, Bobby Wishart, Pat Liney (Goalkeeper), Alan Cousin, Andy Penman, Hugh Robertson, [[Alan Gilzean]], [[Alex Hamilton (footballer born 1936)|Alex Hamilton]], [[Bobby Seith]], [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Ian Ure]] they clinched the title with a win against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], which in turn relegated St Johnstone to the then Second Division. Gordon Smith earned the distinction of being the only player to win the Scottish football championship with three clubs ([[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and Dundee), none of them either half of the traditionally dominant [[Old Firm]].<ref name = \"ancell\">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=976|title=QosFC: Bobby Ancell|website=qosfc.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1962\u201363 in Scottish football|following season]], 1962\u201363, Dundee reached the [[European Cup 1962\u201363#Semi finals|semi-finals]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] beating [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]. Dundee lost to [[A.C. Milan]] on aggregate in the semi-finals; though Dundee won (and kept a clean sheet) against Milan in the home leg at Dens Park. \n\nThe Dee reached the Scottish Cup final again in the [[1963\u201364 Scottish Cup|1963\u201364 competition]]. Shankly left Dundee in February 1965.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\nThe next manager after Shankly was former player [[Bobby Ancell]] from the 1947 B Division Championship side. Ancell took Dundee to a 1967\u201368 League Cup final against the previous season's European Cup winners, Celtic. Ancell's team scored three times at [[Hampden Park]] in Celtic's native [[Glasgow]] but still lost 5\u20133. \n\nIn the predecessor to the [[UEFA Cup]]/[[Europa League]], Dundee reached the semi-finals of the [[1967\u201368 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. Dundee eliminated opposition from the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland to meet [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-final. After a 1\u20131 draw at Dens, a 1\u20130 second leg win took Leeds through.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\nIn 1973 under the management of [[David White (football manager)|David White]] and captaincy of [[Tommy Gemmell]], the [[League Cup]] returned to Dens following a 1\u20130 win against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2000 the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Claudio Caniggia]],<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia fever puts Dundee in world spotlight\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/caniggia-fever-puts-dundee-in-world-spotlight-628967.html\n| newspaper  = [[The Independent|Independent]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London\n| first=Calum\n| last=Philip}}</ref> who later signed for Rangers.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia to join Rangers\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/15/newsstory.sport4\n| work  = [[The Guardian]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London}}</ref> Caniggia was only one of many foreign signings in the Dundee side in the early 2000s, which also included former [[Newcastle United]] player [[Temuri Ketsbaia]].<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Ketsbaia heads north to Dundee\n |url          = http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |work    = [[The Guardian]]\n |date         = 18 October 2001\n |accessdate   = 24 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120331125915/http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |archive-date = 31 March 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The signing of such high-profile players along with many others led Dundee to a Scottish Cup final and two top-six finishes. This was achieved under the managership of [[Ivano Bonetti]], who also made a short but notable contribution on the park linking up well with Caniggia. Attendances were still short of the hoped for numbers and with spending significantly outweighing income, Dundee were soon forced into administration.\n\nBefore Dundee went into financial trouble they knocked out Glasgow side [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] 2\u20130 away from home in the third round of the [[Scottish Cup]]. The fourth round saw Dundee knock out [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 2\u20130 at [[Dens Park]]. Dundee continued their march towards [[Hampden Park]] with a 1\u20131 draw away and a 4\u20131 extra time victory over [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at Dens booked their place in the semi-finals playing [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] at [[Hampden Park]]. A goal by [[Georgi Nemsadze]] secured a 1\u20130 victory and a place in [[2003 Scottish Cup Final|the Final]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In the final [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] hit the post for Dundee but [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] scored to bring Dundee's cup run to an end.\n\nIn 2003, due to the club's failure to sell on players as anticipated insufficient income was raised to fund the large wage bill under owners Peter and James Marr, resulting in a \u00a323m debt which meant they were forced to go into administration with many players such as [[Fabian Caballero]], [[Craig Burley]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgian]] captain [[Giorgi Nemsadze]] leaving in 2005. Despite this huge debt, Dundee survived by selling their stadium in 2003. But the club was then relegated to the second tier of the Scottish leagues, where they remained until July 2012. In mid-2006, it was announced that financial restructuring would see the club become debt-free.\n\nIn 2007, James and Peter Marr severed some of their ties with Dundee, stepping down as chairman and Chief Executive respectively, when their company P&J Taverns was forced into administration. Bob Brannan and [[Dave MacKinnon (footballer)|Dave MacKinnon]] took the Marrs' place.\n\nIn 2008, after a poor run in the league, manager [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]] was sacked, with former manager [[Jocky Scott]] taking over for his third stint with the club.<ref name=\"Scott1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/7695798.stm|title=Scott set for Dundee appointment|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 October 2008 | date=30 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dundee FC.svg|thumb|centre|Logo used from 1987 to 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundee|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Dundee/Dundee.htm|work=Historical Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>]]\nIn the 2009\u201310 season Dundee director Calum Melville was in trouble for claiming he was going to offer rivals [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] \u00a3500,000 for ex-Dundee midfielder [[Scott Robertson (footballer born 1985)|Scott Robertson]].<ref name=\"Scott2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/dundee-director-calum-melville-faces-grilling-over-planned-bid-for-dundee-united-s-scott-robertson-1.928974|title=Melville faces grilling for planned bid|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|accessdate=28 October 2009 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> Dundee won the [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final]] when they beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/cups/challenge-cup/2009/11/23/alba-cup-final-inverness-caledonian-thistle-2-dundee-3-86908-21842989/|title=Alba Cup Final: Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2 Dundee 3|date=23 November 2009|work=DailyRecord|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Scott was sacked as manager after a 3\u20130 defeat by [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/8578476.stm|title=First Division leaders Dundee sack manager Jocky Scott|work=BBC Sport|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=20 March 2010 | first=Jim | last=Spence}}</ref> He was replaced by Gordon Chisholm, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.\n\nIn September 2010, Dundee were again on the brink of going into administration due to a \u00a3365,000 unpaid tax bill.

These targets were set to ensure, in some part, that the failures that led to administration and indeed, several decades of financial turmoil, could not be repeated. Dundee were left after the second administration with only [[Administration (British football)|footballing debt]] and no borrowing capability. Since exiting administration, the club has focussed on honouring the footballing debt, whilst keeping lower football wages and stadium bills, according to the income generated. The debt post-admin was unexpectedly still over \u00a3200,000 which had to be quickly worked into the board's already stretched budgets.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful season in the Premier League, when they were asked to replace [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], Dundee were again relegated after finishing bottom, despite vastly improved form after [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] replaced [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] as manager toward the end of the season. The following season (2013\u201314) Dundee would take part in the [[Scottish Championship]] (formerly the First Division) after reforms were made to the Scottish League system.\n\nThroughout the summer leading up to the start of the 2013\u201314 season talks were held regarding a possible Texan based takeover with investments to be made of up to \u00a3650,000. The takeover was completed and former Director Bill Colvin was appointed as chairman to oversee this new board of which main investor Tim Keyes of Keyes Capital, Austin, Texas, appointed John Nelms to look after his interests. The 2013\u201314 season proved to be one to remember with Dundee clinching the title and promotion to the top tier on the last day of the season with a 2\u20131 win over [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. After a heavy defeat to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and a draw against Alloa, manager [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] was replaced by [[Paul Hartley]]. A 3\u20130 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4\u20131 loss to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] for Hamilton Academical meant that Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale. [[Dens Park]] was sold out for the game against [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] when [[Christian Nade]] headed in the opening goal. Soon after, [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] scored the second goal. The away side pulled a goal back in the second half and [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] managed to close the goal difference with a 10\u20132 victory over [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. But Dundee got the three points, and clinched promotion to the [[Scottish Premiership]].\n\n===Return to the Premiership===\n\nPaul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed [[Greg Stewart (footballer)|Greg Stewart]] on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and [[Philip Roberts]] who joined before the end of May. Released [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] players [[James McPake]] and [[Kevin Thomson]] were next to join, along with [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa]] goalkeeper [[Scott Bain]]. Thomson was made Captain after signing. [[Simon Ferry]], released from Portsmouth then returned to his hometown to play for Dundee. [[Paul McGowan (footballer)|Paul McGowan]] and [[Paul McGinn]] arrived from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and Dumbarton respectfully, then attacking midfielder [[Gary Harkins]] signed for his third spell at the club on the last day of June, after also being released from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. A number of first team players departed, namely [[Christian Nade]] and [[Ryan Conroy]], who both went on to join [[raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Gavin Rae]] who retired from playing and player-coach [[Matt Lockwood]].\n\nOn the opening day of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]], Dundee recorded a 1\u20131 draw against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at home, [[Gary Harkins]] put Dundee ahead from the spot after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] conceded a penalty, with [[Craig Slater]] equalising for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]] on 23 August with a 1\u20130 win over [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] away from home, a 79th-minute goal from [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season. Dundee also started the League Cup well with two 4\u20130 wins on the bounce over [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]].\n\nDundee managed to gain a top six place by mid-April thus securing their position in the Premiership for 2015\u201316 campaign. They secured the place for definite after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] were defeated 2\u20131 by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] on 12 April and a Dundee derby victory on 8 April in a 3\u20131 Win at home to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32089189|title=Kilmarnock 1\u20132 Aberdeen|date=12 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref> \n\nAt the end of the 2014\u201315 season, in June, Dundee chairman Bill Colvin stepped down as chairman and sold his share in Dundee to then director, Tim Keyes who became the new chairman of the club.<ref name=\"eveningtelegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/|title=Evening Telegraph \u2013 The latest news and sport from Dundee, Tayside and Fife|website=Evening Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDundee finished 8th in the [[2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership]], notably relegating rivals [[Dundee United]] at Dens Park.\n\nDundee were relegated to the Scottish Championship at the end of the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership|2018\u201319 season]].

Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as [[Tannadice Park]], which is the home of city rivals Dundee United.\n\nIn 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland's bid to host the [[2008 European Football Championship]]. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Stadium respectively.  However, when [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]] were selected to co-host the event, the plans were shelved for the immediate future.\n\nIn May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett who, despite having invested heavily in Dundee, had rejoined the Dundee United board, where he had previously been a director until September 2008.\n\nIn October 2014, Dundee Supporter's Society announced they had put forward plans to then club chairman, Bill Colvin which would allow the club to buy back the stadium from current owner John Bennett. They also expressed this was not a plan to enable the Supporter's Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, and that they will \"simply administer the scheme\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dee4life.com/news/47/chairmans-update-october.html|title=Chairmans Update October|last=mtc.|website=dee4life.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Colvin announced that negotiations were taking place to buy back the Stadium from current owner John Bennett and his company Sandeman Holdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32240533|title=Dundee negotiate to buy back Dens Park stadium|date=9 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, club owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms were reported to have bought land in the Camperdown area of Dundee, next to the city's Ice Arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/exclusive-dundee-leave-dens-1-2m-land-deal1/|title=Dee could be set for new home as duo buy \u00a31.2m land \u2013 Evening Telegraph}}</ref> It was then made clear in February 2017 that the plan for this land was to develop a new stadium for the club due to the increasing maintenance costs of Dens Park, although plans for a move were described by Nelms as being \"early doors\" in a video interview published on the club's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/dundee-fc/378762/dundee-fc-press-plans-leave-dens-park/|title=Dundee FC press on with plans to leave Dens Park \u2013 The Courier}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed '''Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park''' for sponsorship reasons for the next two seasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44304571 |title=Dundee: Home ground renamed the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park |work=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Club staff==\n\n===Corporate board===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The rivalry is unique, as the two teams' stadiums are located within 100 yards of each other. The close proximity of the two teams also fuels the intensity of the rivalry. This intensity makes it one of the most exciting and notable derbies in Scotland. While it is far friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the [[Old Firm]], both sets of fans regard the fixture to be of high importance, with derby results throughout the season being defining points in each teams' seasons.\n\nDundee traditionally dominated the fixture in its first few decades, but the momentum shifted in the 1980s, with United taking a foothold in the fixture. The history of late has been defined by the inability of both teams to consistently stay in the same division, with Dundee a division below United for quite a few seasons while dealing with the after-effects of multiple administrations. Dundee eventually returned to the [[Scottish Premiership]] in 2014, and in 2016 it was a Dundee derby victory over United that confirmed the latter's own relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36126882|title=Dundee 2\u20131 Dundee United|last=English|first=Tom|date=2 May 2016|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> After a few years of Dundee being a league above United, the two were eventually reunited again in the [[Scottish Championship]] in 2019 following Dundee's relegation.\n\nDundee and United also share a mutual rivalry with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], due to the close proximity between [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], known as the [[Tayside derby]]. This fixture however is considered far less serious than the Dundee derby, though took prominence after United's relegation in 2016. The most notable fixture between the two occurred in 1962, where Dundee defeated St Johnstone 0\u20133 at the latter's former ground, [[Muirton Park]]. This result both confirmed Dundee as league champions for the first and to date only time in their history, and confirmed St Johnstone's relegation from the First Division.\n==Records==\n* '''Highest attendance:''' 136,495 fans attended the [[1952 Scottish Cup Final]] between Dundee and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

Football Club''' is a professional [[Association football|football]] club based in the city of [[Dundee]], Scotland. Founded in 1893, they are nicknamed \"The Dark Blues\" or \"The Dee\". The club plays its home matches at [[Dens Park]].\n\nThe club's most successful era was in the 1960s when, under the management of [[Bob Shankly]], Dundee won the [[Scottish Football League]] title in [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1962]], before reaching the semi-finals of the [[1962\u201363 European Cup]]. Dundee has won the [[Scottish Cup]] once, and won the [[Scottish League Cup]] three times.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of Dundee F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\n\nDundee F.C. was formed in 1893 by the merger of two local clubs, [[Dundee East End F.C.|East End]] and [[Dundee Our Boys F.C.|Our Boys]], with the intention of gaining election to the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL). Their application was successful and they played their first League game on 12 August 1893 at [[West Craigie Park]], securing a 3\u20133 draw against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. Dundee struggled during the first 10 years of their existence. Their best league position was fifth which they achieved in seasons 1895\u201396 and 1896\u201397. They also reached the semi-finals of the [[Scottish Cup]] in 1894\u201395 and 1897\u201398, losing to [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] and [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] respectively. On 26 October 1895 Dundee lost a league game by a record score of 0\u201311 to [[History of Celtic F.C. (1887\u20131994)|Celtic]] in Glasgow. On 1 January 1894 Dundee defeated [[Newton Heath F.C.|Newton Heath]] (the future Manchester United) 2\u20131 at their then [[Carolina Port]] ground in Dundee. Carolina Port also hosted the first international football match held in Dundee on [[1895-96 British Home Championship|21 March 1896]] when Scotland defeated Wales 4\u20130. Dundee's goalkeeper [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Frank Barrett]], midfielder [[List of Scotland international footballers (5\u201324 caps)|Sandy Keillor]] and inside-forward [[List of Scotland international footballers (1\u20134 caps)|Bill Thomson]] were all capped for Scotland during this early period of the club's history. Things began to improve for Dundee with the beginning of the new century. In 1899 they moved from Carolina Port to their present ground of [[Dens Park]]. In season [[1902\u201303 in Scottish football|1902\u201303]] they finished runners-up in the league championship to [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. (In season 1902\u201303 Dundee allowed 12 league goals against, which remains the fewest goals conceded by any British club in a full league season.)\n\nDundee were also league runners-up in 1906\u201307 and 1908\u201309 finishing behind Celtic on both occasions, in [[1908\u201309 in Scottish football|1908\u201309]] by just 1 point. In the 10 seasons from 1902 to 1903 Dundee lost just 16 league games at Dens Park out of 154 played and were unbeaten at home during season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]]. Although ultimate success eluded Dundee in the league the club achieved success in the Scottish Cup. In season [[1909\u201310 in Scottish football|1909\u201310]] Dundee won their first trophy by defeating Clyde in the [[1909\u201310 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup Final]]. (Dundee took three games to beat [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] in the semi-final and then the same number to defeat [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]].) The winning goal in the second replay was scored by [[John Hunter (footballer, born 1878)|John 'Sailor' Hunter]]. In season [[1910\u201311 Scottish Cup|1910\u201311]] Dundee defeated [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] 2\u20131 at Dens Park in the Scottish Cup quarter-final but lost to [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton]] in the semi-final. The beginning of the First World War and the call-up of many players for military duty drastically curtailed football in Britain from 1914 and in [[List of Dundee F.C. seasons|1917]] Dundee and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] were both asked to withdraw from the league due to increasing transport costs for the other league clubs. In 1919 league football recommenced and good home form once again propelled Dundee up the league. They finished 4th in seasons [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201320]], [[1920\u201321 in Scottish football|1920\u201321]] and [[1921\u201322 in Scottish football|1921\u201322]], and were unbeaten at home during season 1921\u201322. However, they could not make the breakthrough to win the league championship.\n\n[[Dave Halliday]] had played on the left wing for his previous clubs, his hometown side [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] and [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. Halliday went to Dundee in 1921 where Scotland internationalist Alec Troup played left wing. Dundee thus converted Halliday to [[centre forward]] with prolific results; he finished as Scottish top scorer in the [[1923\u201324 in Scottish football|1923\u201324 season]] with 38 goals from his 36 top division appearances. This remains the club record all-time seasonal league goal scoring record. Halliday top scored in England's top division in 1928-29 to become the most recent of only 2 players to be outright top scorer in Scotland and England. With Halliday Dundee reached the [[1924\u201325 Scottish Cup]] final eliminating the holders en route, the [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrieonians]] side of [[Hughie Gallacher]]. Dundee led [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] 1-0 at half time in the final before losing out to a last minute [[Jimmy McGrory]] winner. Halliday top scored for Dundee in that cup run. In end of season tours with Dundee, Halliday scored doubles against each of [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Madrid]], [[Valencia CF]] and [[FC Barcelona]]. Halliday scored 103 goals in 147 league and cup appearances for the Dee. He then moved South to set scoring records in England where other teams profited from Dundee's decision to convert Halliday to centre-forward.<ref name=qoslegend>[http://www.qosfc.com/legend-1048 Dave Halliday full career profile on www.qosfc.com]</ref>\n\n===Mid 20th century===\n\n[[File:Dundee FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of yearly table positions of Dundee in the Scottish League.]]The post-Second World War period was a golden era for Dundee Football Club. Having been relegated on the eve of war, the Dark Blues started in 1946 in the first official season in the second tier but within five years they were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and won their first trophy in forty-one years.\n\nBack to back 'B\u2019 Division titles earned George Anderson's Dundee promotion in 1947 and just two years later they were within a whisker of becoming Champions of Scotland. Silverware was not far away however as after spending a world record transfer fee of \u00a323,500 on [[Billy Steel]], much to the chagrin of modern-day supporters of the club \u2013 at least some anyway \u2013 who resented the aspect of finance in football and wish instead for 'homegrown' talent, they won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 in one of the most exciting finals Hampden has ever seen.\n\nTwelve months later Dundee were back at Hampden to become the first side to retain the League Cup and in between these two victories appeared in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final. The Dark Blue side of the era included players such as Bill Brown, Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie, Alfie Boyd, Bobby Flavell and Billy Steel.\n\nIn the [[1958\u201359 Scottish Cup]] Dundee suffered a shock 1\u20130 defeat to [[Highland Football League|Highland League]] side [[Fraserburgh F.C.|Fraserburgh]]. This is widely regarded as Dundee's most embarrassing defeat in their history.\n\n===1960s \u2013 Dundee's golden age===\n\n[[Bob Shankly]] (brother of [[Bill Shankly]]) was appointed manager in 1959. Dundee won the league title of Scotland's top division, then called the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Division One]], in the [[1961\u201362 in Scottish football|1961\u201362 season]]. With players such as Bobby Cox, Bobby Wishart, Pat Liney (Goalkeeper), Alan Cousin, Andy Penman, Hugh Robertson, [[Alan Gilzean]], [[Alex Hamilton (footballer born 1936)|Alex Hamilton]], [[Bobby Seith]], [[Gordon Smith (footballer born 1924)|Gordon Smith]] and [[Ian Ure]] they clinched the title with a win against [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], which in turn relegated St Johnstone to the then Second Division. Gordon Smith earned the distinction of being the only player to win the Scottish football championship with three clubs ([[Hibernian F.C.|Hibs]], [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] and Dundee), none of them either half of the traditionally dominant [[Old Firm]].<ref name = \"ancell\">{{cite web|url=http://qosfc.com/new_newsview.aspx?newsid=976|title=QosFC: Bobby Ancell|website=qosfc.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1962\u201363 in Scottish football|following season]], 1962\u201363, Dundee reached the [[European Cup 1962\u201363#Semi finals|semi-finals]] of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] beating [[1. FC K\u00f6ln]], [[Sporting Clube de Portugal]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]]. Dundee lost to [[A.C. Milan]] on aggregate in the semi-finals; though Dundee won (and kept a clean sheet) against Milan in the home leg at Dens Park. \n\nThe Dee reached the Scottish Cup final again in the [[1963\u201364 Scottish Cup|1963\u201364 competition]]. Shankly left Dundee in February 1965.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\nThe next manager after Shankly was former player [[Bobby Ancell]] from the 1947 B Division Championship side. Ancell took Dundee to a 1967\u201368 League Cup final against the previous season's European Cup winners, Celtic. Ancell's team scored three times at [[Hampden Park]] in Celtic's native [[Glasgow]] but still lost 5\u20133. \n\nIn the predecessor to the [[UEFA Cup]]/[[Europa League]], Dundee reached the semi-finals of the [[1967\u201368 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. Dundee eliminated opposition from the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland to meet [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] in the semi-final. After a 1\u20131 draw at Dens, a 1\u20130 second leg win took Leeds through.<ref name = \"ancell\"/>\n\n===Late 20th century===\n\nIn 1973 under the management of [[David White (football manager)|David White]] and captaincy of [[Tommy Gemmell]], the [[League Cup]] returned to Dens following a 1\u20130 win against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].\n\n===21st century===\nIn 2000 the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Claudio Caniggia]],<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia fever puts Dundee in world spotlight\n| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/scottish/caniggia-fever-puts-dundee-in-world-spotlight-628967.html\n| newspaper  = [[The Independent|Independent]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London\n| first=Calum\n| last=Philip}}</ref> who later signed for Rangers.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Caniggia to join Rangers\n| url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/may/15/newsstory.sport4\n| work  = [[The Guardian]]\n| date = 16 December 2000\n| accessdate = 24 March 2010\n| location=London}}</ref> Caniggia was only one of many foreign signings in the Dundee side in the early 2000s, which also included former [[Newcastle United]] player [[Temuri Ketsbaia]].<ref>{{cite news\n |title        = Ketsbaia heads north to Dundee\n |url          = http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |work    = [[The Guardian]]\n |date         = 18 October 2001\n |accessdate   = 24 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120331125915/http://www1.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=9810.html\n |archive-date = 31 March 2012\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> The signing of such high-profile players along with many others led Dundee to a Scottish Cup final and two top-six finishes. This was achieved under the managership of [[Ivano Bonetti]], who also made a short but notable contribution on the park linking up well with Caniggia. Attendances were still short of the hoped for numbers and with spending significantly outweighing income, Dundee were soon forced into administration.\n\nBefore Dundee went into financial trouble they knocked out Glasgow side [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] 2\u20130 away from home in the third round of the [[Scottish Cup]]. The fourth round saw Dundee knock out [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] 2\u20130 at [[Dens Park]]. Dundee continued their march towards [[Hampden Park]] with a 1\u20131 draw away and a 4\u20131 extra time victory over [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] at Dens booked their place in the semi-finals playing [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness CT]] at [[Hampden Park]]. A goal by [[Georgi Nemsadze]] secured a 1\u20130 victory and a place in [[2003 Scottish Cup Final|the Final]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. In the final [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] hit the post for Dundee but [[Lorenzo Amoruso]] scored to bring Dundee's cup run to an end.\n\nIn 2003, due to the club's failure to sell on players as anticipated insufficient income was raised to fund the large wage bill under owners Peter and James Marr, resulting in a \u00a323m debt which meant they were forced to go into administration with many players such as [[Fabian Caballero]], [[Craig Burley]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgian]] captain [[Giorgi Nemsadze]] leaving in 2005. Despite this huge debt, Dundee survived by selling their stadium in 2003. But the club was then relegated to the second tier of the Scottish leagues, where they remained until July 2012. In mid-2006, it was announced that financial restructuring would see the club become debt-free.\n\nIn 2007, James and Peter Marr severed some of their ties with Dundee, stepping down as chairman and Chief Executive respectively, when their company P&J Taverns was forced into administration. Bob Brannan and [[Dave MacKinnon (footballer)|Dave MacKinnon]] took the Marrs' place.\n\nIn 2008, after a poor run in the league, manager [[Alex Rae (footballer born 1969)|Alex Rae]] was sacked, with former manager [[Jocky Scott]] taking over for his third stint with the club.<ref name=\"Scott1\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/7695798.stm|title=Scott set for Dundee appointment|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=30 October 2008 | date=30 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Dundee FC.svg|thumb|centre|Logo used from 1987 to 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dundee|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Dundee/Dundee.htm|work=Historical Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>]]\nIn the 2009\u201310 season Dundee director Calum Melville was in trouble for claiming he was going to offer rivals [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] \u00a3500,000 for ex-Dundee midfielder [[Scott Robertson (footballer born 1985)|Scott Robertson]].<ref name=\"Scott2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/dundee-director-calum-melville-faces-grilling-over-planned-bid-for-dundee-united-s-scott-robertson-1.928974|title=Melville faces grilling for planned bid|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|accessdate=28 October 2009 | date=29 October 2009}}</ref> Dundee won the [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup Final]] when they beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3\u20132.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/cups/challenge-cup/2009/11/23/alba-cup-final-inverness-caledonian-thistle-2-dundee-3-86908-21842989/|title=Alba Cup Final: Inverness Caledonian Thistle 2 Dundee 3|date=23 November 2009|work=DailyRecord|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2010, Scott was sacked as manager after a 3\u20130 defeat by [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/dundee/8578476.stm|title=First Division leaders Dundee sack manager Jocky Scott|work=BBC Sport|date=20 March 2010|accessdate=20 March 2010 | first=Jim | last=Spence}}</ref> He was replaced by Gordon Chisholm, with Billy Dodds as his assistant.\n\nIn September 2010, Dundee were again on the brink of going into administration due to a \u00a3365,000 unpaid tax bill.

On 10 December 2010 the Dark Blues Business Trust was set up by former Dundee owner Peter Marr and former director Steve Martin to help the club recover from their financial situation. On 17 December 2010 Dundee's appeal against the points deduction was rejected. Dundee went on a 23 match undefeated streak in the first division beating the previous record set by the team.\n\nOn 12 May 2011, Dundee FC exited administration. The club's supporters' trust, Dundee FC Supporters' Society Ltd., became the majority shareholder, and Steve Martin of the DFC Business Trust joined the board of directors along with 5 of the Society Fans board.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13380218.stm | title=Dundee Exit Administration | accessdate=12 May 2011 |work=BBC News| date=12 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 November 2011, it was announced Harry MacLean had resigned from his position as Chief Executive and would work a month's notice.<ref name=\"Harry_Leaves\">{{cite news |title=Harry MacLean Resignation |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=HARRY-MACLEAN-RESIGNATION&newsid=1969 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=6 November 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526121009/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=HARRY-MACLEAN-RESIGNATION&newsid=1969 |archive-date=26 May 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> MacLean, who had played a key role in saving the club during administration,<ref name=\"Harry_Leaves\"/> accepted an invitation to re-join the club in a non-executive role before departing his position as Chief Executive.<ref>{{cite news |title=Statement from Dundee FC and DFCSS |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=STATEMENT-FROM-DUNDEE-FC-AND-DFCSS&newsid=1992 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=21 November 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526121021/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=STATEMENT-FROM-DUNDEE-FC-AND-DFCSS&newsid=1992 |archive-date=26 May 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> His resignation was followed just eleven days later by Stuart Murphy's decision to step down as club chairman and Director of the Club which was effective immediately.<ref>{{cite news |title=Club Statement |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=CLUB-STATEMENT&newsid=1984 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=17 November 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526121034/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/news_detail.asp?h=CLUB-STATEMENT&newsid=1984 |archive-date=26 May 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> On 27 December 2011, Harry MacLean resigned from his non-executive role<ref>{{cite news |title=Harry Leaves Board |url=http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/home/news_detail.asp?newsid=2073 |work=dundeefc.co.uk |publisher=Dundee F.C. |date=27 December 2011 |accessdate=27 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526121100/http://www.dundeefc.co.uk/home/news_detail.asp?newsid=2073 |archive-date=26 May 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> causing questions to arise about the stability of the boardroom.

These targets were set to ensure, in some part, that the failures that led to administration and indeed, several decades of financial turmoil, could not be repeated. Dundee were left after the second administration with only [[Administration (British football)|footballing debt]] and no borrowing capability. Since exiting administration, the club has focussed on honouring the footballing debt, whilst keeping lower football wages and stadium bills, according to the income generated. The debt post-admin was unexpectedly still over \u00a3200,000 which had to be quickly worked into the board's already stretched budgets.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful season in the Premier League, when they were asked to replace [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], Dundee were again relegated after finishing bottom, despite vastly improved form after [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] replaced [[Barry Smith (footballer born 1974)|Barry Smith]] as manager toward the end of the season. The following season (2013\u201314) Dundee would take part in the [[Scottish Championship]] (formerly the First Division) after reforms were made to the Scottish League system.\n\nThroughout the summer leading up to the start of the 2013\u201314 season talks were held regarding a possible Texan based takeover with investments to be made of up to \u00a3650,000. The takeover was completed and former Director Bill Colvin was appointed as chairman to oversee this new board of which main investor Tim Keyes of Keyes Capital, Austin, Texas, appointed John Nelms to look after his interests. The 2013\u201314 season proved to be one to remember with Dundee clinching the title and promotion to the top tier on the last day of the season with a 2\u20131 win over [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]]. After a heavy defeat to [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] and a draw against Alloa, manager [[John Brown (footballer, born 1962)|John Brown]] was replaced by [[Paul Hartley]]. A 3\u20130 win at Alloa for The Dark Blues and a 4\u20131 loss to [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] for Hamilton Academical meant that Dundee were in the driving seat when it came to the finale. [[Dens Park]] was sold out for the game against [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] when [[Christian Nade]] headed in the opening goal. Soon after, [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] scored the second goal. The away side pulled a goal back in the second half and [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]] managed to close the goal difference with a 10\u20132 victory over [[Greenock Morton F.C.|Greenock Morton]]. But Dundee got the three points, and clinched promotion to the [[Scottish Premiership]].\n\n===Return to the Premiership===\n\nPaul Hartley was quick in the transfer window for the following season, bringing in no fewer than twelve new players, to rebuild the squad for top-flight football, having already signed [[Greg Stewart (footballer)|Greg Stewart]] on a pre-contract from Cowdenbeath and [[Philip Roberts]] who joined before the end of May. Released [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] players [[James McPake]] and [[Kevin Thomson]] were next to join, along with [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa]] goalkeeper [[Scott Bain]]. Thomson was made Captain after signing. [[Simon Ferry]], released from Portsmouth then returned to his hometown to play for Dundee. [[Paul McGowan (footballer)|Paul McGowan]] and [[Paul McGinn]] arrived from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] and Dumbarton respectfully, then attacking midfielder [[Gary Harkins]] signed for his third spell at the club on the last day of June, after also being released from [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]]. A number of first team players departed, namely [[Christian Nade]] and [[Ryan Conroy]], who both went on to join [[raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], [[Gavin Rae]] who retired from playing and player-coach [[Matt Lockwood]].\n\nOn the opening day of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]], Dundee recorded a 1\u20131 draw against [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at home, [[Gary Harkins]] put Dundee ahead from the spot after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] conceded a penalty, with [[Craig Slater]] equalising for the visitors from a well struck free-kick on the edge of the Dundee area. Dundee won their first game of the [[2014\u201315 Dundee F.C. season|2014\u201315 season]] on 23 August with a 1\u20130 win over [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] away from home, a 79th-minute goal from [[Peter MacDonald (footballer)|Peter MacDonald]] securing the win, making them unbeaten in their first four league games of the season. Dundee also started the League Cup well with two 4\u20130 wins on the bounce over [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] and [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]].\n\nDundee managed to gain a top six place by mid-April thus securing their position in the Premiership for 2015\u201316 campaign. They secured the place for definite after [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] were defeated 2\u20131 by [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] on 12 April and a Dundee derby victory on 8 April in a 3\u20131 Win at home to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32089189|title=Kilmarnock 1\u20132 Aberdeen|date=12 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref> \n\nAt the end of the 2014\u201315 season, in June, Dundee chairman Bill Colvin stepped down as chairman and sold his share in Dundee to then director, Tim Keyes who became the new chairman of the club.<ref name=\"eveningtelegraph.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/|title=Evening Telegraph \u2013 The latest news and sport from Dundee, Tayside and Fife|website=Evening Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nDundee finished 8th in the [[2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership]], notably relegating rivals [[Dundee United]] at Dens Park.\n\nDundee were relegated to the Scottish Championship at the end of the [[2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership|2018\u201319 season]].

Uniquely, the stadium shares part of the same road (Sandeman Street) as [[Tannadice Park]], which is the home of city rivals Dundee United.\n\nIn 2002, plans were drawn up for a new stadium to be built in the city as part of Scotland's bid to host the [[2008 European Football Championship]]. This stadium would have been shared by Dundee and near-neighbours Dundee United, which would have required the two to leave their historic grounds at Dens Park and Tannadice Stadium respectively.  However, when [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]] were selected to co-host the event, the plans were shelved for the immediate future.\n\nIn May 2009, it was reported that the stadium is owned by local businessman John Bennett who, despite having invested heavily in Dundee, had rejoined the Dundee United board, where he had previously been a director until September 2008.\n\nIn October 2014, Dundee Supporter's Society announced they had put forward plans to then club chairman, Bill Colvin which would allow the club to buy back the stadium from current owner John Bennett. They also expressed this was not a plan to enable the Supporter's Society to own the Stadium but for the club themselves, and that they will \"simply administer the scheme\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dee4life.com/news/47/chairmans-update-october.html|title=Chairmans Update October|last=mtc.|website=dee4life.com}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, Colvin announced that negotiations were taking place to buy back the Stadium from current owner John Bennett and his company Sandeman Holdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32240533|title=Dundee negotiate to buy back Dens Park stadium|date=9 April 2015|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, club owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms were reported to have bought land in the Camperdown area of Dundee, next to the city's Ice Arena.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/fp/exclusive-dundee-leave-dens-1-2m-land-deal1/|title=Dee could be set for new home as duo buy \u00a31.2m land \u2013 Evening Telegraph}}</ref> It was then made clear in February 2017 that the plan for this land was to develop a new stadium for the club due to the increasing maintenance costs of Dens Park, although plans for a move were described by Nelms as being \"early doors\" in a video interview published on the club's website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/dundee-fc/378762/dundee-fc-press-plans-leave-dens-park/|title=Dundee FC press on with plans to leave Dens Park \u2013 The Courier}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018 it was announced that the stadium would be renamed '''Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park''' for sponsorship reasons for the next two seasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44304571 |title=Dundee: Home ground renamed the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park |work=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2018 |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Club staff==\n\n===Corporate board===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The rivalry is unique, as the two teams' stadiums are located within 100 yards of each other. The close proximity of the two teams also fuels the intensity of the rivalry. This intensity makes it one of the most exciting and notable derbies in Scotland. While it is far friendlier than other Scottish derbies such as the [[Old Firm]], both sets of fans regard the fixture to be of high importance, with derby results throughout the season being defining points in each teams' seasons.\n\nDundee traditionally dominated the fixture in its first few decades, but the momentum shifted in the 1980s, with United taking a foothold in the fixture. The history of late has been defined by the inability of both teams to consistently stay in the same division, with Dundee a division below United for quite a few seasons while dealing with the after-effects of multiple administrations. Dundee eventually returned to the [[Scottish Premiership]] in 2014, and in 2016 it was a Dundee derby victory over United that confirmed the latter's own relegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36126882|title=Dundee 2\u20131 Dundee United|last=English|first=Tom|date=2 May 2016|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref> After a few years of Dundee being a league above United, the two were eventually reunited again in the [[Scottish Championship]] in 2019 following Dundee's relegation.\n\nDundee and United also share a mutual rivalry with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]], due to the close proximity between [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], known as the [[Tayside derby]]. This fixture however is considered far less serious than the Dundee derby, though took prominence after United's relegation in 2016. The most notable fixture between the two occurred in 1962, where Dundee defeated St Johnstone 0\u20133 at the latter's former ground, [[Muirton Park]]. This result both confirmed Dundee as league champions for the first and to date only time in their history, and confirmed St Johnstone's relegation from the First Division.\n==Records==\n* '''Highest attendance:''' 136,495 fans attended the [[1952 Scottish Cup Final]] between Dundee and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

Some types of safety glasses are used to protect against visible and near-visible [[light]] or [[radiation]]. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as [[squash (sport)|squash]].\n\nGlasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking.\n\n[[Sunglasses]] allow for better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of [[ultraviolet light]]. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; Photochromatic glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when in they come in contact with ultraviolet light. Most over the counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made.\n\nSpecialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example [[3D glasses]] for [[3D films]] ([[stereoscopy]]). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials.\n\nPeople are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 wearing corrective lenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/06/22/good-question-why-do-so-many-of-us-need-glasses/|title=Good Question: Why Do So Many Of Us Need Glasses?|first=Liz|last=Collin|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.essilorusa.com/stories/detail/vision-impact-institute-releases-study-on-corrective-lens-wearers-in-the-u|title=Newsroom|publisher=}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Types ==\nGlasses can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification.\n\n=== Corrective ===\n{{Main|Corrective lens|Refractive error}}\n[[File:Refraction through glasses 090306.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle]] [[skyline]] as seen through a corrective lens, showing the effect of [[refraction]]]]\n\nCorrective lenses are used to correct [[refractive error]]s by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as [[myopia|nearsightedness (myopia)]], [[hypermetropia|farsightedness (hypermetropia)]] or [[astigmatism]]. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. A common condition in people over forty years old is [[presbyopia]], which is caused by the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a \"stronger\" (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other.\n\nCorrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] of an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]]. A [[lensmeter]] can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the [[life quality]] of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as [[headaches]] or squinting.\n\nThe most common type of corrective lens is \"single vision\", which has a uniform [[refractive index]]. For people with [[presbyopia]] and [[hyperopia]], [[bifocals|bifocal]] and [[trifocal]] glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and [[progressive lenses]] have a continuous gradient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eyewa.com/blog/eyeglasses/|title=Eyeglasses - All What You Need to Know|website=Eyewa Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Reading glasses]] provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from [[drugstore]]s, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have a pair of simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like [[astigmatism]] or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For the total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required.\n\n[[Adjustable-focus eyeglasses]] might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).\n\n[[Pinhole glasses]] are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a [[diffraction]] limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small [[aperture]] in [[photography]].  This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a [[DIY]] fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms.\n\n=== Safety ===\n[[File:SafetyGlassesShield.jpg|thumb|[[Eye protection|Safety glasses]] with side shields]]\n\nSafety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in various situations. They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for [[welding]], which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full-sized [[welding helmet]] is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called \"flash goggles\" because they provide protection from welding flash. [[Nylon]] frames are usually used for protective eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes.\n\n{{See also|Eye protection}}\n\n=== Sunglasses ===\n{{Main|Sunglasses}}\n[[File:Woman wearing sunglasses.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing [[sunglasses]]]]\n\nSunglasses provide more comfort and protection against bright [[visible light|light]] and often against [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. To properly protect the eyes from the dangers of UV light, sunglasses should have UV-400 blocker to provide good coverage against the entire light spectrum that poses a danger.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/brandpublishing/sfl-sunglasses-not-just-an-accessory-in-the-sunshine-state-20180312-story.html|title=Sunglasses not just an accessory in the Sunshine State|last=Solutions|first=Sun Sentinel Content|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}</ref>  [[Photochromic lens]]es, which are [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]], darken when struck by UV light.  The dark tint of the lenses in a pair of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens.\n\nLight [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed.  [[Liquid-crystal display]]s often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include tea shades and [[Mirrorshades (fashion)|mirrorshades]]. Many [[blindness|blind]] people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons.\n\nSunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription.  Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses.  Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over top of another pair of glasses.  Otherwise, many people opt to wear [[contact lens]]es to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used.\n\n=== Mixed doubleframe ===\n[[File:Doubleframe uplifting eyewear - Nella.gif|thumb|left|Doubleframe eyewear with one set of lenses on the moving frame and another pair of lenses on a fixed frame (optional).]]\nThe double frame uplifting glasses have one moving frame with one pair of lenses and the basic fixed frame with another pair of lenses (optional), that are connected by [[four-bar linkage]]. For example, sun lenses could be easily lifted up and down while mixed with [[myopia]] lenses that always stay on. [[Presbyopia]] lenses could be also combined and easily removed from the field of view if needed without taking off glasses.\n\n=== 3D glasses ===\n{{Main|Stereoscopy#3D viewers|l1=3D Viewers}}\nThe [[Stereoscopy|illusion of three dimensions]] on a two-dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes.  The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for.\n\n[[Anaglyph 3D]] glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A [[polarized 3D system]] on the other hand uses [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An [[active shutter 3D system]] uses electronic [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]]. [[Head-mounted display]]s can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewer's eyes.\n\nAnaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at [[3D film|3D movies]].  Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters.  Head-mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units.\n\n=== Magnification (bioptics) ===\nGlasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands.  An example would be ''[[Bioptics (device)|bioptics]]'' or  ''bioptic telescopes'' which have small [[telescope]]s mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble [[goggles]] or [[binoculars]], or may be attached to existing glasses.\n\n=== Yellow-tinted computer/gaming glasses ===\nYellow tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of reducing eyestrain due to lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-blocking-glasses-science-screens-not-destroying-vision-2017-2|title=Computer glasses that claim to protect your eyes from screens are selling like crazy, but they probably aren't doing you much good|last=Loria|first=Kevin|date=21 February 2017|website=Business Insider|accessdate=}}</ref> Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light.

The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions. By reducing the amount of glare on your eyes, vision can be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe anti-glare also applies to the outer glass, thus allowing for better eye contact.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=Anti-glare Coating|url=http://www.allaboutvision.com/lenses/anti-reflective.htm|website=All about Vision.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Frames ==\n[[File:Szem\u00fcveg - 1920-as \u00e9vek.JPG|thumb|Glasses, {{circa|lk=no|1920s}}, with springy cable temples]]\nThe ophthalmic frame is the part of a pair of glasses that is designed to hold the lenses in the proper position.\nOphthalmic frames come in a variety of styles, sizes, materials, shapes, and colors.<ref name=\"Optical Course\">{{cite web | url=http://www.harisingh.com/OpticalCourse.htm | title=Optical Course | publisher=OpticalCourse.com | accessdate=7 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Parts ===\n* pair of eye wires or rims surrounding and holding the lenses in place\n* bridge which connects the two eye wires\n* chassis, the combination of the eye wires and the bridge\n* top bar or brow bar, a bar just above the bridge providing structural support and/or style enhancement (country/Grandpa style).

Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them.  Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes.  For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allow for many trendy and fashionable shapes.  Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used.  However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced.\n\n[[Bifocals|Bifocal]], [[Trifocal lenses|trifocal]], and [[progressive lens]]es generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting [[myopia|myopic]] prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, rectangular or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.\n\n== History == \n\n=== Precursors ===\n{{see|Reading stone}}\n[[File:Hugh specs.jpg|thumb|Detail of a portrait of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Cardinal and renowned biblical scholar [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] painted by [[Tommaso da Modena]] in 1352]]\n[[File:El Greco 048.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of cardinal [[Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara]] by [[El Greco]] circa 1600 shows glasses with temples passing over and beyond the ears]]\n\nScattered evidence exists for use of visual aid devices in Greek and Roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder.<ref>The Natural History, Book 37, Chpt.16.

Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] (10th century) and most notably by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] (''[[Book of Optics]]'', ca. 1021). [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]] of Ptolemy's ''Optics'' and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of \"[[reading stone]]s\".\n\n[[Robert Grosseteste]]'s treatise ''De iride'' (\"On the Rainbow\"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to \"read the smallest letters at incredible distances\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Grant |editor1-first=Edward |title=A Source Book in Medieval Science |date=1974 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |page=389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAPN_3w4hAUC&pg=PA389#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=9780674823600 }} From Grant's English translation of Robert Grosseteste's ''De Iride'' (On the rainbow) in Latin,  p. 389:  \"This part [viz, from Aristotle's supposed treatise on optics] of perspective, if perfectly understood, shows us how to make nearby objects appear very small, and how to make a small object placed at a distance appear as large as we wish, so that it would be possible to read minute letters from incredible distances or count sand, seeds, blades of grass, or any minute objects.\"</ref> A few years later in 1262, [[Roger Bacon]] is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses.<ref>Bacon, Roger; Burke, Robert Belle, trans.

The book by HIRSCHBERG mentioned therein, in which his theory should be presented in detail, has not yet become accessible to me. I, therefore, limit my criticism of it as far as possible and prefer to prove, by means of new material from Chinese literature, that the view of the original invention of spectacles in India is the greatest probability. HIRSCHBERG theory is highly unlikely, as all previous experience has shown and contradicts analogies in cultural history and in the history of inventions in particular; Crystal spectacles appear in the European Middle Ages, in India, and in China, and from the historical point of view one can suppose from the outset that these inventions did not occur independently in each of these three cultural groups, but that a historical connection is here present.}} However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the Chinese manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty.<ref>{{cite web | title=Science and Civilization in China Vol 4.1 | pages=118\u2013119 | url=http://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf | accessdate=3 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823000519/https://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf | archive-date=23 August 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 Rishi Agarwal, in an article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, states that [[Vyasatirtha]] was observed possession a pair of glasses in the 1520\u2019s, he argues that it: ''\"...is, therefore, most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did [[Hindu mathematics]] and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon [[Sushruta]]\"'',<ref>Agarwal, R.

Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (''[[pince-nez]]''). [[Girolamo Savonarola]] suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a [[hat]]. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed sometime before 1727, possibly by the British optician [[Edward Scarlett]]. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as \"[[scissors-glasses]]\" and [[lorgnette]]s were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Moritz von Rohr]] and [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] (with the assistance of H.

In 2008, [[Joshua Silver]] designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/adspecs-eyeglasses-could-provide-sight-for-a-billion.html|title=Adspecs Eyeglasses Could Provide Sight for a Billion|work=TreeHugger}}</ref>\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of [[contact lenses]] and [[laser]] [[Refractive surgery|corrective eye surgery]], glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special [[memory metal]] alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges.

Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses and breaking.\n\n[[Sunglasses]] allow for better vision in bright daylight, and may protect one's eyes against damage from excessive levels of [[ultraviolet light]]. Typical sunglasses lenses are tinted for protection against bright light or polarized to remove glare; Photochromatic glasses are clear in dark or indoor conditions, but turn into sunglasses when in they come in contact with ultraviolet light. Most over the counter sunglasses do not have corrective power in the lenses; however, special prescription sunglasses can be made.\n\nSpecialized glasses may be used for viewing specific visual information, for example [[3D glasses]] for [[3D films]] ([[stereoscopy]]). Sometimes glasses are worn purely for fashion or aesthetic purposes. Even with glasses used for vision correction, a wide range of fashions are available, using plastic, metal, wire, and other materials.\n\nPeople are more likely to need glasses the older they get with 93% of people between the ages of 65 and 75 wearing corrective lenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2011/06/22/good-question-why-do-so-many-of-us-need-glasses/|title=Good Question: Why Do So Many Of Us Need Glasses?|first=Liz|last=Collin|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.essilorusa.com/stories/detail/vision-impact-institute-releases-study-on-corrective-lens-wearers-in-the-u|title=Newsroom|publisher=}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Types ==\nGlasses can be marked or found by their primary function, but also appear in combinations such as prescription sunglasses or safety glasses with enhanced magnification.\n\n=== Corrective ===\n{{Main|Corrective lens|Refractive error}}\n[[File:Refraction through glasses 090306.jpg|thumb|[[Seattle]] [[skyline]] as seen through a corrective lens, showing the effect of [[refraction]]]]\n\nCorrective lenses are used to correct [[refractive error]]s by bending the light entering the eye in order to alleviate the effects of conditions such as [[myopia|nearsightedness (myopia)]], [[hypermetropia|farsightedness (hypermetropia)]] or [[astigmatism]]. The ability of one's eyes to accommodate their focus to near and distant focus alters over time. A common condition in people over forty years old is [[presbyopia]], which is caused by the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]] losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to [[accommodation (eye)|accommodate]] (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a \"stronger\" (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other.\n\nCorrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] of an [[ophthalmologist]] or [[optometrist]]. A [[lensmeter]] can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the [[life quality]] of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as [[headaches]] or squinting.\n\nThe most common type of corrective lens is \"single vision\", which has a uniform [[refractive index]]. For people with [[presbyopia]] and [[hyperopia]], [[bifocals|bifocal]] and [[trifocal]] glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and [[progressive lenses]] have a continuous gradient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eyewa.com/blog/eyeglasses/|title=Eyeglasses - All What You Need to Know|website=Eyewa Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Reading glasses]] provide a separate set of glasses for focusing on close-by objects. Reading glasses are available without prescription from [[drugstore]]s, and offer a cheap, practical solution, though these have a pair of simple lenses of equal power, so will not correct refraction problems like [[astigmatism]] or refractive or prismatic variations between the left and right eye. For the total correction of the individual's sight, glasses complying to a recent ophthalmic prescription are required.\n\n[[Adjustable-focus eyeglasses]] might be used to replace bifocals or trifocals, or might be used to produce cheaper single-vision glasses (since they don't have to be custom-manufactured for every person).\n\n[[Pinhole glasses]] are a type of corrective glasses that do not use a lens. Pinhole glasses do not actually refract the light or change focal length. Instead, they create a [[diffraction]] limited system, which has an increased depth of field, similar to using a small [[aperture]] in [[photography]].  This form of correction has many limitations that prevent it from gaining popularity in everyday use. Pinhole glasses can be made in a [[DIY]] fashion by making small holes in a piece of card which is then held in front of the eyes with a strap or cardboard arms.\n\n=== Safety ===\n[[File:SafetyGlassesShield.jpg|thumb|[[Eye protection|Safety glasses]] with side shields]]\n\nSafety glasses are worn to protect the eyes in various situations. They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear safety glasses to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear safety glasses to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also safety glasses for [[welding]], which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full-sized [[welding helmet]] is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called \"flash goggles\" because they provide protection from welding flash. [[Nylon]] frames are usually used for protective eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, safety glasses often include protection beside the eyes as well as in front of the eyes.\n\n{{See also|Eye protection}}\n\n=== Sunglasses ===\n{{Main|Sunglasses}}\n[[File:Woman wearing sunglasses.jpg|thumb|Woman wearing [[sunglasses]]]]\n\nSunglasses provide more comfort and protection against bright [[visible light|light]] and often against [[ultraviolet]] (UV) light. To properly protect the eyes from the dangers of UV light, sunglasses should have UV-400 blocker to provide good coverage against the entire light spectrum that poses a danger.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/brandpublishing/sfl-sunglasses-not-just-an-accessory-in-the-sunshine-state-20180312-story.html|title=Sunglasses not just an accessory in the Sunshine State|last=Solutions|first=Sun Sentinel Content|work=Sun-Sentinel.com|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}</ref>  [[Photochromic lens]]es, which are [[Photosensitivity|photosensitive]], darken when struck by UV light.  The dark tint of the lenses in a pair of sunglasses blocks the transmission of light through the lens.\n\nLight [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] is an added feature that can be applied to sunglass lenses. Polarization filters are positioned to remove horizontally polarized rays of light, which eliminates glare from horizontal surfaces (allowing wearers to see into water when reflected light would otherwise overwhelm the scene). Polarized sunglasses may present some difficulties for pilots since reflections from water and other structures often used to gauge altitude may be removed.  [[Liquid-crystal display]]s often emit polarized light making them sometimes difficult to view with polarized sunglasses. Sunglasses may be worn just for aesthetic purposes, or simply to hide the eyes. Examples of sunglasses that were popular for these reasons include tea shades and [[Mirrorshades (fashion)|mirrorshades]]. Many [[blindness|blind]] people wear nearly opaque glasses to hide their eyes for cosmetic reasons.\n\nSunglasses may also have corrective lenses, which requires a prescription.  Clip-on sunglasses or sunglass clips can be attached to another pair of glasses.  Some wrap-around sunglasses are large enough to be worn over top of another pair of glasses.  Otherwise, many people opt to wear [[contact lens]]es to correct their vision so that standard sunglasses can be used.\n\n=== Mixed doubleframe ===\n[[File:Doubleframe uplifting eyewear - Nella.gif|thumb|left|Doubleframe eyewear with one set of lenses on the moving frame and another pair of lenses on a fixed frame (optional).]]\nThe double frame uplifting glasses have one moving frame with one pair of lenses and the basic fixed frame with another pair of lenses (optional), that are connected by [[four-bar linkage]]. For example, sun lenses could be easily lifted up and down while mixed with [[myopia]] lenses that always stay on. [[Presbyopia]] lenses could be also combined and easily removed from the field of view if needed without taking off glasses.\n\n=== 3D glasses ===\n{{Main|Stereoscopy#3D viewers|l1=3D Viewers}}\nThe [[Stereoscopy|illusion of three dimensions]] on a two-dimensional surface can be created by providing each eye with different visual information. 3D glasses create the illusion of three dimensions by filtering a signal containing information for both eyes.  The signal, often light reflected off a movie screen or emitted from an electronic display, is filtered so that each eye receives a slightly different image. The filters only work for the type of signal they were designed for.\n\n[[Anaglyph 3D]] glasses have a different colored filter for each eye, typically red and blue or red and green. A [[polarized 3D system]] on the other hand uses [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] filters. Polarized 3D glasses allow for color 3D, while the red-blue lenses produce an image with distorted coloration. An [[active shutter 3D system]] uses electronic [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]]. [[Head-mounted display]]s can filter the signal electronically and then transmit light directly into the viewer's eyes.\n\nAnaglyph and polarized glasses are distributed to audiences at [[3D film|3D movies]].  Polarized and active shutter glasses are used with many home theaters.  Head-mounted displays are used by a single person, but the input signal can be shared between multiple units.\n\n=== Magnification (bioptics) ===\nGlasses can also provide magnification that is useful for people with vision impairments or specific occupational demands.  An example would be ''[[Bioptics (device)|bioptics]]'' or  ''bioptic telescopes'' which have small [[telescope]]s mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses. Newer designs use smaller lightweight telescopes, which can be embedded into the corrective glass and improve aesthetic appearance (mini telescopic spectacles). They may take the form of self-contained glasses that resemble [[goggles]] or [[binoculars]], or may be attached to existing glasses.\n\n=== Yellow-tinted computer/gaming glasses ===\nYellow tinted glasses are a type of glasses with a minor yellow tint. They perform minor color correction, on top of reducing eyestrain due to lack of blinking. They may also be considered minor corrective unprescribed glasses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/blue-blocking-glasses-science-screens-not-destroying-vision-2017-2|title=Computer glasses that claim to protect your eyes from screens are selling like crazy, but they probably aren't doing you much good|last=Loria|first=Kevin|date=21 February 2017|website=Business Insider|accessdate=}}</ref> Depending on the company, these computer or gaming glasses can also filter out high energy blue and ultra-violet light from LCD screens, fluorescent lighting, and other sources of light.

The lenses are given an anti-glare coating to prevent reflections of light under different lighting conditions.

Lens blanks are cut to fit the shape of the frame that will hold them.  Frame styles vary and fashion trends change over time, resulting in a multitude of lens shapes.  For lower power lenses, there are few restrictions which allow for many trendy and fashionable shapes.  Higher power lenses can cause distortion of peripheral vision and may become thick and heavy if a large lens shape is used.  However, if the lens becomes too small, the field of view can be drastically reduced.\n\n[[Bifocals|Bifocal]], [[Trifocal lenses|trifocal]], and [[progressive lens]]es generally require a taller lens shape to leave room for the different segments while preserving an adequate field of view through each segment. Frames with rounded edges are the most efficient for correcting [[myopia|myopic]] prescriptions, with perfectly round frames being the most efficient. Before the advent of eyeglasses as a fashion item, when frames were constructed with only functionality in mind, virtually all eyeglasses were either round, oval, rectangular or curved octagons. It was not until glasses began to be seen as an accessory that different shapes were introduced to be more aesthetically pleasing than functional.\n\n== History == \n\n=== Precursors ===\n{{see|Reading stone}}\n[[File:Hugh specs.jpg|thumb|Detail of a portrait of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Cardinal and renowned biblical scholar [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] painted by [[Tommaso da Modena]] in 1352]]\n[[File:El Greco 048.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of cardinal [[Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara]] by [[El Greco]] circa 1600 shows glasses with temples passing over and beyond the ears]]\n\nScattered evidence exists for use of visual aid devices in Greek and Roman times, most prominently the use of an emerald by emperor Nero as mentioned by Pliny the Elder.<ref>The Natural History, Book 37, Chpt.16.

Ptolemy's description of lenses was commented upon and improved by [[Ibn Sahl (mathematician)|Ibn Sahl]] (10th century) and most notably by [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]] (''[[Book of Optics]]'', ca. 1021). [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Latin translations]] of Ptolemy's ''Optics'' and of Alhazen became available in Europe in the 12th century, coinciding with the development of \"[[reading stone]]s\".\n\n[[Robert Grosseteste]]'s treatise ''De iride'' (\"On the Rainbow\"), written between 1220 and 1235, mentions using optics to \"read the smallest letters at incredible distances\".<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Grant |editor1-first=Edward |title=A Source Book in Medieval Science |date=1974 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |page=389 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAPN_3w4hAUC&pg=PA389#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=9780674823600 }} From Grant's English translation of Robert Grosseteste's ''De Iride'' (On the rainbow) in Latin,  p. 389:  \"This part [viz, from Aristotle's supposed treatise on optics] of perspective, if perfectly understood, shows us how to make nearby objects appear very small, and how to make a small object placed at a distance appear as large as we wish, so that it would be possible to read minute letters from incredible distances or count sand, seeds, blades of grass, or any minute objects.\"</ref> A few years later in 1262, [[Roger Bacon]] is also known to have written on the magnifying properties of lenses.<ref>Bacon, Roger; Burke, Robert Belle, trans.

HIRSCHBERG theory is highly unlikely, as all previous experience has shown and contradicts analogies in cultural history and in the history of inventions in particular; Crystal spectacles appear in the European Middle Ages, in India, and in China, and from the historical point of view one can suppose from the outset that these inventions did not occur independently in each of these three cultural groups, but that a historical connection is here present.}} However, Joseph Needham showed that the mention of glasses in the Chinese manuscript Laufer used to justify the prior invention of them in Asia did not exist in older versions of that manuscript, and the reference to them in later versions was added during the Ming dynasty.<ref>{{cite web | title=Science and Civilization in China Vol 4.1 | pages=118\u2013119 | url=http://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf | accessdate=3 May 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823000519/https://monoskop.org/images/7/70/Needham_Joseph_Science_and_Civilisation_in_China_Vol_4-1_Physics_and_Physical_Technology_Physics.pdf | archive-date=23 August 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 Rishi Agarwal, in an article in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, states that [[Vyasatirtha]] was observed possession a pair of glasses in the 1520\u2019s, he argues that it: ''\"...is, therefore, most likely that the use of lenses reached Europe via the Arabs, as did [[Hindu mathematics]] and the ophthalmological works of the ancient Hindu surgeon [[Sushruta]]\"'',<ref>Agarwal, R.

Serious historians have from time to time produced evidence to suggest that others may have preceded him in the invention; however, a correspondence between [[George Whatley]] and [[John Fenno]], editor of ''[[The Gazette of the United States]]'', suggested that Franklin had indeed invented bifocals, and perhaps 50 years earlier than had been originally thought.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 'Inventor' of Bifocals?|publisher=The College of Optometrists|url=http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613044912/http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/knowledge-centre/museyeum/online_exhibitions/artgallery/bifocals.cfm|archivedate=13 June 2011}}</ref> The first lenses for correcting astigmatism were designed by the [[United Kingdom|British]] astronomer [[George Airy]] in 1825.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lucasianchair.org/19/airy.html|title=Sir George Biddell Airy|last=Bruen|first=Robert|work=The Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge University|publisher=Robert Bruen|accessdate=1 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOver time, the construction of frames for glasses also evolved. Early eyepieces were designed to be either held in place by hand or by exerting pressure on the nose (''[[pince-nez]]''). [[Girolamo Savonarola]] suggested that eyepieces could be held in place by a ribbon passed over the wearer's head, this in turn secured by the weight of a [[hat]]. The modern style of glasses, held by temples passing over the ears, was developed sometime before 1727, possibly by the British optician [[Edward Scarlett]]. These designs were not immediately successful, however, and various styles with attached handles such as \"[[scissors-glasses]]\" and [[lorgnette]]s were also fashionable from the second half of the 18th century and into the early 19th century.\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Moritz von Rohr]] and [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] (with the assistance of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.zeiss.com/C12567A100537AB9/Contents-Frame/6B49EEA709EAE719C1256919003DAE2B |title=Eyeglass Lenses and Visual Aids from Industrial Production |publisher= Zeiss | accessdate =2007-09-02}}</ref>), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, [[Joshua Silver]] designed eyewear with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/adspecs-eyeglasses-could-provide-sight-for-a-billion.html|title=Adspecs Eyeglasses Could Provide Sight for a Billion|work=TreeHugger}}</ref>\n\nDespite the increasing popularity of [[contact lenses]] and [[laser]] [[Refractive surgery|corrective eye surgery]], glasses remain very common, as their technology has improved. For instance, it is now possible to purchase frames made of special [[memory metal]] alloys that return to their correct shape after being bent. Other frames have spring-loaded hinges. Either of these designs offer dramatically better ability to withstand the stresses of daily wear and the occasional accident. Modern frames are also often made from strong, light-weight materials such as [[titanium]] alloys, which were not available in earlier times.\n\n===In fashion===\nIn the 1930s, \"spectacles\" were described as \"medical appliances.\"<ref name=\"pullin\">{{cite book | author = Pullin, Graham|display-authors=etal | date = 2009 | chapter = Fashion Meets Discretion | title = Design Meets Disability | location = Cambridge | publisher = MIT Press | pages = 13\u201364 | isbn = 9780262162555}}</ref> Wearing spectacles was sometimes considered socially humiliating. \nIn the 1970s, fashionable glasses started to become available through manufacturers, and governments also recognized the demand for stylized eyewear.<ref name=\"pullin\" />\n\nGraham Pullin describes how devices for disability, like glasses, have traditionally been designed to camouflage against the skin and restore ability without being visible.<ref name=\"pullin\" /> In the past, design for disability has \"been less about projecting a positive image as about trying not to project an image at all.\"<ref name=\"pullin\" /> Pullin uses the example of spectacles, traditionally categorized as a medical device for \"patients\", and outlines how they are now described as eyewear: a fashionable accessory.<ref name=\"pullin\" /> Much like other fashion designs and accessories, eyewear is created by designers, has reputable labels, and comes in collections, by season and designer.<ref name=\"pullin\" /> It is becoming more common for consumers to purchase eyewear with clear, non-prescription lenses, illustrating that glasses are no longer a social stigma, but a fashionable accessory that \"frames your face.\"<ref name=\"pullin\" />\n\n==Society and culture==\n\n===Market===\nThe market for spectacles has been characterized as having highly [[inelastic demand]], and advertising restrictions in the USA have correlated with higher prices, suggesting that adverts make the spectacles market more [[Price competition|price-competitive]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24100330 |doi=10.1086/466740|title=The Effects of Advertising on the Price of Eye Glasses|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|volume=15|issue=2|pages=337\u201352|year=<!--October or February, depending on source -->1972|last1=Benham|first1=Lee}}</ref> It may also be [[monopolistically competitive]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThere are claims that insufficiently free [[market competition]] inflates the prices of frames, which cost an average of $25-$50 US to make, to an average retail price of $300 in the United States.

This includes establishing international schools for expatriate children and promoting cultural understanding and exchanges. ISQ was the second of seven schools to be established under the International Schools Consortium. ISQ obtained licensing from the Qingdao Education Commission in June 1996 and the National Education Ministry on September 23, 1996.\n\nWhen ISQ began in the fall of 1996, there were eight students in kindergarten through fourth grade. The school was housed in three classrooms with an office and restrooms on the second floor of the back wing of the No. 1 Middle School of High Tech Park. The school grew to thirteen students by the end of the first academic year, and by the end of the second year, the growing student population necessitated that the school relocate. In August 1998, ISQ moved to the fourth floor of the Children's Club at the Qingdao Children's Activity Center, No. 6 Donghai Road. The steady increase in enrollment required the school once more to acquire more classroom and office space at the activity center.<ref name=\"Home Page\" />\n\nBecause of its continued growth, ISQ again relocated to a larger campus. ISQ started its 2007\u20132008 academic year on a new campus in the Laoshan district. Now, after two decades, ISQ is in our new campus located in the Licang District of Qingdao.

It is the only international school in Qingdao with its own, personal campus. The new facility boasts over 50 classrooms, an auditorium, two playgrounds, a soccer field, computer labs, video editing rooms, and a library.\n\n==Faculty and staff==\nISQ has over 70 faculty and staff members from ten different countries, which include the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[South Korea]] and [[South Africa]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe average tenure for our teachers at ISQ is 6.5 years and 49% of the faculty have a master's degree or higher, and some pursuing a master's while teaching.\n\n==Student body and class size==\nSince its establishment, ISQ's students have come from a wide variety of countries, including [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[The United Kingdom]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Singapore]], [[Russia]], the [[Philippines]], and [[New Zealand]].\n\nThe class sizes at ISQ are set as follows: \n* Pre-kindergarten - 14,\n* Junior-kindergarten - 16\n* Kindergarten - 18\n* First-fifth - 24\n* Sixth-twelfth - 25\n* ESL - 16\n\n===Secondary curriculum===\n\n=====English=====\nStudents in middle school take basic English classes for their respective grade level. Students in High School are required to obtain four English credits. ISQ offers two AP English classes: [[AP English Literature and Composition]] and [[AP English Language and Composition]].\n\n=====Foreign language=====\nAll students in grades 1-8 are required to study [[Chinese language|Chinese]] unless they require additional help in learning [[English language|English]]. In high school, students must obtain two credits of a foreign. ISQ previously offered [[Spanish language|Spanish]], but now only offers Chinese and [[Korean language|Korean]]. [[AP Chinese]] is offered, and Honors Chinese (for native speakers) is offered and considered the hardest Chinese course that ISQ offers (this is noted on a student's transcript).\n\n=====Mathematics=====\nIn middle school, students begin with either Math 6 and [[Pre-Algebra]] (depending on where they placed on a math evaluation), and by 8th grade will have progressed to either [[Algebra I]] or [[Geometry]]. In high school, students begin their freshmen year in either [[Geometry]] or [[Algebra II]]. For older high school students, [[Pre-Calculus]], [[Honors Pre-Calculus]], [[AP Calculus AB]], [[AP Calculus BC]], [[AP Statistics]], Intro to [[Statistics]], and Advanced [[Calculus]] are offered. Intro to [[Statistics]] is not offered every year, and Advanced Calculus is considered math course that IQ offers (this is noted on a student's transcript).\n\n=====Physical Education / Health=====\nStudents in grades 1-8  are required to take a general [[Physical Education]] class. Each grade of secondary is also required to take some variation of a traditional [[Health]] class. In high school, a total of two credits are required (0.5 for Health, and 1.5 for Physical Education). As of the 2019\u201320 school year, ISQ's Physical Education and Health classes have changed, and the two are somewhat integrated. Students have the option to obtain Physical Education credits through after-school athletics. 0.5 credits are earned if a students participates in three [[Junior Varsity]] sports in one school year, and 0.5 credits are earned if a student makes two [[Varsity team|Varsity]] sports in one school year. A student can earn a whole credit if three Varsity sports are achieved in one year.\n\n=====Science=====\nMiddle school students take a combination of integrated sciences \u2013 life, earth, and physical. For high school students, 3 credits of science are required, [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] are mandatory (to be taken in the Freshmen and Sophomore year respectively). [[Physics]] is optional for upperclassmen, in addition to optional [[AP Biology]], [[AP Chemistry]], and [[AP Physics]]. Sophomores may take [[AP Biology]]. AP Physics can also count for a student's math credit under certain conditions.\n\n=====Social studies=====\nThe middle school [[Social Studies]] curriculum includes a very entry-level study of [[World History]] and [[Geography]]. High school students must complete three credits of Social Studies, and one must be either [[AP Economics]] or [[Economics]] and [[Government]]. For freshmen, World History is required. Other high school students may choose between [[AP World History]], [[AP Economics]], [[Contemporary History]]/Culture, Science, and Identity.\n\n=====AP courses / honors courses=====\nISQ currently offers [[AP Calculus AB]], [[AP Calculus BC]], [[AP Biology]], [[AP Chemistry]], [[AP Statistics]], [[AP World History]], [[AP Economics]], [[AP Chinese]], [[AP English Literature and Composition]], [[AP English Language and Composition]], [[AP Computer Science Principles]], [[AP Computer Science A]], and [[AP Research]]. AP Laugnage and AP Literature are each offered every other year, and the same applies to the AP Computer Science classes. ISQ formerly offered [[AP Art History]] and. \n\nAdvanced Placement courses have been designed to provide an additional challenge for students wishing to learn more about a specific subject area. Courses are taught at the level of a university freshman course. Students will receive 0.66 additional grade points for grades of C- or higher. Students in AP classes receive more homework than they would receive in an honors course. Students taking AP courses are eligible to take College Board exams. Charges for this test are paid by the school. However, if a student chooses to take an AP test but is not in that AP course, he/she must pay the exam fee. AP courses require more homework than regular classes. Whereas a regular course requires an average of 2.5 hours of homework per week, AP courses require approximately 6 hours per week. \n\nDue to the rigorous requirements, ISQ has set limits on the amount of AP courses a student may take. Freshmen are only permitted to take AP Chinese, and only if they pass an entrance exam designed by ISQ's Chinese Department. Sophomores may choose between AP Biology, AP Statistics, AP Economics, and AP Chinese, AP World History, and whichever of the two computer science courses the school is offering that year. They can only chose two. Under special circumstances, a sophomore may be permitted to take an AP Calculus course. Upperclassmen are permitted to take any and all AP Courses, but only three per year. Under special circumstances, a student may take five, but only if they can keep all their individual class grades above 97%.\n\nHonors courses are also more rigorous and place higher demands on students. Students who take honors courses receive 0.33 additional grade points for grades of C- or higher. Unlike AP courses, honors courses are not subject to outside exams, and students are unable to use honors courses to apply for college credit.\n\n===Grading scale and grade point average===\nThe [[GPA]] scale used by the International School of Qingdao depends on the grade percentage attained in each class.<ref name=\"Qingdao MTI International School\">{{cite web|url=http://www.qmischina.com/uploads/docs/2008-2009%20Student%20Handbook.pdf|title=2008-2009 Student Handbook\u2014 Academic Information|year=2008|publisher=Qingdao MTI International School|accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

After first contact with Spaniards, they eventually became known as the [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]], a Spanish word similar to ''Chamori'', the name of the indigenous caste system's higher division.\n\nThe ancient people of the Marianas raised colonnades of megalithic capped pillars called [[latte stone]]s upon which they built their homes. The Spanish reported that by the time of their arrival, the largest of these were already in ruins, and that the Chamorros believed the ancestors who had erected the pillars lived in an era when people possessed supernatural abilities.\n\nIn 2013 archaeologists posited that the first people to settle in the Marianas may have made what was at that point the longest uninterrupted ocean-crossing voyage in human history.

He and his crew were the first Europeans to arrive in the Mariana Islands. He landed on Guam, the southernmost island of the Marianas, and claimed the archipelago for [[Spain]]. The Spanish ships were met offshore by the native Chamorros, who delivered refreshments and then helped themselves to a small boat belonging to Magellan's fleet. This led to a cultural clash: in Chamorro tradition, little property was private and taking something one needed, such as a boat for fishing, did not count as stealing. The Spanish did not understand this custom and fought the Chamorros until the boat was recovered. Three days after he had been welcomed on his arrival, Magellan fled the archipelago. Spain regarded the islands as annexed and later made them part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1565. In 1734, the Spanish built a royal palace, the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a)]], in Guam for the governor of the islands. Although the palace was largely destroyed during World War II portions of it remain.\n\nGuam operated as an important stopover between Manila and Mexico for [[galleons]] carrying gold between the Philippines and Spain.\n\nIn 1668, Father [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] renamed the islands ''Las Marianas'' in honor of his patroness the Spanish regent [[Mariana of Austria]] (1634\u20131696), widow of [[Philip IV of Spain|Felipe IV]] (reigned 1621\u20131655).\n\nMost of the islands' native population (90\u201395%)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Commonwealth-of-the-Northern-Mariana-Islands.html/ | title= Culture of Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands |publisher=EveryCulture.com |accessdate= September 17, 2007}}</ref> died from European diseases carried by the Spaniards or married non-Chamorro settlers under Spanish rule.

The Chamorro population gradually recovered, and Chamorro, [[Filipino language|Filipino]], and [[Carolinian language|Refaluwasch]] languages and other ethnic differences remain in the Marianas.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Spanish colonists forcibly moved the Chamorros to Guam, to encourage assimilation and conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]]. By the time they were allowed to return to the Northern Marianas, many Carolinians from present-day eastern [[Yap State]] and western [[Chuuk State]] had settled in the Marianas.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Both languages, as well as English, are now official in the commonwealth.\n\n====Carolinian immigration====\nThe Northern Marianas experienced an influx of immigration from the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] during the 19th century. Both this Carolinian subethnicity and Carolinians in the Carolines archipelago [[endonym|refer to themselves]] as the [[Refaluwasch]]. The indigenous Chamoru word for the same group of people is ''gu'palao''. They are usually referred to simply as \"Carolinians\", though unlike the other two monikers, this can also mean those who actually live in the Carolines and who may have no affiliation with the Marianas.\n\nThe conquering Spanish did not focus attempts at cultural suppression against Carolinian immigrants, whose immigration they allowed during a period when the indigenous Chamoru majority was being subjugated with land alienation, forced relocations and internment. Carolinians in the Marianas continue to be fluent in the [[Carolinian language]], and have maintained many of the cultural distinctions and traditions of their ethnicity's land of ancestral origin.<ref name=Cunningham1>\n{{cite book\n|last1= Cunningham|first1= Lawrence J.\n|title= Ancient Chamorro Society\n|date= 1992|publisher= Bess Press|pages= 193\u2013195\n|url= https://books.google.com/?id=9r0a2ww8KLcC&lpg=PA194&dq=spanish%20chamorro%20carolinian&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn= 9781880188057\n}}\n</ref>{{qn|date=August 2016}}\n\n===German possession and Japanese LoN mandate===\n{{Main|Spanish\u2013American War|Treaty of Paris (1898)|German New Guinea|South Seas Mandate}}\n[[File:Korean Cafe in Saipan.JPG|thumb|Saipan under the administration of [[Japanese Empire|Japan]]]]\nFollowing its loss during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] ceded Guam to the United States and sold the remainder of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] (i.e., the Northern Marianas), along with the Caroline Islands, to [[German Empire|Germany]] under the [[German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany administered the islands as part of its colony of [[German New Guinea]] and did little in terms of development.\n\nEarly in [[World War I]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] declared war on Germany and invaded the Northern Marianas. In 1919, the [[League of Nations]] (LoN) awarded all of Germany's islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] located north of the [[Equator]], including the Northern Marianas, under [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] to Japan. Under this arrangement, the Japanese thus administered the Northern Marianas as part of the [[South Seas Mandate]]. During the Japanese period, [[sugar cane]] became the main industry of the islands. [[Garapan]] on [[Saipan]] was developed as a regional capital, and numerous Japanese (including ethnic [[Korean people|Koreans]], [[Okinawa]]n, and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]) migrated to the islands. In the December 1939 census, the total population of the South Seas Mandate was 129,104, of whom 77,257 were Japanese (including ethnic Taiwanese and Koreans). On Saipan the pre-war population comprised 29,348 Japanese settlers and 3,926 Chamorro and Caroline Islanders; [[Tinian]] had 15,700 Japanese settlers (including 2,700 ethnic Koreans and 22 ethnic Chamorro).\n\n===World War II===\n{{further|Pacific Islands home front during World War II}}\nOn December 8, 1941, hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japanese forces from the Marianas launched an [[Battle of Guam (1941)|invasion of Guam]]. Chamorros from the Northern Marianas, which had been under Japanese rule for more than 20 years, were brought to Guam to assist the Japanese administration. This, combined with the harsh treatment of Guamanian Chamorros during the 31-month occupation, created a rift that would become the main reason Guamanians rejected the reunification referendum approved by the Northern Marianas in the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Marine infantrymen on Saipan.jpg|thumb|Marine infantrymen in [[Garapan]], Saipan]]\nOn June 15, 1944, the United States military invaded the Mariana Islands, starting the [[Battle of Saipan]], which ended on July 9.

[[Rota (island)|Rota]] was left untouched (and isolated) until the Japanese surrender in August 1945, owing to its military insignificance.\n\nThe war did not end for everyone with the signing of the armistice. The last group of [[Japanese holdout]]s surrendered on Saipan on December 1, 1945. On Guam, Japanese soldier [[Shoichi Yokoi]], unaware that the war had ended, hid in a jungle cave in the [[Talofofo]] area until 1972.\n\nJapanese nationals were eventually repatriated to the [[Japanese home islands]].\n\n===United States possession (UN trusteeship) ===\n{{see also|Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands}}\n[[File:saipan.jpg|right|thumb|The island of [[Saipan]]]]\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the Northern Marianas were administered by the United States pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]] as part of the [[United Nations]] [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], which gave responsibility for defense and foreign affairs to the United States.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Four referenda offering integration with Guam or changes to the islands' status were held in [[1958 Saipan integration referendum|1958]], [[1961 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1961]], [[1963 Northern Mariana Islands integration referendum|1963]] and [[1969 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1969]].

However, the CNMI is outside the customs territory of the United States and, although the internal revenue code does apply in the form of a local income tax, the income tax system is largely locally determined.

The [[District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands]] was established by [[act of Congress]] in 1977, and began operations in January 1978. The court sits on the island of [[Saipan]], but may sit other places within the commonwealth. The district court has the same jurisdiction as all other United States district courts, including diversity jurisdiction and [[bankruptcy]] jurisdiction. Appeals are taken to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]].\n\n==Citizenship==\nArticle III of the Covenant conferred [[United States citizenship]] on legally qualified CNMI residents, which generally included all citizens of the CNMI, and established U.S. [[birthright citizenship]] for persons born in the CNMI.<ref name=covenant />\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of the Northern Mariana Islands}}\n[[File:Pagan Island, Northern Marianas.jpg|thumb|[[Pagan Island]]]]\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands benefits from its trading relationship with the federal government of the United States and cheap trained labor from Asia. Historically, the CNMI's economy has relied on tourism, mostly from Japan, and on the [[garment]] manufacturing sector. The economy has declined since quotas were lifted in 2005, eventually leading all the garment factories on Saipan to close by February 2009. Tourism also declined after 2005 when [[Japan Airlines]] stopped serving the Marianas.<ref name=\"Business Law Handbook\">{{cite book |author=International Business Publications, USA |title=Northern Mariana Islands Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JO4zMchWSxoC&pg=PA41 |date=January 1, 2012 |publisher=Int'l Business Publications |isbn=978-1-4387-7068-0 |pages=41\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands had successfully used its position as a free trade area with the U.S., while at the same time not being subject to the same [[labor laws]]. For example, the $3.05 per hour minimum wage in the commonwealth, which lasted from 1997 to 2007, was lower than in the U.S. and some other worker protections are weaker, leading to lower production costs. That allowed garments to be labeled \"Made in USA\" without having to comply with all U.S. labor laws. However, the U.S. minimum wage law signed by [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] on May 25, 2007, resulted in stepped increases in the Northern Marianas' minimum wage, which allowed it to reach the U.S. level in 2015.<ref name=\"Vallejera\">{{cite news |author=Jayvee L.

[[Northern Marianas College]] is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] and offers a range of programs similar to other small U.S. [[community college]]s.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Chamorro performers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Chamorro people]]\nMuch of the Chamorro culture in the Mariana Islands was heavily influenced by the Spanish during the Spanish era, as well as by the Germans and Japanese. Respect is an important part of Chamorro culture, and one common display is the tradition of \"manngingi'\". This tradition has been around for centuries and involves an elder and a young Chamorro child. The child takes the hand of the elder, places it on their nose and says ''\u00f1ot'' to the men and ''\u00f1ora'' to the women with the elders responding ''diosti ayudi'', meaning \"God help you\".\n\nThe [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]] culture is very similar to the Chamorro culture with respect being very important. The Carolinian culture can be traced back to [[Yap]] and [[Chuuk Lagoon|Chuuk]], where the Carolinians originated.\n\n===Cuisine===\nMuch of Chamorro cuisine is influenced by various cultures. Examples of popular foods of foreign origin include various types of sweet or savory [[empanada]], originally introduced from Spain, and [[pancit]], a noodle dish from the Philippines.\n\nArcheological evidence reveals that rice has been cultivated in the Marianas since prehistoric times. Red rice made with achoti is a distinct staple food that strongly distinguishes Chamorro cuisine from that of other Pacific islands. It is commonly served for special events, such as parties (gupot or \"fiestas\"), novenas, and high school or college graduations. Fruits such as [[breadfruit|lemmai]] (breadfruit), [[mango|mangga]] (mangoes), [[coconut|niyok]] (coconuts), and [[Averrhoa bilimbi|bilimbines]] (bilimbi, a fruit related to [[starfruit]]) are included in various local recipes. Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and American cuisine are also commonly available.\n\nLocal specialities include [[kelaguen]], a dish in which meat is cooked in whole or in part by the action of [[citric acid]] rather than heat; tinaktak, a meat dish made with coconut milk; and k\u00e5'du fanihi (flying fox/fruit bat soup). Fruit bats have become scarce in modern times on several islands, primarily due to the overharvesting of the species and loss of habitat; hunting them is now illegal even though poaching still occurs.\n\nThe Marianas and the Hawaiian islands are the world's foremost consumers, per capita, of [[Spam (food)|Spam]], with Guam at the top of the list, and Hawaii second (details regarding the rest of the Marianas are often absent from statistics). Spam was introduced to the islands by the American military as war rations during the World War II era.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Northern Mariana Islands}}\nA small independent [[cinema of Northern Mariana Islands]], producing mostly documentary films, developed in the [[21st century]] thanks to the efforts of the Commonwealth and of the [[Northern Marianas College]]. Films had already been shot in the islands in the [[20th century]] by foreign producers.<ref name=\"Bill\">{{cite act|type=Bill|date=2011|legislature=Seventeenth Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature|title=Commonwealth Film & Media Amendment Act of 2011|url=http://www.cnmileg.gov.mp/documents/house/hse_bills/17/HB17-157.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, a new \u00a7 2151 of the Commonwealth Code established  within the Marianas Visitors Authority (MVA), a Commonwealth Film, Video and Media Office, also known as the Northern Mariana Islands Film Office, with the purpose of attracting foreign companies to produce movies in the Commonwealth and to develop a local cinema industry.<ref>{{cite act|type=Commonwealth Code|date=2002|article=2151|legislature=Northern Marianas Commonwealth Legislature|title=Commonwealth Film, Video and Media Office Established|url=https://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/cmc_section/T4/2151.pdf }}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nOwing to the Spanish [[missionaries]] in the Marianas, a large majority of Chamorros and Carolinians practice [[Roman Catholicism]], including the use of [[rosary|rosaries]] and [[novena]]s. The Japanese occupation had the effect of creating a sizable [[Buddhist]] community which remained even after their departure. Due to influence of the United States, diverse denominations of [[Protestantism]] also entered the islands.\n\n===Sports===\nTeam [[sports]] popular in the United States were introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands by American soldiers during World War II. [[Baseball]] is the islands' most popular sport. CNMI teams have made appearances in the [[Little League World Series]] (in the Little, Junior, Senior and Big league divisions) as well as winning gold medals in the [[Micronesian Games]] and [[South Pacific Games]].\n\n[[Basketball]] and [[mixed martial arts]] are also popular in the islands, which hosted the official 2009 [[Oceania Basketball Tournament]].

After first contact with Spaniards, they eventually became known as the [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]], a Spanish word similar to ''Chamori'', the name of the indigenous caste system's higher division.\n\nThe ancient people of the Marianas raised colonnades of megalithic capped pillars called [[latte stone]]s upon which they built their homes. The Spanish reported that by the time of their arrival, the largest of these were already in ruins, and that the Chamorros believed the ancestors who had erected the pillars lived in an era when people possessed supernatural abilities.\n\nIn 2013 archaeologists posited that the first people to settle in the Marianas may have made what was at that point the longest uninterrupted ocean-crossing voyage in human history.

He and his crew were the first Europeans to arrive in the Mariana Islands. He landed on Guam, the southernmost island of the Marianas, and claimed the archipelago for [[Spain]]. The Spanish ships were met offshore by the native Chamorros, who delivered refreshments and then helped themselves to a small boat belonging to Magellan's fleet. This led to a cultural clash: in Chamorro tradition, little property was private and taking something one needed, such as a boat for fishing, did not count as stealing. The Spanish did not understand this custom and fought the Chamorros until the boat was recovered. Three days after he had been welcomed on his arrival, Magellan fled the archipelago. Spain regarded the islands as annexed and later made them part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] in 1565. In 1734, the Spanish built a royal palace, the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a)]], in Guam for the governor of the islands. Although the palace was largely destroyed during World War II portions of it remain.\n\nGuam operated as an important stopover between Manila and Mexico for [[galleons]] carrying gold between the Philippines and Spain.\n\nIn 1668, Father [[Diego Luis de San Vitores]] renamed the islands ''Las Marianas'' in honor of his patroness the Spanish regent [[Mariana of Austria]] (1634\u20131696), widow of [[Philip IV of Spain|Felipe IV]] (reigned 1621\u20131655).\n\nMost of the islands' native population (90\u201395%)<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Commonwealth-of-the-Northern-Mariana-Islands.html/ | title= Culture of Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands |publisher=EveryCulture.com |accessdate= September 17, 2007}}</ref> died from European diseases carried by the Spaniards or married non-Chamorro settlers under Spanish rule.

The Chamorro population gradually recovered, and Chamorro, [[Filipino language|Filipino]], and [[Carolinian language|Refaluwasch]] languages and other ethnic differences remain in the Marianas.\n\nDuring the 17th century, Spanish colonists forcibly moved the Chamorros to Guam, to encourage assimilation and conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]]. By the time they were allowed to return to the Northern Marianas, many Carolinians from present-day eastern [[Yap State]] and western [[Chuuk State]] had settled in the Marianas.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Both languages, as well as English, are now official in the commonwealth.\n\n====Carolinian immigration====\nThe Northern Marianas experienced an influx of immigration from the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] during the 19th century. Both this Carolinian subethnicity and Carolinians in the Carolines archipelago [[endonym|refer to themselves]] as the [[Refaluwasch]]. The indigenous Chamoru word for the same group of people is ''gu'palao''. They are usually referred to simply as \"Carolinians\", though unlike the other two monikers, this can also mean those who actually live in the Carolines and who may have no affiliation with the Marianas.\n\nThe conquering Spanish did not focus attempts at cultural suppression against Carolinian immigrants, whose immigration they allowed during a period when the indigenous Chamoru majority was being subjugated with land alienation, forced relocations and internment. Carolinians in the Marianas continue to be fluent in the [[Carolinian language]], and have maintained many of the cultural distinctions and traditions of their ethnicity's land of ancestral origin.<ref name=Cunningham1>\n{{cite book\n|last1= Cunningham|first1= Lawrence J.\n|title= Ancient Chamorro Society\n|date= 1992|publisher= Bess Press|pages= 193\u2013195\n|url= https://books.google.com/?id=9r0a2ww8KLcC&lpg=PA194&dq=spanish%20chamorro%20carolinian&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|isbn= 9781880188057\n}}\n</ref>{{qn|date=August 2016}}\n\n===German possession and Japanese LoN mandate===\n{{Main|Spanish\u2013American War|Treaty of Paris (1898)|German New Guinea|South Seas Mandate}}\n[[File:Korean Cafe in Saipan.JPG|thumb|Saipan under the administration of [[Japanese Empire|Japan]]]]\nFollowing its loss during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] ceded Guam to the United States and sold the remainder of the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] (i.e., the Northern Marianas), along with the Caroline Islands, to [[German Empire|Germany]] under the [[German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany administered the islands as part of its colony of [[German New Guinea]] and did little in terms of development.\n\nEarly in [[World War I]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] declared war on Germany and invaded the Northern Marianas. In 1919, the [[League of Nations]] (LoN) awarded all of Germany's islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] located north of the [[Equator]], including the Northern Marianas, under [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] to Japan. Under this arrangement, the Japanese thus administered the Northern Marianas as part of the [[South Seas Mandate]]. During the Japanese period, [[sugar cane]] became the main industry of the islands. [[Garapan]] on [[Saipan]] was developed as a regional capital, and numerous Japanese (including ethnic [[Korean people|Koreans]], [[Okinawa]]n, and [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]]) migrated to the islands. In the December 1939 census, the total population of the South Seas Mandate was 129,104, of whom 77,257 were Japanese (including ethnic Taiwanese and Koreans). On Saipan the pre-war population comprised 29,348 Japanese settlers and 3,926 Chamorro and Caroline Islanders; [[Tinian]] had 15,700 Japanese settlers (including 2,700 ethnic Koreans and 22 ethnic Chamorro).\n\n===World War II===\n{{further|Pacific Islands home front during World War II}}\nOn December 8, 1941, hours after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japanese forces from the Marianas launched an [[Battle of Guam (1941)|invasion of Guam]]. Chamorros from the Northern Marianas, which had been under Japanese rule for more than 20 years, were brought to Guam to assist the Japanese administration. This, combined with the harsh treatment of Guamanian Chamorros during the 31-month occupation, created a rift that would become the main reason Guamanians rejected the reunification referendum approved by the Northern Marianas in the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Marine infantrymen on Saipan.jpg|thumb|Marine infantrymen in [[Garapan]], Saipan]]\nOn June 15, 1944, the United States military invaded the Mariana Islands, starting the [[Battle of Saipan]], which ended on July 9.

[[Rota (island)|Rota]] was left untouched (and isolated) until the Japanese surrender in August 1945, owing to its military insignificance.\n\nThe war did not end for everyone with the signing of the armistice. The last group of [[Japanese holdout]]s surrendered on Saipan on December 1, 1945. On Guam, Japanese soldier [[Shoichi Yokoi]], unaware that the war had ended, hid in a jungle cave in the [[Talofofo]] area until 1972.\n\nJapanese nationals were eventually repatriated to the [[Japanese home islands]].\n\n===United States possession (UN trusteeship) ===\n{{see also|Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands}}\n[[File:saipan.jpg|right|thumb|The island of [[Saipan]]]]\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the Northern Marianas were administered by the United States pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]] as part of the [[United Nations]] [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], which gave responsibility for defense and foreign affairs to the United States.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Four referenda offering integration with Guam or changes to the islands' status were held in [[1958 Saipan integration referendum|1958]], [[1961 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1961]], [[1963 Northern Mariana Islands integration referendum|1963]] and [[1969 Northern Mariana Islands status referendum|1969]].

In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated [http://cnmilaw.org/cnmicovenant.html Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America].

Like the other five delegates, he can participate in debates and vote in committee but has no vote on the floor of the House of Representatives; and has no role in the U.S. Senate, but is equal to a Senator when he serves on a conference committee.\n\nOn December 22, 1990, the [[United Nations Trusteeship Council]] terminated the TTPI as it applied to the CNMI and five other of the TTPI's original seven districts (the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Yap)), this was acknowledged in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] passed on the same day.\n\n[[File:TTPI High Court judges.jpg|thumb|TTPI High Court judges]]\nUnder the Covenant, in general, United States federal law applies to CNMI.

The [[District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands]] was established by [[act of Congress]] in 1977, and began operations in January 1978. The court sits on the island of [[Saipan]], but may sit other places within the commonwealth. The district court has the same jurisdiction as all other United States district courts, including diversity jurisdiction and [[bankruptcy]] jurisdiction. Appeals are taken to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]].\n\n==Citizenship==\nArticle III of the Covenant conferred [[United States citizenship]] on legally qualified CNMI residents, which generally included all citizens of the CNMI, and established U.S. [[birthright citizenship]] for persons born in the CNMI.<ref name=covenant />\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of the Northern Mariana Islands}}\n[[File:Pagan Island, Northern Marianas.jpg|thumb|[[Pagan Island]]]]\n\nThe Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands benefits from its trading relationship with the federal government of the United States and cheap trained labor from Asia. Historically, the CNMI's economy has relied on tourism, mostly from Japan, and on the [[garment]] manufacturing sector. The economy has declined since quotas were lifted in 2005, eventually leading all the garment factories on Saipan to close by February 2009. Tourism also declined after 2005 when [[Japan Airlines]] stopped serving the Marianas.<ref name=\"Business Law Handbook\">{{cite book |author=International Business Publications, USA |title=Northern Mariana Islands Business Law Handbook: Strategic Information and Laws |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JO4zMchWSxoC&pg=PA41 |date=January 1, 2012 |publisher=Int'l Business Publications |isbn=978-1-4387-7068-0 |pages=41\u201348}}</ref>\n\nThe Northern Mariana Islands had successfully used its position as a free trade area with the U.S., while at the same time not being subject to the same [[labor laws]]. For example, the $3.05 per hour minimum wage in the commonwealth, which lasted from 1997 to 2007, was lower than in the U.S. and some other worker protections are weaker, leading to lower production costs. That allowed garments to be labeled \"Made in USA\" without having to comply with all U.S. labor laws. However, the U.S. minimum wage law signed by [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] on May 25, 2007, resulted in stepped increases in the Northern Marianas' minimum wage, which allowed it to reach the U.S. level in 2015.<ref name=\"Vallejera\">{{cite news |author=Jayvee L.

[[Northern Marianas College]] is accredited by the [[Western Association of Schools and Colleges]] and offers a range of programs similar to other small U.S. [[community college]]s.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Chamorro performers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Chamorro people]]\nMuch of the Chamorro culture in the Mariana Islands was heavily influenced by the Spanish during the Spanish era, as well as by the Germans and Japanese. Respect is an important part of Chamorro culture, and one common display is the tradition of \"manngingi'\". This tradition has been around for centuries and involves an elder and a young Chamorro child. The child takes the hand of the elder, places it on their nose and says ''\u00f1ot'' to the men and ''\u00f1ora'' to the women with the elders responding ''diosti ayudi'', meaning \"God help you\".\n\nThe [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]] culture is very similar to the Chamorro culture with respect being very important. The Carolinian culture can be traced back to [[Yap]] and [[Chuuk Lagoon|Chuuk]], where the Carolinians originated.\n\n===Cuisine===\nMuch of Chamorro cuisine is influenced by various cultures. Examples of popular foods of foreign origin include various types of sweet or savory [[empanada]], originally introduced from Spain, and [[pancit]], a noodle dish from the Philippines.\n\nArcheological evidence reveals that rice has been cultivated in the Marianas since prehistoric times. Red rice made with achoti is a distinct staple food that strongly distinguishes Chamorro cuisine from that of other Pacific islands. It is commonly served for special events, such as parties (gupot or \"fiestas\"), novenas, and high school or college graduations. Fruits such as [[breadfruit|lemmai]] (breadfruit), [[mango|mangga]] (mangoes), [[coconut|niyok]] (coconuts), and [[Averrhoa bilimbi|bilimbines]] (bilimbi, a fruit related to [[starfruit]]) are included in various local recipes. Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and American cuisine are also commonly available.\n\nLocal specialities include [[kelaguen]], a dish in which meat is cooked in whole or in part by the action of [[citric acid]] rather than heat; tinaktak, a meat dish made with coconut milk; and k\u00e5'du fanihi (flying fox/fruit bat soup). Fruit bats have become scarce in modern times on several islands, primarily due to the overharvesting of the species and loss of habitat; hunting them is now illegal even though poaching still occurs.\n\nThe Marianas and the Hawaiian islands are the world's foremost consumers, per capita, of [[Spam (food)|Spam]], with Guam at the top of the list, and Hawaii second (details regarding the rest of the Marianas are often absent from statistics). Spam was introduced to the islands by the American military as war rations during the World War II era.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Northern Mariana Islands}}\nA small independent [[cinema of Northern Mariana Islands]], producing mostly documentary films, developed in the [[21st century]] thanks to the efforts of the Commonwealth and of the [[Northern Marianas College]].

The Japanese occupation had the effect of creating a sizable [[Buddhist]] community which remained even after their departure. Due to influence of the United States, diverse denominations of [[Protestantism]] also entered the islands.\n\n===Sports===\nTeam [[sports]] popular in the United States were introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands by American soldiers during World War II. [[Baseball]] is the islands' most popular sport. CNMI teams have made appearances in the [[Little League World Series]] (in the Little, Junior, Senior and Big league divisions) as well as winning gold medals in the [[Micronesian Games]] and [[South Pacific Games]].\n\n[[Basketball]] and [[mixed martial arts]] are also popular in the islands, which hosted the official 2009 [[Oceania Basketball Tournament]].

All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.<ref name=zeder2012/>\n\n[[Houseplant]]s and ornamentals are plants domesticated primarily for [[aesthetic]] enjoyment in and around the home, while those domesticated for large-scale food production are called crops. Domesticated plants deliberately altered or selected for special desirable characteristics are [[cultigens]]. Animals domesticated for home companionship are called [[pet]]s, while those domesticated for food or work are known as [[livestock]].\n\nThis [[Mutualism (biology)|biological mutualism]] is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the [[ant\u2013fungus mutualism]] that exists between [[leafcutter ants]] and certain fungi.<ref name=zeder2015/>\n\n[[Domestication syndrome]] is the suite of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=hammer1984/> The term is also applied to vertebrate animals, and includes increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.<ref name=wilkins2014/>\n\n==Cause and timing==\n[[File:Evolution of temperature in the Post-Glacial period according to Greenland ice cores (Younger Dryas).jpg|thumb|upright=2|Evolution of temperatures in the postglacial period, after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], showing very low temperatures for the most part of the Younger Dryas, rapidly rising afterwards to reach the level of the warm [[Holocene]], based on [[Greenland ice cores]].<ref name=Zalloua2017/>]]\n\nThe [[domestication of animals]] and plants was triggered by the climatic and environmental changes that occurred after the peak of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] around 21,000 years ago and which continue to this present day. These changes made obtaining food difficult. The first domesticate was the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') at least 15,000 years ago. The [[Younger Dryas]] that occurred 12,900 years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging strategies. By the beginning of the [[Holocene]] from 11,700 years ago, favorable climatic conditions and increasing human populations led to small-scale animal and plant domestication, which allowed humans to augment the food that they were obtaining through [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gathering]]. <ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe [[Neolithic transition]] led to agricultural societies emerging in locations across Eurasia, North Africa, and South and Central America. In the [[Fertile Crescent]] 10,000-11,000 years ago, [[zooarchaeology]] indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and [[taurine cattle]] were the first livestock to be domesticated. Two thousand years later, humped [[zebu]] cattle were domesticated in what is today [[Baluchistan]] in Pakistan. In [[East Asia]] 8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar that were genetically different from those found in the Fertile Crescent. The horse was domesticated on the Central Asian steppe 5,500 years ago. Both the chicken in Southeast Asia and the cat in Egypt were domesticated 4,000 years ago. <ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe sudden appearance of the [[domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') in the archaeological record then led to a rapid shift in the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], and [[demography]] of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=larson2014/> It was followed by livestock and crop domestication, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=fuller2011/><ref name=zeder2006/> Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=bocquet2011/> the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=barker2006/>\n\n==<span id=\"Animals\"></span>Animals==\n===Theory===\n{{main|Domestication of animals}}\n[[File:Harold f Weston - Iran7.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karakul sheep]]{{efn|This [[Central Asia]]n breed is ancient, dating perhaps to 1400&nbsp;BCE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/karakul/ |website=Breeds of Livestock\n|title=Karakul |publisher=[[Oklahoma State University]] |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}</ref>}} and shepherds in Iran.

Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of an individual animal, to reduce its natural avoidance of humans, and to tolerate the presence of humans. Domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition to respond calmly to human presence.<ref name=price2008/><ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=diamond2012/>\n\nCertain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics:<ref name=zeder2012/>{{rp|Fig 1}}<ref name=hale1969/><ref name=price1984/><ref name=price2002/>\n# The size and organization of their social structure\n# The availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates\n# The ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth\n# The degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and\n# Responses to humans and new environments, including reduced flight response and reactivity to external stimuli.\n\n===Mammals===\n{{main|Domestication of animals|List of domesticated animals}}\n\nThe beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted [[coevolution]]ary process with multiple stages along different pathways.<ref name=larson2014/> It is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., [[dogs]], [[cats]], [[fowl]], possibly [[pigs]]); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., [[sheep]], [[goats]], cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/><ref name=blaustein2015/><ref name=vahabi2015/><ref name=gepts2012/> The dog was the first domesticant,<ref name=larson2012/><ref name=perri2016/> and was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and before the domestication of other animals.<ref name=larson2012/> Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways.

It also involved the destruction, enslavement, or assimilation of other groups of early people who did not make such a transition.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boyden |first=Stephen Vickers |title=Biohistory: The interplay between human society and the biosphere, past and present |journal=Man and the Biosphere Series |volume=8 |date=1992 |issue=supplement 173 |page=665 |doi=10.1021/es00028a604 |bibcode=1992EnST...26..665.}}</ref>\n\n===On diversity===\n[[File:Wheat harvest.jpg|thumb|right|Industrialized wheat harvest \u2013 North America today]]\n{{further|Sustainable agriculture}}\n\nIn 2016, a study found that humans have had a major impact on global [[genetic diversity]] as well as extinction rates, including a contribution to megafaunal extinctions. Pristine landscapes no longer exist and have not existed for millennia, and humans have concentrated the planet's biomass into human-favored plants and animals. Domesticated ecosystems provide food, reduce predator and natural dangers, and promote commerce, but have also resulted in habitat loss and extinctions commencing in the Late Pleistocene. Ecologists and other researchers are advised to make better use of the archaeological and paleoecological data available for gaining an understanding the history of human impacts before proposing solutions.<ref name=boivin2016/>\n\n==See also==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Anthrozoology]]\n* [[Columbian Exchange]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Experimental evolution]]\n* [[Genetic engineering]]\n* [[Genetic erosion]]\n* [[Genomics of domestication]]\n* [[History of plant breeding]]\n* [[Marker assisted selection]]\n* [[Pet]]\n* [[Self-domestication]]\n* [[Timeline of agriculture and food technology]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=barker2006>Barker G. 2006.

Birds are also widely kept as [[cagebirds]], from [[songbirds]] to [[parrots]]. The longest established [[invertebrate]] domesticates are the [[honey bee]] and the [[silkworm]]. [[Land snail]]s are raised for food, while species from several phyla are kept for research, and others are bred for [[biological control]].\n\nThe domestication of plants began at least 12,000 years ago with [[cereal]]s in the [[Middle East]], and the [[bottle gourd]] in Asia.

All past definitions of domestication have included a relationship between humans with plants and animals, but their differences lay in who was considered as the lead partner in the relationship. This new definition recognizes a mutualistic relationship in which both partners gain benefits. Domestication has vastly enhanced the reproductive output of crop plants, livestock, and pets far beyond that of their wild progenitors. Domesticates have provided humans with resources that they could more predictably and securely control, move, and redistribute, which has been the advantage that had fueled a population explosion of the agro-pastoralists and their spread to all corners of the planet.<ref name=zeder2012/>\n\n[[Houseplant]]s and ornamentals are plants domesticated primarily for [[aesthetic]] enjoyment in and around the home, while those domesticated for large-scale food production are called crops. Domesticated plants deliberately altered or selected for special desirable characteristics are [[cultigens]]. Animals domesticated for home companionship are called [[pet]]s, while those domesticated for food or work are known as [[livestock]].\n\nThis [[Mutualism (biology)|biological mutualism]] is not restricted to humans with domestic crops and livestock but is well-documented in nonhuman species, especially among a number of social insect domesticators and their plant and animal domesticates, for example the [[ant\u2013fungus mutualism]] that exists between [[leafcutter ants]] and certain fungi.<ref name=zeder2015/>\n\n[[Domestication syndrome]] is the suite of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] traits arising during domestication that distinguish crops from their wild ancestors.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=hammer1984/> The term is also applied to vertebrate animals, and includes increased docility and tameness, coat color changes, reductions in tooth size, changes in craniofacial morphology, alterations in ear and tail form (e.g., floppy ears), more frequent and nonseasonal estrus cycles, alterations in [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] levels, changed concentrations of several neurotransmitters, prolongations in juvenile behavior, and reductions in both total brain size and of particular brain regions.<ref name=wilkins2014/>\n\n==Cause and timing==\nThe [[domestication of animals]] and plants was triggered by the climatic and environmental changes that occurred after the peak of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] around 21,000 years ago and which continue to this present day. These changes made obtaining food difficult. The first domesticate was the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus'') at least 15,000 years ago. The [[Younger Dryas]] that occurred 12,900 years ago was a period of intense cold and aridity that put pressure on humans to intensify their foraging strategies. By the beginning of the [[Holocene]] from 11,700 years ago, favorable climatic conditions and increasing human populations led to small-scale animal and plant domestication, which allowed humans to augment the food that they were obtaining through [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gathering]]. <ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe [[Neolithic transition]] led to agricultural societies emerging in locations across Eurasia, North Africa, and South and Central America. In the [[Fertile Crescent]] 10,000-11,000 years ago, [[zooarchaeology]] indicates that goats, pigs, sheep, and [[taurine cattle]] were the first livestock to be domesticated. Two thousand years later, humped [[zebu]] cattle were domesticated in what is today [[Baluchistan]] in Pakistan. In [[East Asia]] 8,000 years ago, pigs were domesticated from wild boar that were genetically different from those found in the Fertile Crescent. The horse was domesticated on the Central Asian steppe 5,500 years ago. Both the chicken in Southeast Asia and the cat in Egypt were domesticated 4,000 years ago. <ref name=McHugo2019/>\n\nThe sudden appearance of the [[domestic dog]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') in the archaeological record then led to a rapid shift in the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], and [[demography]] of both humans and numerous species of animals and plants.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=larson2014/> It was followed by livestock and crop domestication, and the transition of humans from foraging to farming in different places and times across the planet.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=fuller2011/><ref name=zeder2006/> Around 10,000 YBP, a new way of life emerged for humans through the management and exploitation of plant and animal species, leading to higher-density populations in the centers of domestication,<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=bocquet2011/> the expansion of agricultural economies, and the development of urban communities.<ref name=machugh2016/><ref name=barker2006/>\n\n==<span id=\"Animals\"></span>Animals==\n===Theory===\n{{main|Domestication of animals}}\n[[File:Harold f Weston - Iran7.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karakul sheep]]{{efn|This [[Central Asia]]n breed is ancient, dating perhaps to 1400&nbsp;BCE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/sheep/karakul/ |website=Breeds of Livestock\n|title=Karakul |publisher=[[Oklahoma State University]] |accessdate=October 2, 2017}}</ref>}} and shepherds in Iran.

He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious [[selective breeding]] in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]] or from selection on other traits.<ref name=darwin1868/><ref name=diamond2007/><ref name=larson2014b/>\n\nThere is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.<ref name=olsen2013/><ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or [[Landrace|regional populations]].<ref name=doust2014/><ref name=larson2014/><ref name=meyer2013/>\n\n''Domestication'' of animals should not be confused with [[tame animal|''taming'']]. Taming is the conditioned behavioral modification of an individual animal, to reduce its natural avoidance of humans, and to tolerate the presence of humans. Domestication is the permanent genetic modification of a bred lineage that leads to an inherited predisposition to respond calmly to human presence.<ref name=price2008/><ref name=macdonald2009/><ref name=diamond2012/>\n\nCertain animal species, and certain individuals within those species, make better candidates for domestication than others because they exhibit certain behavioral characteristics:<ref name=zeder2012/>{{rp|Fig 1}}<ref name=hale1969/><ref name=price1984/><ref name=price2002/>\n# The size and organization of their social structure\n# The availability and the degree of selectivity in their choice of mates\n# The ease and speed with which the parents bond with their young, and the maturity and mobility of the young at birth\n# The degree of flexibility in diet and habitat tolerance; and\n# Responses to humans and new environments, including reduced flight response and reactivity to external stimuli.\n\n===Mammals===\n{{main|Domestication of animals|List of domesticated animals}}\n\nThe beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted [[coevolution]]ary process with multiple stages along different pathways.<ref name=larson2014/> It is proposed that there were three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., [[dogs]], [[cats]], [[fowl]], possibly [[pigs]]); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., [[sheep]], [[goats]], cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel).<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/><ref name=zeder2012/><ref name=frantz2015b/><ref name=blaustein2015/><ref name=vahabi2015/><ref name=gepts2012/> The dog was the first domesticant,<ref name=larson2012/><ref name=perri2016/> and was established across [[Eurasia]] before the end of the [[Late Pleistocene]] era, well before [[Agriculture|cultivation]] and before the domestication of other animals.<ref name=larson2012/> Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified, leading eventually to a formalised [[animal husbandry]].<ref name=larson2014/> Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they took place over much longer time frames.<ref name=larson2013/>\n\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.<ref name=serpell2014/><ref name=cagan2016/> The archaeological and genetic data suggest that long-term bidirectional [[gene flow]] between wild and domestic stocks \u2013 including [[donkey]]s, [[horse]]s, New and Old World [[camelid]]s, [[goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[pig]]s \u2013 was common.<ref name=larson2014/><ref name=marshall2014/> One study has concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars into pigs and created [[domestication islands]] in the genome.

Captive and domesticated animals often have smaller size, [[piebald]] color, shorter faces with smaller and fewer teeth, diminished horns, weak muscle ridges, and less genetic variability.  Poor joint definition, late fusion of the limb bone [[epiphysis|epiphyses]] with the diaphyses, hair changes, greater fat accumulation, smaller brains, simplified behavior patterns, extended immaturity, and more pathology are among the defects of domestic animals.  All of these changes have been documented by archaeological evidence, and confirmed by animal breeders in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Berry |first=R.J. |chapter=The Genetical Implications of Domestication in Animals |editor1=Ucko, Peter J. |editor2=Dimbleby, G.W. |title=The Domestication and Exploitation of Plants and Animals |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago |date=1969 |pages=207\u201317}}</ref> In 2014, a study proposed the theory that under selection, docility in mammals and birds results partly from a slowed pace of [[neural crest]] development, that would in turn cause a reduced fear\u2013startle response due to mild [[neurocristopathy]] that causes domestication syndrome. The theory was unable to explain curly tails nor domestication syndrome exhibited by plants.<ref name=wilkins2014/>\n\nA side effect of domestication has been [[zoonotic]] diseases. For example, cattle have given humanity various [[Poxviridae|viral poxes]], [[measles]], and [[tuberculosis]]; pigs and ducks have given [[influenza]]; and horses have given the [[rhinovirus]]es.

They claim that this kind of domestication demands a totalitarian relationship with both the land and the plants and animals being domesticated. They say that whereas, in a state of wildness, all life shares and competes for resources, domestication destroys this balance. Domesticated landscape (e.g. pastoral lands/agricultural fields and, to a lesser degree, [[horticulture]] and [[gardening]]) ends the open sharing of resources; where \"this was everyone's\", it is now \"mine\". Anarcho-primitivists state that this notion of ownership laid the foundation for social [[hierarchy]] as property and power emerged. It also involved the destruction, enslavement, or assimilation of other groups of early people who did not make such a transition.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Boyden |first=Stephen Vickers |title=Biohistory: The interplay between human society and the biosphere, past and present |journal=Man and the Biosphere Series |volume=8 |date=1992 |issue=supplement 173 |page=665 |doi=10.1021/es00028a604 |bibcode=1992EnST...26..665.}}</ref>\n\n===On diversity===\n[[File:Wheat harvest.jpg|thumb|right|Industrialized wheat harvest \u2013 North America today]]\n{{further|Sustainable agriculture}}\n\nIn 2016, a study found that humans have had a major impact on global [[genetic diversity]] as well as extinction rates, including a contribution to megafaunal extinctions. Pristine landscapes no longer exist and have not existed for millennia, and humans have concentrated the planet's biomass into human-favored plants and animals. Domesticated ecosystems provide food, reduce predator and natural dangers, and promote commerce, but have also resulted in habitat loss and extinctions commencing in the Late Pleistocene. Ecologists and other researchers are advised to make better use of the archaeological and paleoecological data available for gaining an understanding the history of human impacts before proposing solutions.<ref name=boivin2016/>\n\n==See also==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Anthrozoology]]\n* [[Columbian Exchange]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Experimental evolution]]\n* [[Genetic engineering]]\n* [[Genetic erosion]]\n* [[Genomics of domestication]]\n* [[History of plant breeding]]\n* [[Marker assisted selection]]\n* [[Pet]]\n* [[Self-domestication]]\n* [[Timeline of agriculture and food technology]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=barker2006>Barker G. 2006.

They lost their first game on January 25 when the Madison All-Stars beat them 17\u20137. They got their first win five days later when they defeated the Milwaukee Winter Club 10\u20138.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe next year the team was sold by the original owner Reed Fansher to a group of investors. One of the investors, Erwin J. Merar, owned an appliance store. The team was renamed the \"Admirals\" after [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|a brand of household appliances]] sold in Merar's store.<ref>http://news.sportslogos.net/2019/11/22/milwaukee-admirals-celebrate-refrigerators-with-50th-season-logo/</ref>\n\nBeginning with the [[1973 in sports#Ice hockey|1973]]\u2013[[1974 in sports#Ice hockey|74]] season the Admirals joined the [[United States Hockey League]]. Their first season in a league was not particularly successful as they ended the season in last place in their division. They won only 11 games, lost 35, and tied two games that season.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Admirals won the USHL league championship in [[1976 in sports#Ice hockey|1976]], winning seven straight games in the league's playoffs. In the off-season, the team was purchased by former [[Chicago Blackhawks]] announcer [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFor the [[1977 in sports#Ice hockey|1977]]\u2013[[1978 in sports#Ice hockey|78]] season the Admirals joined the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] as the USHL was becoming a strictly amateur league. The Admirals appeared in the IHL's Turner Cup finals only once ([[1983 in sports#Ice hockey|1983]]), where they lost to Toledo in six games.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThey stayed a part of the IHL until it joined the [[American Hockey League]] for the [[2001 in sports#Ice hockey|2001]]\u2013[[2002 in sports#Ice hockey|02]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hockeydb.com/stte/milwaukee-admirals-6842.html|title=Milwaukee Admirals hockey team [AHL] statistics and history at hockeydb.com|website=www.hockeydb.com|access-date=2016-03-28}}</ref> season when the IHL ceased operations. Five other IHL franchises also joined the AHL that season. The team was allowed to keep their nickname despite the presence of the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]] in the AHL, as Milwaukee has had the nickname since 1977, well before the Norfolk team was established as the [[Hampton Roads Admirals]] in the [[ECHL]]. In the 2015-16 season, Norfolk moved to the AHL's Pacific Division as the newest incarnation of the [[San Diego Gulls]].\n\n[[File:DSC 0879 (26668742198).jpg|thumb|left|2003-04 Admirals with the Calder Cup]]\n\nThey won their first Calder Cup in 2004 when they defeated the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]]. Prior to the finals, Milwaukee needed seven games to defeat the [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]] in the first round. Then the Admirals defeated the [[Chicago Wolves]] in six games to advance to the conference finals. The Admirals then eliminated the [[Rochester Americans]] four games to one. Milwaukee went on to sweep the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]] to win the Calder Cup. The Admirals completed a rare postseason run in which they needed one fewer games to eliminate their opponents in each subsequent series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theahl.com/championship-players-s11575 |title=Calder Cup Champions - Players {{!}} AHL |website=theahl.com |access-date=2016-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227101122/http://theahl.com/championship-players-s11575 |archivedate=2010-02-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe Admirals were purchased in June 2005 by a group of investors, led by Harris J.

They lost their first game on January 25 when the Madison All-Stars beat them 17\u20137. They got their first win five days later when they defeated the Milwaukee Winter Club 10\u20138.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe next year the team was sold by the original owner Reed Fansher to a group of investors. One of the investors, Erwin J. Merar, owned an appliance store. The team was renamed the \"Admirals\" after [[Admiral (electrical appliances)|a brand of household appliances]] sold in Merar's store.<ref>http://news.sportslogos.net/2019/11/22/milwaukee-admirals-celebrate-refrigerators-with-50th-season-logo/</ref>\n\nBeginning with the [[1973 in sports#Ice hockey|1973]]\u2013[[1974 in sports#Ice hockey|74]] season the Admirals joined the [[United States Hockey League]]. Their first season in a league was not particularly successful as they ended the season in last place in their division. They won only 11 games, lost 35, and tied two games that season.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe Admirals won the USHL league championship in [[1976 in sports#Ice hockey|1976]], winning seven straight games in the league's playoffs. In the off-season, the team was purchased by former [[Chicago Blackhawks]] announcer [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nFor the [[1977 in sports#Ice hockey|1977]]\u2013[[1978 in sports#Ice hockey|78]] season the Admirals joined the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] as the USHL was becoming a strictly amateur league.

Five other IHL franchises also joined the AHL that season. The team was allowed to keep their nickname despite the presence of the [[Norfolk Admirals (AHL)|Norfolk Admirals]] in the AHL, as Milwaukee has had the nickname since 1977, well before the Norfolk team was established as the [[Hampton Roads Admirals]] in the [[ECHL]].

Prior to the finals, Milwaukee needed seven games to defeat the [[Cincinnati Mighty Ducks]] in the first round. Then the Admirals defeated the [[Chicago Wolves]] in six games to advance to the conference finals. The Admirals then eliminated the [[Rochester Americans]] four games to one. Milwaukee went on to sweep the [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins]] to win the Calder Cup. The Admirals completed a rare postseason run in which they needed one fewer games to eliminate their opponents in each subsequent series.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theahl.com/championship-players-s11575 |title=Calder Cup Champions - Players {{!}} AHL |website=theahl.com |access-date=2016-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227101122/http://theahl.com/championship-players-s11575 |archivedate=2010-02-27 }}</ref>\n\nThe Admirals were purchased in June 2005 by a group of investors, led by Harris J.
