Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Magikarp first appeared in the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and subsequent sequels. They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the [[Fish]] [[Pok\u00e9mon]], Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, especially lakes, rivers, and ponds. Magikarp is especially well known from the popular mobile game [[Pok\u00e9mon Go]], where it\u2019s featured as a starter Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n==Description==\n\nMagikarp is a red, medium-sized fish. Its notable characteristics include large, heavy scales. Its fins are primarily white, but it has a stiff, three-pointed fin on its back and, a four-pointed fin on its stomach which are both yellow. The shape of the dorsal fin resembles a crown, leading to its Japanese name ''Koiking''. It also has long [[barbels]], which are white on females and tan on males. Although this Pok\u00e9mon is capable of surviving in even the most polluted ponds,<ref name=\"MagikarpSapphire\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|sapphire|Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy Pok\u00e9mon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.}}</ref> it is usually overlooked by trainers because it is pathetically weak.<ref name=\"MagikarpDiamond\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|diamond|It is said to be the world's weakest Pok\u00e9mon. No one knows why it has managed to survive.}}</ref> Even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around. They are normally seen using Splash, which is unusual, as it makes them easy targets to [[predator]]s.<ref name=\"MagikarpSilver\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|silver|For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like Pidgeotto to catch it mid-jump.}}</ref> Before the species multiplied, it is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than the Magikarp seen today,<ref name=\"MagikarpRed\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|red|In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s that exist today.}}</ref> and this belief has led scientists to research this species.<ref name=\"MagikarpRuby\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|ruby|Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pok\u00e9mon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.}}</ref> Long-lived Magikarp are able to utilize their immense splashing power to leap high enough to jump mountains.<ref name=\"MagikarpPlatinum\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|Platinum|A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.}}</ref> Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds.<ref name=\"MagikarpYellow\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|yellow|Famous for being very unreliable. It can be found swimming in seas, lakes, rivers and shallow puddles.}}</ref> It is not a strong swimmer, and currents in the water will sweep it downstream.<ref name=\"MagikarpCrystal\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|crystal|This Pok\u00e9mon gets easily pushed along rivers when there are strong currents. It is very hard to evolve.}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of Magikarp evolving into Gyarados is loosely based on the Chinese mythological tale of the [[Asian carp#In Chinese culture|Carps leaping over the Dragon Gate]]. According to the legend, carps that leap over a legendary waterfall, referred to as the Dragon Gate, are transformed into dragons.\n\nMagikarp has drawn comparisons to [[Feebas]]; however, the latter is usually regarded higher in the gaming community because it can learn far more moves than Magikarp in the Pok\u00e9mon games.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nIn the video game series, Magikarp is seen commonly when fishing with an Old or Good Rod. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|their remakes]], an [[Non-player character|NPC]] will sell the player a Magikarp. A similar character appears in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']]. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], Magikarp appear flopping around in a dried up lake. Outside of the main series, in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'', Magikarp featured in its own mini game called \"Magikarp Splash\", in which players must Splash high enough to hit the button at the top of the screen as many times as it can. A mobile video game, called ''Pok\u00e9mon: Magikarp Jump'', was announced in February 2017 under the title ''Splash! Magikarp'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Funnell|first1=Rob|title='Splash!

Created by [[Ken Sugimori]], Magikarp first appeared in the video games [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']] and subsequent sequels. They have later appeared in various merchandise, spinoff titles and animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. Known as the [[Fish]] [[Pok\u00e9mon]], Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, especially lakes, rivers, and ponds. Magikarp is especially well known from the popular mobile game [[Pok\u00e9mon Go]], where it\u2019s featured as a starter Pok\u00e9mon.\n\n==Description==\n\nMagikarp is a red, medium-sized fish. Its notable characteristics include large, heavy scales. Its fins are primarily white, but it has a stiff, three-pointed fin on its back and, a four-pointed fin on its stomach which are both yellow. The shape of the dorsal fin resembles a crown, leading to its Japanese name ''Koiking''. It also has long [[barbels]], which are white on females and tan on males. Although this Pok\u00e9mon is capable of surviving in even the most polluted ponds,<ref name=\"MagikarpSapphire\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|sapphire|Magikarp is virtually useless in battle as it can only splash around. As a result, it is considered to be weak. However, it is actually a very hardy Pok\u00e9mon that can survive in any body of water no matter how polluted it is.}}</ref> it is usually overlooked by trainers because it is pathetically weak.<ref name=\"MagikarpDiamond\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|diamond|It is said to be the world's weakest Pok\u00e9mon. No one knows why it has managed to survive.}}</ref> Even in the heat of battle it will do nothing but flop around. They are normally seen using Splash, which is unusual, as it makes them easy targets to [[predator]]s.<ref name=\"MagikarpSilver\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|silver|For no reason, it jumps and splashes about, making it easy for predators like Pidgeotto to catch it mid-jump.}}</ref> Before the species multiplied, it is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than the Magikarp seen today,<ref name=\"MagikarpRed\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|red|In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak [[Lineal descendant|descendant]]s that exist today.}}</ref> and this belief has led scientists to research this species.<ref name=\"MagikarpRuby\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|ruby|Magikarp is a pathetic excuse for a Pok\u00e9mon that is only capable of flopping and splashing. This behavior prompted scientists to undertake research into it.}}</ref> Long-lived Magikarp are able to utilize their immense splashing power to leap high enough to jump mountains.<ref name=\"MagikarpPlatinum\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|Platinum|A Magikarp living for many years can leap a mountain using Splash. The move remains useless, though.}}</ref> Magikarp is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds.<ref name=\"MagikarpYellow\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|yellow|Famous for being very unreliable. It can be found swimming in seas, lakes, rivers and shallow puddles.}}</ref> It is not a strong swimmer, and currents in the water will sweep it downstream.<ref name=\"MagikarpCrystal\">{{Pok\u00e9dex|crystal|This Pok\u00e9mon gets easily pushed along rivers when there are strong currents. It is very hard to evolve.}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of Magikarp evolving into Gyarados is loosely based on the Chinese mythological tale of the [[Asian carp#In Chinese culture|Carps leaping over the Dragon Gate]]. According to the legend, carps that leap over a legendary waterfall, referred to as the Dragon Gate, are transformed into dragons.\n\nMagikarp has drawn comparisons to [[Feebas]]; however, the latter is usually regarded higher in the gaming community because it can learn far more moves than Magikarp in the Pok\u00e9mon games.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nIn the video game series, Magikarp is seen commonly when fishing with an Old or Good Rod. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|''Pok\u00e9mon Red'' and ''Blue'']], and [[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|their remakes]], an [[Non-player character|NPC]] will sell the player a Magikarp. A similar character appears in [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|''Pok\u00e9mon Black'' and ''White'']]. In [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|''Pok\u00e9mon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']], Magikarp appear flopping around in a dried up lake. Outside of the main series, in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'', Magikarp featured in its own mini game called \"Magikarp Splash\", in which players must Splash high enough to hit the button at the top of the screen as many times as it can. A mobile video game, called ''Pok\u00e9mon: Magikarp Jump'', was announced in February 2017 under the title ''Splash! Magikarp'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Funnell|first1=Rob|title='Splash!

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.]<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

L'Enfant died before the work was completed, which required Banneker to carry on in his stead.<ref name=Defender>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepearlofomega.org/Resources/Documents/The%20Dial,%20Ch%20iDefender,%202-16-29.pdf|format=PDF|title=Howard U Gets Memorial to Benjamin Banneker |work=Chicago, Illinois: [[The Chicago Defender]] (National edition)|date=1929-02-16 |page=A1 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] Historical Newspapers |accessdate=2017-11-09|via=[http://www.thepearlofomega.org The Pearl of Omega]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109123630/http://www.thepearlofomega.org/Resources/Documents/The%20Dial,%20Ch%20iDefender,%202-16-29.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, as a book that won the 1917 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] had earlier reported, L'Enfant lived long after he developed his plan for the federal capital city.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970|first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi|url-access=registration|title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital|work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395|oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19|quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.]<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers.
