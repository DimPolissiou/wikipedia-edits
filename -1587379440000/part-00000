That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Squad==\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Cotroneo|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''3''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Francesco Modesto]]''<ref>loaned out on Winter.</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=ITA|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=ITA|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=CMR|name=''[[Frank Oliver Ongfiang]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=14|nat=ITA|name=Rocco D'Aiello|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=16|nat=ITA|name=Pietro Balistreri|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''18''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Franco Brienza]]''<ref> Loaned out</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=ITA|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=19|nat=ITA|name=Daniele Zito|pos=DF}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=''21''|nat=ROU|name=''[[Paul Codrea]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]<ref>Transfered In </ref>|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=ITA|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=''23''|nat=ITA|name=''[[Ighli Vannucchi]]''<ref>Loaned out.</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=24|nat=NGA|name=John Olufemi|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=SLE|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=ITA|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|name=Michele Trionfante|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ROU|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=BRA|name=[[Jedaias Capucho Neves|Jeda]]<ref>Transfered In on Winter</ref>|pos=FW}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|name=Marco Fina|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=46|nat=ITA|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=51|nat=ITA|name=Vincenzo Giannusa|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=79|nat=ITA|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=81|nat=ITA|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF}}\n{{fs player|no=82|nat=ITA|name=Nicola Milano|pos=MF}}\n{{fs player|no=84|nat=ITA|name=Paolo Comi|pos=GK}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n===Transfers===\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;width:99%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |In\n|-\n! width=3% |Pos.\n! width=33% |Name\n! width=28% |from\n! width=36% |Type\n|-\n|GK ||[[Gianluca Berti]] ||Empoli ||\n|-\n|GK ||Paolo Comi ||Monza ||\n|-\n|DF ||[[Michele Ferri]] ||[[A.C.

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots.

He went on to serve in southern Russia and the Middle East postwar.<ref name=\"Samuel Kinkead Biography\">[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/safrica/kinkead.php Samuel Kinkead Biography]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKinked was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South African Republic]],<ref name=\"Samuel Kinked Biography\"/> to an Irish father and Scottish mother who had recently emigrated there. He was the second son, with an elder brother named Thompson Calder Kinkead, born circa 1893.\n\nSamuel Kinkead joined the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] in September 1915. He took pilot training at Eastbourne in South Africa. He earned his wings by the end of 1915.\n\n==First World War==\nSamuel Kinkead served in 2 Wing RNAS during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. While flying a [[Bristol Scout]], he shot down a Fokker on 11 August 1916. He also scored on 28 August 1916 while flying a [[Nieuport]], and was credited with a third victory while flying a Nieuport.\n\nHe fell ill with a serious case of malaria and was shipped home to convalesce. Upon recovery, he was forwarded to England, where his older brother Thompson was training as a pilot in the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. While on his second solo flight on 3 September 1917, Thompson died in a crash at Shoreham. Samuel signed for his deceased brother's personal effects.\n\nSamuel Kinkead was assigned to 1 Naval Squadron to fly Nieuports on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Exactly two weeks after his brother's death, on 17 September 1917, he drove down a [[Deutsche Flugzeug-Werke|DFW]] two-seater out of control. A month later, he repeated the feat to become an ace. He went on to claim three more triumphs in October.\n\nIn November and December 1917, he downed three planes each. In mid November, he switched 'birds' to fly a [[Sopwith Camel]], the type of plane he would fly through war's end. Then, with his tally at 14, he went on hiatus for three months. During this time, on 22 February, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (DSC).\n\nIn March, 1918, he started accumulating victories by ones and twos, finishing up May with his total at 26. Most of the time, he drove enemy craft out of the fight; he reported few destroyed. However, he received a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSC on 26 April 1918. Then, on 30 May, he broke his string again, this time for two months.\n\nHe scored on each of the last three days of July, and four times in August, bringing his total to 33. He had become the leading ace out of the 18 in his squadron, now renumbered 201 Squadron when it was folded into the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]]. On 3 August, he received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC). On 2 November, he was awarded a Bar to his DFC.\n\nOut of the victories whose details are recorded, Kinkead claimed 23 enemy planes 'out of control' including three shared. He destroyed five, and shared in the destruction of two others. One aircraft was claimed captured.<ref>Above the Trenches- Shores, Franks & Guest; page 226</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nKinkead volunteered to serve with [[No. 47 Squadron RAF]] after war's end, when they were sent into Russia to intercede in the [[Russian Civil War]]. He served as B Flight Commander under [[Raymond Collishaw]]. The squadron operated from an equipped train. It was while supporting General [[Denikin]]'s Royalists that, on 12 October 1919, he won the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for a crucial ground attack against a Bolshevik cavalry division near Kotluban, thus saving the city of Tsaritsyn from capture. He also shot down three Russian fighters during this campaign: on 30 September 1919, at Chernyi Yar; on 7 October, at Dubovka; and on 18 October at Peskovatka.\n\nHe was a member of the British 1927 [[Schneider Trophy]] team, retiring in the [[Gloster IV]] after five laps.<ref>\"[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200773.html The Schneider Trophy Race]\". ''Flight'', 6 October 1927. pp. 695\u2014699.</ref> His third lap speed of 277.18&nbsp;mph was the fastest biplane seaplane flight ever recorded.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Kinkeads Gravestone at Fawley Church.jpg|alt=|thumb|299x299px|Samuel Kinkead's Gravestone at Fawley Church]]\nIn 1928, while in command of the [[RAF High Speed Flight]], Kinkead was killed in a plane crash as he tried to become the first man to travel at more than five miles a minute<ref>[http://www.julianlewis.net/local_news_detail.php?id=32 THE AIR ACE ON THE WATERSIDE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161713/http://www.julianlewis.net/local_news_detail.php?id=32 |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> in a [[Supermarine S.5]] near [[Calshot]] [[England]].<ref name=\"Samuel Kinkead Biography\"/> The circumstances of his death have never been satisfactorily explained although a verdict of death by misadventure was passed at the inquest. The witnesses to the crash thought Kinkead was flying very low and very fast when his S.5 dived into moderately deep water near the Calshot Lightship. Although the RAF Duty Motorboat quickly buoyed the wreck site it took two days for the salvage vessel to find and retrieve the wreckage that had split into two parts. The remains were taken to Calshot and the controls were laid out on the slipway to check for any technical fault but the inspector could find nothing technically wrong with the machine. It was at first thought that Kinkead had been thrown clear of the machine during the crash but his body was found, minus half of his head, compressed into the tail. The tail had to be cut open in order to retrieve the body. It was quite obvious that Sam Kinkead had died instantly.\n\nAlthough neither the RAF inquiry nor the Coroner's Inquest were able to give a definitive cause for the accident, D'Arcy Grieg (the pilot who took over from Kinkead) had his own theory as to what had happened. He ruled out mechanical failure of the aircraft because they were too well maintained but said Kinkead was killed by a combination of factors including recovering from a bout of Malaria that would have him feeling, ' a bit below par.'  It was March and late in the afternoon. The sea was glass calm and therefore it was impossible to judge height accurately and there was a mist so he had no horizon when coming in. Grieg also thought the fumes from the engine and the heat from the oil coolers would have turned the cockpit into an extremely hot Turkish Bath. The autopsy, however, had found no evidence for carbon monoxide poisoning. Flying at over 300 MPH and at no higher than 150 feet Kinkead was never more than half a heart beat from disaster.\n\nKinkead was buried<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishpathe.com/video/funeral-of-kinkhead-flyer/query/Britain|title=Funeral Of Kinkead Flyer|last=Path\u00e9|first=British|website=www.britishpathe.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-10}}</ref> at [[All Saints' Church, Fawley]] \u2013 the headstone on his grave reads:\n:In memory of Flight Lieutenant Samuel Marcus Kinkead DSO DSC DFC who, on 12 March 1928 while flying at Calshot, gave his life in an attempt to break the world's speed record.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ride|first1=David|title=Some Memorials in the New Forest|url=http://www.lymington-and-district-historical-society.co.uk/March2013.html|publisher=Lymington & District Historical Society|accessdate=9 January 2015|date=March 2013}}</ref>\n:\n\n== 90th Anniversary Memorial Service ==\n[[File:Front Cover of Memorial Service for Samual Kinkead.jpg|thumb|Front Cover of Memorial Service for Samual Kinkead held at All Saints' Church Fawley.]]In 2018, the 90th anniversary of his death, a special memorial service<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fawleychurch.org/2018/02/17/memorial-service-for-samuel-kinkead/|title=Memorial Service for Samuel Kinkead|last=|first=|date=|website=Fawley Church|access-date=}}</ref> was held at [[All Saints Church, Fawley|All Saints' Church, Fawley]] on the 11th of March.

He went on to serve in southern Russia and the Middle East postwar.<ref name=\"Samuel Kinkead Biography\">[http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/safrica/kinkead.php Samuel Kinkead Biography]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nKinked was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South African Republic]],<ref name=\"Samuel Kinked Biography\"/> to an Irish father and Scottish mother who had recently emigrated there. He was the second son, with an elder brother named Thompson Calder Kinkead, born circa 1893.\n\nSamuel Kinkead joined the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] in September 1915. He took pilot training at Eastbourne in South Africa. He earned his wings by the end of 1915.\n\n==First World War==\nSamuel Kinkead served in 2 Wing RNAS during the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. While flying a [[Bristol Scout]], he shot down a Fokker on 11 August 1916. He also scored on 28 August 1916 while flying a [[Nieuport]], and was credited with a third victory while flying a Nieuport.\n\nHe fell ill with a serious case of malaria and was shipped home to convalesce. Upon recovery, he was forwarded to England, where his older brother Thompson was training as a pilot in the [[Royal Flying Corps]]. While on his second solo flight on 3 September 1917, Thompson died in a crash at Shoreham. Samuel signed for his deceased brother's personal effects.\n\nSamuel Kinkead was assigned to 1 Naval Squadron to fly Nieuports on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Exactly two weeks after his brother's death, on 17 September 1917, he drove down a [[Deutsche Flugzeug-Werke|DFW]] two-seater out of control. A month later, he repeated the feat to become an ace. He went on to claim three more triumphs in October.\n\nIn November and December 1917, he downed three planes each. In mid November, he switched 'birds' to fly a [[Sopwith Camel]], the type of plane he would fly through war's end. Then, with his tally at 14, he went on hiatus for three months. During this time, on 22 February, he was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (DSC).\n\nIn March, 1918, he started accumulating victories by ones and twos, finishing up May with his total at 26. Most of the time, he drove enemy craft out of the fight; he reported few destroyed. However, he received a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his DSC on 26 April 1918. Then, on 30 May, he broke his string again, this time for two months.\n\nHe scored on each of the last three days of July, and four times in August, bringing his total to 33. He had become the leading ace out of the 18 in his squadron, now renumbered 201 Squadron when it was folded into the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]]. On 3 August, he received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC). On 2 November, he was awarded a Bar to his DFC.\n\nOut of the victories whose details are recorded, Kinkead claimed 23 enemy planes 'out of control' including three shared. He destroyed five, and shared in the destruction of two others. One aircraft was claimed captured.<ref>Above the Trenches- Shores, Franks & Guest; page 226</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\nKinkead volunteered to serve with [[No. 47 Squadron RAF]] after war's end, when they were sent into Russia to intercede in the [[Russian Civil War]]. He served as B Flight Commander under [[Raymond Collishaw]]. The squadron operated from an equipped train. It was while supporting General [[Denikin]]'s Royalists that, on 12 October 1919, he won the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for a crucial ground attack against a Bolshevik cavalry division near Kotluban, thus saving the city of Tsaritsyn from capture. He also shot down three Russian fighters during this campaign: on 30 September 1919, at Chernyi Yar; on 7 October, at Dubovka; and on 18 October at Peskovatka.\n\nHe was a member of the British 1927 [[Schneider Trophy]] team, retiring in the [[Gloster IV]] after five laps.<ref>\"[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1927/1927%20-%200773.html The Schneider Trophy Race]\". ''Flight'', 6 October 1927. pp. 695\u2014699.</ref> His third lap speed of 277.18&nbsp;mph was the fastest biplane seaplane flight ever recorded.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Samuel Kinkeads Gravestone at Fawley Church.jpg|alt=|thumb|299x299px|Samuel Kinkead's Gravestone at Fawley Church]]\nIn 1928, while in command of the [[RAF High Speed Flight]], Kinkead was killed in a plane crash as he tried to become the first man to travel at more than five miles a minute<ref>[http://www.julianlewis.net/local_news_detail.php?id=32 THE AIR ACE ON THE WATERSIDE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161713/http://www.julianlewis.net/local_news_detail.php?id=32 |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> in a [[Supermarine S.5]] near [[Calshot]] [[England]].<ref name=\"Samuel Kinkead Biography\"/> The circumstances of his death have never been satisfactorily explained although a verdict of death by misadventure was passed at the inquest. The witnesses to the crash thought Kinkead was flying very low and very fast when his S.5 dived into moderately deep water near the Calshot Lightship. Although the RAF Duty Motorboat quickly buoyed the wreck site it took two days for the salvage vessel to find and retrieve the wreckage that had split into two parts. The remains were taken to Calshot and the controls were laid out on the slipway to check for any technical fault but the inspector could find nothing technically wrong with the machine. It was at first thought that Kinkead had been thrown clear of the machine during the crash but his body was found, minus half of his head, compressed into the tail. The tail had to be cut open in order to retrieve the body. It was quite obvious that Sam Kinkead had died instantly.\n\nAlthough neither the RAF inquiry nor the Coroner's Inquest were able to give a definitive cause for the accident, D'Arcy Grieg (the pilot who took over from Kinkead) had his own theory as to what had happened. He ruled out mechanical failure of the aircraft because they were too well maintained but said Kinkead was killed by a combination of factors including recovering from a bout of Malaria that would have him feeling, ' a bit below par.'

Since 1996, New Zealand has used the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) voting system, giving voters two votes: one for a political party and one for their local electorate MP. The party vote decides how many seats each party gets in the new Parliament; a party is entitled to a share of the seats if it receives 5% of the party vote or wins an electorate. Normally, the House has 120 seats but extra seats may be added where there is an [[Overhang seat|overhang]], caused by a party winning more electorates than seats it is entitled to. The one-seat overhang from the 50th Parliament will remain for the 51st Parliament, after [[United Future]] won one electorate when their 0.22% party vote did not entitle them to any seats.\n\nA total of 3,140,417 people were registered to vote in the election; around 92.6% of all eligible New Zealanders.<ref name=\"enrolstats\" /> A total of 2,446,279 votes were cast,<ref name=\"prelim\">{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/preliminary-results-2014-general-election |title= Preliminary results for the 2014 general election |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= 21 September 2014 |accessdate= 21 September 2014}}</ref> including a record 717,579 [[early voting|advance votes]], more than double the number cast in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2014-general-election/advance-voting-statistics |title= Advance voting statistics |publisher= Electoral Commission |accessdate= 20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Advance votes 2014 total with two days to go |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11327320 |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |date= 19 September 2014 |accessdate= 19 September 2014}}</ref> Turnout was 77.90%, higher than the 2011 election,<ref name=\"prelim\" /> but the sixth-lowest since [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|women gained the vote]] in 1893.\n\nThe centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by incumbent [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[John Key]], gained a plurality with 47.0% of the party vote and 60 of the 121 seats.

Under the terms of the Electoral Referendum Act 2010 the majority vote in favour of retaining MMP meant that the Electoral Commission had the task of conducting an independent review of the workings of the MMP system.\n\nThe Commission released a consultation paper in February 2012 calling for public submissions on ways to improve the MMP system, with the focus put on six areas:\n\n# basis of eligibility for list seats (thresholds)\n# [[by-election]] candidates\n# dual candidacy\n# order of candidates on [[Party-list proportional representation|party lists]]\n# [[Overhang seat|overhang]]\n# proportion of electorate seats to list seats\n\nThe Commission released a proposal paper for consultation in August 2012 and published its final report on 29 October 2012. In the report, the Commission recommended the following:<ref name=\"MMPproposal\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20report%202012%20review%20of%20MMP.pdf |title= Report of the Electoral Commission on the review of the MMP voting system |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= 29 October 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114205922/http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20Report%202012%20Review%20of%20MMP.pdf |archive-date= 14 November 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* Reducing the party vote threshold from 5 percent to 4 percent. If introduced, the 4 percent threshold should be reviewed after three general elections.\n* Abolishing the one electorate seat threshold \u2013 a party must cross the party vote threshold to gain list seats.\n* Abolishing the provision of overhang seats for parties not reaching the threshold \u2013 the extra electorates would be made up at the expense of list seats to retain 120 MPs\n* Retaining the status quo for by-election candidacy and dual candidacy.\n* Retaining the status quo with closed party lists, but increasing scrutiny in selection of list candidates to ensure parties comply with their own party rules.\n* Parliament should give consideration to fixing the ratio between electorate seats and list seats at 60:40 (72:48 in a 120-seat parliament).\n\nParliament has the right to decide whether to implement any changes to the system, which had been largely unchanged since it was introduced in 1994 for the {{NZ election link|1996}}. In November 2012 a [[private member's bill]] under the name of opposition Labour Party member [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] proposed implementing the first two recommendations; it was drawn from the member's bill ballot on 14 November 2013, but by the time Parliament dissolved for the election, it was still awaiting its first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL12864_1/electoral-adjustment-of-thresholds-amendment-bill |title= Electoral (Adjustment of Thresholds) Amendment Bill \u2013 Bills \u2013 Legislation |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 14 November 2013 |accessdate= 24 September 2014}}</ref>\nIn May 2014 [[Judith Collins]] and John Key announced that no inter-party consensus existed on implementing the recommendations of the Commission, so the Government would not introduce any legislation.<ref>{{cite news\n|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10883610\n|title= Government rejects recommendations to change MMP system\n|publisher= New Zealand Herald|last= Young |first= Audrey |date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 June 2014}}\n</ref>\n\n===50th Parliament (2011\u201314)===\n{{main|50th New Zealand Parliament}}\nFollowing the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] entered into [[confidence and supply]] agreements with [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], the [[M\u0101ori Party]] and [[United Future]] to continue the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]]. These arrangements give the National-led government a majority of seven seats, with 64 on confidence-and-supply in the 121-seat Parliament.\n\nThe [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]], [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green]], [[New Zealand First]] and [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] parties are all in opposition, but only the Labour Party constitutes the [[Official Opposition (New Zealand)|formal Opposition]].\n\nAt the 2011 election, the National Party gained 59 seats, the Labour Party 34 seats, the Green Party 14 seats, New Zealand First eight seats, M\u0101ori three seats, and Mana, ACT, and United Future gained one seat each. One change was made to the allocation during the Parliament. In 2012, [[Brendan Horan]] was expelled from the NZ First caucus but continued to sit as an Independent, meaning NZ First had seven caucus MPs for the remainder of the Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/Parties/NZFirst/|title=New Zealand Parliament \u2013 NZ First|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2013, the Electoral Commission de-registered United Future after it could not prove it had the 500 financial members required for registration. The party successfully re-registered on 13 August 2013, but in the interim its sole MP, [[Peter Dunne]], sat in the house as an independent. On 13 June 2014, ACT's sole MP [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] resigned from Parliament after being found guilty of filing a false electoral return for his 2010 Auckland mayoral campaign. As his resignation came within six months of the election, his seat was left vacant, meaning ACT had no representation in Parliament until the general election.\n\n==Dates==\nOn 10 March 2014, Prime Minister John Key announced that the election would take place on Saturday 20 September 2014. As in 2011, the Prime Minister announced the date early, although only six months in advance compared to the nearly ten months in 2011. Traditionally, the election date is a closely guarded secret, and announced as late as possible.<ref>{{cite news |first= Hamish |last= Rutherford |date= 10 March 2014 |title= Election date announced for September |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9811213/Election-date-announced-for-September |publisher= Fairfax NZ News |accessdate= 19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA general election must take place every three years, and Parliaments generally run the full three-year term unless an early election is called or the election date is set to circumvent holding a by-election.

A party contesting all 71 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $2,915,700 on election campaigning. All electorate candidates are permitted to spend $25,700 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Part 7: Election expenses, donations and loans \u2013 Party Secretary Handbook |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/party-secretary-handbook/part-7-election-expenses-donations-loans |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= April 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nRegistered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning, and broadcasting time on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to make opening and closing addresses.

Since 1996, New Zealand has used the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) voting system, giving voters two votes: one for a political party and one for their local electorate MP. The party vote decides how many seats each party gets in the new Parliament; a party is entitled to a share of the seats if it receives 5% of the party vote or wins an electorate. Normally, the House has 120 seats but extra seats may be added where there is an [[Overhang seat|overhang]], caused by a party winning more electorates than seats it is entitled to. The one-seat overhang from the 50th Parliament will remain for the 51st Parliament, after [[United Future]] won one electorate when their 0.22% party vote did not entitle them to any seats.\n\nA total of 3,140,417 people were registered to vote in the election; around 92.6% of all eligible New Zealanders.<ref name=\"enrolstats\" /> A total of 2,446,279 votes were cast,<ref name=\"prelim\">{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/preliminary-results-2014-general-election |title= Preliminary results for the 2014 general election |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= 21 September 2014 |accessdate= 21 September 2014}}</ref> including a record 717,579 [[early voting|advance votes]], more than double the number cast in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2014-general-election/advance-voting-statistics |title= Advance voting statistics |publisher= Electoral Commission |accessdate= 20 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Advance votes 2014 total with two days to go |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11327320 |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |date= 19 September 2014 |accessdate= 19 September 2014}}</ref> Turnout was 77.90%, higher than the 2011 election,<ref name=\"prelim\" /> but the sixth-lowest since [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|women gained the vote]] in 1893.\n\nThe centre-right [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by incumbent [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|Prime Minister]] [[John Key]], gained a plurality with 47.0% of the party vote and 60 of the 121 seats.

Under the terms of the Electoral Referendum Act 2010 the majority vote in favour of retaining MMP meant that the Electoral Commission had the task of conducting an independent review of the workings of the MMP system.\n\nThe Commission released a consultation paper in February 2012 calling for public submissions on ways to improve the MMP system, with the focus put on six areas:\n\n# basis of eligibility for list seats (thresholds)\n# [[by-election]] candidates\n# dual candidacy\n# order of candidates on [[Party-list proportional representation|party lists]]\n# [[Overhang seat|overhang]]\n# proportion of electorate seats to list seats\n\nThe Commission released a proposal paper for consultation in August 2012 and published its final report on 29 October 2012. In the report, the Commission recommended the following:<ref name=\"MMPproposal\">{{cite web |url= http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20report%202012%20review%20of%20MMP.pdf |title= Report of the Electoral Commission on the review of the MMP voting system |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= 29 October 2012 |accessdate= 7 December 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121114205922/http://www.mmpreview.org.nz/sites/default/files/pages/uploads/Final%20Report%202012%20Review%20of%20MMP.pdf |archive-date= 14 November 2012 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* Reducing the party vote threshold from 5 percent to 4 percent.

In November 2012 a [[private member's bill]] under the name of opposition Labour Party member [[Iain Lees-Galloway]] proposed implementing the first two recommendations; it was drawn from the member's bill ballot on 14 November 2013, but by the time Parliament dissolved for the election, it was still awaiting its first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL12864_1/electoral-adjustment-of-thresholds-amendment-bill |title= Electoral (Adjustment of Thresholds) Amendment Bill -- Bills -- Legislation |publisher= New Zealand Parliament |date= 14 November 2013 |accessdate= 24 September 2014}}</ref>\nIn May 2014 [[Judith Collins]] and John Key announced that no inter-party consensus existed on implementing the recommendations of the Commission, so the Government would not introduce any legislation.<ref>{{cite news\n|url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10883610\n|title= Government rejects recommendations to change MMP system\n|publisher= New Zealand Herald|last= Young |first= Audrey |date=14 May 2013|accessdate=15 June 2014}}\n</ref>\n\n===50th Parliament (2011\u201314)===\n{{main|50th New Zealand Parliament}}\nFollowing the [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 general election]], the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] entered into [[confidence and supply]] agreements with [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], the [[M\u0101ori Party]] and [[United Future]] to continue the [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand|Fifth National Government]].

One change was made to the allocation during the Parliament. In 2012, [[Brendan Horan]] was expelled from the NZ First caucus but continued to sit as an Independent, meaning NZ First had seven caucus MPs for the remainder of the Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/Parties/NZFirst/|title=New Zealand Parliament - NZ First|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 May 2013, the Electoral Commission de-registered United Future after it could not prove it had the 500 financial members required for registration. The party successfully re-registered on 13 August 2013, but in the interim its sole MP, [[Peter Dunne]], sat in the house as an independent. On 13 June 2014, ACT's sole MP [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] resigned from Parliament after being found guilty of filing a false electoral return for his 2010 Auckland mayoral campaign. As his resignation came within six months of the election, his seat was left vacant, meaning ACT had no representation in Parliament until the general election.\n\n==Dates==\nOn 10 March 2014, Prime Minister John Key announced that the election would take place on Saturday 20 September 2014. As in 2011, the Prime Minister announced the date early, although only six months in advance compared to the nearly ten months in 2011. Traditionally, the election date is a closely guarded secret, and announced as late as possible.<ref>{{cite news |first= Hamish |last= Rutherford |date= 10 March 2014 |title= Election date announced for September |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9811213/Election-date-announced-for-September |publisher= Fairfax NZ News |accessdate= 19 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA general election must take place every three years, and Parliaments generally run the full three-year term unless an early election is called or the election date is set to circumvent holding a by-election.

While it was correctly predicted Christchurch East would remain a Labour seat, the prediction that the marginal Christchurch Central electorate would move in Labour's favour proved false; the seat instead swung in National's favour. The loss of Labour-leaning urban parts of Waimakariri made it a safer seat for National, which increased it majority from 642 votes in 2011 to 2,133 in 2014.

A party contesting all 71 electorates is therefore permitted to spend $2,915,700 on election campaigning. All electorate candidates are permitted to spend $25,700 each on campaigning over and above their party's allocation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Part 7: Election expenses, donations and loans -- Party Secretary Handbook |url= http://www.elections.org.nz/party-secretary-handbook/part-7-election-expenses-donations-loans |publisher= Electoral Commission |date= April 2014 |accessdate= 29 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nRegistered parties are allocated a separate broadcasting budget for radio and television campaigning, and broadcasting time on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to make opening and closing addresses.

In the Limavady area, the predominate family was the O'Cahans. Their mark is found everywhere in the town and surrounding area. [[O'Cahan]]'s Rock is one of Limavady's main historical points. This is where, according to local myth, a dog belonging to one of the Chiefs jumped the river to get help from nearby clans after a surprise enemy attack. This gave Limavady its name, Limavady being the anglicised version of ''Leim an Mhadaidh'', which means leap of the dog.<ref name=\"CN\"/> This rock, along with other relics of Limavady's history, can be seen at Roe Valley Country Park.\n\nThe town developed from a small [[Plantation of Ulster|Plantation]] settlement founded by Sir [[Thomas Phillips (Irish adventurer)|Thomas Phillips]]. In 1610 Sir Thomas Phillips was granted 13,100 acres of land at Limavady which included an O\u2019Cahan castle. He commenced the building of the \u2018Newtown of Limavady\u2019 which was laid out in a cruciform road pattern. Newtown Limavady was incorporated, with the appointment of a Provost and 12 Burgesses, on 31 March 1613 with a charter granted by King James I.

In the Limavady area, the predominate family was the O'Cahans. Their mark is found everywhere in the town and surrounding area. [[O'Cahan]]'s Rock is one of Limavady's main historical points. This is where, according to local myth, a dog belonging to one of the Chiefs jumped the river to get help from nearby clans after a surprise enemy attack. This gave Limavady its name, Limavady being the anglicised version of ''Leim an Mhadaidh'', which means leap of the dog.<ref name=\"CN\"/> This rock, along with other relics of Limavady's history, can be seen at Roe Valley Country Park.\n\nThe town developed from a small [[Plantation of Ulster|Plantation]] settlement founded by Sir [[Thomas Phillips (Irish adventurer)|Thomas Phillips]].

At that time, it was not clear that the Soviets' main satellite plan (which would eventually become [[Sputnik 3]]) would be able to get to space because of the ongoing issues with the R-7 ICBM, which would be needed to launch a satellite of that size. \"Korolev proposed substituting two 'simple satellites' for the [[International Geophysical Year|IGY]] satellite\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The choice to launch these two instead of waiting for the more advanced Sputnik 3 to be finished was largely motivated by the desire to launch a satellite to orbit before the US.\n\n==Mission profile==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--4 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[Image:Ussrsputnik2-20kop1957scott2032.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[USSR]] [[postage stamp]] \"\u0421\u043f\u0443\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a-2\"]]\nSputnik 2, known to Korolev's design bureau as \"Prosteyshiy Sputnik-2\", meaning \"Simple Satellite 2\",<ref>Siddiqi, Asif A..

These included modifying the launch trajectory to utilize propellant more efficiently and removing some flight control components to reduce weight. In addition, the core stage would be burned to propellant depletion instead of cutting off at a preset time. The telemetry system at engine cutoff would be switched from monitoring the booster's parameters to those of the capsule. It was also designed to only transmit data for ten minutes at a time every 90 minutes, so as to prevent battery power from being used up sending data while the spacecraft was out of range of Soviet tracking stations. The interstage section between the booster and capsule was highly polished and equipped with thermal blankets so as to reflect off sunlight and keep the latter cool; also, several deployable reflectors were mounted on the core stage. A braking nozzle was added to the core stage to prevent it from tumbling in orbit; this would work by venting excess [[helium]] gas from the propellant tank pressurization system. Several RD-107 engines were test-fired, with the best-performing units being selected for use on Sputnik 2's booster. The launch vehicle arrived at Baikonur on 22 October, along with various parts of the capsule. On 1 November, the booster was erected on LC-1.\n\nTen dogs were considered for the mission, with the final selection being narrowed down to three, Laika being the flight animal, Albina the backup, and Muhka used to test equipment.\n\nLiftoff took place at about 17:30 Moscow time on 3 November.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1957-002A|title=Sputnik 2 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> Booster performance was nominal and the command to terminate core stage thrust was issued at T+297 seconds, just as onboard sensors detected LOX depletion. The booster and capsule entered a 225 \u00d7 1,671&nbsp;km (140 \u00d7 1,038&nbsp;mi) orbit at a 65\u00b0 inclination.\n\nDuring the first two orbits, it proved difficult to reliably track Sputnik 2's flight path, but ground controllers were able to intercept theodolite data from an American tracking station in [[Perth, Australia]]. Data showed that Laika's heart rate and breathing spiked rapidly during ascent, but she otherwise reached orbit largely unscathed. Official Soviet press releases stated that Laika survived a week in orbit, but information released in the post-Soviet era indicated that she died only a few hours into the mission. Other sources suggested it had been four days before the dog succumbed to overheating and [[carbon dioxide]] buildup.\n\nTelemetry data indicated that Laika's vital signs were normal for the first three orbits, but during the fourth orbit, the cabin temperature rose to {{convert|43|C|abbr=on}} followed by movements of the dog. Data received on the second day showed no signs of breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure, but the cardio sensor was still registering a heart beat. By the morning of 6 November, there were no signs of life in the capsule. On 10 November, the batteries in the spacecraft ran out and all data transmission ceased, after 150 separate telemetry sessions. Sputnik 2 reentered the atmosphere on 14 April 1958 after 162 days in space and about 2500 orbits. Reentry was sighted from the east coast of the United States and surviving debris impacted in the Amazon region of South America.<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2_mission.html</ref>\n\nThe flight sparked considerable ethical debate about cruelty to animals, as Laika had been launched with the full knowledge that she could not be recovered and may have suffered a quite unpleasant death from panic and overheating, and even some Soviet space program officials reportedly felt sorry about her. An anonymously-written poem criticizing the mission and the Soviet state was circulated in Moscow.\n\nThe R-7 was also known by its GURVO designation 8K71,<ref>Zaloga, Stephen J..

Other stations in Australia and South America had also been in range and intercepted the signals. However, the Soviets would not release the code that would allow the stations in Australia and South America to read the signals, and without the code, the stations would not cooperate and send the data to the Soviets.\n\nThe disagreement cost the Soviets the opportunity to claim one of the most significant findings of the space race at that time, and only after the launch (1 February 1958) of the U.S. satellite [[Explorer 1]] did [[James Van Allen]] demonstrate the existence of the radiation belts.<ref>\nRoberts, W.

At that time, it was not clear that the Soviets' main satellite plan (which would eventually become [[Sputnik 3]]) would be able to get to space because of the ongoing issues with the R-7 ICBM, which would be needed to launch a satellite of that size. \"Korolev proposed substituting two 'simple satellites' for the [[International Geophysical Year|IGY]] satellite\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The choice to launch these two instead of waiting for the more advanced Sputnik 3 to be finished was largely motivated by the desire to launch a satellite to orbit before the US.\n\n==Mission profile==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--4 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[Image:Ussrsputnik2-20kop1957scott2032.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[USSR]] [[postage stamp]] \"\u0421\u043f\u0443\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a-2\"]]\nSputnik 2, known to Korolev's design bureau as \"Prosteyshiy Sputnik-2\", meaning \"Simple Satellite 2\",<ref>Siddiqi, Asif A..

These included modifying the launch trajectory to utilize propellant more efficiently and removing some flight control components to reduce weight. In addition, the core stage would be burned to propellant depletion instead of cutting off at a preset time. The telemetry system at engine cutoff would be switched from monitoring the booster's parameters to those of the capsule. It was also designed to only transmit data for ten minutes at a time every 90 minutes, so as to prevent battery power from being used up sending data while the spacecraft was out of range of Soviet tracking stations. The interstage section between the booster and capsule was highly polished and equipped with thermal blankets so as to reflect off sunlight and keep the latter cool; also, several deployable reflectors were mounted on the core stage. A braking nozzle was added to the core stage to prevent it from tumbling in orbit; this would work by venting excess [[helium]] gas from the propellant tank pressurization system. Several RD-107 engines were test-fired, with the best-performing units being selected for use on Sputnik 2's booster. The launch vehicle arrived at Baikonur on 22 October, along with various parts of the capsule. On 1 November, the booster was erected on LC-1.\n\nTen dogs were considered for the mission, with the final selection being narrowed down to three, Laika being the flight animal, Albina the backup, and Muhka used to test equipment.\n\nLiftoff took place at about 17:30 Moscow time on 3 November.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/displayTrajectory.action?id=1957-002A|title=Sputnik 2 Launch and Trajectory Information|website=NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive|access-date=November 2, 2019}}</ref> Booster performance was nominal and the command to terminate core stage thrust was issued at T+297 seconds, just as onboard sensors detected LOX depletion. The booster and capsule entered a 225 \u00d7 1,671&nbsp;km (140 \u00d7 1,038&nbsp;mi) orbit at a 65\u00b0 inclination.\n\nDuring the first two orbits, it proved difficult to reliably track Sputnik 2's flight path, but ground controllers were able to intercept theodolite data from an American tracking station in [[Perth, Australia]]. Data showed that Laika's heart rate and breathing spiked rapidly during ascent, but she otherwise reached orbit largely unscathed. Official Soviet press releases stated that Laika survived a week in orbit, but information released in the post-Soviet era indicated that she died only a few hours into the mission. Other sources suggested it had been four days before the dog succumbed to overheating and [[carbon dioxide]] buildup.\n\nTelemetry data indicated that Laika's vital signs were normal for the first three orbits, but during the fourth orbit, the cabin temperature rose to {{convert|43|C|abbr=on}} followed by movements of the dog. Data received on the second day showed no signs of breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure, but the cardio sensor was still registering a heart beat. By the morning of 6 November, there were no signs of life in the capsule. On 10 November, the batteries in the spacecraft ran out and all data transmission ceased, after 150 separate telemetry sessions. Sputnik 2 reentered the atmosphere on 14 April 1958 after 162 days in space and about 2500 orbits. Reentry was sighted from the east coast of the United States and surviving debris impacted in the Amazon region of South America.<ref>http://www.russianspaceweb.com/sputnik2_mission.html</ref>\n\nThe flight sparked considerable ethical debate about cruelty to animals, as Laika had been launched with the full knowledge that she could not be recovered and may have suffered a quite unpleasant death from panic and overheating, and even some Soviet space program officials reportedly felt sorry about her. An anonymously-written poem criticizing the mission and the Soviet state was circulated in Moscow.\n\nThe R-7 was also known by its GURVO designation 8K71,<ref>Zaloga, Stephen J..
