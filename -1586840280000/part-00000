P. 61</ref>\n\n=== Theories of Citizenship ===\nAccording to Vincent Campbell, theories of citizenship can be categorized into two core groups: those that consider journalism ''for'' citizenship, and those that consider journalism ''as'' citizenship.\n\nThe classical model of citizenship is the base of the two theories of citizenship. The classical model is rooted in the ideology of informed citizens and places emphasis on the role of journalists rather than on citizens.\n\nThe classical model has four main characteristics:\n* journalists' role of informing citizens\n* citizens are assumed to be informed if they regularly attend to the news they are supplied with\n* more informed citizens are more likely to participate\n* the more informed citizens participate, the more democratic a state is more likely to be.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Vincent|date=2015|title=Theorizing Citizenship in Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|issue=5|pages=704\u2013719|doi=10.1080/21670811.2014.937150}}</ref>\n\nThe first characteristic upholds the theory that journalism is ''for'' citizens. One of the main issues with this is that there is a normative judgement surrounding the amount and nature of information that citizens should have as well as what the relationship between the two should be. One branch of journalism ''for'' citizens is the \"monitorial citizen\" (coined by [[Michael Schudson]]). The \"monitorial citizen\" suggests that citizens appropriately and strategically select what news and information they consume. The \"monitorial citizen\" along with other forms of this ideology conceive individuals as those who do things with information to enact change and citizenship. However, this production of information does not equal to an act of citizenship, but instead an act of journalism. Therefore, citizens and journalists are portrayed as distinctive roles whereas journalism is used by citizens ''for'' citizenship and conversely, journalists serve citizens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second theory considers journalism ''as'' citizenship. This theory focuses on the different aspects of citizen identity and activity and understands citizen journalism as directly constituting citizenship. The term \"liquid citizenship\" (coined by [[Zizi Papacharissi]]) depicts how the lifestyles that individuals engage in allow them to interact with other individuals and organizations, which thus remaps the conceptual periphery of civic, political, and social. This \"liquid citizenship\" allows the interactions and experiences that individuals face to become citizen journalism where they create their own forms of journalism. An alternative approach of journalism as citizenship rests between the distinction between \"dutiful\" citizens and \"actualizing\" citizens. \"Dutiful\" citizens engage in traditional citizenship practices, while \"actualizing\" citizens engage in non-traditional citizenship practices. This alternative approach suggests that \"actualizing\" citizens are less likely to use traditional media and more likely to use online and [[social media]] as sources of information, discussion, and participation. Thus, journalism in the form of online and social media practices become a form of citizenship for actualizing citizens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCriticisms have been made against citizen journalism, especially from among professionals in the field. Citizen journalists are often portrayed as unreliable, biased and untrained{{Snd}} as opposed to professionals who have \"recognition, paid work, unionized labour and behaviour that is often politically neutral and unaffiliated, at least in the claim if not in the actuality\".<ref name=\"The Iranian Story: What Citizens?

The contemporary citizen journalist movement emerged after journalists began to question the predictability of their coverage of events such as the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 U.S. presidential election]]. Those journalists became part of the public, or civic, journalism movement, which sought to counter the erosion of trust in the news media and the widespread disillusionment with politics and civic affairs.<ref name=\"merritt\">Merritt, D. \"[http://pjnet.org/post/318/ News Media must regain vigor, courage.]\" September 29, 2004, ''PJNet Today''.</ref><ref name=\"dvorkin\">Dvorkin, J.

According to Leonard Witt, however, early public journalism efforts were \"often part of 'special projects' that were expensive, time-consuming, and episodic. Too often these projects dealt with an issue and moved on. [[Professional journalism|Professional journalists]] were driving the discussion. They would have the goal of doing a story on welfare-to-work (or the environment, or traffic problems, or the economy), and then they would recruit a cross-section of citizens and chronicle their points of view. Since not all reporters and editors bought into this form of public journalism, and some outright opposed it, reaching out to the people from the newsroom was never an easy task.\" By 2003, in fact, the movement seemed to be petering out, with the Pew Center for Civic Journalism closing its doors.\n\nTraditionally, the term \"citizen journalism\" has had a history of struggle with deliberating on a concise and mutually agreed upon definition. Even today, the term lacks a clear form of conceptualization. Although the term lacks conceptualization, alternative names of the term are unable to comprehensively capture the phenomenon. For example, one of  the interchangeable names with \"citizen journalism\" is \"[[user-generated content]]\" (UGC). However, the issue with this alternative term is that it eliminates the potential civic virtues of citizen journalism and considers it to be stunted and proprietorial.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Wall|first=Melissa|date=2015|title=Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|issue=6|pages=797\u2013813|doi=10.1080/21670811.2014.1002513}}</ref>\n\nWith today's technology the citizen journalist movement has found new life as the average person can capture news and distribute it globally.

This is because citizen journalism allows people to post as much content as they want, whenever they want. In order to stay competitive, traditional news sources are forcing their journalist to compete. This means that journalist now have to write, edit and add pictures into their content and they must do so at a rapid pace, as it is perceived by news companies that it's essential for journalist to produce content at the same rate that citizens can post content on the internet. This is hard though, as many news companies are facing budget cuts and cannot afford to pay journalists the proper amount for the amount of work they do.  Despite the uncertainties of a job in journalism and rising tuition costs there has been a 35% increase in journalism majors throughout the past few years according to [[Astra Taylor]] in her book ''[[The People's Platform]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador Paperback|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Legal repercussions===\nEdward Greenberg, a New York City litigator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecopyrightzone.com/?page_id=9|title=About Ed|author=Edward Greenberg |accessdate= 17 August 2010|date=2009-12-20}}</ref> notes higher vulnerability of unprofessional journalists in court compared to the professional ones:\n{{quote|\"So-called shield laws, which protect reporters from revealing sources, vary from state to state. On occasion, the protection is dependent on whether the person [who] asserted the claim is in fact a journalist.

P. 61</ref>\n\n=== Theories of Citizenship ===\nAccording to Vincent Campbell, theories of citizenship can be categorized into two core groups: those that consider journalism ''for'' citizenship, and those that consider journalism ''as'' citizenship.\n\nThe classical model of citizenship is the base of the two theories of citizenship. The classical model is rooted in the ideology of informed citizens and places emphasis on the role of journalists rather than on citizens.\n\nThe classical model has four main characteristics:\n* journalists' role of informing citizens\n* citizens are assumed to be informed if they regularly attend to the news they are supplied with\n* more informed citizens are more likely to participate\n* the more informed citizens participate, the more democratic a state is more likely to be.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Vincent|date=2015|title=Theorizing Citizenship in Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|issue=5|pages=704\u2013719|doi=10.1080/21670811.2014.937150}}</ref>\n\nThe first characteristic upholds the theory that journalism is ''for'' citizens. One of the main issues with this is that there is a normative judgement surrounding the amount and nature of information that citizens should have as well as what the relationship between the two should be. One branch of journalism ''for'' citizens is the \"monitorial citizen\" (coined by [[Michael Schudson]]). The \"monitorial citizen\" suggests that citizens appropriately and strategically select what news and information they consume. The \"monitorial citizen\" along with other forms of this ideology conceive individuals as those who do things with information to enact change and citizenship. However, this production of information does not equal to an act of citizenship, but instead an act of journalism. Therefore, citizens and journalists are portrayed as distinctive roles whereas journalism is used by citizens ''for'' citizenship and conversely, journalists serve citizens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe second theory considers journalism ''as'' citizenship. This theory focuses on the different aspects of citizen identity and activity and understands citizen journalism as directly constituting citizenship. The term \"liquid citizenship\" (coined by [[Zizi Papacharissi]]) depicts how the lifestyles that individuals engage in allow them to interact with other individuals and organizations, which thus remaps the conceptual periphery of civic, political, and social. This \"liquid citizenship\" allows the interactions and experiences that individuals face to become citizen journalism where they create their own forms of journalism. An alternative approach of journalism as citizenship rests between the distinction between \"dutiful\" citizens and \"actualizing\" citizens. \"Dutiful\" citizens engage in traditional citizenship practices, while \"actualizing\" citizens engage in non-traditional citizenship practices. This alternative approach suggests that \"actualizing\" citizens are less likely to use traditional media and more likely to use online and [[social media]] as sources of information, discussion, and participation. Thus, journalism in the form of online and social media practices become a form of citizenship for actualizing citizens.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCriticisms have been made against citizen journalism, especially from among professionals in the field. Citizen journalists are often portrayed as unreliable, biased and untrained{{Snd}} as opposed to professionals who have \"recognition, paid work, unionized labour and behaviour that is often politically neutral and unaffiliated, at least in the claim if not in the actuality\".<ref name=\"The Iranian Story: What Citizens?

The contemporary citizen journalist movement emerged after journalists began to question the predictability of their coverage of events such as the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988 U.S. presidential election]]. Those journalists became part of the public, or civic, journalism movement, which sought to counter the erosion of trust in the news media and the widespread disillusionment with politics and civic affairs.<ref name=\"merritt\">Merritt, D. \"[http://pjnet.org/post/318/ News Media must regain vigor, courage.]\" September 29, 2004, ''PJNet Today''.</ref><ref name=\"dvorkin\">Dvorkin, J.

According to Leonard Witt, however, early public journalism efforts were \"often part of 'special projects' that were expensive, time-consuming, and episodic. Too often these projects dealt with an issue and moved on. [[Professional journalism|Professional journalists]] were driving the discussion. They would have the goal of doing a story on welfare-to-work (or the environment, or traffic problems, or the economy), and then they would recruit a cross-section of citizens and chronicle their points of view. Since not all reporters and editors bought into this form of public journalism, and some outright opposed it, reaching out to the people from the newsroom was never an easy task.\" By 2003, in fact, the movement seemed to be petering out, with the Pew Center for Civic Journalism closing its doors.\n\nTraditionally, the term \"citizen journalism\" has had a history of struggle with deliberating on a concise and mutually agreed upon definition. Even today, the term lacks a clear form of conceptualization. Although the term lacks conceptualization, alternative names of the term are unable to comprehensively capture the phenomenon. For example, one of  the interchangeable names with \"citizen journalism\" is \"[[user-generated content]]\" (UGC). However, the issue with this alternative term is that it eliminates the potential civic virtues of citizen journalism and considers it to be stunted and proprietorial.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Wall|first=Melissa|date=2015|title=Citizen Journalism|url=|journal=Digital Journalism|volume=3|issue=6|pages=797\u2013813|doi=10.1080/21670811.2014.1002513}}</ref>\n\nWith today's technology the citizen journalist movement has found new life as the average person can capture news and distribute it globally.

This has drawn some criticism from traditional media institutions such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', which have accused proponents of public journalism of abandoning the traditional goal of [[Objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]. Many traditional journalists view citizen journalism with some skepticism, believing that only trained journalists can understand the exactitude and ethics involved in reporting news. See, e.g., [[Nicholas Lemann]], Vincent Maher, and Tom Grubisich.\n\nAn academic paper by Vincent Maher, the head of the New Media Lab at Rhodes University, outlined several weaknesses in the claims made by citizen journalists, in terms of the \"three deadly E's\", referring to ethics, economics, and [[epistemology]].<ref name=\"maher\">Maher, V. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060924125946/http://nml.ru.ac.za/maher/?p=6 Citizen Journalism is Dead.]\" 2005, New Media Lab, School of Journalism & Media Studies, Rhodes University, South Africa.</ref>\n\nAn analysis by language and linguistics professor, Patricia Bou-Franch, found that some citizen journalists resorted to abuse-sustaining discourses naturalizing violence against women.

Also according to the article, the sites with the weakest editorial content were able to expand aggressively because they had stronger financial resources.\n\nAnother article published on Pressthink examined Backfence, a citizen journalism site with three initial locations in the D.C. area, which reveals that the site has only attracted limited citizen contributions.<ref name=\"george\">George, E. \"[http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/11/30/lz_bcfc.html Guest Writer Liz George of Baristanet Reviews Backfence.com Seven Months After Launch.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051204042534/http://journalism.nyu.edu/pubzone/weblogs/pressthink/2005/11/30/lz_bcfc.html |date=December 4, 2005 }}\" November 30, 2005, ''Pressthink''.</ref> The author concludes that, \"in fact, clicking through Backfence's pages feels like frontier land -\u2013 remote, often lonely, zoned for people but not home to any.

There is either a fire line or police line, or security, or the Secret Service who allow them to pass upon displaying credentials vetted by the departments or agencies concerned.

As low as 32% of the American population have a fair amount of trust in the media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/195542/americans-trust-mass-media-sinks-new-low.aspx|title=Americans' Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low|last=Inc|first=Gallup|website=Gallup.com|access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Effects on traditional journalism ===\nJournalism has been affected significantly due to citizen journalism. This is because citizen journalism allows people to post as much content as they want, whenever they want. In order to stay competitive, traditional news sources are forcing their journalist to compete. This means that journalist now have to write, edit and add pictures into their content and they must do so at a rapid pace, as it is perceived by news companies that it's essential for journalist to produce content at the same rate that citizens can post content on the internet. This is hard though, as many news companies are facing budget cuts and cannot afford to pay journalists the proper amount for the amount of work they do.  Despite the uncertainties of a job in journalism and rising tuition costs there has been a 35% increase in journalism majors throughout the past few years according to [[Astra Taylor]] in her book ''[[The People's Platform]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age|last=Taylor|first=Astra|publisher=Picador Paperback|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Legal repercussions===\nEdward Greenberg, a New York City litigator,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecopyrightzone.com/?page_id=9|title=About Ed|author=Edward Greenberg |accessdate= 17 August 2010|date=2009-12-20}}</ref> notes higher vulnerability of unprofessional journalists in court compared to the professional ones:\n{{quote|\"So-called shield laws, which protect reporters from revealing sources, vary from state to state. On occasion, the protection is dependent on whether the person [who] asserted the claim is in fact a journalist. There are many cases at both the state and federal levels where judges determine just who is/is not a journalist. Cases involving libel often hinge on whether the actor was or was not a member of the \"press\".\"<ref name=\"letsabolishcitizenjournalism\"/>}}\n\nThe view stated above does not mean that professional journalists are fully protected by shield laws. In the 1972 [[Branzburg v. Hayes]] case the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] invalidated the use of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as a defense for reporters summoned to testify before a [[grand jury]]. In 2005, the [[Reporters' Privilege#Judith Miller brings reporters' privilege to the forefront of media attention|reporter's privilege]] of [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] and [[Matthew Cooper (American journalist)|Matthew Cooper]] was rejected by the appellate court.\n\n== Possible future ==\nCitizen journalism increased during the last decade of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century, associated with the creation of the [[internet]] which introduced new ways in communicating and engaging news. Due to this shift in technology, individuals were able to access more news than previously and at a much faster rate. This larger quantity also made it so there was a larger variety of sources which people were able to consume media and news.\n\nNatalie Fenton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/sfu/reader.action?docID=10349689|title=ProQuest Ebook Central|author=|date=|website=site.ebrary.com|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}</ref> discusses the role of citizen journalism within the [[Digital Age|digital age]] and has three characteristics associated with the topic: speed and space, multiplicity and poly-centrality, and interactivity and participation.\n\nWith technological advancements, individuals were able to participate increasingly in journalism. Pictures or videos could be uploaded online in a matter of minutes and this paved the way for [[social media]] to grow as a strong producer in the industry. The introduction of technologies such as the [[smartphone]] increased the ability to access the internet. Many large corporations have shifted their focus toward online presence, such as Facebook or YouTube.

The [[Hugo Awards]] have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe award was first presented in 1955, and has been given annually since except for in 1958. A \"fanzine\" is defined for the award as a magazine that does not meet the Hugo award's criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average press run of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of any one person, had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine.<ref name=\"thacats\"/> This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|fan writing]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|fan art]].

Of these, 40 magazines run by 67 editors have won, including ties. ''Locus'' has won 8 times out of 13 nominations, the most wins of any magazine. ''[[File 770]]'' has won 7 of 31, the most nominations of any magazine. ''[[Mimosa (magazine)|Mimosa]]'' has won 6 of 14 nominations, ''Ansible'' has won 5 out of 11, and ''Science Fiction Review'' has won 4 of 12; they are the only other magazines to win more than twice. ''Challenger'' has the most nominations without winning at 12; the next highest is ''FOSFAX'' with 7. As editor of ''Locus'' Charles N.

The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1956 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1957 all of the candidates were recorded.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the \"year in literature\" article corresponding with when the work was eligible. Entries with a blue background  won the award for that year; those with a white background are the other nominees on the short-list. \n\nNote that five magazines are listed under multiple names: ''Psychotic'' was later renamed to ''Science Fiction Review'', ''Zenith'' was renamed to ''Zenith Speculation'' and later to ''Speculation'', ''[[Algol (fanzine)|Algol]]'' was renamed to ''Starship'', ''Tangent'' was renamed to ''[[Tangent Online]]'' when it switched from a print magazine to an online one, and ''Cry of the Nameless'', a club bulletin for \"The Nameless Ones\", was renamed to ''Cry'' when it began publishing more general material. No other magazines have been nominated under multiple names.<ref name=\"Zenithname\"/><ref name=\"Algolname\"/><ref name=\"NamelessOnes\"/> Those magazines are sorted under the first name they were nominated as.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners and joint winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"45%\" scope=\"col\"|Work\n! width=\"44%\" scope=\"col\"|Editor(s)\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1954 in literature|1955]]\n| ''[[Fantasy-Times]]''* || {{sortname|James V.|Taurasi, Sr.|nolink=1}} and Ray Van Houten\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo55\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"10\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1955 in literature|1956]]\n| ''[[Inside (magazine)|Inside]]''* || {{sortname|Ron|Smith|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n| ''[[Science Fiction Advertiser]]''* || {{sortname|Ron|Smith|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''A Bas'' || {{sortname|Boyd|Raeburn|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''[[Fantasy-Times]]'' || {{sortname|James V.|Taurasi, Sr.|nolink=1}} and Ray Van Houten\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Grue'' || {{sortname|Peggy|Nadramia}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''[[Hyphen (fanzine)|Hyphen]]'' || {{sortname|Walt|Willis}} and Chuck Harris\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Oblique'' || {{sortname|Cliff|Gould|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Peon'' || {{sortname|Charles Lee|Riddle|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Psychotic'' || {{sortname|Richard E.|Geis}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''[[Sky Hook]]'' || {{sortname|Redd|Boggs}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1956 in literature|1957]]\n| ''[[Science-Fiction Times]]''* || {{sortname|James V.|Taurasi, Sr.|nolink=1}}, Ray Van Houten and Frank R.

'''Hugo Award for Best Fanzine''' is given each year for [[editing|non professionally edited]] [[magazine]]s, or \"[[fanzine]]s\", related to science fiction or fantasy which has published four or more issues with at least one issue appearing in the previous calendar year.<ref name=\"HugoConst71\"/> Awards were also once given out for professional magazines in the [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|professional magazine]] category, and since 1984 have been awarded for semi-professional magazines in the [[Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine|semiprozine]] category; several magazines that were nominated for or won the fanzine category have gone on to be nominated for or win the semiprozine category since it was established. The [[Hugo Awards]] have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe award was first presented in 1955, and has been given annually since except for in 1958. A \"fanzine\" is defined for the award as a magazine that does not meet the Hugo award's criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average press run of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of any one person, had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine.<ref name=\"thacats\"/> This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|fan writing]] and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|fan art]]. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or \"Retro Hugos\", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943, 1944, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fanzine category has been included each year.<ref name=\"LocusRetroHugoinfo\"/>\n\nDuring the 73 nomination years, including Retro Hugo years, 133 magazines run by 194 editors have been nominated. Of these, 40 magazines run by 67 editors have won, including ties. ''Locus'' has won 8 times out of 13 nominations, the most wins of any magazine. ''[[File 770]]'' has won 7 of 31, the most nominations of any magazine. ''[[Mimosa (magazine)|Mimosa]]'' has won 6 of 14 nominations, ''Ansible'' has won 5 out of 11, and ''Science Fiction Review'' has won 4 of 12; they are the only other magazines to win more than twice. ''Challenger'' has the most nominations without winning at 12; the next highest is ''FOSFAX'' with 7. As editor of ''Locus'' Charles N. Brown has won 8 of 13 nominations, though he shared 8 of those awards with Dena Brown. [[Richard E. Geis]] has won 6 of 15 nominations for his work on ''Science Fiction Review'', ''Psychotic'', and ''The Alien Critic''; [[Mike Glyer]] has won 7 of 31 for editing ''[[File 770]]''; [[David Langford]] has won 5 of 12 for work on ''Ansible'' and ''Twil-Ddu''; and Richard Lynch and Nicki Lynch have both won 6 of 14 nominations for ''Mimosa''. [[Guy H. Lillian III]] has the most nominations without winning at 12 for ''Challenger''.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] (Worldcon), and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1956 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1957 all of the candidates were recorded.<ref name=\"thafaq\"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/>\n\n== Winners and nominees ==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the work was first published. Each date links to the \"year in literature\" article corresponding with when the work was eligible. Entries with a blue background  won the award for that year; those with a white background are the other nominees on the short-list. \n\nNote that five magazines are listed under multiple names: ''Psychotic'' was later renamed to ''Science Fiction Review'', ''Zenith'' was renamed to ''Zenith Speculation'' and later to ''Speculation'', ''[[Algol (fanzine)|Algol]]'' was renamed to ''Starship'', ''Tangent'' was renamed to ''[[Tangent Online]]'' when it switched from a print magazine to an online one, and ''Cry of the Nameless'', a club bulletin for \"The Nameless Ones\", was renamed to ''Cry'' when it began publishing more general material. No other magazines have been nominated under multiple names.<ref name=\"Zenithname\"/><ref name=\"Algolname\"/><ref name=\"NamelessOnes\"/> Those magazines are sorted under the first name they were nominated as.\n\n<span style=\"margin:0px; padding-bottom:1px; font-size:90%; display:block;\"><span style=\"border:#aaa solid 1px; background-color:#B0C4DE;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Winners and joint winners</span>\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"85%\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! width=\"7%\" scope=\"col\"|Year\n! width=\"45%\" scope=\"col\"|Work\n! width=\"44%\" scope=\"col\"|Editor(s)\n! width=\"4%\" scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref.\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1954 in literature|1955]]\n| ''[[Fantasy-Times]]''* || {{sortname|James V.|Taurasi, Sr.|nolink=1}} and Ray Van Houten\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo55\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"10\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1955 in literature|1956]]\n| ''[[Inside (magazine)|Inside]]''* || {{sortname|Ron|Smith|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n| ''[[Science Fiction Advertiser]]''* || {{sortname|Ron|Smith|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''A Bas'' || {{sortname|Boyd|Raeburn|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''[[Fantasy-Times]]'' || {{sortname|James V.|Taurasi, Sr.|nolink=1}} and Ray Van Houten\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Grue'' || {{sortname|Peggy|Nadramia}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''[[Hyphen (fanzine)|Hyphen]]'' || {{sortname|Walt|Willis}} and Chuck Harris\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Oblique'' || {{sortname|Cliff|Gould|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Peon'' || {{sortname|Charles Lee|Riddle|nolink=1}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''Psychotic'' || {{sortname|Richard E.|Geis}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|-\n| ''[[Sky Hook]]'' || {{sortname|Redd|Boggs}}\n|align=\"center\"| <ref name=\"Hugo56\"/>\n|- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!scope=\"row\" align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\"| [[1956 in literature|1957]]\n| ''[[Science-Fiction Times]]''* || {{sortname|James V.|Taurasi, Sr.|nolink=1}}, Ray Van Houten and Frank R.

It also forms the centre of a [[parish]] of the same name which covers an area of 86.1 square miles.<ref>https://www.townlands.ie/mayo/aghagower/</ref> The village is known for its links to Saint Patrick and T\u00f3char Ph\u00e1draig, the pilgrimage route from Ballintubber Abbey to [[Croagh Patrick]].{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nAughagower came to prominence in 441 when St. Patrick founded a church and bishopric, and placed over it Bishop Senach; the [[Book of Armagh]] states that bishops still dwelt there in the time of the writer (early part of the ninth century).<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopaedia\">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15079d.htm Catholic Encyclopaedia 1917</ref> Senach was one of St. Patrick's closest followers, originally from Armagh, who traveled with him to Aughagower and Croagh Patrick as part of his household.\n\n[[St. Patrick]] is recorded as having stayed in Aughagower where he built a church and anointed the parish's first bishop, [[Senach]], on his journey to [[Croagh Patrick]]. Aughagower lies mid-way along [[Patrick's Causeway|T\u00f3char Ph\u00e1draig]], formerly a part of the royal processional route from [[Rathcroghan|Cruachan]] (the ancient capital of [[Connacht]]), and later an important pilgrimage route from [[Ballintubber Abbey]] to [[Croagh Patrick]]. Senach founded a church, and his daughter Mathona, a nunnery. These were situated appromixately 100 yards north of the medieval round tower and abbey, alongside the 'Temple of the Teeth' the site of an earlier stone church, presumed to have been built atop an original wooden church founded by St. Patrick.<ref> John Keville, 'Saints, Chieftains and Landlords' published in three parts in Cathair na Mart Vol.2, no.1, 1982; vol.3, no.1, 1983; vol.4, no, 1984.</ref>\n\nSince its formation by St. Patrick as a bishopric in the 5th century, Aughagower represented one of the most populous and influential parishes in [[Umhaill]]. The jurisdiction of Aughagower extended over the \"Owles\", the territory around Clew Bay, comprising the modern deanery of [[Westport, County Mayo|Westport]]. But after several centuries these churches and their lands were absorbed first into the Diocese of Mayo and afterwards granted to the Archbishop of Tuam.\nThe importance of the parish was still evident six centuries after St. Patrick departed, as seen when in 1215 competing claims by the Archbishops of Tuam and Armagh to the church and lands of Aughagower arose, with Pope Innocent in Rome being called upon to settle the dispute, and did so in favour of Tuam.<ref>Right Rev. Monsignor D'Alton, 'History of the Archdicoese of Tuam', 1928, Chapter V page 82-83</ref>.\n\n=== Early modern ===\nThe importance of Aughagower parish in these warring episodes is seen by the defensive forts of [[Doon Castle]] in the townland of [[Dooncastle]] and MacPhilbin's castle in [[Ayle]] (ruins of both are still standing), which were controlled by the MacPhilbin (also rendered as McPhilipin) clan, a scion of the powerful Bourke family, descending from Philip, brother of [[William Liath de Burgh]] (Bourke). The Bourkes initially battled fiercely with the Kingdom of Ireland forces. The revered [[Grace O'Malley]] {{lang-ga|Gr\u00e1inne N\u00ed  Mh\u00e1ille}} of the powerful [[O'Malley (surname)]] dynasty that ruled [[Umhaill]] married into the Bourke family, with her second marriage, to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke]]. In later centuries the Bourke family became part of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, among their descendants were the Brownes of [[Westport House]], holding the titles of Earl of Altamount and Marquess of Sligo.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries [[Umhaill]] and Aughagower saw intense internecine struggles between warring clans and the Tudor [[Kingdom of Ireland]], led by Sir [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]] who sought to establish control of the area, forcing local clans such as the Bourke clan to submit their titles and claims of land to the monarchy, and swear allegiance to the crown, after which their lands would be re-granted to them for their loyalty, under the policy of [[surrender and regrant]].<ref>Right Rev. Monsignor D'Alton, 'History of the Archdicoese of Tuam', 1928,</ref>.\n\n=== Late modern and contemporary ===\nA great part of the population of the parish of Aughagower was lost in the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], and traces of ruins of deserted houses exist in several parts of the parish.<ref>John Keville, 'Aughagower Part 3', Cathair na Mart Volume 4 page 28, 1984</ref>. \n\nThe [[Carrowkennedy ambush]] took place in [[Carrowkennedy]], in the south of Aughagower parish. One of the few encounters of the [[Irish War of Independence]] to take place in [[Connacht]], the [[Carrowkennedy ambush]] was carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) on 2 June 1921, during the Irish War of Independence. An IRA flying column, commanded by Michael Kilroy, ambushed a mobile patrol of the Royal Irish Constabulary Special Reserves ([[Black and Tans]]) at Carrowkennedy, near Westport, County Mayo. It resulted in the deaths of eight of the RIC, including some who were killed by their own rifle grenade. After two hours the RIC surrendered and their weaponry and ammunition were seized by the IRA.{{fact|date=December 2019}} The RIC prisoners were not executed, but released upon their surrender, and this led many members of the successful ambush to seek refuge in the network of safe-houses throughout the counties of Mayo and Galway.\n\n=== Round tower and Abbey ===\n[[File:Aghagower Round Tower 2007 08 12.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Aghagower Round tower]]\nThe ruins of a medieval church adjoins the graveyard of the town's modern Catholic church. It has a well-preserved tenth-century [[Irish round tower]], with the exception of its topmost section and capstone. \n\nThe tower was built between 973 and 1013<ref name=\"T\u00f3char\">T\u00f3char Ph\u00e1draig A Pilgrims Progress - published by Ballintubber Abbey 1989</ref>, a period during which the [[Irish round tower|round tower]] proliferated, wherein they provided a defensive vantage point, a place of safety for church riches and fortification against raids from the north by the Danish, [[Norse-Gaels]] and raiding Irish clans.<ref> John Keville, 'Saints, Chieftains and Landlords' published in three parts in Cathair na Mart Vol.2, no.1, 1982; vol.3, no.1, 1983; vol.4, no, 1984.</ref>\nAccording to legend, the round tower's capstone was struck by lightning, and landed half a mile away on the hill of Tavenish. A local woman is said to have carried the heavy cap stone in her apron to the church, where it still remains today<ref name=\"T\u00f3char\" />  The tower was partly restored in 1969 and leans slightly to the north.<ref name=\"T\u00f3char\" />\n\n=== Ancient monuments and legends ===\nThere are a number of ancient monuments in Aughagower, some of which are locally reputed to trace their origin to the time of St. Patrick's ministry in the parish.\n\n'''Leaba Ph\u00e1draig''' (Patrick's bed) is said to have been a place where [[St. Patrick]] rested, which it has been suggested may have housed a hut or tent, used in the daytime as place of work for St. Patrick.<ref>Brian Mannion, 'Aughagower and its Patrician sites and connections' published in 'Cathair na Mart, Journal of the Westport Historical Society, Vol. 8, No.1, 1988, pages 5-19</ref>\n \n'''Dabhach Ph\u00e1draig''' (Patrick's vat or tub) is a circular bath surrounded by a stone wall, where pilgrims may have washed their feet, and which may have been used by St. Patrick and his household as a washing place. Due to local drainage the well is now dry except in extremely wet weather. A [[sheela na gig]] (Irish: Sighle na gC\u00edoch) was found in a nearby ditch, and the Mayo Historical Society organised for it to be fitted to the outside wall of Dabhach Ph\u00e1draig in 2001. It was moved in 2017 to an internal wall for security and to make it easier to find (the light conditions affect how easily the figure can be made out)<ref>http://www.irelands-sheelanagigs.org/sheelas/westport/</ref>, and it now forms part of Dabhach Ph\u00e1draig's eastern wall.<ref>Brian Mannion, 'Aughagower and its Patrician sites and connections' published in 'Cathair na Mart, Journal of the Westport Historical Society, Vol. 8, No.1, 2018, pages 5-19</ref>\n\n'''St. Patrick's Knee''' is a small stone in the graveyard with a small recess carved out of it, which is filled with water. Local legend states that St. Patrick kneeled on this rock and left the imprint, and the water that gathers in it is thought to be holy. \n\n'''Tobair na Deoch\u00e1in''' (the Well of the Deacons), now dried up, was where pilgrims drank water while performing the pilgrimage. A tree growing over Dabhach Ph\u00e1draig was said to have curative powers. The soil was applied in a poultice, and when the ailment was cured the soil must be returned.<ref> John Keville, 'Cathair na Mart Vol.2, no.1, 1982. </ref>.\n\n'''Cloughundra''' (Also rendered as 'Cloch Andra'). There is a large stone of approximately 150kg, named Cloughundra, which is currently on display on the village green. The local folk-tale states that there was once a giant in Aughagower who used to throw the stone over his shoulder and would throw it \"as far as another man would send a pebble. The stone is there yet and the trace of his fingers in it. A great many strongmen spend their leisure time trying to lift the stone\".<ref> John Keville, 'Cathair na Mart Vol.2, no.1, 1982. </ref>.\n\n'''Leacht Tomaltaigh''' is an ancient monument on the Gorteen-Aughagower townland boundary, just south of where the T\u00f3char Ph\u00e1draig passes. Its mythical origin relates to a tale from St. Patrick's time, that a man tested the claims of the generosity of St. Patrick's household, where nobody in need of food would be turned away. The housekeeper is said to have told himthat there was a cake in the oven, and that when it was baked he could have some. He pretended to be angry and left saying the claims of hospitality were untrue,  after a few hundred yards he fell from his horse to his death and a monument was raised to mark the spot of his death. The explanation of the myth is unlikely for a number of reasons and it is thought that this monument marks the grave of one of St. Patrick's charioteers, Totmael ('bald poll') who is recorded in the Book of Armagh and The Tripartite Life of St. Patrick as having died whilst St. Patrick and his household were travelling to Croagh Patrick, along the T\u00f3char. The monument is still standing in its repaired and mortared form. It stands approxiamtely 2.5 feet tall, although it was once a much larger monument, at a height of 6 feet.<ref>Brian Mannion, 'Aughagower and its Patrician sites and connections' published in 'Cathair na Mart, Journal of the Westport Historical Society, Vol. 8, No.1, 1988, pages 5-19</ref> \n\n'''[[Lankill Standing Stone]]''' is a [[Menhir|standing stone]] and [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] located in [[County Mayo]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archaeology.ie/sites/default/files/media/pdf/monuments-in-state-care-mayo.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Monuments in State Care : Ownership & Guardianship : Mayo|date=4 March 2009|website=Archaeology.ie|accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref> It stands in a field {{Convert|2.7|km|abbr=on}} west-southwest of Aughagower, south of [[Knappaghbeg Lough]].

It is bordered to the northeast by Mace South, to the south by Tevinish East, to the southwest by Aughagower, to the west by Gorteen, and to the northwest by the Deerpark. Cloondacon is situated on [[Patrick's Causeway|Tochar Ph\u00e1draig]], the ancient route from [[Ballintubber Abbey]] through Aughagower to [[Croagh Patrick]]. The name Cluain D\u00e1 Chon refers to an ancient legend according to which a pagan chieftain set two [[Irish Wolfhound|wolfhounds]] on [[Saint Patrick]]. Instead of attacking Patrick, the hounds licked his hands. The chieftain was moved by this and became a Christian. According to an alternative version, St. Patrick made the sign of the cross over them, and the two hounds were swallowed up in an oval shaped hole called Poll na gCon (the hole of the hounds).{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of towns and villages in the Republic of Ireland|List of towns and villages in Ireland]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}{{Commons category|Aghagower}}{{County Mayo}}c\n\n[[Category:Towns and villages in County Mayo]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use Irish English|date=July 2015}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = Aughagower\n|other_name             = {{pad top italic|Achadh Ghobhair}}\n|settlement_type        = Town\n|image_skyline          = Aghagower, Co Mayo - Round Tower (geograph 5220719).jpg\n|image_caption          = Aghagower's round tower\n|pushpin_map            = Ireland\n|pushpin_label_position = right\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Ireland\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of Ireland|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Connacht]]\n|subdivision_type3      = [[Counties of Ireland|County]]\n|subdivision_name3      = [[County Mayo]]\n|established_title      = \n|established_date       = \n|unit_pref              = Metric\n|area_footnotes         = \n|area_total_km2         = \n|population_as_of       = \n|population_footnotes   = \n|population_total       = \n|population             = \n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|timezone1              = [[West European Time|WET]] \n|utc_offset1            = +0\n|timezone1_DST          = [[Irish Standard Time|IST]] ([[Western European Summer Time|WEST]]) \n|utc_offset1_DST        = -1\n|coordinates            = {{coord|53.7635|-9.464|dim:100000_region:IE|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes    = \n|elevation_m            = 157\n|blank_name             = [[Irish grid reference system|Irish Grid Reference]]\n|blank_info             = {{iem4ibx|M034803}}\n|website                = \n|footnotes              = \n}}\n'''Aughagower''' or '''Aghagower''' ({{Irish place name|Achadh Fhobhair|Field of the Springs}}) is a small village in rural [[County Mayo]] in western [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

A tree growing over Dabhach Ph\u00e1draig was said to have curative powers. The soil was applied in a poultice, and when the ailment was cured the soil must be returned.<ref> John Keville, 'Cathair na Mart Vol.2, no.1, 1982. </ref>.\n\n'''Cloughundra''' (Also rendered as 'Cloch Andra'). There is a large stone of approximately 150kg, named Cloughundra, which is currently on display on the village green. The local folk-tale states that there was once a giant in Aughagower who used to throw the stone over his shoulder and would throw it \"as far as another man would send a pebble. The stone is there yet and the trace of his fingers in it. A great many strongmen spend their leisure time trying to lift the stone\".<ref> John Keville, 'Cathair na Mart Vol.2, no.1, 1982. </ref>.\n\n'''Leacht Tomaltaigh''' is an ancient monument on the Gorteen-Aughagower townland boundary, just south of where the T\u00f3char Ph\u00e1draig passes. Its mythical origin relates to a tale from St. Patrick's time, that a man tested the claims of the generosity of St. Patrick's household, where nobody in need of food would be turned away. The housekeeper is said to have told himthat there was a cake in the oven, and that when it was baked he could have some. He pretended to be angry and left saying the claims of hospitality were untrue,  after a few hundred yards he fell from his horse to his death and a monument was raised to mark the spot of his death. The explanation of the myth is unlikely for a number of reasons and it is thought that this monument marks the grave of one of St. Patrick's charioteers, Totmael ('bald poll') who is recorded in the Book of Armagh and The Tripartite Life of St. Patrick as having died whilst St. Patrick and his household were travelling to Croagh Patrick, along the T\u00f3char. The monument is still standing in its repaired and mortared form. It stands approxiamtely 2.5 feet tall, although it was once a much larger monument, at a height of 6 feet.<ref>Brian Mannion, 'Aughagower and its Patrician sites and connections' published in 'Cathair na Mart, Journal of the Westport Historical Society, Vol. 8, No.1, 1988, pages 5-19</ref> \n\n'''[[Lankill Standing Stone]]''' is a [[Menhir|standing stone]] and [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] located in [[County Mayo]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archaeology.ie/sites/default/files/media/pdf/monuments-in-state-care-mayo.pdf|format=PDF|title=National Monuments in State Care : Ownership & Guardianship : Mayo|date=4 March 2009|website=Archaeology.ie|accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref> It stands in a field {{Convert|2.7|km|abbr=on}} west-southwest of Aughagower, south of [[Knappaghbeg Lough]].

Fairborne petitioned in August that his pay as commander-in-chief might not be taken away. Ossory died on 30 July, and Fairborne remained as sole defender of Tangier.\n\n==Death==\nThe Moors made a further attack in October. On 24 October, Fairborne, riding out of the town to inspect the defences, took part in a slight skirmish and was mortally wounded by a shot.

He is credited with scoring multiple victories during the conflict flying a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]. For actions during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] he was awarded the [[Air Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=William Henry Leder |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24645703/william-henry-leder |website=Find a Grave}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nLeder was born in [[Flasher, North Dakota]] in 1918, the son of Helena Augusta Wall and Carl Benjamin Leder. He attended [[Mandan High School]] in [[Mandan, North Dakota]]. After high school, he attended North Dakota State Teachers College for four years and graduated with a B.A. Degree. He taught in public schools in North Dakota for two years before enlisting. He enlisted in the Navy on April 12, 1941.<ref>U.S. World War II Navy Muster Rolls, 1938-1949</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:VF-10 pilots on USS Enterprise (CV-6) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|200px|VF-10 pilots on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] (William H. Leder in front row on knee, far left).]] Leder was initially stationed at the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul_Joint_Air_Reserve_Station|Naval Reserve Aviation Base]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. He became an aviation cadet on October 1, 1941 and attended flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. He was commissioned an ensign on May 15, 1942. On May 18 of that same year, he married Kathryn Silvia Loran<ref>Florida, County Marriage Records, 1823-1982</ref> before being transferred to Aircraft Carrier Training Group [[NAS San Diego]] in June. \n\nIn August of 1942, he joined [[VF-10|Fighting Squadron 10]], also known as the \"Grim Reapers\", before being shipped out to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].<ref>National Archives Veterans' Service Records</ref>\n\nLeder flew as a member of what was known as the [[Cactus Air Force]]. He was part of a large assembly of allied air power assigned to the [[Solomon Islands]] in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. As a member of [[VF-10]], he was stationed on the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'']] during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] and flew multiple air combat patrol missions in defense of his carrier group against enemy Japanese forces.\n\nIn his first air combat engagement on October 26th, 1942, he shot down at least one enemy dive bomber in defense of the ''Enterprise''. \n\nOn November 13, 1942, he was part of a four plane flight on combat patrol over the ''Enterprise'' that intercepted and shot down a Japanese bomber shadowing the task force. \n\nLater on January 30, 1943, he shot down a torpedo bomber attempting to attack the cruiser [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|USS ''Chicago'']] as it sat damaged near [[Rennell Island]].\n\n== Air Medal ==\nLeder was nominated by his commander for the Distinguished Flying Cross and was ultimately awarded the [[Air Medal]] for his actions in the Pacific.\n\n'''Citation:'''\n\n:Conspicuous courage and skill in air combat with the enemy. On October 26, 1942, while defending your carrier from air attack in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, you destroyed one enemy dive bomber and probably destroyed another before they could release their bombs. In November 13, 1942, while a member of the combat patrol over the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, you assisted in shooting down one four engine patrol bomber which was attempting to shadow your task force. On January 30, 1943, while on combat patrol over the damaged cruiser USS CHICAGO in the vicinity of Rennell Island, yourself and three other pilots intercepted, by sight contact, an enemy heavily armed twin engine torpedo bomber which was preceding an enemy attack group of twelve torpedo bombers for the obvious purpose of reconnoitering our forces and directing the attack. After a running fight lasting twenty minutes and carried on at speeds approaching 300 m.p.h., you succeeded in shooting the enemy down in flames. Your courage, tenacity, and skill were exemplary and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.\n\n== Later career and death ==\n[[File:Bill Leder Headstone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial headstone at [[Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park]].]]\nAfter action in the Pacific, Leder moved to [[Woodinville, Washington]] and was stationed at the Ellensburg Army Airfield (today [[Bowers Airport|Bowers Field]]) in [[Ellensburg, Washington]] as a [[test pilot]].

The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe fancast must have released four or more episodes by the end of the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|dramatic presentation category]]. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast.<ref name=\"thacats\"/> The name of the award is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Fan (person)|fan]] and [[podcast]]. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.\n\nDuring the 9 years the award has been active, 24 fancasts by 66 people have been nominated, and 6 of those fancasts have won. ''[[SF Squeecast]]'', created by a team of five people, won the award in both 2012 and 2013, and declined to be nominated for 2014.<ref name=\"Squeecastdeclined\"/> ''[[SF Signal|SF Signal Podcast]]'', run by Patrick Hester, won the 2014 award, and ''Galactic Suburbia Podcast'', run by Alisa Krasnostein, Alexandra Pierce, Tansy Rayner Roberts, and Andrew Finch, won the 2015 award. No award was given in 2016, and ''Tea and Jeopardy'', by Emma Newman and Peter Newman, won in 2017 on its third nomination. ''Ditch Diggers'', by [[Mur Lafferty]] and Matt Wallace, won the 2018 award in its second year of nominations, and ''Our Opinions Are Correct'', by [[Annalee Newitz]] and [[Charlie Jane Anders]], won the 2019 award. ''Galactic Suburbia Podcast'' has received the most nominations at eight, followed by ''The Coode Street Podcast'' at seven.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the awards presentation constitutes its central event. Supporting members are those who do not attend the convention itself, and pay a smaller membership fee as a result. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The fancasts on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of fancasts that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/> Members are permitted to vote \"no award\", if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that \"no award\" takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in the Best Fancast category in 2016.<ref name=\"Hugo16\"/>\n\n==Winners and nominees==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the story was first published.

Peter Newman at the Hugo Award Ceremony at Worldcon in Helsinki 2017.jpg|thumb|Peter and Emma Newman accepting the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Fancast]]\nThe '''Hugo Award for Best Fancast''', is one of the [[Hugo Awards]], and is awarded to the best non-professional audio or video periodical devoted to science fiction, fantasy, or related subjects. The Hugo Awards have been described as \"a fine showcase for speculative fiction\" and \"the best known literary award for science fiction writing\".<ref name=\"GuardianHugo\"/><ref name=\"LitroHugo\"/>\n\nThe fancast must have released four or more episodes by the end of the previous calendar year, at least one of which appeared in that year, and it must not qualify for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|dramatic presentation category]]. It must also not provide or be published by an entity that provides a quarter or more of the income of any one person working on the fancast.<ref name=\"thacats\"/> The name of the award is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Fan (person)|fan]] and [[podcast]]. The Hugo Award for Best Fancast was first proposed as a category after the 2011 awards, and then appeared as a temporary category at the 2012 awards. Temporary awards are not required to be repeated in following years. The 2013 awards, however, did repeat the category, and afterwards it was ratified as a permanent category, and will appear in all future years.\n\nDuring the 9 years the award has been active, 24 fancasts by 66 people have been nominated, and 6 of those fancasts have won. ''[[SF Squeecast]]'', created by a team of five people, won the award in both 2012 and 2013, and declined to be nominated for 2014.<ref name=\"Squeecastdeclined\"/> ''[[SF Signal|SF Signal Podcast]]'', run by Patrick Hester, won the 2014 award, and ''Galactic Suburbia Podcast'', run by Alisa Krasnostein, Alexandra Pierce, Tansy Rayner Roberts, and Andrew Finch, won the 2015 award. No award was given in 2016, and ''Tea and Jeopardy'', by Emma Newman and Peter Newman, won in 2017 on its third nomination. ''Ditch Diggers'', by [[Mur Lafferty]] and Matt Wallace, won the 2018 award in its second year of nominations, and ''Our Opinions Are Correct'', by [[Annalee Newitz]] and [[Charlie Jane Anders]], won the 2019 award. ''Galactic Suburbia Podcast'' has received the most nominations at eight, followed by ''The Coode Street Podcast'' at seven.\n\n==Selection==\nHugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the awards presentation constitutes its central event. Supporting members are those who do not attend the convention itself, and pay a smaller membership fee as a result. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The fancasts on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of fancasts that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name=\"thaabout\"/> Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.<ref name=\"2017change\"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.<ref name=\"LocusHugoinfo\"/><ref name=\"worldcon\"/> Members are permitted to vote \"no award\", if they feel that none of the nominees is deserving of the award that year, and in the case that \"no award\" takes the majority the Hugo is not given in that category. This happened in the Best Fancast category in 2016.<ref name=\"Hugo16\"/>\n\n==Winners and nominees==\nIn the following table, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony, rather than when the story was first published.
