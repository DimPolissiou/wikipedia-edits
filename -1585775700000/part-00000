This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long-term. The [[dot-com bubble]] burst at the start of the 21st century and destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.00 (i.e., 1\u00a2 per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion\n.

The Fire Phone was meant to deliver media streaming options but the venture failed, resulting in Amazon registering a $170 million loss.  This would also lead to the Fire Phone production being stopped the following year.  In August of the same year Amazon would finalize the acquisition of Twitch, a social video gaming streaming site for $970 million.  This new acquisition would be integrated to the game production division of Amazon.\n\n[[File:Day 1 Tower Seattle WA Jan 17.jpg|thumb|[[Day 1 (building)|Day 1 building]] in Seattle]]\nIn June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire [[Whole Foods]], a high-end [[supermarket]] [[chain store|chain]] with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.<ref name=\"WF\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/16/investing/amazon-buying-whole-foods/index.html |title=Amazon is buying Whole Foods for $13.7 billion |last1=La Monica |first1=Paul |last2=Isidore |first2=Chris |website=CNN Money |publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref> The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge [[Walmart]]'s supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer.

This comparatively slow growth caused stockholders to complain that the company was not reaching profitability fast enough to justify their investment or even survive in the long-term. The [[dot-com bubble]] burst at the start of the 21st century and destroyed many e-companies in the process, but Amazon survived and moved forward beyond the tech crash to become a huge player in online sales. The company finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $0.00 (i.e., 1\u00a2 per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion\n.

The Fire Phone was meant to deliver media streaming options but the venture failed, resulting in Amazon registering a $170 million loss.  This would also lead to the Fire Phone production being stopped the following year.  In August of the same year Amazon would finalize the acquisition of Twitch, a social video gaming streaming site for $970 million.

This was especially controversial as the article appeared whilst the GMC proceedings were still under away and was published on the first day of Meadow's defence.

Huth and Goins are both suing the actor for damages related to their alleged sexual assaults. Although the statute of limitations has run out for most other accusers to sue directly for their alleged assault, multiple accusers have filed [[defamation]] lawsuits claiming that Cosby had kept calling them liars throughout 2014. Dickinson, Hill, Ruehli, and McKee have filed individual lawsuits. Green, Serignese, Traitz, Bowman, Tarshis, Moritz, and Leslie are also involved in a combined lawsuit against Cosby. Most lawsuits that are active are currently on hold awaiting the outcome of his criminal trial. Some are still allowed to file motions and depose witnesses, with the exception of Cosby himself. However, most judges have indicated that a civil trial will not take place until after the criminal trial is held.\n\nIn 2005, Constand sued Cosby. The parties settled the case on confidential terms in 2006. In July 2015, after portions of the sealed deposition were released, Cosby released a statement saying the \"only reason\" why he settled \"was because it would have been embarrassing in those days to put all those women on the stand, and his family had no clue.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/bill-cosby-deposition-reveals-he-806963|title=Bill Cosby Deposition Reveals He Gave Women Quaaludes for Sex|last=Gardner|first=Eriq|date=July 6, 2015 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> During summer 2015, both Cosby's legal team and Constand's lawyer Troiani filed motions accusing the other party of having broken the confidentiality agreement that was part of the 2006 settlement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202733285173/Plaintiff-Rebuts-Cosby-Allegation-of-Settlement-Breach |title=Plaintiff Rebuts Cosby Allegation of Settlement Breach |last=McLellan |first=Lizzy |date=July 29, 2015 |publisher=The Legal Intelligencer |access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> The primary issue alleged by Cosby was that a court reporter released the full transcript of his deposition, blaming Troiani for this act<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/article/bill-cosby-accuser-andrea-constand-gay-court-filing |title=Bill Cosby's Original Accuser Andrea Constand Calls Him a 'Narcissist' Who Missed Cues That She's Gay |last= Ehrich Dowd |first=Kathy |last2=Weisensee Egan |first2=Nicole |date=July 28, 2015 |work=People |access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> and seeking sanctions against Troiani.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/article/bill-cosby-admits-affairs-drugs-deposition-released |title=Bill Cosby Admits and Defends His Extramarital Affairs, Giving Women Drugs, in Newly Released Court Documents |last=Carlson |first=Adam |date=July 19, 2015 |work=People |access-date=January 3, 2016 }}</ref> A federal judge had unsealed portions of the evidence from the 2005 lawsuit, but that did not include Cosby's statements made [[under oath]].<ref>{{cite news |author=no by-line (Tribune wire reports) |title=Cosby lawyers: Release of deposition broke settlement terms |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-bill-cosby-lawyers-20150723-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |date=July 23, 2015 |access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe significance of the availability of the deposition is that it contains admissions made by Cosby about his tactics in dealing with other women, including the use of \"powerful sedatives [including Quaaludes] in a calculated pursuit of young women\", according to a ''New York Times'' summary.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bowley |first=Graham |date=July 18, 2015 |title=Bill Cosby in Deposition said drugs and fame helped him seduce women |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/19/arts/bill-cosby-deposition-reveals-calculated-pursuit-of-young-women-using-fame-drugs-and-deceit.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, USA |access-date=January 3, 2016}}</ref> The transcript of the full testimony was obtained by ''Times'' from a court-reporting service, where it was publicly available.

But the insurer has also filed lawsuits related to both cases, aiming for [[declaratory relief]] that it is not responsible.\n\nCosby's homeowners insurance does cover him for \"personal injury\", which is defined in his policy as including \"bodily injury\"; \"shock, emotional distress, mental injury\"; \"invasion of privacy\"; and \"defamation, libel, or slander\".

In her opinion, O'Connell looked at the \"arising out of\" exclusion noted above and declares the meaning is ambiguous. \"The Court finds that both Plaintiff's broad interpretation and Defendant's narrow interpretation of 'arising out of' are reasonable{{nbsp}}... The sexual misconduct exclusion could reasonably be read to require that Dickinson's claims merely relate to sexual misconduct, or that Dickinson's claims be proximately caused by the sexual misconduct\", she wrote.\n\nSince ambiguous terms are interpreted in favor of finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. She looked at the Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. \"For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though he knew that she had been in a rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage{{nbsp}}... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'\", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a \"mixed\" action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling does not apply to the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable.<ref name=Cosby_Dismisses_AIG_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bill-cosby-scores-victory-against-insurance-company-203210562.html;_ylt=A0LEV7rmh0dWcyEATL0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Bill Cosby Scores Victory Against Insurance Company|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref> AIG plans to appeal this ruling.<ref name=Cosby_AIG_Appeal_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-aig-s-home-insurance-is-covering-bill-cosby-s-legal-costs-200246340.html;_ylt=A0LEVjs5KOhWhwIAEi0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Why AIG is paying Bill Cosby's legal costs|date=March 14, 2016|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA Massachusetts federal judge, Mark G.

The fact they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment.\" This statement was also posted to the front page of Cosby's official website.

But the insurer has also filed lawsuits related to both cases, aiming for [[declaratory relief]] that it is not responsible.\n\nCosby's homeowners insurance does cover him for \"personal injury\", which is defined in his policy as including \"bodily injury\"; \"shock, emotional distress, mental injury\"; \"invasion of privacy\"; and \"defamation, libel, or slander\". However, the policy contains an exclusion for \"sexual, physical or mental abuse\", setting the stage for a potentially novel legal battle over whether a defamation claim about the denial of sexual abuse is covered.<ref name=\"AIG_Lawsuit\"/>\n\nIn September 2015, Cosby filed a motion to either dismiss AIG's lawsuit or put it on hold.

In her opinion, O'Connell looked at the \"arising out of\" exclusion noted above and declares the meaning is ambiguous. \"The Court finds that both Plaintiff's broad interpretation and Defendant's narrow interpretation of 'arising out of' are reasonable{{nbsp}}... The sexual misconduct exclusion could reasonably be read to require that Dickinson's claims merely relate to sexual misconduct, or that Dickinson's claims be proximately caused by the sexual misconduct\", she wrote.\n\nSince ambiguous terms are interpreted in favor of finding coverage, Cosby prevailed. O'Connell gave a second independent reason for finding in Cosby's favor. She looked at the Dickinson complaint and concluded that there are allegations independent of sexual misconduct. \"For example, allegations that Defendant 'intentionally drugged' Dickinson 'even though he knew that she had been in a rehab center for addiction a few months before' could reasonably be interpreted as independent of sexual misconduct, and therefore, within the Policies' coverage{{nbsp}}... Similarly, the Dickinson Complaint alleges that Defendant's statements contain numerous implications about Dickinson, including the implication that 'Dickinson has copied the claims made publicly by other women against Defendant' and 'the implication that Ms. Dickinson's rape disclosure is a lie and that therefore she is a liar'\", she wrote. As courts impose coverage in a \"mixed\" action, Cosby prevailed here as well but this ruling does not apply to the Massachusetts case, where AIG and Cosby are still fighting to determine who is liable.<ref name=Cosby_Dismisses_AIG_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bill-cosby-scores-victory-against-insurance-company-203210562.html;_ylt=A0LEV7rmh0dWcyEATL0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Bill Cosby Scores Victory Against Insurance Company|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=November 13, 2015}}</ref> AIG plans to appeal this ruling.<ref name=Cosby_AIG_Appeal_Dickinson>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/why-aig-s-home-insurance-is-covering-bill-cosby-s-legal-costs-200246340.html;_ylt=A0LEVjs5KOhWhwIAEi0PxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByMjB0aG5zBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw--|title=Why AIG is paying Bill Cosby's legal costs|date=March 14, 2016|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nA Massachusetts federal judge, Mark G.
