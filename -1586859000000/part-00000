He was most recently the head coach of [[Premier League]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nAfter a modest playing career spent mostly in Spain's [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]], Emery transitioned into coaching after retiring in 2004. He began at [[Lorca Deportiva CF|Lorca Deportiva]], where he achieved promotion to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in his first season, and was subsequently awarded the [[Miguel Mu\u00f1oz Trophy]]. He then joined [[UD Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]], who he led to promotion to [[La Liga]] for the first time in the club's history. This earned him a move to La Liga heavyweights [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], where he regularly led the team to top three finishes. After leaving Valencia, he coached [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] for six months, before moving to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in 2013.\n\nAt Sevilla, Emery gained plaudits for his style of football, and shrewdness in the transfer market alongside [[Monchi]], the club's director of football. He achieved an unprecedented three consecutive [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] victories, which earned him a move to French club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) in 2016. In his first year managing PSG, he led them to a stylized [[Treble (association football)#Domestic trebles|domestic treble]], winning the [[2016\u201317 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], [[2016\u201317 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]] and [[2016 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|Troph\u00e9e des Champions]], while finishing second in the year-end tables for [[2016\u201317 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/football/article/2017/05/28/football-vers-une-deuxieme-saison-au-psg-pour-l-entraineur-unai-emery_5135018_1616938.html |title=Football: vers une deuxi\u00e8me saison au PSG pour l\u2019entra\u00eeneur Unai Emery?|trans-title=Football: second season in sight at PSG for coach Unai Emery? |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |author=R\u00e9mi Dupr\u00e9 |language=French |date=28 May 2017 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref> Emery exceeded this in his second season with a domestic quadruple of [[2017\u201318 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]], the [[2017\u201318 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], the [[2017\u201318 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]] and [[2017 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|Troph\u00e9e des Champions]].\n\nAfter the expiry of his contract with PSG, Emery was appointed head coach of English club Arsenal in May 2018, following the resignation of long-serving Arsenal manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]], and reached the [[2019 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]] in his first season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48171988 |title=Valencia 2\u20134 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Steve Sutcliffe |date=9 May 2019 |accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> Emery was dismissed as head coach in November 2019 after a series of poor results.\n\n==Early life and playing career==\nEmery was born in [[Hondarribia]], [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2012/09/18/actualidad/1348004938_946271.html |title=El incordio de Hondarribia|trans-title=The nuisance from Hondarribia |newspaper=[[El Pa\u00eds]] |language=Spanish |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariovasco.com/deportes/futbol/201703/07/emery-hondarribia-pelear-champions-20170306183400.html |title=Emery, de Hondarribia a pelear por la Champions|trans-title=Emery, from Hondarribia to fighting for the Champions |newspaper=[[El Diario Vasco]] |language=Spanish |date=7 March 2017 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> His father and grandfather, named [[Juan Emery|Juan]] and [[Antonio Emery|Antonio]] respectively, were also footballers, both [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]s.

He was most recently the head coach of [[Premier League]] club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].\n\nAfter a modest playing career spent mostly in Spain's [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n]], Emery transitioned into coaching after retiring in 2004. He began at [[Lorca Deportiva CF|Lorca Deportiva]], where he achieved promotion to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in his first season, and was subsequently awarded the [[Miguel Mu\u00f1oz Trophy]]. He then joined [[UD Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]], who he led to promotion to [[La Liga]] for the first time in the club's history. This earned him a move to La Liga heavyweights [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], where he regularly led the team to top three finishes. After leaving Valencia, he coached [[FC Spartak Moscow|Spartak Moscow]] for six months, before moving to [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in 2013.\n\nAt Sevilla, Emery gained plaudits for his style of football, and shrewdness in the transfer market alongside [[Monchi]], the club's director of football. He achieved an unprecedented three consecutive [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] victories, which earned him a move to French club [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG) in 2016. In his first year managing PSG, he led them to a stylized [[Treble (association football)#Domestic trebles|domestic treble]], winning the [[2016\u201317 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], [[2016\u201317 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]] and [[2016 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|Troph\u00e9e des Champions]], while finishing second in the year-end tables for [[2016\u201317 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/football/article/2017/05/28/football-vers-une-deuxieme-saison-au-psg-pour-l-entraineur-unai-emery_5135018_1616938.html |title=Football: vers une deuxi\u00e8me saison au PSG pour l\u2019entra\u00eeneur Unai Emery?|trans-title=Football: second season in sight at PSG for coach Unai Emery? |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |author=R\u00e9mi Dupr\u00e9 |language=French |date=28 May 2017 |accessdate=29 May 2017}}</ref> Emery exceeded this in his second season with a domestic quadruple of [[2017\u201318 Ligue 1|Ligue 1]], the [[2017\u201318 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], the [[2017\u201318 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]] and [[2017 Troph\u00e9e des Champions|Troph\u00e9e des Champions]].\n\nAfter the expiry of his contract with PSG, Emery was appointed head coach of English club Arsenal in May 2018, following the resignation of long-serving Arsenal manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]], and reached the [[2019 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]] in his first season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48171988 |title=Valencia 2\u20134 Arsenal |publisher=BBC Sport |author=Steve Sutcliffe |date=9 May 2019 |accessdate=7 December 2019}}</ref> Emery was dismissed as head coach in November 2019 after a series of poor results.\n\n==Early life and playing career==\nEmery was born in [[Hondarribia]], [[Gipuzkoa]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2012/09/18/actualidad/1348004938_946271.html |title=El incordio de Hondarribia|trans-title=The nuisance from Hondarribia |newspaper=[[El Pa\u00eds]] |language=Spanish |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariovasco.com/deportes/futbol/201703/07/emery-hondarribia-pelear-champions-20170306183400.html |title=Emery, de Hondarribia a pelear por la Champions|trans-title=Emery, from Hondarribia to fighting for the Champions |newspaper=[[El Diario Vasco]] |language=Spanish |date=7 March 2017 |accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref> His father and grandfather, named [[Juan Emery|Juan]] and [[Antonio Emery|Antonio]] respectively, were also footballers, both [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]s.

With a line-up comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they are regarded as the [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|most influential band of all time]].{{sfn|Hasted|2017|p=425}} The group were integral to the development of [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and [[popular music]]'s recognition as an art form.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}} Rooted in [[skiffle]], [[beat music|beat]] and 1950s [[rock and roll]], their sound incorporated elements of [[classical music]] and [[traditional pop]] in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from [[sentimental ballad|ballads]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]] to [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]]. As pioneers in [[Recording practices of the Beatles|recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}\n\nLed by primary songwriters [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] over three years from 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act and producer [[George Martin]] guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"[[Beatlemania]]\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"[[British Invasion]]\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music act of all time]], with certified sales of over 183&nbsp;million units in the US and estimated sales of 600&nbsp;million units worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19800654|title=From Fab Four to fabulously rich|last=Hotten|first=Russell|date=2012-10-04|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> They hold the record for most number-one albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]], [[List of artists by number of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles|most number-one hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and most singles sold in the UK.

In 2008, the group topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the all-time most successful artists on the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to [[the Quarrymen]] after discovering that another local group was already using the name.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=47\u201352}} Fifteen-year-old [[Paul McCartney]] joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}} In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend [[George Harrison]] to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.</ref> and they enlisted him as their [[lead guitar]]ist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}}\n\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the [[Liverpool College of Art]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=103}} The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=17}} were playing [[rock and roll]] whenever they could find a drummer.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=742\u2013743}} Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to ''Beatals'', as a tribute to [[Buddy Holly]] and [[the Crickets]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Gilliland| 1969|loc=show 27, track 4}} They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief [[The Beat Ballad Show Tour|tour of Scotland]] as the backing group for pop singer and fellow [[Liverpudlian]] [[Johnny Gentle]]. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to ''The Beatles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18\u201322}}\n\n[[Allan Williams]], the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them [[The Beatles in Hamburg|in Hamburg]], but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired [[Pete Best]] in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, left four days later, contracted to club owner [[Bruno Koschmider]] for what would be a 3{{frac|2}}-month residency.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=21\u201325}} Beatles historian [[Mark Lewisohn]] writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the [[Reeperbahn|red-light area]] comes to life&nbsp;... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=22}}\n\n[[File:Reeperbahn.jpg|alt=The Reeperbahn nightclub as seen from the sidewalk with its entrance lighted.

After closing Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the [[Kaiserkeller]] in October.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=23}} When he learned they had been performing at the rival [[Top Ten Club]] in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24, 33}} and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=88}} The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=24}} One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=24\u201325}} Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fianc\u00e9e [[Astrid Kirchherr]],{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=25}} who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=222\u2013224}}\n\nDuring the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used [[Phenmetrazine|Preludin]] both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66\u201367}} In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \"[[exi (subculture)|exi]]\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=32}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=76}} When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=89, 94}} Producer [[Bert Kaempfert]] contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as [[Tony Sheridan]]'s [[backup band|backing band]] on a series of recordings for [[Polydor Records]].{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 27, track 4}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=249\u2013251}} As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=450}} Credited to \"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\", the single \"[[My Bonnie]]\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the ''[[Musikmarkt]]'' chart.{{sfn|Everett|2001|p=100}}\n\nAfter the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing [[beat music|Merseybeat]] movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=33}} In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at [[The Cavern Club]], they encountered [[Brian Epstein]], a local record-store owner and music columnist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84\u201387}} He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence&nbsp;... [a] star quality.\"{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=34\u201335}}\n\nEpstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=84\u201388}} Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=10}} Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what was later determined as a [[cerebral hemorrhage|brain haemorrhage]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}}\n\nEpstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2013|p=612, 629}} After a New Year's Day audition, [[The Beatles' Decca audition|Decca Records rejected the band]] with the comment \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=67}} However, three months later, producer [[George Martin]] signed the Beatles to [[EMI]]'s [[Parlophone]] label.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=56}}\n\n[[File:Abbey Rd Studios.jpg|thumb|right|Main entrance at Abbey Road Studios|alt=A flight of stone steps leads from an asphalt car park up to the main entrance of a white two-story building.

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including [[folk-rock]], [[country music|country]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[baroque pop]], without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}}}}\n\nIn ''The Beatles as Musicians'', [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed \u2013 as a means to entertain \u2013 a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=9}}\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist \u2013 a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=12}} MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nThe band's earliest influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=140, 660, 856\u2013858, 881}} During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=660}} Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis.

Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=278}} They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", for instance, is \"cast in the {{lang|en-US|mold}} of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=402}}\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by [[Martin C. Strong|Martin Strong]] as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\".{{sfn|Strong|2004|p=108}} Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" and \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". The influence of [[Indian classical music]] was evident in Harrison's \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\", \"[[Love You To]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\" \u2013 Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the [[raga]] form in miniature\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=406, 462\u2013463}}\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song \u2013 more sophisticated than pop&nbsp;... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song \u2013 classical or vernacular \u2013 that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=196}} Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles&nbsp;... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=43}}\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained ''in parallel'' their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\"{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=256}} As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"[[Revolution 9]]\" (whose [[musique concr\u00e8te]] approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's [[country music|country]] song \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\", Harrison's [[rock ballad]] \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", and the \"[[Heavy metal music#Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s|proto-metal]] roar\" of McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\".<ref name=\"White Album AllMusic\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=''The Beatles [White Album]'' \u2013 The Beatles |publisher=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202730/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Contribution of George Martin ===\n[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|right|thumb|alt=The Beatles with George Martin in the studio in the mid-1960s|Martin (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s]]\n[[George Martin]]'s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=721}} He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=121, 290}} Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=158}} Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something [[baroque music|baroque]]\" to a particular recording.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=290}} In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and [[Brass instrument|brass]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=382, 405, 409, 443, 584}}\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which '[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]' is an outstanding example.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:\n\n{{blockquote|Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality&nbsp;... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work&nbsp;\u2013 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...&nbsp;I always saw him as an aural [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time&nbsp;... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve&nbsp;... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, ''Pepper'' would never have been the album it was. Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked, who knows?{{sfn|Martin|1979|pp=205\u2013206}}}}\n\nHarrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: \"I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness \u2013 we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\"{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=264}}\n\n=== In the studio ===\n{{see also|Recording practices of the Beatles}}\n\nMaking innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards \u2013 any of these might be incorporated into their music.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}} Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, [[Ken Townsend]] and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from ''Rubber Soul'' and, especially, ''Revolver'' onwards.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}}\n\nAlong with innovative studio techniques such as [[audio signal processing|sound effects]], unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, [[double tracking]] and [[vari-speed]] recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the [[swarmandal]] in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} and the [[clavioline]], an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=259}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Main|Cultural impact of the Beatles}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles on Green Hill in Almaty, Kazakhstan.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|alt=A monument of the English rock band the Beatles in Almaty, Kazakhstan|''The Beatles Monument'' in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\n\nFormer ''Rolling Stone'' associate editor [[Robert Greenfield]] compared the Beatles to [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original&nbsp;...

The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion \u2013 19 or 20% \u2013 and Brian Epstein's \u2013 9 or 10% \u2013 which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=169\u201371, 368\u2013369}}{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=178}} In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75&nbsp;million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5&nbsp;million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25&nbsp;million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=37\u201338}} At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=42}}\n\nHarrison created [[Harrisongs]] to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"[[Taxman]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=45}} The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"[[What Goes On (The Beatles song)|What Goes On]]\" and \"[[Flying (The Beatles song)|Flying]]\", were also Northern Songs copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with [[Apple Corps|Apple Publishing]] while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created [[Startling Music]], which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=351}}\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company [[Associated Television]] (ATV), founded by impresario [[Lew Grade]], without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=369\u2013372}} The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in [[City of London|the City]].\"{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=372}} By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973.{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=296}} In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=236}}\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=129}} According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \u00a320&nbsp;million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \u00a35&nbsp;million bid that was rejected.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=130}} According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \u00a321\u201325&nbsp;million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a [[takeover]] by Australian business magnate [[Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court]] for \u00a360&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=130, 139}}\n\nIn 1985, [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV for a reported $47.5&nbsp;million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=140, 174, 176}} In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110&nbsp;million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with [[Sony]], creating a new company, [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=198}} In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750&nbsp;million.<ref>Christman, Ed. \"Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing\" ''Billboard'' 30 September 2016</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33{{frac|3}}% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs \u2013 \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\" \u2013 were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=192\u2013193}} in 1978,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=13&ti=1,13&SC=Author&SA=Ardmore%20%26%20Beechwood%2C%20Ltd%2E&PID=Upy2LYQ_qgX3JEfWR3-tuPzH0eAB&SEQ=20190215123104&SID=4 |title=Public Catalog |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=19 May 1978 |website=cocatalog.loc.gov |publisher=U.S. Copyright Office |access-date=15 February 2019 |quote=}}</ref> and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=536}} On 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in the [[United States district court]] against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon\u2013McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018.

With a line-up comprising [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they are regarded as the [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|most influential band of all time]].{{sfn|Hasted|2017|p=425}} The group were integral to the development of [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] and [[popular music]]'s recognition as an art form.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}} Rooted in [[skiffle]], [[beat music|beat]] and 1950s [[rock and roll]], their sound incorporated elements of [[classical music]] and [[traditional pop]] in innovative ways; the band later explored music styles ranging from [[sentimental ballad|ballads]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]] to [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]]. As pioneers in [[Recording practices of the Beatles|recording]], songwriting and artistic presentation, the group revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the [[Baby boomers|era's youth]] and sociocultural movements.{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=157}}\n\nLed by primary songwriters [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and [[Hamburg]] over three years from 1960, initially with [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] playing [[Bass guitar|bass]]. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including [[Pete Best]], before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager [[Brian Epstein]] moulded them into a professional act and producer [[George Martin]] guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, \"[[Love Me Do]]\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"[[Beatlemania]]\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title of \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the \"[[British Invasion]]\" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales records. They soon made their film debut with ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965), ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and ''[[Abbey Road]]'' (1969). In 1968, they founded [[Apple Corps]], a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After [[Break-up of the Beatles|the group's break-up]] in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot and killed]] in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nThe Beatles are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music act of all time]], with certified sales of over 183&nbsp;million units in the US and estimated sales of 600&nbsp;million units worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19800654|title=From Fab Four to fabulously rich|last=Hotten|first=Russell|date=2012-10-04|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-GB}}</ref> They hold the record for most number-one albums on the [[UK Albums Chart]], [[List of artists by number of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles|most number-one hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and most singles sold in the UK.

In 2008, the group topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki/>'s list of the all-time most successful artists on the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to [[the Quarrymen]] after discovering that another local group was already using the name.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=47\u201352}} Fifteen-year-old [[Paul McCartney]] joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=93\u201399}} In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend [[George Harrison]] to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \"[[Raunchy (instrumental)|Raunchy]]\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus,<ref>{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=47}}; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=127}}.</ref> and they enlisted him as their [[lead guitar]]ist.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=47}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=13}}\n\nBy January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the [[Liverpool College of Art]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=103}} The three guitarists, billing themselves as Johnny and the Moondogs,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=17}} were playing [[rock and roll]] whenever they could find a drummer.{{sfn|Harry|2000b|pp=742\u2013743}} Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]], who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar with the proceeds, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to ''Beatals'', as a tribute to [[Buddy Holly]] and [[the Crickets]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}}{{sfn|Gilliland| 1969|loc=show 27, track 4}} They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief [[The Beat Ballad Show Tour|tour of Scotland]] as the backing group for pop singer and fellow [[Liverpudlian]] [[Johnny Gentle]]. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to ''The Beatles''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18\u201322}}\n\n[[Allan Williams]], the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them [[The Beatles in Hamburg|in Hamburg]], but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired [[Pete Best]] in mid-August 1960.

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including [[folk-rock]], [[country music|country]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], and [[baroque pop]], without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=160}}}}\n\nIn ''The Beatles as Musicians'', [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed \u2013 as a means to entertain \u2013 a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=9}}\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist \u2013 a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]] intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=12}} MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n=== Influences ===\nThe band's earliest influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Little Richard]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=140, 660, 856\u2013858, 881}} During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the [[Star-Club]] in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=660}} Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=881}} Other early influences include [[Buddy Holly]], [[Eddie Cochran]], [[Roy Orbison]]{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=289, 526, 830}} and [[the Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=111, 123, 131, 133}}\n\nThe Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Who]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[the Byrds]] and [[the Beach Boys]], whose 1966 album ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' amazed and inspired McCartney.{{sfn|Harry|2000a|pp=99, 217, 357, 1195}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=333\u2013335, 359}}{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 150, 162, 169}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Miles |first=Barry |date=November 1966 |title=A Conversation with Paul McCartney |newspaper=International Times |location=London}}</ref> Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\"{{sfn|Granata|2003|p=17}} Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=147, 165, 177}}\n\n=== Genres ===\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|title=Merseybeat \u2013 Significant Albums, Artists and Songs|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=27 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016041739/http://www.allmusic.com/style/merseybeat-ma0000012018/songs|archive-date=16 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=30\u201332, 100\u2013107}} Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of ''Beatles for Sale'', \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\",{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=255}} while Gould credits ''Rubber Soul'' as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=296}}\n\n[[File:Guitarras de McCartney y Harrison.jpg|upright=.75|thumb|A [[H\u00f6fner 500/1|H\u00f6fner \"violin\" bass guitar]] and [[Gretsch|Gretsch Country Gentleman guitar]], models played by McCartney and Harrison, respectively; the [[Vox AC30]] amplifier behind them is the model the Beatles used during performances in the early 1960s.|alt=Two electric guitars, a light brown violin-shaped bass and a darker brown guitar resting against a Vox amplifier]]\n\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=278}} They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'}}s \"[[She's Leaving Home]]\", for instance, is \"cast in the {{lang|en-US|mold}} of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=402}}\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by [[Martin C. Strong|Martin Strong]] as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\".{{sfn|Strong|2004|p=108}} Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]\" and \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\". The influence of [[Indian classical music]] was evident in Harrison's \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\", \"[[Love You To]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\" \u2013 Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the [[raga]] form in miniature\".{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=406, 462\u2013463}}\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song \u2013 more sophisticated than pop&nbsp;... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song \u2013 classical or vernacular \u2013 that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\"{{sfn|Campbell|2008|p=196}} Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles&nbsp;... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"{{sfn|Benson|2003|p=43}}\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained ''in parallel'' their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\"{{sfn|Pedler|2003|p=256}} As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"[[Revolution 9]]\" (whose [[musique concr\u00e8te]] approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's [[country music|country]] song \"[[Don't Pass Me By]]\", Harrison's [[rock ballad]] \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\", and the \"[[Heavy metal music#Origins: late 1960s and early 1970s|proto-metal]] roar\" of McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\".<ref name=\"White Album AllMusic\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=''The Beatles [White Album]'' \u2013 The Beatles |publisher=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |accessdate=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530202730/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-mw0000418113 |archive-date=30 May 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Contribution of George Martin ===\n[[File:Beatles and George Martin in studio 1966.JPG|right|thumb|alt=The Beatles with George Martin in the studio in the mid-1960s|Martin (second from right) in the studio with the Beatles in the mid-1960s]]\n[[George Martin]]'s close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"[[fifth Beatle]]\".{{sfn|Harry|2000a|p=721}} He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=121, 290}} Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=158}} Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something [[baroque music|baroque]]\" to a particular recording.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=290}} In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and [[Brass instrument|brass]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=382, 405, 409, 443, 584}}\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which '[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]' is an outstanding example.\"{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=238}} Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his stabilising influence:\n\n{{blockquote|Compared with Paul's songs, all of which seemed to keep in some sort of touch with reality, John's had a psychedelic, almost mystical quality&nbsp;... John's imagery is one of the best things about his work&nbsp;\u2013 'tangerine trees', 'marmalade skies', 'cellophane flowers' ...&nbsp;I always saw him as an aural [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], rather than some drug-ridden record artist. On the other hand, I would be stupid to pretend that drugs didn't figure quite heavily in the Beatles' lives at that time&nbsp;... they knew that I, in my schoolmasterly role, didn't approve&nbsp;... Not only was I not into it myself, I couldn't see the need for it; and there's no doubt that, if I too had been on dope, ''Pepper'' would never have been the album it was. Perhaps it was the combination of dope and no dope that worked, who knows?{{sfn|Martin|1979|pp=205\u2013206}}}}\n\nHarrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: \"I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness \u2013 we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\"{{sfn|Harry|2003|p=264}}\n\n=== In the studio ===\n{{see also|Recording practices of the Beatles}}\n\nMaking innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards \u2013 any of these might be incorporated into their music.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}} Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, [[Ken Townsend]] and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from ''Rubber Soul'' and, especially, ''Revolver'' onwards.{{sfn|Hertsgaard|1995|p=103}}\n\nAlong with innovative studio techniques such as [[audio signal processing|sound effects]], unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, [[double tracking]] and [[vari-speed]] recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the [[swarmandal]] in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=212}} They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro,{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} and the [[clavioline]], an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\".{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=259}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Main|Cultural impact of the Beatles}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles on Green Hill in Almaty, Kazakhstan.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|alt=A monument of the English rock band the Beatles in Almaty, Kazakhstan|''The Beatles Monument'' in [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]]]]\n\nFormer ''Rolling Stone'' associate editor [[Robert Greenfield]] compared the Beatles to [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original&nbsp;...

The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion \u2013 19 or 20% \u2013 and Brian Epstein's \u2013 9 or 10% \u2013 which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=15\u201317}}{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=169\u201371, 368\u2013369}}{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=178}} In 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75&nbsp;million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5&nbsp;million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25&nbsp;million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=37\u201338}} At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=42}}\n\nHarrison created [[Harrisongs]] to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"[[Taxman]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=45}} The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"[[What Goes On (The Beatles song)|What Goes On]]\" and \"[[Flying (The Beatles song)|Flying]]\", were also Northern Songs copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=46\u201347}} Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with [[Apple Corps|Apple Publishing]] while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrison thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created [[Startling Music]], which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"[[Octopus's Garden]]\".{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=60\u201361}}{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=351}}\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company [[Associated Television]] (ATV), founded by impresario [[Lew Grade]], without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain a controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding.{{sfn|Norman|1996|pp=369\u2013372}} The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in [[City of London|the City]].\"{{sfn|Norman|1996|p=372}} By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973.{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=296}} In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=236}}\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, [[Associated Communications Corporation]] (ACC), led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=129}} According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for \u00a320&nbsp;million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a \u00a35&nbsp;million bid that was rejected.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=130}} According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs and turned down an offer of \u00a321\u201325&nbsp;million from McCartney and Ono for Northern Songs. In 1982, ACC was acquired in a [[takeover]] by Australian business magnate [[Robert Holmes \u00e0 Court]] for \u00a360&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=130, 139}}\n\nIn 1985, [[Michael Jackson]] purchased ATV for a reported $47.5&nbsp;million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|pp=140, 174, 176}} In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110&nbsp;million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with [[Sony]], creating a new company, [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]], in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third-largest music publisher in the world.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=198}} In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750&nbsp;million.<ref>Christman, Ed. \"Sony Finalizes Acquisition of Michael Jackson Estate's Stake in Sony/ATV Publishing\" ''Billboard'' 30 September 2016</ref>\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33{{frac|3}}% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%.{{sfn|Southall|Perry|2006|p=195}} Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs \u2013 \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S.

Subsidised tuition for members of participating civilian flying clubs was offered in exchange for an 'honorable undertaking' that in an emergency members would serve in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]]. Members of this Civil Air Guard had a dark blue boiler uniform (usually privately purchased) and badges supplied for distinction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30064804|title=badge, formation, British, Civil Air Guard|website=Imperial War Museums|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> When civil aviation ceased not long before the war began in September 1939, most members of the Civil Air Guard enlisted in either the Royal Air Force or the Fleet Air Arm.\n\n==The Civil Air Guard scheme==\nOn 23 July 1938, Sir [[Kingsley Wood]], [[Secretary of State for Air]], announced the creation of the Civil Air Guard scheme. Its intention was to provide pilots who could assist the [[Royal Air Force]] in a time of emergency. The scheme was civilian in nature and established in conjunction with local flying clubs. Membership was open to any person between the ages of 18 and 50 years.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1938/1938%20-%202129.html |title=The C.A.G. |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |editor-first=C.

The maximum subsidy of \u00a32000 for each club would not apply to those in the Air Guard.<ref name=\"Times48055\" />  The Air Ministry also lifted a restriction on the use of foreign aircraft for training by the flying clubs. Previously, only British-built aircraft could be used if the club wanted Ministry subsidies.<ref name=\"Times48070\" />\n\n=== Governance of the scheme ===\nTo control the organisation, five commissioners were appointed.

Since then it has remained a major medical research laboratory with a much broader focus.\n\nA new replacement building constructed close by to the original site on the [[Cambridge Biomedical Campus]] was opened in May 2013. The road outside the new building is named [[Francis Crick]] Avenue after the 1962 joint [[Nobel Prize]] winner, who co-discovered the helical structure of [[DNA]] in 1953.\n\n==History==\n===Origins: 1947-61===\n\n[[Max Perutz]], following an undergraduate training in organic chemistry, left [[Austria]] in 1936 and came to the [[University of Cambridge]] to study for a PhD, joining the [[X-Ray Crystallography|X-ray crystallographic group]] led by [[John Desmond Bernal|J.D. Bernal]]. Here, in the [[Cavendish laboratory]], he started his lifelong work on [[hemoglobin]]. The death of [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]] led to his successor, [[Lawrence Bragg]], a pioneer in X-ray crystallography, becoming the new Cavendish professor of physics in 1938. Bragg became a major supporter of Perutz and his group in those early days.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], many scientists from the physical side of science turned to biology, bringing with them a new way of thinking and expertise. [[John Kendrew]] joined Perutz's group to study a protein closely related to hemoglobin  \u2014 [[myoglobin]] \u2014 in 1946. In 1947, the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), under the guidance of its Secretary [[Harold Himsworth]], decided to form and support the \u201cMRC Unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems\u201d. The group, which by 1948 also included [[Hugh Huxley]] working on muscle, was joined in 1949 by [[Francis Crick]], who worked initially on protein crystallography. In 1951 they were joined by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]].\n\n1953 was an [[annus mirabilis]]: Watson and Crick discovered the double-helical structure of [[DNA]], which revealed that biological information was encoded in a linear structure and how this information could be duplicated during [[cell division]]. Perutz discovered that the detailed three-dimensional structures of proteins, such as myoglobin and hemoglobin could, in principle, be solved by X-ray analysis using a heavy metal atom labeling technique. Hugh Huxley discovered that [[muscle]] contraction works by a [[sliding filament mechanism]].\n\nIn 1957 the group's name was changed to the \u201cMRC Unit for Molecular Biology\u201d. Also that year,  [[Vernon Ingram]] discovered that the disease [[sickle cell anaemia]] is caused by a single amino acid change in the hemoglobin molecule and [[Sydney Brenner]] joined the Unit. In 1958, Crick's review \u201cOn Protein Synthesis\u201d appeared: this laid out, for the first time, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], the [[sequence hypothesis]] and the [[adaptor hypothesis]]. In 1961 Brenner helped discover [[messenger RNA]] and, in the same year, he and Crick established that the [[genetic code]] was read in triplets.\n\nAll this work was accomplished in a single-storey temporary building (The Hut), a few rooms in the Austin Wing, a room with a lean-to glass front (The Greenhouse) and a short sealed off corridor (The Gallery) within the Cavendish laboratory.<ref name=finch>John Finch; ''A Nobel Fellow On Every Floor'', Medical Research Council 2008, 381 pp, {{ISBN|978-1-84046-940-0}}</ref>\n\n===Opening of the LMB in 1962===\n[[File:Laboratory of Molecular Biology.jpg|thumb|The LMB building until 2012. The white structure is a new lecture hall added to the old building.]]\nThe MRC built a new Laboratory on the outskirts of Cambridge \u2014 the LMB \u2014 into which the Unit from the Cavendish moved in early 1962. Additionally, [[Fred Sanger|Fred Sanger's]] Unit which had been housed in the University's Biochemistry department joined them, as did [[Aaron Klug]] from London. Sanger had invented methods for determining the sequence of amino acids in a protein: he was awarded the [[Nobel prize]] for chemistry in 1958 for the first protein sequence, that of [[insulin]]. The new laboratory was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1962. Later that year, Kendrew and Perutz shared the Nobel prize for chemistry and Crick and Watson received a share of the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine.  The LMB building was incorporated into the new [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] complex as this was constructed in the 1970s.<ref>http://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/lmb-past-present-future/</ref>\n\nThe new LMB had Perutz as its chairman and contained 3 divisions: Structural Studies, headed by Kendrew; Molecular Genetics (Crick); Protein Chemistry (Sanger). In all, there were about 40 scientists but this number rapidly increased, particularly with a large influx of post-doctoral visitors from the US.<ref name=finch/>\n\n===Molecular Biology: after 1962===\n\nDuring the next decade, molecular biology the world over flourished, the outline bones of the 1950s now having flesh put on them. The detailed 3-D atomic structures of a series of proteins, and how they function, were deduced. These included [[myoglobin]], [[hemoglobin]] and [[chymotrypsin]], the last by [[David Blow]]. The genetic code, from evidence around the world, was assembled by Crick. Punctuation signals in the [[messenger RNA]] \u2014 where to start translating the RNA into a protein sequence, and where to stop \u2014 were discovered by postdoctoral fellow [[Joan A. Steitz]].<ref>J. A. Steitz, (1969) \"Polypetide Chain Initiation: Nucleotide Sequences of the Three Ribosomal Binding Sites in Bacteriophage R17 RNA,\" ''Nature''  '''224''' (5223):957-964.</ref> Crick suggested how the [[tRNA]] molecules \u2014 his original adaptors \u2014 read the messenger in his [[Wobble base pair|wobble hypothesis]]. Sanger devised new methods for sequencing [[RNA]] molecules and then later for DNA molecules (for which he received a second Nobel prize in chemistry in 1980). Much later, this line was extended to include determining the sequence of whole [[genomes]], in which [[John Sulston]] played a key role. How tRNA precursor molecules are processed to give a functional tRNA was elucidated by [[John Derek Smith|John Smith]] and [[Sid Altman]], and this later led to the discovery of [[ribozymes]]. The atomic structure of the first tRNA molecule was solved and [[zinc fingers]] discovered by Klug (who received the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1982). The structure of the [[ATP synthase]] was solved by [[John E. Walker]] and Andrew Leslie, for which Walker shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1997.<ref name=finch/> The structure of the [[ribosome]] was solved by [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]], for which he shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2009.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/index.html Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 2009]</ref>\n\n===1960s: Development and ''C.elegans''===\n[[File:cmglee Cambridge LMB lab.jpg|thumb|A laboratory at the new LMB building in June 2013]]\nTowards the end of the 1960s decade, it seemed that new problems in biology could be solved using the approaches which proved so successful  in molecular biology.\n\nSydney Brenner started working on the genetics of the nematode ''C.elegans'' in 1965. This group expanded, especially with many foreign visitors who today form the core of ''C.elegans'' research. Sulston determined the cell lineage of this small worm and [[John Graham White]] the entire wiring diagram of its nervous system. [[Robert Horvitz]], who helped in the cell lineage, was to share the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine with Brenner and Sulston in 2002. [[Jonathan Hodgkin]] established the genetic pathway in ''C.elegans'' which controls sex determination. [[John Gurdon]] developed the use of the frog oocyte to translate mRNAs, sharing the 2012 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for his earlier work showing that genetic information remains intact during development.\n\n[[Peter Lawrence (biologist)|Peter Lawrence]] came to study pattern formation, helping discover how compartments in ''Drosophila'' determine the fly's body plan. Under his influence, Crick also became interested in morphogenetic gradients and how they may help specify biological patterns.\n\n===Immunology===\n[[C\u00e9sar Milstein]] had over many years been working on antibody variation. He was joined in this by [[Georges K\u00f6hler]] and, together, they discovered how to produce [[monoclonal antibodies]]. For this they shared the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1984. This area was extended by [[Greg Winter]]<ref name=mrclmb>{{Cite journal|doi=10.7554/eLife.00856|title = Building for the future|journal = eLife|volume = 2|year = 2013|last1 = Pelham|first1 = Hugh|pmid = 23741620|pmc = 3667621}}</ref> who pioneered antibody engineering to make novel human antibodies and antibody fragments. Both monoclonal antibodies and their fragments are now of major medical importance.\n\n[[Michael Neuberger]] discovered the mechanism by which antibody diversification occurs by [[Activation-induced (cytidine) deaminase]]. This fundamental discovery is the keystone to understanding the molecular mechanism by which organisms can produce a diverse repertoire of antibodies to recognise new pathogens. This of wider importance in understanding the role of directed mutagenesis and DNA repair in physiology. Finally, the molecular mechanisms elucidated by Neuberger may be of great importance in understanding the mutational pattern of [[kataegis]] in breast cancer. Sadly, Michael Neuberger died from myeloma - the irony of which was not lost on him.\n\n===Cell biology===\n[[File:cmglee Cambridge LMB atrium.jpg|thumb|Atrium of the new building at night]]\n\nThe emphasis on classical molecular biology shifted towards cell biology and development, so that the Molecular Genetics division was renamed Cell Biology. [[Mark Bretscher]] discovered the topological way proteins are arranged in the [[cell membrane|human erythrocyte membrane]] and its [[flippase|phospholipid asymmetry]]. [[Richard Henderson (molecular biologist)|Richard Henderson]] and [[Nigel Unwin]] developed [[electron crystallography]] to determine the structure of two-dimensional arrays, applying this to the bacterial purple protein, [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. [[Barbara Pearse]] discovered the major components of [[clathrin-coated vesicles]], structures formed during [[endocytosis]], and a low resolution structure of the cage-like lattice around them was determined. How proteins become localised to different parts of the cell \u2014 such as to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]] or the [[plasma membrane]] \u2014 and the role of this in cell polarity, have been elucidated by Bretscher, [[Hugh Pelham]]<ref name=pelham>{{Who's Who | surname = PELHAM | othernames = Sir Hugh (Reginald Brentnall) | id = U30466 | volume = 2016 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> and Sean Munro. The [[spindle pole body|spindle pole bodies]] \u2014 the large structures in yeast cells which act as the foci to which chromosomes are moved during mitosis \u2014 have been purified and a low resolution structure of them deduced by John Kilmartin.<ref name=kilmartin>{{Who's Who | surname = MARTIN | othernames = Dr John Vincent| id = U43561 | volume = 2016 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nA continuing interest has been the structure of chromosomes. This was initiated by a visitor, [[Roger Kornberg]], who discovered the first level of condensation of DNA, the [[nucleosome]], and continues with the focus on understanding the higher orders of folding DNA.\n\n===Neurobiology===\nA new division of Neurobiology was created in 1993 with a wide variety of topics. Unwin has further developed electron crystallography and solved the structure of the [[acetylcholine receptor]], which activates many neurons.  [[Michel Goedert]] has identified variant proteins associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n\n===Instrumentation===\nScientific advances often depend on technological advances: the LMB has been at the forefront of many of these. Some major examples include nucleic acid sequencing, protein and antibody engineering, construction of new X-ray equipment and the invention of the scanning confocal microscope.<ref name=finch/>\n\n==Administrative structure==\n[[File:cmglee Cambridge LMB lecture.jpg|thumb|A public lecture at the new building]]\nThe LMB has a deliberately simple administrative environment.<ref name=\"Wong2012\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/490487e|title = LMB Cambridge: Bureaucracy bypass let research flourish|journal = Nature|volume = 490|issue = 7421|pages = 487|year = 2012|last1 = Wong|first1 = Min-Liang|pmid=23099394|bibcode = 2012Natur.490..487W|doi-access = free}}</ref> From outside the LMB, the parent MRC ensured that the quinquennial assessment had a light touch: only a brief explanation of past achievements and an indication of where future plans lay were required by the external committee. Their recommendations were simply advisory, leaving the division leaders a free hand as to how to run their affairs: they were assumed to know best.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nWithin the LMB, Perutz's criterion of how to arrange things was that the act of doing science should be facilitated at all levels. The LMB had a single budget: there were no personal budgets or equipment \u2014 everything was communal. It had state of the art equipment and was well financed by the MRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Chemical reagents, glassware and other expendables could be withdrawn from a single store with only a signature required.

Since then it has remained a major medical research laboratory with a much broader focus.\n\nA new replacement building constructed close by to the original site on the [[Cambridge Biomedical Campus]] was opened in May 2013. The road outside the new building is named [[Francis Crick]] Avenue after the 1962 joint [[Nobel Prize]] winner, who co-discovered the helical structure of [[DNA]] in 1953.\n\n==History==\n===Origins: 1947-61===\n\n[[Max Perutz]], following an undergraduate training in organic chemistry, left [[Austria]] in 1936 and came to the [[University of Cambridge]] to study for a PhD, joining the [[X-Ray Crystallography|X-ray crystallographic group]] led by [[John Desmond Bernal|J.D. Bernal]]. Here, in the [[Cavendish laboratory]], he started his lifelong work on [[hemoglobin]]. The death of [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford]] led to his successor, [[Lawrence Bragg]], a pioneer in X-ray crystallography, becoming the new Cavendish professor of physics in 1938. Bragg became a major supporter of Perutz and his group in those early days.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], many scientists from the physical side of science turned to biology, bringing with them a new way of thinking and expertise. [[John Kendrew]] joined Perutz's group to study a protein closely related to hemoglobin  \u2014 [[myoglobin]] \u2014 in 1946. In 1947, the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), under the guidance of its Secretary [[Harold Himsworth]], decided to form and support the \u201cMRC Unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems\u201d. The group, which by 1948 also included [[Hugh Huxley]] working on muscle, was joined in 1949 by [[Francis Crick]], who worked initially on protein crystallography. In 1951 they were joined by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]].\n\n1953 was an [[annus mirabilis]]: Watson and Crick discovered the double-helical structure of [[DNA]], which revealed that biological information was encoded in a linear structure and how this information could be duplicated during [[cell division]]. Perutz discovered that the detailed three-dimensional structures of proteins, such as myoglobin and hemoglobin could, in principle, be solved by X-ray analysis using a heavy metal atom labeling technique. Hugh Huxley discovered that [[muscle]] contraction works by a [[sliding filament mechanism]].\n\nIn 1957 the group's name was changed to the \u201cMRC Unit for Molecular Biology\u201d. Also that year,  [[Vernon Ingram]] discovered that the disease [[sickle cell anaemia]] is caused by a single amino acid change in the hemoglobin molecule and [[Sydney Brenner]] joined the Unit. In 1958, Crick's review \u201cOn Protein Synthesis\u201d appeared: this laid out, for the first time, the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], the [[sequence hypothesis]] and the [[adaptor hypothesis]]. In 1961 Brenner helped discover [[messenger RNA]] and, in the same year, he and Crick established that the [[genetic code]] was read in triplets.\n\nAll this work was accomplished in a single-storey temporary building (The Hut), a few rooms in the Austin Wing, a room with a lean-to glass front (The Greenhouse) and a short sealed off corridor (The Gallery) within the Cavendish laboratory.<ref name=finch>John Finch; ''A Nobel Fellow On Every Floor'', Medical Research Council 2008, 381 pp, {{ISBN|978-1-84046-940-0}}</ref>\n\n===Opening of the LMB in 1962===\n[[File:Laboratory of Molecular Biology.jpg|thumb|The LMB building until 2012. The white structure is a new lecture hall added to the old building.]]\nThe MRC built a new Laboratory on the outskirts of Cambridge \u2014 the LMB \u2014 into which the Unit from the Cavendish moved in early 1962. Additionally, [[Fred Sanger|Fred Sanger's]] Unit which had been housed in the University's Biochemistry department joined them, as did [[Aaron Klug]] from London. Sanger had invented methods for determining the sequence of amino acids in a protein: he was awarded the [[Nobel prize]] for chemistry in 1958 for the first protein sequence, that of [[insulin]]. The new laboratory was opened by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1962. Later that year, Kendrew and Perutz shared the Nobel prize for chemistry and Crick and Watson received a share of the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine.  The LMB building was incorporated into the new [[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] complex as this was constructed in the 1970s.<ref>http://www.medschl.cam.ac.uk/lmb-past-present-future/</ref>\n\nThe new LMB had Perutz as its chairman and contained 3 divisions: Structural Studies, headed by Kendrew; Molecular Genetics (Crick); Protein Chemistry (Sanger). In all, there were about 40 scientists but this number rapidly increased, particularly with a large influx of post-doctoral visitors from the US.<ref name=finch/>\n\n===Molecular Biology: after 1962===\n\nDuring the next decade, molecular biology the world over flourished, the outline bones of the 1950s now having flesh put on them. The detailed 3-D atomic structures of a series of proteins, and how they function, were deduced. These included [[myoglobin]], [[hemoglobin]] and [[chymotrypsin]], the last by [[David Blow]]. The genetic code, from evidence around the world, was assembled by Crick. Punctuation signals in the [[messenger RNA]] \u2014 where to start translating the RNA into a protein sequence, and where to stop \u2014 were discovered by postdoctoral fellow [[Joan A. Steitz]].<ref>J. A. Steitz, (1969) \"Polypetide Chain Initiation: Nucleotide Sequences of the Three Ribosomal Binding Sites in Bacteriophage R17 RNA,\" ''Nature''  '''224''' (5223):957-964.</ref> Crick suggested how the [[tRNA]] molecules \u2014 his original adaptors \u2014 read the messenger in his [[Wobble base pair|wobble hypothesis]]. Sanger devised new methods for sequencing [[RNA]] molecules and then later for DNA molecules (for which he received a second Nobel prize in chemistry in 1980). Much later, this line was extended to include determining the sequence of whole [[genomes]], in which [[John Sulston]] played a key role. How tRNA precursor molecules are processed to give a functional tRNA was elucidated by [[John Derek Smith|John Smith]] and [[Sid Altman]], and this later led to the discovery of [[ribozymes]]. The atomic structure of the first tRNA molecule was solved and [[zinc fingers]] discovered by Klug (who received the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1982). The structure of the [[ATP synthase]] was solved by [[John E. Walker]] and Andrew Leslie, for which Walker shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1997.<ref name=finch/> The structure of the [[ribosome]] was solved by [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]], for which he shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2009.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/index.html Nobel Laureates in Chemistry 2009]</ref>\n\n===1960s: Development and ''C.elegans''===\n[[File:cmglee Cambridge LMB lab.jpg|thumb|A laboratory at the new LMB building in June 2013]]\nTowards the end of the 1960s decade, it seemed that new problems in biology could be solved using the approaches which proved so successful  in molecular biology.\n\nSydney Brenner started working on the genetics of the nematode ''C.elegans'' in 1965. This group expanded, especially with many foreign visitors who today form the core of ''C.elegans'' research. Sulston determined the cell lineage of this small worm and [[John Graham White]] the entire wiring diagram of its nervous system. [[Robert Horvitz]], who helped in the cell lineage, was to share the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine with Brenner and Sulston in 2002. [[Jonathan Hodgkin]] established the genetic pathway in ''C.elegans'' which controls sex determination. [[John Gurdon]] developed the use of the frog oocyte to translate mRNAs, sharing the 2012 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for his earlier work showing that genetic information remains intact during development.\n\n[[Peter Lawrence (biologist)|Peter Lawrence]] came to study pattern formation, helping discover how compartments in ''Drosophila'' determine the fly's body plan. Under his influence, Crick also became interested in morphogenetic gradients and how they may help specify biological patterns.\n\n===Immunology===\n[[C\u00e9sar Milstein]] had over many years been working on antibody variation. He was joined in this by [[Georges K\u00f6hler]] and, together, they discovered how to produce [[monoclonal antibodies]]. For this they shared the Nobel prize for physiology or medicine in 1984. This area was extended by [[Greg Winter]]<ref name=mrclmb>{{Cite journal|doi=10.7554/eLife.00856|title = Building for the future|journal = eLife|volume = 2|year = 2013|last1 = Pelham|first1 = Hugh|pmid = 23741620|pmc = 3667621}}</ref> who pioneered antibody engineering to make novel human antibodies and antibody fragments. Both monoclonal antibodies and their fragments are now of major medical importance.\n\n[[Michael Neuberger]] discovered the mechanism by which antibody diversification occurs by [[Activation-induced (cytidine) deaminase]]. This fundamental discovery is the keystone to understanding the molecular mechanism by which organisms can produce a diverse repertoire of antibodies to recognise new pathogens. This of wider importance in understanding the role of directed mutagenesis and DNA repair in physiology. Finally, the molecular mechanisms elucidated by Neuberger may be of great importance in understanding the mutational pattern of [[kataegis]] in breast cancer. Sadly, Michael Neuberger died from myeloma - the irony of which was not lost on him.\n\n===Cell biology===\n[[File:cmglee Cambridge LMB atrium.jpg|thumb|Atrium of the new building at night]]\n\nThe emphasis on classical molecular biology shifted towards cell biology and development, so that the Molecular Genetics division was renamed Cell Biology. [[Mark Bretscher]] discovered the topological way proteins are arranged in the [[cell membrane|human erythrocyte membrane]] and its [[flippase|phospholipid asymmetry]]. [[Richard Henderson (molecular biologist)|Richard Henderson]] and [[Nigel Unwin]] developed [[electron crystallography]] to determine the structure of two-dimensional arrays, applying this to the bacterial purple protein, [[bacteriorhodopsin]]. [[Barbara Pearse]] discovered the major components of [[clathrin-coated vesicles]], structures formed during [[endocytosis]], and a low resolution structure of the cage-like lattice around them was determined. How proteins become localised to different parts of the cell \u2014 such as to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus]] or the [[plasma membrane]] \u2014 and the role of this in cell polarity, have been elucidated by Bretscher, [[Hugh Pelham]]<ref name=pelham>{{Who's Who | surname = PELHAM | othernames = Sir Hugh (Reginald Brentnall) | id = U30466 | volume = 2016 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref> and Sean Munro. The [[spindle pole body|spindle pole bodies]] \u2014 the large structures in yeast cells which act as the foci to which chromosomes are moved during mitosis \u2014 have been purified and a low resolution structure of them deduced by John Kilmartin.<ref name=kilmartin>{{Who's Who | surname = MARTIN | othernames = Dr John Vincent| id = U43561 | volume = 2016 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nA continuing interest has been the structure of chromosomes. This was initiated by a visitor, [[Roger Kornberg]], who discovered the first level of condensation of DNA, the [[nucleosome]], and continues with the focus on understanding the higher orders of folding DNA.\n\n===Neurobiology===\nA new division of Neurobiology was created in 1993 with a wide variety of topics. Unwin has further developed electron crystallography and solved the structure of the [[acetylcholine receptor]], which activates many neurons.  [[Michel Goedert]] has identified variant proteins associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]].\n\n===Instrumentation===\nScientific advances often depend on technological advances: the LMB has been at the forefront of many of these. Some major examples include nucleic acid sequencing, protein and antibody engineering, construction of new X-ray equipment and the invention of the scanning confocal microscope.<ref name=finch/>\n\n==Administrative structure==\n[[File:cmglee Cambridge LMB lecture.jpg|thumb|A public lecture at the new building]]\nThe LMB has a deliberately simple administrative environment.<ref name=\"Wong2012\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/490487e|title = LMB Cambridge: Bureaucracy bypass let research flourish|journal = Nature|volume = 490|issue = 7421|pages = 487|year = 2012|last1 = Wong|first1 = Min-Liang|pmid=23099394|bibcode = 2012Natur.490..487W|doi-access = free}}</ref> From outside the LMB, the parent MRC ensured that the quinquennial assessment had a light touch: only a brief explanation of past achievements and an indication of where future plans lay were required by the external committee. Their recommendations were simply advisory, leaving the division leaders a free hand as to how to run their affairs: they were assumed to know best.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nWithin the LMB, Perutz's criterion of how to arrange things was that the act of doing science should be facilitated at all levels. The LMB had a single budget: there were no personal budgets or equipment \u2014 everything was communal. It had state of the art equipment and was well financed by the MRC.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Chemical reagents, glassware and other expendables could be withdrawn from a single store with only a signature required. Key to the smooth functioning of the lab was Michael Fuller, who was responsible for its day-to-day running.<ref name=\"Cleaver2003\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.300.5627.1875c|title = Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology|journal = Science|volume = 300|issue = 5627|pages = 1875c|year = 2003|last1 = Cleaver|first1 = J.

The portico was completely rebuilt in 1897, and above it are statues of two Kings: Edward II on the left, and probably either Charles I or [[James I of England|James I]], although this is disputed; above those is a statue of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] after whom the college is officially named.<ref name=\"OCO\" /> The top breaks the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] tradition and has [[Classical order|classical]] [[pilaster]]s, a shield with garlands, and a segmental [[pediment]].<ref name=\"TBO\" />\n\nThe hall has a [[hammerbeam roof]]; the louvre in the centre is now [[glazing in architecture|glazed]], but was originally the only means of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by [[Ninian Comper]] and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous [[Gothic Revival architecture|19th-century Gothic]] type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, is evident in the Buttery.\n\nBehind the High Table is a portrait of Edward II; underneath is a [[longsword]] brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years on one of the college's estates at [[Swainswick]], near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. On either side are portraits of [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Joseph Butler]]. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Thomas Arnold]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[John Keble]], [[John Henry Newman|Saint John Henry Newman]], [[Richard Whately]] and [[John Robinson (1650\u20131723)|John Robinson]].\n\nThe [[stained glass|heraldic glass]] in the windows display the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of benefactors and distinguished members of the college; three of the windows were designed by Ninian Comper.<ref name=\"OCO\" /> The window next to the entrance on the East side contains the arms of [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professors of Modern History]] who have been ''[[ex-officio]]'' fellows of the college.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\n==== Chapel ====\nThe current chapel is Oriel's third, the first being built around 1373 on the north side of First Quadrangle. By 1566, the chapel was located on the south side of the quadrangle, as shown in a drawing made for [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s visit to Oxford in that year. The present building was consecrated in 1642 and despite subsequent restorations it largely retains its original appearance.\n\n[[File:Oriel College St Margaret.jpg|right|thumb|upright|In the gallery of the chapel is a late medieval stained glass image of [[Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]].]]\nThe bronze [[lectern]] was given to the college in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677\u20131678. Except for the [[pew]]s on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved [[altar rails|communion rails]]. Behind the altar is [[Bernard van Orley]]'s ''[[Stations of the Cross|The Carrying of the Cross]]'' \u2014 a companion-piece to this painting is in the [[National Gallery of Scotland]]. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for [[St Mary Abbots]] Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.<ref name=\"TOO\">Pacey, Robert and Popkin, Michael, ''The Organs of Oxford'' (1980) \u2014 Second edition published by [http://www.positifpress.com/books/ISBN0906894255.html Positif Press, Oxford], p.73 {{ISBN|0-906894-25-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn the north-west window of the gallery there is a small piece of [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] glass, a figure of [[Saint Margaret the Virgin|St Margaret of Antioch]]. In the south window of the gallery there is a painted window of \"[[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|The Presentation of Christ in the Temple]]\", executed by [[William Peckitt]] of York. It was originally set in the east window in 1767; a later version of his work can be seen in [[New College, Oxford|New College]] Chapel. The rest of the [[stained glass]] is [[Victorian era|Victorian]]: the earliest is on the easternmost part of the south side; the rest date from after the 1884 restorations by Powell.\n\nAbove the entrance to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by [[Richard Whately]], and later by [[John Henry Newman|Saint John Henry Newman]]. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers \u2014 when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the [[ante-chapel]] was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988;<ref name=\"TOO\" /> in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the [[Oxford Movement]]. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the chapel was extensively restored with the assistance of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/history|title=Oriel College Chapel Guide & History|publisher= (reference for the section)|accessdate= 22 March 2007}}</ref> The chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Wainwright and the director of music is Dr David Maw.\n\n=== Second Quad (Back Quad) ===\n[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-Oriel College 02.jpg|left|thumb|Designed by [[James Wyatt]] and completed in 1796, this building houses the senior common rooms and library.]]\nOriginally a garden, the demand for more accommodation for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by [[John Robinson (1650\u20131723)|Bishop Robinson]] at the suggestion of his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, as a result of a benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of First Quad are repeated on them \u2014 only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819,<ref name=\"TBO\" /> they were joined up to First Quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated \u2013 the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of [[Basil Champneys]], and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the provost's lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.<ref name=\"TBO\" />\n\n[[File:Oriel College Senior Library.jpg|right|thumb|On the first floor of James Wyatt's building, the senior library, looking east]]\n\nThe north range houses the library and senior common rooms; designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style by [[James Wyatt]], it was built between 1788 and 1796 to accommodate the books requested by [[Edward Leigh, 5th Baron Leigh|Edward, Baron Leigh]], formerly High Steward of the University and an Orielensis, whose gift had doubled the size of the library.<ref name=\"OCHL\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/history-library|title= Oriel College History of the Library|accessdate= 22 March 2007}}</ref> The two-storey building has [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] arches on the ground floor and a row of [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns above, dividing the fa\u00e7ade into seven bays \u2014 the ground floor contains the first purpose-built senior common rooms in Oxford, above is the library.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\nOn 7 March 1949, a fire spread from the library roof; over 300 printed books and the manuscripts on exhibition were completely destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair,<ref name=\"OCHL\" /> though the main structure suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\n=== Third Quad (St Mary's Quad) ===\nThe south, east and west ranges of Third Quadrangle contain elements of [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall]], which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; less than a decade later, the Hall's buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building. Bedel Hall in the south was formally amalgamated with St Mary Hall in 1505.\n\nIn the south range, parts of the medieval buildings survive and are incorporated into staircase ten \u2014 the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber-framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and [[Buttery (shop)|Buttery]] of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from Third Quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, can be seen to have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.\n\nOn the east side of the quad is a simple rustic style timber-frame building; known as \"the Dolls' House\", it was erected by Principal King in 1743.\n\nIn 1826 an ornate range was erected by St Mary Hall in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, incorporating the old gate of St Mary Hall, on the west side of the quad. Designed by [[Daniel Robertson (architect)|Daniel Robertson]], it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford.<ref name=\"TBO\" /> The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\n[[File:Oriel College Rhodes Building.JPG|right|thumb|Statues of [[Cecil John Rhodes|Cecil Rhodes]], [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] on the central bay of the Rhodes Building's [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] fa\u00e7ade]]\nThe Rhodes Building, pictured right, was built in 1911 using \u00a3100,000 left to the college for that purpose by former student [[Cecil John Rhodes|Cecil Rhodes]].<ref name=\"TBO\" /> It was designed by [[Basil Champneys]] and stands on the site of the house of the St Mary Hall Principal, on the High Street.

The left hand block and much of the centre was to be given up to a new provost's lodging, and the five windows on the first floor above the arcade were to light a gallery belonging to the lodging. The college eventually decided to retain the existing provost's lodging and demanded detailing \"more in accordance with the style which has become traditional in Oxford\". It became the last building of the [[Jacobethan|Jacobean revival style]] in Oxford.<ref>\n[[Howard Colvin|Colvin, Howard]] ''Unbuilt Oxford'' [http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=0300031262 Yale University Press] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319064507/http://yalepress.yale.edu/YupBooks/book.asp?isbn=0300031262 |date=19 March 2007 }}  {{ISBN|0-300-03126-2}}.\n</ref>\n\nOn the side facing the High Street, there is a statue of Rhodes over the main entrance, with [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] beneath.

In 2018 Oriel repeated this victory with their second double headship. It remains the only college to possess a double headship in Torpids.\n\nIn recent years, Oriel claimed the women's Torpids Headship in 2017 and held it in 2018. It has held the men's Headship in Eights in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. It regained men's Headship in Torpids in 2018. The women's and men's second boats are currently in \"fixed divisions\" in the bumps charts and, as such, are guaranteed a place in racing each year.

Mixed Eights are crews from a single college that must contain at least four female rowers. For Crewdate Eights one enters as a group of four rowers with or without a coxswain and are then matched up with another group, where possible creating a mixed college and mixed gender crew. The final two crews have a crewdate paid for them by the Regatta. It is a fun event with which to end the years collegiate racing schedule. The course runs upstream from the Longbridges Boathouse to past the end of boathouses on Christ Church Island and races are conducted in knock-out format.\n\nThe general emblem of the Oriel College Boat Club is the three feathers.

On either side are portraits of [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Joseph Butler]]. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Thomas Arnold]], [[James Anthony Froude]], [[John Keble]], [[John Henry Newman|Saint John Henry Newman]], [[Richard Whately]] and [[John Robinson (1650\u20131723)|John Robinson]].\n\nThe [[stained glass|heraldic glass]] in the windows display the [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] of benefactors and distinguished members of the college; three of the windows were designed by Ninian Comper.<ref name=\"OCO\" /> The window next to the entrance on the East side contains the arms of [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professors of Modern History]] who have been ''[[ex-officio]]'' fellows of the college.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\n==== Chapel ====\nThe current chapel is Oriel's third, the first being built around 1373 on the north side of First Quadrangle.

It was originally set in the east window in 1767; a later version of his work can be seen in [[New College, Oxford|New College]] Chapel. The rest of the [[stained glass]] is [[Victorian era|Victorian]]: the earliest is on the easternmost part of the south side; the rest date from after the 1884 restorations by Powell.\n\nAbove the entrance to the chapel is an oriel that, until the 1880s, was a room on the first floor that formed part of a set of rooms that were occupied by [[Richard Whately]], and later by [[John Henry Newman|Saint John Henry Newman]]. Whately is said to have used the space as a larder and Newman is said to have used it for his private prayers \u2014 when the organ was installed in 1884, the space was used for the blower. The wall that once separated the room from the [[ante-chapel]] was removed, making it accessible from the chapel. The organ was built by J. W. Walker & Sons in 1988;<ref name=\"TOO\" /> in 1991 the space behind the organ was rebuilt as an oratory and memorial to Newman and the [[Oxford Movement]]. A new stained glass window designed by Vivienne Haig and realised by Douglas Hogg was completed and installed in 2001.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, the chapel was extensively restored with the assistance of donations from Lady Norma Dalrymple-Champneys. During this work, the chandelier, given in 1885 by Provost Shadwell while still a fellow, was put back in place, the organ was restored, the painting mounted behind the altar, and the chapel repainted. A list of former chaplains and organ scholars was erected in the ante-chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/history|title=Oriel College Chapel Guide & History|publisher= (reference for the section)|accessdate= 22 March 2007}}</ref> The chaplain is Rev Dr Robert Wainwright and the director of music is Dr David Maw.\n\n=== Second Quad (Back Quad) ===\n[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-Oriel College 02.jpg|left|thumb|Designed by [[James Wyatt]] and completed in 1796, this building houses the senior common rooms and library.]]\nOriginally a garden, the demand for more accommodation for undergraduates in the early 18th century resulted in two free-standing blocks being built. The first block erected was the Robinson Building on the east side, built in 1720 by [[John Robinson (1650\u20131723)|Bishop Robinson]] at the suggestion of his wife, as the inscription over the door records. Its twin block, the Carter Building, was erected on the west side in 1729, as a result of a benefaction by Provost Carter. The two buildings stood for nearly a hundred years as detached blocks in the garden, and the architectural elements of First Quad are repeated on them \u2014 only here the seven gables are all alike. Between 1817 and 1819,<ref name=\"TBO\" /> they were joined up to First Quad with their present, rather incongruous connecting links. In the link to the Robinson Building, two purpose-built rooms have been incorporated \u2013 the Champneys Room, designed by Weldon Champneys, the nephew of [[Basil Champneys]], and the Benefactors Room, a panelled room honouring benefactors of the college. A Gothic oriel window, belonging to the provost's lodgings, was added to the Carter Building in 1826.<ref name=\"TBO\" />\n\n[[File:Oriel College Senior Library.jpg|right|thumb|On the first floor of James Wyatt's building, the senior library, looking east]]\n\nThe north range houses the library and senior common rooms; designed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style by [[James Wyatt]], it was built between 1788 and 1796 to accommodate the books requested by [[Edward Leigh, 5th Baron Leigh|Edward, Baron Leigh]], formerly High Steward of the University and an Orielensis, whose gift had doubled the size of the library.<ref name=\"OCHL\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/content/history-library|title= Oriel College History of the Library|accessdate= 22 March 2007}}</ref> The two-storey building has [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] arches on the ground floor and a row of [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns above, dividing the fa\u00e7ade into seven bays \u2014 the ground floor contains the first purpose-built senior common rooms in Oxford, above is the library.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\nOn 7 March 1949, a fire spread from the library roof; over 300 printed books and the manuscripts on exhibition were completely destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair,<ref name=\"OCHL\" /> though the main structure suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.<ref name=\"OUAS\" />\n\n=== Third Quad (St Mary's Quad) ===\nThe south, east and west ranges of Third Quadrangle contain elements of [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall]], which was incorporated into Oriel in 1902; less than a decade later, the Hall's buildings on the northern side were demolished for the construction of the Rhodes Building. Bedel Hall in the south was formally amalgamated with St Mary Hall in 1505.\n\nIn the south range, parts of the medieval buildings survive and are incorporated into staircase ten \u2014 the straight, steep flight of stairs and timber-framed partitions date from a mid-15th century rebuilding of St Mary Hall. The former Chapel, Hall and [[Buttery (shop)|Buttery]] of St Mary Hall, built in 1640, form part of the Junior Library and Junior Common Room. Viewed from Third Quad, the Chapel, with its Gothic windows, can be seen to have been built neatly on top of the Hall, a unique example in Oxford of such a plan.\n\nOn the east side of the quad is a simple rustic style timber-frame building; known as \"the Dolls' House\", it was erected by Principal King in 1743.\n\nIn 1826 an ornate range was erected by St Mary Hall in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, incorporating the old gate of St Mary Hall, on the west side of the quad.

Election is by the approval of the Tortoise Council.\n\nMembers must be Orielenses (excepting Honorary members) who have represented OCBC with excellence. Members of the men's and women's 1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid are judged to have fulfilled these criteria but still must be approved by the Tortoise Council. All other potential members are at the Council's discretion.\n\nThe unique emblem of the Tortoise Club is the tortoise badge.<ref name=\"The College of Arms newsletter\" /> The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply the use of the Tortoise emblem by the general Oriel College Boat Club membership or members of the Oriel Society \u2013 these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.\n\n[[File:Oriel College Women's Boat Club - The Blessed Virgins Club.jpg|thumb|100px|The emblem of the Blessed Virgins Club]]\n\n===== The Blessed Virgins Club =====\nThe Blessed Virgins Club was the female counterpart of the Tortoise Club.

Mombach can be reached via Mainz-innenstadt (downtown) or [[Bundesautobahn 643]].\n\n== Location ==\nMombach is located on the southern (left) bank of the [[Rhine]] River, flowing from east to west after converging with the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The Rhine River is the northern border. Mombach lies in the [[Mainz basin]] below the [[Rheinhessen]] Plateau.\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike [[Rheinhessen]], Mombach is protected by [[Hunsr\u00fcck]], [[Taunus]], [[Odenwald]] and [[Donnersberg]].\nThe average yearly temperature of Mombach is 11.5 degrees Celsius (53&nbsp;\u00b0F). The annual rainfall is below 500 liters per square meter (19.7&nbsp;in) and comes near to a [[semi-arid]] to [[mediterranean climate]]. There are around 1,665 hours of [[irradiance|sunshine]] per year.\n\n== History ==\nIn 2006 Mombach celebrated its 750-year jubilee. Mombach had been originally a location of [[farmer]]s, [[sailor|mariner]]s and [[fishermen]].\n\n=== Prehistory to Middle Ages ===\nArcheological excavations prove that the site of Mombach had been already settled in prehistoric times. A flat hatchet dated to the early Bronze Age has been found in Mombach as well as many discoveries from Roman times. The formation of the locality happened most likely during the [[Franks|Frankish realm]]. The name Mombach is derived most likely from the Frankish name ''Muno'' (Munno). The 750-year jubilee dates back to a document of 1256 mentioning the city, but the locality is surely older.\n\n=== France's urge to the Rhine ===\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], with the change of occupying forces of Mainz and surroundings (also Swedish and imperialists), the French troops deployed up to Mainz in the year 1644. During the first period of the war [[Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt]] held the position as ''[[Amtmann]]'' of the village named by the [[cathedral chapter]] of [[Mainz Cathedral]]. As soon as the [[garrison]] had been weakened by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], the French returned again. They devastated and occupied the left bank of the Rhine up to its natural border in 1688 including Mainz without a declaration of war. Not much later in 1689 Mainz had been reconquered by imperial forces in the [[War of the Grand Alliance#Continental Europe (1688\u201389)|war of the Palatinian Succession]].\n\n=== During the Electorate ===\nThe location had been surrounded by a wall during the electoral times. Parts of this wall are components of old buildings to this day. The historical core of Mombach is the Lindenplatz. Most of the important buildings of that time grouped round the old [[tilia]], the first chapel of [[Saint Nicholas]], the common bakery oven and the schoolhouse. In 1703 the first Saint Nicholas church had been consecrated. Mombach has been independent from the town's clerical nobility [[St. Peter's Church, Mainz|St. Peter]] since then. The vicar of [[Mainz Cathedral]] de la Roche had been given the necessary funds. Shortly after this, a new municipality and schoolhouse could be erected. During the 18th century an ardour for the countryside occurred and Mombach could benefit from this. The buildings Walderdorfsche Anlage, Kesselstadtsche Anlage and the Rondell had been erected during this time.\n\n=== Second French occupation ===\nIn 1792 [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|General Custine]] abolished the electoral administration. With the repeated occupation of the left bank of the Rhine by the [[French Revolutionary Army]], the collegial administration of Mombach by St. Peter had been terminated. After the collapse of the [[First Coalition]], the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] and the confirmation in the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] Mombach was added to French territory. Since 1801 ''[[pr\u00e9fet]]'' [[Jean Bon Saint-Andr\u00e9]] governed the ''d\u00e9partment'' of [[Mont-Tonnerre]] and laid down the old village gates, as well as some saints' memorials in Mombach.\n\n=== Grand duchy Hesse-Darmstadt ===\nAfter the failing of [[Napoleon]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the region around Mainz, [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] came to the Grand duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Ever since that the region is called [[Rheinhessen]]. Mainz turned into a [[Fortress Mainz|federal fortress]]. Numerous fruit growing areas, vineyards and forests were converted into military property. In 1845 the [[Waggonfabrik Gebr\u00fcder Gastell]] was forced to leave Mainz city and settled in Mombach. Due to safety reasons, such big fire processing production sites were no longer allowed to produce within the fortress's walls. The site of Count von Walderdorf at the fringe of Mombach was chosen. With the completion of the railway track on the left bank of the Rhine, the village received the first railway station in 1859 [http://wikimapia.org/29241/]. This fostered the rural as well as the industrial production. The founding of a chemical production site, today [[INEOS|INEOS Paraform]] in 1856 contributed significantly to this increase. In 1869 the first gymnasium and the school house in the main street were built. The increasing industrialisation of the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] 1871/71, fostered again the immigration of workers' families. Another railway track, the [[Hessian Ludwig Railway]], led towards Gonsenheim along the Gastell production site in 1871. There was an additional railway station. In 1885 the population increased to 2822 persons, including 485 Protestants.\n\nToday's industrial [[port]] had been constructed between 1882 and 1887 as a [[timber rafting]] port. In August 1890 the boiler and pressure vessel producer Schmahl founded his company.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nAt the beginning of the 20th century Mombach received [[town gas]] and water supply as well as sewer connection. A coal gasification plant and a [[water supply network]] emerged, and the electric [[tram]] connected Mombach to Mainz. The most important contemporary [[Gasometer]] of Germany was in Mombach.\n\nIn 1907 Mombach was suburbanised as one of the first suburbs of Mainz, under the reign of Lord Mayor [[Karl G\u00f6ttelmann]]. With Mombach, Mainz grew to a real large city, defined to have more than 100,000 inhabitants then. Concurrent with the rapid growth of the industrial revolution came their [[Industrial Revolution#Social effects|social effects]], which were heavily discussed. Mombach as a workers' suburb was chosen as a site for a [[church monument]] with a [[tomb]] of bishop [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]].\n\nThe [[German Emperor]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] often watched the [[military exercise]]s which took place in the [[Mainz Sand Dunes]] over many years. These Kaiser-manoeuvres or \u2013parades finally took place in 1913.\n\nAnother historical break in the development of the suburb was [[World War I]]. In 1918 French troops occupied Mainz again and did not leave it before 1930; the economic situation got worse. In 1937 new barracks were built named after [[Hugo von Kathen]], the last military governor of the Mainz fortress.\n\nIn the cause of the [[bombing of Mainz in World War II]] Mombach was subject to air raids. Until the end of [[World War II]] Mombach was located on two [[floodplain]]s and had access to a natural Rhine [[swimming bath]]. But after Mainz lost its properties on the right bank of the Rhine, the suburbs Am\u00f6neburg, Kostheim and Kastel, as well as Bischofsheim, together with the biggest contemporary freight [[train station]], due to the [[zoning]] of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]], Mombach changed to an industrial site. Mainz had not only lost the suburbs, but concurrently 50% of its property and the biggest part of its industrial capacities. Nevertheless Mombach still has a historical core, with old houses such as the old administration building.\n {| border=\"0\" style=\"float:center; empty-cells:show; width:100%; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:0,5em;\"\n  |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n  | [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]] || [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]] || [[Mainz-Am\u00f6neburg]]\n  |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n  | [[Budenheim]] || [[Image:Windrosse.PNG]] || [[Mainz]]\n  |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n  | [[Finthen]] || [[Gonsenheim]] || [[Hartenberg-M\u00fcnchfeld]]\n  |}\n\n== Official emblem ==\n[[Image:Wappen Mombach Erzstift.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Coat of Arms around 1500]]Displays of old [[Coat of Arms]] are no longer seen in Mombach. So there is no trace back to older history and affiliation with former proprietors. Early in the Middle Ages Mombach belonged to the estate of the [[archbishop of Mainz]], who assigned the location as a ''Manslehen''. In the 14th century the property rights changed over to the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of Mainz and belonged to [[St. Peter's Church, Mainz|St. Peter]] up to Napoleonic times. Due to this the colors of the chapter silver (white)/red, may be found in most of the depictions. Around 1500 three [[rose gold]] balls on the right side of the CoA can be found added to the chapter's colours. These refer to the dowry affair of [[Saint Nicholas]], the patron saint of mariners.\n\nAlso on a court of law seal of 1741, silver/red bars are the focus. The typical [[baroque]] seal shows [[Nicholas of Myra]], the patron saint of the parish church built in 1703, hovering above the clouds with his [[crosier]]. In order to identify the bishop, three resurrected children climbing out of a wooden barrel are shown as [[iconography]].\n\nMombach did not have its own CoA since the French occupation. As the new [[Mainz town hall]] had been erected between 1971 and 1974, a full set of coat of arms of all suburbs should be shown in chronological order of the incorporation in the lobby. Due to this a new CoA was drawn up. The traditional depiction with the saint was not regarded as contemporary. The [[heraldry]] expert Dr. Leitermann was charged with the creation of a new CoA. The [[Field (heraldry)|field]] of the [[shield]] is divided by a cross. The four partitions show themes in relation to the history of Mombach and the current Mombach. \n[[Image:Wappen Mombach.png|thumb|left|110px|new Coat of Arms since 1974]]\n*the above partitions are related to the history of the parish:\n**right, the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of the chapter with his characteristic red bars on silver (today white) background, a hint at the former property.\n**left on blue shield a golden crosier with three golden balls can be seen, referring to the patron saint St. Nicholas.\n* the below partitions are related to the presence of the year 1974:\n**right, crossed silver [[spade]] and [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], on green shield symbolizing farming at that time.\n**left, a black, toothed wheel on silver shield, indicating the importance of industry.\n\n== Sights ==\n[[Image:Herz-Jesu Mombach.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Sacred Heart|Sacred Heart of Jesus]] Church]]\n* Historical waterworks (1904)\n* House Kleiststra\u00dfe 30\n* House Hauptstra\u00dfe 47\n* [[Herz-Jesu-Kirche, Mainz|Herz-Jesu-Kirche]] (Sacred Heart Church, Cath., 1911) by [[Ludwig Becker (architect)|Ludwig Becker]]\n* Catholic parish Saint Nicholas (1955)\n* Protestant Friedenskirche (Peace Church, 1911)\n* historical Protestant house of prayer of 1891\n* historical school house with teachers' flats of 1869\n* historical [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn|Jahn]] school house  (1894)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] school house (1912)\n[[Image:Waggonfabrik.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Emperor's balcony at the railroad car factory of the Gastell brothers]]\n* historical hospital of the Gastell brothers, later Rochus hospital, today Caritas-Centre\n* historical village museum in the old pump station\n* Villa H\u00e4nlein\n* Eiskeller (old ice storage)\n* Municipality (1875)\n* industry memorial [[Waggonfabrik Gebr\u00fcder Gastell|Waggonfabrik]] with [[Ph\u00f6nixhalle]]\n* Chapel with cross (1814)\n\n== Parks ==\n[[Image:Brunnen Ortsvw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Well at the municipality]]\n*De La Roche Park\n*Park in the old cemetery\n*Am Mahnes\n*Public park Heilig Geist\n*Unique nature playing ground of Mainz at K\u00f6ppelstra\u00dfe\n:According to a social study for the town of Mainz, the district ''Am Westring'' has the best relation of greenery to housing.\n\n== Nature preserves ==\n*Dunes in the [[Mainz Sand Dunes|Mombach Sand Dunes]]\n*[[Special Protection Area]] around the old water works\n* Nature preserve between Plantage and Erzbergerstra\u00dfe\n\n== Prominent People of Mombach ==\n\n* [[Paul Haenlein]], aviation pioneer\n* [[Julius Buckler]], First World War fighter ace\n* [[Eduard David]] first president of the national assembly of the [[Weimar Republic]].

Mombach can be reached via Mainz-innenstadt (downtown) or [[Bundesautobahn 643]].\n\n== Location ==\nMombach is located on the southern (left) bank of the [[Rhine]] River, flowing from east to west after converging with the [[Main (river)|Main]]. The Rhine River is the northern border. Mombach lies in the [[Mainz basin]] below the [[Rheinhessen]] Plateau.\n\n=== Climate ===\nLike [[Rheinhessen]], Mombach is protected by [[Hunsr\u00fcck]], [[Taunus]], [[Odenwald]] and [[Donnersberg]].\nThe average yearly temperature of Mombach is 11.5 degrees Celsius (53&nbsp;\u00b0F). The annual rainfall is below 500 liters per square meter (19.7&nbsp;in) and comes near to a [[semi-arid]] to [[mediterranean climate]]. There are around 1,665 hours of [[irradiance|sunshine]] per year.\n\n== History ==\nIn 2006 Mombach celebrated its 750-year jubilee. Mombach had been originally a location of [[farmer]]s, [[sailor|mariner]]s and [[fishermen]].\n\n=== Prehistory to Middle Ages ===\nArcheological excavations prove that the site of Mombach had been already settled in prehistoric times. A flat hatchet dated to the early Bronze Age has been found in Mombach as well as many discoveries from Roman times. The formation of the locality happened most likely during the [[Franks|Frankish realm]]. The name Mombach is derived most likely from the Frankish name ''Muno'' (Munno). The 750-year jubilee dates back to a document of 1256 mentioning the city, but the locality is surely older.\n\n=== France's urge to the Rhine ===\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], with the change of occupying forces of Mainz and surroundings (also Swedish and imperialists), the French troops deployed up to Mainz in the year 1644. During the first period of the war [[Anselm Casimir Wambold von Umstadt]] held the position as ''[[Amtmann]]'' of the village named by the [[cathedral chapter]] of [[Mainz Cathedral]]. As soon as the [[garrison]] had been weakened by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], the French returned again. They devastated and occupied the left bank of the Rhine up to its natural border in 1688 including Mainz without a declaration of war. Not much later in 1689 Mainz had been reconquered by imperial forces in the [[War of the Grand Alliance#Continental Europe (1688\u201389)|war of the Palatinian Succession]].\n\n=== During the Electorate ===\nThe location had been surrounded by a wall during the electoral times. Parts of this wall are components of old buildings to this day. The historical core of Mombach is the Lindenplatz. Most of the important buildings of that time grouped round the old [[tilia]], the first chapel of [[Saint Nicholas]], the common bakery oven and the schoolhouse. In 1703 the first Saint Nicholas church had been consecrated. Mombach has been independent from the town's clerical nobility [[St. Peter's Church, Mainz|St. Peter]] since then. The vicar of [[Mainz Cathedral]] de la Roche had been given the necessary funds. Shortly after this, a new municipality and schoolhouse could be erected. During the 18th century an ardour for the countryside occurred and Mombach could benefit from this. The buildings Walderdorfsche Anlage, Kesselstadtsche Anlage and the Rondell had been erected during this time.\n\n=== Second French occupation ===\nIn 1792 [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|General Custine]] abolished the electoral administration. With the repeated occupation of the left bank of the Rhine by the [[French Revolutionary Army]], the collegial administration of Mombach by St. Peter had been terminated. After the collapse of the [[First Coalition]], the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] and the confirmation in the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] Mombach was added to French territory. Since 1801 ''[[pr\u00e9fet]]'' [[Jean Bon Saint-Andr\u00e9]] governed the ''d\u00e9partment'' of [[Mont-Tonnerre]] and laid down the old village gates, as well as some saints' memorials in Mombach.\n\n=== Grand duchy Hesse-Darmstadt ===\nAfter the failing of [[Napoleon]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the region around Mainz, [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]], [[Alzey]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] came to the Grand duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt. Ever since that the region is called [[Rheinhessen]]. Mainz turned into a [[Fortress Mainz|federal fortress]]. Numerous fruit growing areas, vineyards and forests were converted into military property. In 1845 the [[Waggonfabrik Gebr\u00fcder Gastell]] was forced to leave Mainz city and settled in Mombach. Due to safety reasons, such big fire processing production sites were no longer allowed to produce within the fortress's walls. The site of Count von Walderdorf at the fringe of Mombach was chosen. With the completion of the railway track on the left bank of the Rhine, the village received the first railway station in 1859 [http://wikimapia.org/29241/]. This fostered the rural as well as the industrial production. The founding of a chemical production site, today [[INEOS|INEOS Paraform]] in 1856 contributed significantly to this increase. In 1869 the first gymnasium and the school house in the main street were built. The increasing industrialisation of the [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] 1871/71, fostered again the immigration of workers' families. Another railway track, the [[Hessian Ludwig Railway]], led towards Gonsenheim along the Gastell production site in 1871. There was an additional railway station. In 1885 the population increased to 2822 persons, including 485 Protestants.\n\nToday's industrial [[port]] had been constructed between 1882 and 1887 as a [[timber rafting]] port. In August 1890 the boiler and pressure vessel producer Schmahl founded his company.\n\n=== 20th century ===\nAt the beginning of the 20th century Mombach received [[town gas]] and water supply as well as sewer connection. A coal gasification plant and a [[water supply network]] emerged, and the electric [[tram]] connected Mombach to Mainz. The most important contemporary [[Gasometer]] of Germany was in Mombach.\n\nIn 1907 Mombach was suburbanised as one of the first suburbs of Mainz, under the reign of Lord Mayor [[Karl G\u00f6ttelmann]]. With Mombach, Mainz grew to a real large city, defined to have more than 100,000 inhabitants then. Concurrent with the rapid growth of the industrial revolution came their [[Industrial Revolution#Social effects|social effects]], which were heavily discussed. Mombach as a workers' suburb was chosen as a site for a [[church monument]] with a [[tomb]] of bishop [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]].\n\nThe [[German Emperor]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] often watched the [[military exercise]]s which took place in the [[Mainz Sand Dunes]] over many years. These Kaiser-manoeuvres or \u2013parades finally took place in 1913.\n\nAnother historical break in the development of the suburb was [[World War I]]. In 1918 French troops occupied Mainz again and did not leave it before 1930; the economic situation got worse. In 1937 new barracks were built named after [[Hugo von Kathen]], the last military governor of the Mainz fortress.\n\nIn the cause of the [[bombing of Mainz in World War II]] Mombach was subject to air raids. Until the end of [[World War II]] Mombach was located on two [[floodplain]]s and had access to a natural Rhine [[swimming bath]]. But after Mainz lost its properties on the right bank of the Rhine, the suburbs Am\u00f6neburg, Kostheim and Kastel, as well as Bischofsheim, together with the biggest contemporary freight [[train station]], due to the [[zoning]] of the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany]], Mombach changed to an industrial site. Mainz had not only lost the suburbs, but concurrently 50% of its property and the biggest part of its industrial capacities. Nevertheless Mombach still has a historical core, with old houses such as the old administration building.\n {| border=\"0\" style=\"float:center; empty-cells:show; width:100%; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:0,5em;\"\n  |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n  | [[Wiesbaden-Schierstein|Schierstein]] || [[Wiesbaden-Biebrich|Biebrich]] || [[Mainz-Am\u00f6neburg]]\n  |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n  | [[Budenheim]] || [[Image:Windrosse.PNG]] || [[Mainz]]\n  |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"\n  | [[Finthen]] || [[Gonsenheim]] || [[Hartenberg-M\u00fcnchfeld]]\n  |}\n\n== Official emblem ==\n[[Image:Wappen Mombach Erzstift.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Coat of Arms around 1500]]Displays of old [[Coat of Arms]] are no longer seen in Mombach. So there is no trace back to older history and affiliation with former proprietors. Early in the Middle Ages Mombach belonged to the estate of the [[archbishop of Mainz]], who assigned the location as a ''Manslehen''. In the 14th century the property rights changed over to the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of Mainz and belonged to [[St. Peter's Church, Mainz|St. Peter]] up to Napoleonic times. Due to this the colors of the chapter silver (white)/red, may be found in most of the depictions. Around 1500 three [[rose gold]] balls on the right side of the CoA can be found added to the chapter's colours. These refer to the dowry affair of [[Saint Nicholas]], the patron saint of mariners.\n\nAlso on a court of law seal of 1741, silver/red bars are the focus. The typical [[baroque]] seal shows [[Nicholas of Myra]], the patron saint of the parish church built in 1703, hovering above the clouds with his [[crosier]]. In order to identify the bishop, three resurrected children climbing out of a wooden barrel are shown as [[iconography]].\n\nMombach did not have its own CoA since the French occupation. As the new [[Mainz town hall]] had been erected between 1971 and 1974, a full set of coat of arms of all suburbs should be shown in chronological order of the incorporation in the lobby. Due to this a new CoA was drawn up. The traditional depiction with the saint was not regarded as contemporary. The [[heraldry]] expert Dr. Leitermann was charged with the creation of a new CoA. The [[Field (heraldry)|field]] of the [[shield]] is divided by a cross. The four partitions show themes in relation to the history of Mombach and the current Mombach. \n[[Image:Wappen Mombach.png|thumb|left|110px|new Coat of Arms since 1974]]\n*the above partitions are related to the history of the parish:\n**right, the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of the chapter with his characteristic red bars on silver (today white) background, a hint at the former property.\n**left on blue shield a golden crosier with three golden balls can be seen, referring to the patron saint St. Nicholas.\n* the below partitions are related to the presence of the year 1974:\n**right, crossed silver [[spade]] and [[Hoe (tool)|hoe]], on green shield symbolizing farming at that time.\n**left, a black, toothed wheel on silver shield, indicating the importance of industry.\n\n== Sights ==\n[[Image:Herz-Jesu Mombach.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|[[Sacred Heart|Sacred Heart of Jesus]] Church]]\n* Historical waterworks (1904)\n* House Kleiststra\u00dfe 30\n* House Hauptstra\u00dfe 47\n* [[Herz-Jesu-Kirche, Mainz|Herz-Jesu-Kirche]] (Sacred Heart Church, Cath., 1911) by [[Ludwig Becker (architect)|Ludwig Becker]]\n* Catholic parish Saint Nicholas (1955)\n* Protestant Friedenskirche (Peace Church, 1911)\n* historical Protestant house of prayer of 1891\n* historical school house with teachers' flats of 1869\n* historical [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn|Jahn]] school house  (1894)\n* [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi|Pestalozzi]] school house (1912)\n[[Image:Waggonfabrik.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Emperor's balcony at the railroad car factory of the Gastell brothers]]\n* historical hospital of the Gastell brothers, later Rochus hospital, today Caritas-Centre\n* historical village museum in the old pump station\n* Villa H\u00e4nlein\n* Eiskeller (old ice storage)\n* Municipality (1875)\n* industry memorial [[Waggonfabrik Gebr\u00fcder Gastell|Waggonfabrik]] with [[Ph\u00f6nixhalle]]\n* Chapel with cross (1814)\n\n== Parks ==\n[[Image:Brunnen Ortsvw.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Well at the municipality]]\n*De La Roche Park\n*Park in the old cemetery\n*Am Mahnes\n*Public park Heilig Geist\n*Unique nature playing ground of Mainz at K\u00f6ppelstra\u00dfe\n:According to a social study for the town of Mainz, the district ''Am Westring'' has the best relation of greenery to housing.\n\n== Nature preserves ==\n*Dunes in the [[Mainz Sand Dunes|Mombach Sand Dunes]]\n*[[Special Protection Area]] around the old water works\n* Nature preserve between Plantage and Erzbergerstra\u00dfe\n\n== Prominent People of Mombach ==\n\n* [[Paul Haenlein]], aviation pioneer\n* [[Julius Buckler]], First World War fighter ace\n* [[Eduard David]] first president of the national assembly of the [[Weimar Republic]].

Due to its central location it is the primary station of the suburb besides the halt \u201cWaggonfabrik\u201d. The station is a part of the West Rhine Railway and borders the Wye: Gleisdreieck Mainz, leading to the Kaiserbr\u00fccke (Mainz) and the main station Mainz.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n=== Presence ===\n* [[INEOS]] [[INEOS Paraform|Paraform]], [[chemical industry]]<ref>[http://www.ineos.com/en/businesses/INEOS-Paraform/Sites/ INEOS-Paraform/Sites/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110133142/http://www.ineos.com/en/businesses/INEOS-Paraform/Sites/ |date=2014-01-10 }}</ref>\n* [[lacquer]] fabrication Albrecht\n* [[dairygold]]\n* RIGA MAINZ GmbH & Co.
