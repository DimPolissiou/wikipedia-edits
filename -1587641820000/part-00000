The crippled hand disqualified him for medical school (his preferred academic institution), and he decided to study biology and anthropology, with special emphasis on sensory and behavioral physiology.<ref name=\"Sch\u00f6nberger2015\" />\n\nHis hearing loss around 4&nbsp;kHz increased his awareness of vocalizations of mice in the range between 10 and 20&nbsp;kHz. At that time, the technology for electronic sound recording and loudspeakers was limited to the range between 100&nbsp;Hz and 8&nbsp;kHz and, in order to provide a convincing proof of the use of ultrasound, Schleidt started to develop and build his own electronic gadgets and thus became a pioneer of bioacoustics and animal communication.<ref name=\"Schleidt1948\" /><ref name=\"Schleidt1952\" /><ref>Zippelius H-M.& Schleidt, W.

It was found through molecular genetics to be closely related to ''B. popi''.\n\n==Description==\n''Boophis fayi'' was first found at the [[Betampona Reserve]] in [[Madagascar]]. Skeleton frogs are primarily identified by their eyes, and ''B. fayi'' has a greenish rather than red [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] color and is characterized by green outer irises and turquoise iris peripheries.

It is brown in color and has dermal flaps on the heels and elbows and white tubercules along the [[cloaca]]l opening, classifying it as being in the ''B. goudoti'' group.\n\nThe species has a relatively small SVL (snout vent length) compared to the rest of the ''B. goudoti'' group, and is further distinguished by its unique eye color, small white tubercles in the cloacal region, and weak supratypanic fold.<ref name=\"K\u00f6hler2011\" /> It is also has substantial genetic differentiation from the rest of the group.  Compared to frogs of similar size, it has a unique iris and has no elevated dosral reticulation. Compared to larger frogs, males have a slightly larger SVL and shorter hindlimbs.\n\n==Behavior==\nThe frog can also be differentiated by its advertisement call, which is a series of 1-3 notes with durations of 100-370 ms.<ref name=\"K\u00f6hler2011\" /> The notes pulse, but pulse repetition is fast. The note repetition rate is about 3.3/s. It also has another call, suspected to be a territorial call because of its similarity to that of ''[[Boophis tampoka|B. tampoka]]''. It is 1-2 click notes lasting up to 200 ms, depending on the number of notes. The notes do not pulse and note repetition is about 6-10/s.

The firm, Quinlan Terry Architects LLP continues the architectural style of the practice which was started by Raymond Erith in 1928, and specialises in high quality traditional building, mostly in classical idioms. The practice is based in Dedham, Essex, and employs 12 staff. A book about the firm's work written by David Watkin, entitled ''Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry'' (New York: Rizzoli International Publications), was published in 2006.\n\nThe first work by Raymond Erith on which Quinlan Terry had a major role was the new house Kings Waldenbury, Hertfordshire, completed for the Pilkington family in 1971, when new building in a classical manner was deeply unfashionable. During the three-year construction period of the house, Terry kept a diary, published later, in which he bemoaned the modern world and stoically defended his conservative, reformed, evangelical faith.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/mar/07/architecture|first= Lynn |last=Barber|title=Shock of the Old|newspaper=The Observer|date=7 March 2004|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis design for the 1992 ''Maitland Robinson Library''<ref>[http://www.qftarchitects.com/projects/pages/universities/maitlandrobinson.php Quinlan Francis Terry Architects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065246/http://www.qftarchitects.com/projects/pages/universities/maitlandrobinson.php |date=7 April 2014 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Maitland Robinson Library, Downing College</ref> at [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], won the [[Building of the Year Award]] in 1994. One of his best known works is [[Brentwood Cathedral]] in Essex.  This is radical extension of a nineteenth century [[Roman Catholic]] [[Gothic revival]] church is in the [[English Baroque]] manner owing much to [[James Gibbs]] and [[Thomas Archer]] and makes little or no attempt to be in keeping with the older building.  Terry's new work has a [[portico]] based on the south portico of [[St Paul's cathedral]] designed by Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. Unusually, all five classical orders of architecture were used and Terry has said in lectures that he views classical architecture as an expression of the divine order.\n\nDuring the 1980s he was also appointed by [[Margaret Thatcher]], then Prime Minister, to renovate the interiors of [[10 Downing Street]], restored 40 years previously by Raymond Erith, Terry's teacher, after war damage. Terry's work there is more assertive than Erith's. In [[Gloucestershire]], he designed Waverton House, where he used the style made popular by [[Matthew Brettingham]] in the late 18th century, featuring a central staircase lit from above, surrounded by rooms on both floors.\n\nIn 1989, he designed [[Quinlan Terry's Regent's Park villas|a series of three new villas]] for the [[Crown Estate]] Commissioners in Outer Circle in London's [[Regent's Park]]. Building in the park was controversial but said to be in the spirit of the [[Prince Regent]]'s original though unrealised intentions for the park, which was to contain numerous villas for [[regent|Regency]] courtiers surrounding a new royal palace. Terry's three new villas have near-identical plans, based on [[Palladio]]'s [[Villa Saraceno]], but the external elevations vary, showing respectively [[Gothic revival|Gothic]], Italian Mannerist and muscular [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classical]] features in the manner of [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. Six villas were eventually built between 1989 and 2002.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Terry designed the restoration of [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], controversially turning the orientation of the medieval church through 90 degrees, moving or removing some fittings, and reworking its previous [[Tractarian]] [[Anglican]] layout into a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] stripped-back meeting house plan informed by the precepts of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theology, in tune with its current firmly evangelical congregation.\n\nAlso in the 1990s, he designed a castle for the Barclay brothers on their private island of [[Brecqhou]] in the Channel Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31517392|title=Who are the Barclay brothers?|last=|first=|date=2015-02-20|website=BBC|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n\nTerry designed the external envelope of New Margaret Thatcher Infirmary at the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], with Steffian Bradley Architects<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317150028/http://www.steffian.co.uk/main.html |title=STEFFIAN BRADLEY ARCHITECTS United States \u00b7 United Kingdom \u00b7 Spain \u00b7 China |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref> as the lead consultant and planners for the building; a new Georgian Theatre for Downing College Cambridge; new offices, retail and residential development at 264\u2013267 Tottenham Court Road, London; offices and retail at 22 Baker Street, London; and Queen Mother Square, [[Poundbury]]; mixed use development [[Richmond, London#Richmond Riverside|Richmond Riverside]]\n\n===In the United States===\nHis works in the US include the Abercrombie Residence,<ref name=\"Abercrombie Residence\">{{Cite web |url=https://qtarchitects.com/projects/houses-overseas/abercrombie-residence/ |title=Abercrombie Residence |website=Quinlan Terry Architects |access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref> a classical mansion based on [[Marble Hill House]], [[Twickenham]], UK.  Complete with a ''[[piano nobile]]'' approached by an external staircase, it has a pediment supported by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  The house is constructed of [[Kasota limestone]], with [[Indiana]] limestone dressings.\n\n== Perception ==\n\nTerry's architecture has been championed by [[David Watkin (historian)|David Watkin]], who wrote the monograph ''Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry'' (2006), and by [[Roger Scruton]] who called it \"one long breath of fresh air\"  in his ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' article  \"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\".<ref>[[Roger Scruton|Scruton, Roger]], [https://www.spectator.co.uk/2006/04/hail-quinlan-terry/ \"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\"], ''[[The Spectator]]'' 8 April 2006.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Quinlan Terry is the single most distinguished and prolific architect at work in the Classical tradition in either Britain or the United States of America.

The firm, Quinlan Terry Architects LLP continues the architectural style of the practice which was started by Raymond Erith in 1928, and specialises in high quality traditional building, mostly in classical idioms. The practice is based in Dedham, Essex, and employs 12 staff. A book about the firm's work written by David Watkin, entitled ''Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry'' (New York: Rizzoli International Publications), was published in 2006.\n\nThe first work by Raymond Erith on which Quinlan Terry had a major role was the new house Kings Waldenbury, Hertfordshire, completed for the Pilkington family in 1971, when new building in a classical manner was deeply unfashionable. During the three-year construction period of the house, Terry kept a diary, published later, in which he bemoaned the modern world and stoically defended his conservative, reformed, evangelical faith.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/mar/07/architecture|first= Lynn |last=Barber|title=Shock of the Old|newspaper=The Observer|date=7 March 2004|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nHis design for the 1992 ''Maitland Robinson Library''<ref>[http://www.qftarchitects.com/projects/pages/universities/maitlandrobinson.php Quinlan Francis Terry Architects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065246/http://www.qftarchitects.com/projects/pages/universities/maitlandrobinson.php |date=7 April 2014 }}&nbsp;\u2013 Maitland Robinson Library, Downing College</ref> at [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], won the [[Building of the Year Award]] in 1994. One of his best known works is [[Brentwood Cathedral]] in Essex.  This is radical extension of a nineteenth century [[Roman Catholic]] [[Gothic revival]] church is in the [[English Baroque]] manner owing much to [[James Gibbs]] and [[Thomas Archer]] and makes little or no attempt to be in keeping with the older building.  Terry's new work has a [[portico]] based on the south portico of [[St Paul's cathedral]] designed by Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. Unusually, all five classical orders of architecture were used and Terry has said in lectures that he views classical architecture as an expression of the divine order.\n\nDuring the 1980s he was also appointed by [[Margaret Thatcher]], then Prime Minister, to renovate the interiors of [[10 Downing Street]], restored 40 years previously by Raymond Erith, Terry's teacher, after war damage. Terry's work there is more assertive than Erith's. In [[Gloucestershire]], he designed Waverton House, where he used the style made popular by [[Matthew Brettingham]] in the late 18th century, featuring a central staircase lit from above, surrounded by rooms on both floors.\n\nIn 1989, he designed [[Quinlan Terry's Regent's Park villas|a series of three new villas]] for the [[Crown Estate]] Commissioners in Outer Circle in London's [[Regent's Park]]. Building in the park was controversial but said to be in the spirit of the [[Prince Regent]]'s original though unrealised intentions for the park, which was to contain numerous villas for [[regent|Regency]] courtiers surrounding a new royal palace. Terry's three new villas have near-identical plans, based on [[Palladio]]'s [[Villa Saraceno]], but the external elevations vary, showing respectively [[Gothic revival|Gothic]], Italian Mannerist and muscular [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classical]] features in the manner of [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. Six villas were eventually built between 1989 and 2002.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Terry designed the restoration of [[St Helen's Bishopsgate]], controversially turning the orientation of the medieval church through 90 degrees, moving or removing some fittings, and reworking its previous [[Tractarian]] [[Anglican]] layout into a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] stripped-back meeting house plan informed by the precepts of [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] theology, in tune with its current firmly evangelical congregation.\n\nAlso in the 1990s, he designed a castle for the Barclay brothers on their private island of [[Brecqhou]] in the Channel Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31517392|title=Who are the Barclay brothers?|last=|first=|date=2015-02-20|website=BBC|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n\nTerry designed the external envelope of New Margaret Thatcher Infirmary at the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], with Steffian Bradley Architects<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317150028/http://www.steffian.co.uk/main.html |title=STEFFIAN BRADLEY ARCHITECTS United States \u00b7 United Kingdom \u00b7 Spain \u00b7 China |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref> as the lead consultant and planners for the building; a new Georgian Theatre for Downing College Cambridge; new offices, retail and residential development at 264\u2013267 Tottenham Court Road, London; offices and retail at 22 Baker Street, London; and Queen Mother Square, [[Poundbury]]; mixed use development [[Richmond, London#Richmond Riverside|Richmond Riverside]]\n\n===In the United States===\nHis works in the US include the Abercrombie Residence,<ref name=\"Abercrombie Residence\">{{Cite web |url=https://qtarchitects.com/projects/houses-overseas/abercrombie-residence/ |title=Abercrombie Residence |website=Quinlan Terry Architects |access-date=30 June 2019}}</ref> a classical mansion based on [[Marble Hill House]], [[Twickenham]], UK.  Complete with a ''[[piano nobile]]'' approached by an external staircase, it has a pediment supported by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns.  The house is constructed of [[Kasota limestone]], with [[Indiana]] limestone dressings.\n\n== Perception ==\n\nTerry's architecture has been championed by [[David Watkin (historian)|David Watkin]], who wrote the monograph ''Radical Classicism: The Architecture of Quinlan Terry'' (2006), and by [[Roger Scruton]] who called it \"one long breath of fresh air\"  in his ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'' article  \"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\".<ref>[[Roger Scruton|Scruton, Roger]], [https://www.spectator.co.uk/2006/04/hail-quinlan-terry/ \"Hail Quinlan Terry: our greatest living architect\"], ''[[The Spectator]]'' 8 April 2006.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Quinlan Terry is the single most distinguished and prolific architect at work in the Classical tradition in either Britain or the United States of America.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

movie rating]].

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization.<ref name=\"nytimes interview\" /> Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.<ref name=\"variety maybes2\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-season-two-netflix-1201824880/ |title='Stranger Things' EPs on Season 2: 'We Could Explore It If Netflix Wanted To' |first=Debra |last=Brinbaum |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nRegarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb.<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> Joyce was fashioned after [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' character Roy Neary in ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:David Harbour by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Duffer Brothers cast [[David Harbour]] as Chief Hopper believing this was his opportunity to portray a lead character.]]\nIn June 2015, it was announced that [[Winona Ryder]] and [[David Harbour]] had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.<ref name=\"June2015TVL\" /> The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\".

violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s [[Amblin Entertainment]] films drove the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Addition of PG-13 rating|PG-13 movie rating]]. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.<ref name=\"empire\" /> The brothers had wanted to avoid any [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with [[practical effect]]s, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g13305063/stranger-things-trivia/?slide=24 |title=50 Things You Didn't Know About 'Stranger Things' |date=November 6, 2017 |work=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2016/07/20/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-6/ |title='Stranger Things': How the Duffer Brothers created their monster |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref> However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed.

(commonly referred to as '''Pagani''') is an Italian  manufacturer of [[sports car]]s and [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]] components. The company was founded in 1992 by the Argentinian [[Horacio Pagani (auto executive)|Horacio Pagani]] and is based in [[San Cesario sul Panaro]], near [[Modena, Italy]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Horacio Pagani (auto executive)|Horacio Pagani]], who formerly managed [[Lamborghini]]'s composites department, founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new company worked with Lamborghini on numerous projects, including the restyling of the [[Lamborghini Countach#25th Anniversary Countach|Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary Edition]], the [[Lamborghini LM002]], the [[Lamborghini P140|P140]] design concept, and the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo]]. In the late 1980s, Pagani began designing his own car, then referred to as the \"C8 Project\". Pagani planned to rename the C8 the \"Fangio F1\" to honour his friend, the five-time Argentinian [[Formula One]] champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]].\n\nIn 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being tested at the [[Dallara]] wind tunnel with positive results.

The Huayra BC uses a lightweight titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped out interior. The tyres are [[Pirelli]] P-Zero Corsa tires that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper along with a large rear wing. The car uses an [[Xtrac]] 7-speed [[sequential manual transmission]], and has an electro-hydraulic actuation. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes.\n\nOnly 20 units of the Huayra BC were made, all of which were already sold with each unit costing \u20ac2.1M.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/pagani/huayra/60-bc/first-drive |title=First drive: the hardcore Pagani Huayra BC |publisher=Top Gear |date=2016-02-18 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ronan Glon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/pagani-insane-huayra-bc-boasts-142107723.html |title=Pagani\u2019s insane Huayra BC boasts more power, more carbon fiber, and a more muscular look |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2016-02-19 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Huayra Roadster ===\nAfter 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled in the 2017 [[Geneva Motor Show]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://gtspirit.com/2017/03/07/geneva-2017-pagani-huayra-roadster/|title=Geneva 2017: Pagani Huayra Roadster|last=Adams|first=Lawrence|date=2017-03-07|website=GTspirit|access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref> \n\nThe design of the car has undergone several changes, with the most noticeable being the rear, with new eyelid-like fixed flaps that continue with the design and eventually end on the rear lights along with the inclusion of vents on the rear engine cover for efficient cooling of the engine, the wheels which are new and are specifically constructed for the car along with [[Pirelli]] P-Zero tires, and the addition of a spoiler at the front. The car also uses conventional doors instead of the [[Gull-wing door]]s used in the coup\u00e9 as such doors cannot be fitted to an open top car. The car utilises the same [[twin-turbo]] [[V12 engine]] as the coup\u00e9 but the power is now uprated and is {{convert|764|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm and {{Convert|1000|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,400 rpm. The power is delivered to the rear wheels via an all-new [[Xtrac]] 7-speed [[sequential manual transmission]] which is 40% lighter than its coup\u00e9 counterpart. The car is constructed by an all-new material developed by Pagani called 'carbon triax', which is a combination of tri-axis [[fibre glass]] with [[carbon fibre]] due to which the roadster weighs {{cvt|70|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} less than its coup\u00e9 counterpart, for a total of {{convert|1,280|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}, making it the first roadster lighter than the coup\u00e9.

(commonly referred to as '''Pagani''') is an Italian  manufacturer of [[sports car]]s and [[Carbon fiber reinforced polymer|carbon fiber]] components. The company was founded in 1992 by the Argentinian [[Horacio Pagani (auto executive)|Horacio Pagani]] and is based in [[San Cesario sul Panaro]], near [[Modena, Italy]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Horacio Pagani (auto executive)|Horacio Pagani]], who formerly managed [[Lamborghini]]'s composites department, founded Pagani Composite Research in 1988. This new company worked with Lamborghini on numerous projects, including the restyling of the [[Lamborghini Countach#25th Anniversary Countach|Lamborghini Countach 25th Anniversary Edition]], the [[Lamborghini LM002]], the [[Lamborghini P140|P140]] design concept, and the [[Lamborghini Diablo|Diablo]]. In the late 1980s, Pagani began designing his own car, then referred to as the \"C8 Project\". Pagani planned to rename the C8 the \"Fangio F1\" to honour his friend, the five-time Argentinian [[Formula One]] champion [[Juan Manuel Fangio]].\n\nIn 1991, Pagani established Modena Design to meet the increasing demand for his design, engineering, and prototyping services. In 1992, he began construction of a Fangio F1 prototype, and by 1993, the car was being tested at the [[Dallara]] wind tunnel with positive results. In 1994, [[Mercedes-Benz]] agreed to supply Pagani with V12 engines. The cost of these cars are at a total of 2.3&nbsp;million dollars.\n\nThe final car was named the [[Pagani Zonda#Zonda C12|Zonda C12]], the first of the Zonda line (the Fangio F1 name was dropped out of respect for Fangio, who died in 1995). It was first presented at the 1999 [[Geneva Motor Show]].\n\nIn 2005, Pagani announced that it planned to triple its production output within the next three years, and to enter the US market in 2007.\n\nOn 30 June 2010, Pagani claimed a new record for production-based cars using the [[Pagani Zonda#Zonda R|Pagani Zonda R]] and completing the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] in 6:47, beating the [[Ferrari 599XX]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pagani.com/en/news/2010/df52fc4a8b1f4b4b9e11350422bd28c4.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202064642/http://www.pagani.com/en/news/2010/df52fc4a8b1f4b4b9e11350422bd28c4.aspx |archivedate=2017-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Pagani Zonda ==\n{{main article|Pagani Zonda}}\nPagani's first model, the [[Pagani Zonda|Zonda]], is powered by a mid-mounted [[Overhead camshaft|DOHC]] V12 engine manufactured by [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s [[Mercedes-AMG|AMG]] division.

The Huayra BC uses a lightweight titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped out interior. The tyres are [[Pirelli]] P-Zero Corsa tires that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper along with a large rear wing. The car uses an [[Xtrac]] 7-speed [[sequential manual transmission]], and has an electro-hydraulic actuation. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double-clutch gearboxes.\n\nOnly 20 units of the Huayra BC were made, all of which were already sold with each unit costing \u20ac2.1M.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/pagani/huayra/60-bc/first-drive |title=First drive: the hardcore Pagani Huayra BC |publisher=Top Gear |date=2016-02-18 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ronan Glon |url=https://news.yahoo.com/pagani-insane-huayra-bc-boasts-142107723.html |title=Pagani\u2019s insane Huayra BC boasts more power, more carbon fiber, and a more muscular look |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=2016-02-19 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Huayra Roadster ===\nAfter 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled in the 2017 [[Geneva Motor Show]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://gtspirit.com/2017/03/07/geneva-2017-pagani-huayra-roadster/|title=Geneva 2017: Pagani Huayra Roadster|last=Adams|first=Lawrence|date=2017-03-07|website=GTspirit|access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref> \n\nThe design of the car has undergone several changes, with the most noticeable being the rear, with new eyelid-like fixed flaps that continue with the design and eventually end on the rear lights along with the inclusion of vents on the rear engine cover for efficient cooling of the engine, the wheels which are new and are specifically constructed for the car along with [[Pirelli]] P-Zero tires, and the addition of a spoiler at the front. The car also uses conventional doors instead of the [[Gull-wing door]]s used in the coup\u00e9 as such doors cannot be fitted to an open top car. The car utilises the same [[twin-turbo]] [[V12 engine]] as the coup\u00e9 but the power is now uprated and is {{convert|764|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm and {{Convert|1000|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,400 rpm. The power is delivered to the rear wheels via an all-new [[Xtrac]] 7-speed [[sequential manual transmission]] which is 40% lighter than its coup\u00e9 counterpart. The car is constructed by an all-new material developed by Pagani called 'carbon triax', which is a combination of tri-axis [[fibre glass]] with [[carbon fibre]] due to which the roadster weighs {{cvt|70|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} less than its coup\u00e9 counterpart, for a total of {{convert|1,280|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}, making it the first roadster lighter than the coup\u00e9.
