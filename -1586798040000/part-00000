The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the [[Spanish Empire]], with the exception of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[British Canada|Canada]], the north-eastern [[United States]] and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean. The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the [[Catholic]] faith through [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] conversions.\n\nBeginning with the 1492 arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] would expand across the [[Caribbean]] Islands, half of [[South America]], most of [[Central America]] and much of [[North America]] (including present day [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal]] regions of the [[United States]]). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492\u20131832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850\u20131950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|the indigenous population plummeted]] by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus's voyages, primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">\"La catastrophe d\u00e9mographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, p. 17</ref> This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of [[genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease, which is considered a byproduct of the [[Columbian exchange]]. [[Mestizaje|Racial mixing]] was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and ultimately led to the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity, which combines African, [[Hispanic]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.\n\nSpain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent [[balkanization]] of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific. Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.\n\n==Conquests==\n[[File:Banner of arms crown of Castille Habsbourg style.svg|thumb|upright=0.55|<center><hr />[[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] territory of [[Crown of Castile]].

Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.<ref>Ida Altman, S.L. Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003 pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\n===West Indies===\nColumbus made four voyages to the [[West Indies]] as the monarchs granted Columbus the governorship of the new territories, and financed more of his trans-Atlantic journeys. He founded [[La Navidad]] on the island later named [[Hispaniola]] (now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), in what is the present-day [[Haiti]] on his first voyage. After its destruction by the indigenous [[Taino]] people, the town of Isabella was begun in 1493, on his second voyage. In 1496 his brother, [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]], founded [[Santo Domingo]]. By 1500, despite a high death rate, there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area. The local [[Ta\u00edno]] people continued to resist, refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish-occupied villages. The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest. In 1500 the city of [[Nueva C\u00e1diz]] was founded on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]], followed by the founding of [[Aragua (state)|Santa Cruz]] by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in present-day [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira peninsula]].

Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.<ref>Robert S.

First published by University of California Press 1952.</ref> But not until the [[Spanish conquest of Peru]] was the conquest of the Aztecs matched in scope by the victory over the Inca empire in 1532.\n\nThe Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire was led by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]. The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.\n\nThe [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].\n\nSpain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].\n\n===Peru===\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of Peru}}\n[[File:Balboa s\u00fcdsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]\n[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]\n\nIn 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].\n\nThe Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Hu\u00e1scar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa]] was established in 1542.

A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from [[Asunci\u00f3n]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\" The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]].\n\n===New Granada===\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}\nBetween 1537 and 1543, six{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--Federmann from the east, De Belalc\u00e1zar from the south and De Quesada from the north, which others?--> Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia, conquered the [[Muisca Confederation]], and set up the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] ({{lang-es|Nuevo Reino de Granada}}).

In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in [[encomienda]], in order to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]], who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor.

The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment.

During the early [[Age of Discovery]], the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Robert |title=The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/spiritualconques00rica |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1966}}</ref> However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or [[secular clergy]], marked a turning point in the crown's control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Padden |first=Robert C. |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo of 1574 |journal=The Americas |number=12 |date=1956 |pp=333\u2013354}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Schwaller |first=John F |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo in New Spain, 1574\u20131600 |journal=The Americas |number=42 |date=1986 |pp=253\u2013274}}</ref> Religious orders along with the Jesuits embarked on further evangelization in frontier regions of the empire. The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the [[tithe]] on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop.{{sfn|Brading|1993|pp=241-247}} The crown [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]].\n\n==== Cabildos or town councils ====\n{{Main|Cabildo (council)}}\n[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|Cabildo in the city of [[Salta]] (Argentina)]]\n\nSpanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or ''Cabildo''.

The change diminished the political and economic power of the viceroyalty and opened formal connections between the mining district of Upper Peru and the port of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe system of crown rule evolved from the era of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], which established the [[Council of the Indies]], to the establishment of viceroyalties in Mexico and Peru following their conquests in the Habsburg era, and then into an [[Intendant]] system in the eighteenth century as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]].

In 1821 [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The [[Plan of Iguala]] was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico.\n\nThese began a movement for [[Spanish American wars of independence|colonial independence]] that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the [[French Revolution|French]] and the [[American Revolution]] influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s.

It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492\u20131832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850\u20131950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|the indigenous population plummeted]] by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus's voyages, primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">\"La catastrophe d\u00e9mographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, p. 17</ref> This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of [[genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease, which is considered a byproduct of the [[Columbian exchange]]. [[Mestizaje|Racial mixing]] was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and ultimately led to the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity, which combines African, [[Hispanic]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.\n\nSpain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent [[balkanization]] of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific.

Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.<ref>Ida Altman, S.L.

Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.<ref>Robert S.

The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.\n\nThe [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].\n\nSpain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].\n\n===Peru===\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of Peru}}\n[[File:Balboa s\u00fcdsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]\n[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]\n\nIn 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].\n\nThe Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Hu\u00e1scar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa]] was established in 1542. The [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nPeru was the last territory in the continent under Spanish occupation, which ended on 9 December 1824 at the Battle of Ayacucho  (Spanish rule continued until 1898 in Cuba and Puerto Rico).\n\n===R\u00edo de la Plata and Paraguay===\nEuropean explorers arrived in [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1516. Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Fort of Sancti Spiritu]] established in 1527 next to the [[Paran\u00e1 River]]. [[Buenos Aires]], a permanent colony, was established in 1536 and in 1537 [[Asunci\u00f3n]] was established in the area that is now [[Paraguay]]. Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away, and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from [[Asunci\u00f3n]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\" The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]].\n\n===New Granada===\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}\nBetween 1537 and 1543, six{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--Federmann from the east, De Belalc\u00e1zar from the south and De Quesada from the north, which others?--> Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia, conquered the [[Muisca Confederation]], and set up the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] ({{lang-es|Nuevo Reino de Granada}}).

Viceroyalties were the largest territory unit of administration in the civil and religious spheres and the boundaries of civil and ecclesiastical governance coincided by design, to ensure crown control over both bureaucracies.{{sfn|Mecham|1966|p=26}} Until the eighteenth century, there were just two viceroyalties, with the Viceroyalty of New Spain (founded 1535) administering North America, a portion of the Caribbean, and the Philippines, and the viceroyalty of Peru (founded 1542) having jurisdiction over Spanish South America. Viceroys served as the vice-patron of the Catholic Church, including the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Inquisition]], established in the seats of the viceroyalties (Mexico City and Peru). Viceroys were responsible for good governance of their territories, economic development, and humane treatment of the indigenous populations.<ref>Burkholder, Mark A. \"Viceroyalty, Viceroy\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 5, p. 408-409}}</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth-century reforms, the Viceroyalty of Peru was reorganized, splitting off portions to form the Viceroyalty of New Granada (Colombia) (1739) and the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata (Argentina) (1776), leaving Peru with jurisdiction over Peru, Charcas, and Chile.

Judges (''oidores'') held \"formidable power.

During a financial crisis in the late seventeenth century, the crown began selling Audiencia appointments, and American-born Spaniards held 45% of Audiencia appointments. Although there were restrictions of appointees' ties to local elite society and participation in the local economy, they acquired dispensations from the cash-strapped crown. Audiencia judgments and other functions became more tied to the locality and less to the crown and impartial justice.\n\nDuring the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in the mid-eighteenth century, the crown systematically sought to centralize power in its own hands and diminish that of its overseas possessions, appointing peninsular-born Spaniards to Audiencias. American-born elite men complained bitterly about the change, since they lost access to power that they had enjoyed for nearly a century.<ref name=\"burkholder audencia\" />\n\n====Civil administrative districts====\n{{Main|Corregidor (position)|Intendant}}\nDuring the early colonial era and under the Habsburgs, the crown established a regional layer of colonial jurisdiction in the institution of [[Corregimiento]], which was between the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] and [[Cabildo (council)|town councils]]. Corregimiento expanded \"royal authority from the urban centers into the countryside and over the indigenous population.\"<ref name=\"Corregidor\">Burkholder, Mark A. \"Corregidor\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 272}}</ref> As with many colonial institutions, corregimiento had its roots in Castile when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] centralize power over municipalities. In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in [[encomienda]], in order to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]], who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor. [[Alcald\u00eda mayor|Alcald\u00edas mayores]] were larger districts with a royal appointee, the ''Alcalde mayor''.\n\nAs the indigenous populations declined, the need for corregimiento decreased and then suppressed, with the alcald\u00eda mayor remaining an institution until it was replaced in the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]] by royal officials, [[Intendant]]s. The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment. As with many other royal posts, these positions were sold, starting in 1677.<ref name=Corregidor /> The Bourbon-era intendants were appointed and relatively well paid.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brungardt |first=Maurice |title=Corregidor/Corregimiento |volume=1 |encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC Clio |year=2006 |pages= 361\u2013363}}</ref>\n\n====Ecclesiastical organization====\n[[File:Vista de la Catedral de Puebla desde la terraza del Museo Amparo..jpg|thumb|left|[[Puebla Cathedral]]]]\n\nDuring the early colonial period, the crown authorized friars of [[Catholic religious order]]s ([[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinians]]) to function as priests during the conversion of indigenous populations. During the early [[Age of Discovery]], the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Robert |title=The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/spiritualconques00rica |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1966}}</ref> However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or [[secular clergy]], marked a turning point in the crown's control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Padden |first=Robert C. |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo of 1574 |journal=The Americas |number=12 |date=1956 |pp=333\u2013354}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Schwaller |first=John F |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo in New Spain, 1574\u20131600 |journal=The Americas |number=42 |date=1986 |pp=253\u2013274}}</ref> Religious orders along with the Jesuits embarked on further evangelization in frontier regions of the empire. The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the [[tithe]] on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop.{{sfn|Brading|1993|pp=241-247}} The crown [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]].\n\n==== Cabildos or town councils ====\n{{Main|Cabildo (council)}}\n[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|Cabildo in the city of [[Salta]] (Argentina)]]\n\nSpanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or ''Cabildo''.

Cook]] (1896\u20131974) was the most painstakingly careful researcher. From decades of research, he made estimates for the pre-contact population and the history of demographic decline during the Spanish and post-Spanish periods. According to Cook, the indigenous Californian population at first contact, in 1769, was about 310,000 and had dropped to 25,000 by 1910. The vast majority of the decline happened after the Spanish period, during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[United States|US]] periods of Californian history (1821\u20131910), with the most dramatic collapse (200,000 to 25,000) occurring in the US period (1846\u20131910).<ref>Baumhoff, Martin A. 1963.

The second factor was disease. ...A third factor, which strongly intensified the effect of the other two, was the social and physical disruption visited upon the Indian. He was driven from his home by the thousands, starved, beaten, raped, and murdered with impunity. He was not only given no assistance in the struggle against foreign diseases, but was prevented from adopting even the most elementary measures to secure his food, clothing, and shelter. The utter devastation caused by the white man was literally incredible, and not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"Cook, Sherburne F. 1976b.

{"title_page": "Drakula \u0130stanbul'da", "text_new": "{{More references|date=September 2016}}\n[[Image:Drakula Istanbulda.jpg|thumb|150px|right|''Dracula in \u0130stanbul'']]\n'''''Drakula \u0130stanbul'da''''' (''Dracula in Istanbul'') is a Turkish 1953 film version of [[Bram Stoker|Bram Stoker's]] original novel ''[[Dracula]]''.\n\nThe screenplay was based on a 1928 novel by [[Ali Riza Seyfi]] called ''Kaz\u0131kl\u0131 Voyvoda'' (''Impaler Voivode''), and is more or less a translation of Stoker's novel, but there is no [[Renfield]] character and G\u00fczin, the \"[[Mina Harker]]\" character, is a [[showgirl]] given to performing in revealing outfits. Drakula/Dracula is played by balding Atif Kaptan. Both the novel and the film make an explicit connection with the historical [[Vlad the Impaler]], the Prince and three-time Voivode of [[Wallachia]]. This is the first film to portray Dracula with fangs.\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 1953. Azmi, a lawyer, travels to Romania to close a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Azmi receives a letter from Dracula at an inn in Bistritz. He meets fearful, superstitious people at the inn. They are frightened at the mention of Draculas name, and because it is the 14th of the month, a day of ill omen. A woman warns him not to go, but Azmi says he carries an amulet for protection. The hotel\u2019 car only takes Azmi so far, and then Dracula\u2019s own carriage picks him up. The Count himself, incognito, drives the carriage to the castle. At the castle, Azmi is greeted by the Count, who helps Azmi with his bags and shows him to his room. Dracula makes excuses as to the absence of his servants, and as to why he doesn't plan to eat dinner. Azmi enjoys a supper in which the Count does not join him. Dracula tells Azmi about Transylvanian history. Wolves howl outside, and the Count remarks: \u201cListen to them\u2014the children of the night! They sing beautiful song\u201d.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42''.</ref>\n\nA hunchbacked servant suddenly appears and  gives Azmi a key to the library and warns him not to sleep there. In the library, the Count tells Azmi to write three letters home, in which he is to say that he has already left Transylvania. Azmi and Dracula discuss the sale of the house in Istanbul. Azmi cuts his thumb. The sight of blood excites the Count. Azmi explores the castle and falls asleep in one of the rooms, and is attacked a vampire woman. The Count stops the attack, giving the woman a baby to feed on. Azmi awakes as if from a nightmare. Dracula helps him return to his room. Azmi finds a book about vampires in\nthe library-but all the pages on how to destoy them are ripped off. A woman comes to the castle pleading for the return of her child. Wolves kill her. Azmi finds a vault in which the Count reposes in a coffin-like box and tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails, whereupon he flees in terror. Dracula later tries to attack Azmi, but his servant  intervenes, and Dracula kills him. A rooster crows, and Dracula disappears. Next night looking out a window, Azmi sees Dracula climb head-first down the outer wall. Azmi returns to the vault in which the Count reposes in his box and again tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails. He also empties a revolver into the Count, but gunshots do not harm him. Azmi runs away.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42-43''.</ref>\n\nBack in Turkey, Azmi's wife G\u00fczin receives one of his letters. She frets because it\u2019s the first she's heard from him in ten days. G\u00fczin spends her time with her best friend Sadan.  Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately. Though Sadan seems happy as she recently become engaged to Turan. G\u00fczin and Sadan go to the seashore. While taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disap- peared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. G\u00fczin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. G\u00fczin walks Sadan back to her room. Sadan begins to suffer from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. Her illness baffles Dr. Akif. Dr.Nuri is called to examine Sadan  and notices that she has two tiny wounds on her throat. G\u00fczin meanwhile learns that Azmi  is being nursed back to health in a hospital in Edirne. She goes to bring him home. Dr.Nuri recommends blood transfusions for Sadan. He also places garlic in her room and prepares a wreath of it for her to wear in her sleep. He warns that her windows should not be opened at night. That night, Sadan\u2019s mother removes the necklace, with disastrous results. The Count breaks the window to Sadan\u2019s room and attacks her. Sadan\u2019s mother, who is still in the room at the time, dies of a heart attack. Azmi and G\u00fczin return from Edirne, but they are too late. Sadan is on her deathbed, marks from her neck vanished and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She speaks with strange seductiveness to Turan, but Dr. Nuri prevents Turan from kissing her. Sadan dies, is buried and then rises as vampire, who preys on children. Dr.Nuri, Azmi, G\u00fczin , Dr.Akif, and Turan agree to join forces against the Count. Dr.Nuri tells the others of his suspicions about Dracula, and about his limitations: he retreats from garlic, and he can be killed by a stake through the heart or by decapitation. Dr. Nuri also reveals that the wounds in the children\u2019s throats weren't made in the same way as Sadan\u2019s wounds, but were made by Sadan herself. Dr.Nuri leads Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb, Sadan's coffin is empty.<ref>Lyndon W.

That night, Dr. Nuri returns to the graveyard with Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan, and wait for Sadan. She returns to the tomb carrying a child, whom she abandons when Van Dr.Nuri and the others confront her. After trying to sweet-talk Turan, she recoils from a garlic clove and is captured. The men then return Sadan to her grave, and Turan stakes her. Dr.Nuri, Azmi, Turan, and Dr.Akif infiltrate Dracula's house and find the boxes. They place garlic in them, and then lie in wait for the Count\u2019s return. G\u00fczin, who is a showgirl, is performing that night and has to return to the musical hall to fetch her garlic wreath she left there and is detained by Dracula, who waited her there.

Drakula/Dracula is played by balding Atif Kaptan. Both the novel and the film make an explicit connection with the historical [[Vlad the Impaler]], the Prince and three-time Voivode of [[Wallachia]]. This is the first film to portray Dracula with fangs.\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 1953. Azmi, a lawyer, travels to Romania to close a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Azmi receives a letter from Dracula at an inn in Bistritz. He meets fearful, superstitious people at the inn. They are frightened at the mention of Draculas name, and because it is the 14th of the month, a day of ill omen. A woman warns him not to go, but Azmi says he carries an amulet for protection. The hotel\u2019 car only takes Azmi so far, and then Dracula\u2019s own carriage picks him up. The Count himself, incognito, drives the carriage to the castle. At the castle, Azmi is greeted by the Count, who helps Azmi with his bags and shows him to his room. Dracula makes excuses as to the absence of his servants, and as to why he doesn't plan to eat dinner. Azmi enjoys a supper in which the Count does not join him. Dracula tells Azmi about Transylvanian history. Wolves howl outside, and the Count remarks: \u201cListen to them\u2014the children of the night! They sing beautiful song\u201d.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42''.</ref>\n\nA hunchbacked servant suddenly appears and  gives Azmi a key to the library and warns him not to sleep there. In the library, the Count tells Azmi to write three letters home, in which he is to say that he has already left Transylvania. Azmi and Dracula discuss the sale of the house in Istanbul. Azmi cuts his thumb. The sight of blood excites the Count. Azmi explores the castle and falls asleep in one of the rooms, and is attacked a vampire woman. The Count stops the attack, giving the woman a baby to feed on. Azmi awakes as if from a nightmare. Dracula helps him return to his room. Azmi finds a book about vampires in\nthe library-but all the pages on how to destoy them are ripped off. A woman comes to the castle pleading for the return of her child. Wolves kill her. Azmi finds a vault in which the Count reposes in a coffin-like box and tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails, whereupon he flees in terror. Dracula later tries to attack Azmi, but his servant  intervenes, and Dracula kills him. A rooster crows, and Dracula disappears. Next night looking out a window, Azmi sees Dracula climb head-first down the outer wall. Azmi returns to the vault in which the Count reposes in his box and again tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails. He also empties a revolver into the Count, but gunshots do not harm him. Azmi runs away.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42-43''.</ref>\n\nBack in Turkey, Azmi's wife G\u00fczin receives one of his letters. She frets because it\u2019s the first she's heard from him in ten days. G\u00fczin spends her time with her best friend Sadan.  Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately. Though Sadan seems happy as she recently become engaged to Turan. G\u00fczin and Sadan go to the seashore. While taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disap- peared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. G\u00fczin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. G\u00fczin walks Sadan back to her room.

Conway's minimal \"suitcase drum\" setup harks back to his use of the cocktail drum.<ref>[https://jeffreyfoucault.com/press Jeffrey Foucault's website]</ref> \n\nConway occasionally joins [[Vapors of Morphine]], which honors the legacy of Morphine, for some big shows.<ref>[https://www.vaporsofmorphine.com/bio/ Vapors of Morphine bio]</ref> \n\nHe also continues to perform as a guest on albums and live dates by other artists. In particular, Chris Smither cited Conway's feel and intuition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ecurrent.com/music/guitars-influence-going-solo-and-playing-in-the-band/ |author=Bye, Brandon |title=Guitars, Influence, Going Solo, and Playing in the Band |work=Current |date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nConway was drummer on ''Early Riser'', the ninth album by [[John Statz]], recorded in 2019 and released in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.westword.com/music/hear-it-john-statz-on-recording-with-morphine-drummer-billy-conway-11683821 |author=Solomon, Jon |title= Hear It: John Statz on Recording With Morphine Drummer Billy Conway |work=Westword |date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Conway, Fitting, and Champagne got together and recorded an album. A live date was announced for January 19, 2020 at Club Passim in Cambridge -- which was to be their first appearance together on stage since all were members of Treat Her Right. Unfortunately, it was announced that week that Conway would not be able to perform at the event because of health issues and that Jerome Deupree and Larry Dersch would fill in.<ref>[https://www.passim.org/live-music/events/billy-jimmy-dave/ Club Passim website]</ref> At the event Fitting told the audience Conway had restarted cancer treatment. He was originally diagnosed in 2014. \n\n== Solo album ==\nYet despite his health challenges, and in part because of them, Conway released his first solo album, ''Outside Inside'' in 2020. It was accompanied by a new album from Sargent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/09/arts/making-music-or-weathering-misfortune-billy-conway-laurie-sargent-are-this-together/?fbclid=IwAR0o2pjTKdspZ0AY4j2YO8gdb789jYhHCv543HMD20LnKEuMY4B7BWI5qtU |author=Sullivan, James |title= Making music or weathering misfortune, Billy Conway and Laurie Sargent are in this together|work=Boston Globe |date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== As producer ==\n\nConway has served as a producer and engineer. This arose in his prior capacity as a founder of [[Hi-n-Dry]], but he also oversaw two of Kris Delmhorst's albums, ''[[Five Stories (album)|Five Stories]]'' and ''[[Songs for a Hurricane]]''.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-conway-mn0000767868/credits Billy Conway's credits - Allmusic.com]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conway, Billy}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American drummers]]\n[[Category:Yale University alumni]]\n[[Category:Morphine (band) members]]\n[[Category:People from Owatonna, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Record producers from Minnesota]]\n", "name_user": "Rory1262", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSolo album", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Conway_(drummer)"}
