Hence the name ''Antwerpen'', from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''hand werpen'', akin to Old English ''hand'' and ''wearpan'' (to throw), which has evolved to today's ''warp''.<ref>[http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0000599.php4 Brabo Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerpen] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nA longstanding theory is that the name originated in the Gallo-Roman period and comes from the Latin ''antverpia''. ''Antverpia'' would come from ''Ante'' (before) ''Verpia'' (deposition, sedimentation), indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river (which is in fact the same origin as Germanic ''waerpen''). Note that the river Scheldt, before a transition period between 600 and 750, followed a different track. This must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city, situating the city within a former curve of the river.<ref>[http://www.viatrip.com/articles/Antwerp_Tourist_Information.htm Antwerp Tourist Information] \u2013 Meredith Booney, ''\"The name 'Antwerp' has been linked to the word \"aanwerp\" (alluvial mound), which was the geographical feature in the early settlement period in this place\"''.</ref> However, many historians think it unlikely that there was a large settlement which would be named 'Antverpia', but more something like an outpost with a river crossing.\n\nHowever, [[John Lothrop Motley]] argues, and so do a lot of historians and Dutch (language) etymologists,{{who|date=February 2020}} that Antwerp's name derives from \"''anda\"'' (at) and ''\"werpum\"'' (wharf)<ref name=\"placenames\">{{cite book |last = Room |first = Adrian |title = Placenames of the World |publisher = McFarland & Company |date = 1 August 1997 |location =  |page = [https://archive.org/details/placenamesofworl00room/page/32 32] |isbn = 0-7864-0172-9 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/placenamesofworl00room/page/32 }}</ref> to give ''an 't werf'' (on the wharf, in the same meaning as the current English [[wharf]]). ''Aan 't werp'' (at the warp) is also possible. This \"warp\" (thrown ground) is a man-made hill or a river deposit, high enough to remain dry at high tide, whereupon a construction could be built that would remain dry. Another word for werp is ''pol'' (dyke)  hence [[polder]]s (the dry land behind a dyke, that was no longer flooded by the tide).\n\n[[Alfred Michiels]] has suggested that derivations based on ''hand werpen'', ''Antverpia'', \"on the wharf\", or \"at the warp\" lack historical backing in the form of recorded past spellings of the placename. He points instead to [[Audoin (bishop)|Dado]]'s ''Life of [[St. Eligius]]'' (''Vita Eligii'') from the 7th century, which records the form ''Andoverpis''.

At the end of the 10th century, the Scheldt became the boundary of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Antwerp became a [[Margraviate of Antwerp|margraviate]] in 980, by the German emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]], a border province facing the [[County of Flanders]].\n\nIn the 11th century, the best-known leader of the [[First Crusade]] (1096-1099), [[Godfrey of Bouillon]],  was originally [[Margraviate of Antwerp#Margraves of Antwerp|Margrave of Antwerp]], from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of [[Lower Lorraine]] (1087-1100) and [[King of Jerusalem|Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] (1099-1100). In the 12th century, [[Norbert of Xanten]] established a community of his [[Premonstratensian|Premonstratensian canons]] at [[St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp|St. Michael's Abbey]] at Caloes. Antwerp was also the headquarters of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] during his early negotiations with [[Jacob van Artevelde]], and his son [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel]], the [[Duke of Clarence]], was born there in 1338.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Antwerp (city)|display=Antwerp|volume=2|pages=155\u2013156}}</ref>\n\n===16th century===\n[[File:Osias Beert the Elder - Dishes with Oysters, Fruit, and Wine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Osias Beert]] the Elder, from Antwerp.

[[Francesco Guicciardini]], the Florentine envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo.

The city's trade expanded to include cloth from England, Italy and Germany, wines from Germany, France and Spain, salt from France, and wheat from the Baltic. The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers.

During [[World War I]], the city became the fallback point of the [[Belgian Army]] after the defeat at [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]. The [[Siege of Antwerp (1914)|Siege of Antwerp]] lasted for 11 days, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under [[German occupation of Belgium during World War I|German occupation]] until the Armistice.\n\nAntwerp hosted the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. During [[World War II]], the city was an important strategic target because of its port. It was [[Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France|occupied by Germany]] in May 1940 and liberated by the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 11th Armoured Division]] on 4 September 1944. After this, the Germans attempted to destroy the [[Port of Antwerp]], which was used by the Allies to bring new material ashore. Thousands of [[Rheinbote]], [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2]] missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (and particularly [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]) [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.<ref>Michael Ryckewaert, ''[[Planning Perspectives]],'' July 2010, Vol. 25 Issue 3, pp 303\u2013322,</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre.

Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to [[Brussels]], [[Hasselt]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Ghent]], [[Lille]] and [[Bruges]] and [[Breda]] and [[Bergen op Zoom]] (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the [[Kennedytunnel|Kennedy Tunnel]] (1967) and the [[Liefkenshoektunnel|Liefkenshoek Tunnel]] (1991).\n\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"[[Oosterweelconnection]]\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the ''Lange Wapper'') over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn September 2010 the [[Flemish Government]] decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:AntwerpCS May 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station|Antwerp Central Station]]]]\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to [[Amsterdam]] and Paris, and national trains to [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]], [[Ostend]], [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Hasselt]], [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Leuven]] and [[Turnhout]].\n\n[[Antwerpen-Central railway station|Antwerp Central station]] is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in [[W. G. Sebald|W G Sebald]]'s haunting novel [[Austerlitz (novel)|''Austerlitz'']]. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\n\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest [[classification yard]] for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n===Public transportation===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by [[De Lijn]] and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The [[Antwerp Tram|tram network]] has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"[[Antwerp Pre-metro|premetro]]\" and includes a tunnel under the river.

Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Social Democrat]] party: [[Camille Huysmans]], [[Lode Craeybeckx]], Frans Deti\u00e8ge and [[Mathilde Schroyens]], and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en [[Patrick Janssens]]. Since 2013, the mayor is the Flemish nationalist [[Bart De Wever]], belonging to the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish separatist]] party [[N-VA]] ([[New Flemish Alliance]]).\n\n==Climate==\nAntwerp has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'') similar to that of [[Southern England]], while being far enough inland to build up summer warmth above {{convert|23|C|F}} average highs for both July and August.

He extracted a toll from passing boatmen, and for those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river.<ref>Legenden en Mythen [http://www.figy.be/legenden/Antwerpen_Brabo.htm Legende van Brabo en de reus Antigoon]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201213033/http://www.figy.be/legenden/Antwerpen_Brabo.htm |date=1 December 2010 }}</ref> Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named [[Silvius Brabo]], who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. Hence the name ''Antwerpen'', from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''hand werpen'', akin to Old English ''hand'' and ''wearpan'' (to throw), which has evolved to today's ''warp''.<ref>[http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0000599.php4 Brabo Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerpen] {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\nA longstanding theory is that the name originated in the Gallo-Roman period and comes from the Latin ''antverpia''. ''Antverpia'' would come from ''Ante'' (before) ''Verpia'' (deposition, sedimentation), indicating land that forms by deposition in the inside curve of a river (which is in fact the same origin as Germanic ''waerpen''). Note that the river Scheldt, before a transition period between 600 and 750, followed a different track. This must have coincided roughly with the current ringway south of the city, situating the city within a former curve of the river.<ref>[http://www.viatrip.com/articles/Antwerp_Tourist_Information.htm Antwerp Tourist Information] \u2013 Meredith Booney, ''\"The name 'Antwerp' has been linked to the word \"aanwerp\" (alluvial mound), which was the geographical feature in the early settlement period in this place\"''.</ref> However, many historians think it unlikely that there was a large settlement which would be named 'Antverpia', but more something like an outpost with a river crossing.\n\nHowever, [[John Lothrop Motley]] argues, and so do a lot of historians and Dutch (language) etymologists,{{who|date=February 2020}} that Antwerp's name derives from \"''anda\"'' (at) and ''\"werpum\"'' (wharf)<ref name=\"placenames\">{{cite book |last = Room |first = Adrian |title = Placenames of the World |publisher = McFarland & Company |date = 1 August 1997 |location =  |page = [https://archive.org/details/placenamesofworl00room/page/32 32] |isbn = 0-7864-0172-9 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/placenamesofworl00room/page/32 }}</ref> to give ''an 't werf'' (on the wharf, in the same meaning as the current English [[wharf]]). ''Aan 't werp'' (at the warp) is also possible. This \"warp\" (thrown ground) is a man-made hill or a river deposit, high enough to remain dry at high tide, whereupon a construction could be built that would remain dry. Another word for werp is ''pol'' (dyke)  hence [[polder]]s (the dry land behind a dyke, that was no longer flooded by the tide).\n\n[[Alfred Michiels]] has suggested that derivations based on ''hand werpen'', ''Antverpia'', \"on the wharf\", or \"at the warp\" lack historical backing in the form of recorded past spellings of the placename. He points instead to [[Audoin (bishop)|Dado]]'s ''Life of [[St. Eligius]]'' (''Vita Eligii'') from the 7th century, which records the form ''Andoverpis''.

In the 12th century, [[Norbert of Xanten]] established a community of his [[Premonstratensian|Premonstratensian canons]] at [[St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp|St. Michael's Abbey]] at Caloes.

The city's skilled workers processed soap, fish, sugar, and especially cloth. Banks helped finance the trade, the merchants, and the manufacturers.

Thousands of [[Rheinbote]], [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2]] missiles were fired (more V-2s than used on all other targets during the entire war combined), causing severe damage to the city but failed to destroy the port due to poor accuracy. After the war, Antwerp, which had already had a sizeable Jewish population before the war, once again became a major European centre of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] (and particularly [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]]) [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\nA Ten-Year Plan for the port of Antwerp (1956\u20131965) expanded and modernized the port's infrastructure with national funding to build a set of canal docks. The broader aim was to facilitate the growth of the north-eastern Antwerp metropolitan region, which attracted new industry based on a flexible and strategic implementation of the project as a co-production between various authorities and private parties. The plan succeeded in extending the linear layout along the Scheldt river by connecting new satellite communities to the main strip.<ref>Michael Ryckewaert, ''[[Planning Perspectives]],'' July 2010, Vol. 25 Issue 3, pp 303\u2013322,</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Antwerp rebranded itself as a world-class fashion centre.

Known locally as the \"Ring\" it offers motorway connections to [[Brussels]], [[Hasselt]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Ghent]], [[Lille]] and [[Bruges]] and [[Breda]] and [[Bergen op Zoom]] (Netherlands). The banks of the Scheldt are linked by three road tunnels (in order of construction): the Waasland Tunnel (1934), the [[Kennedytunnel|Kennedy Tunnel]] (1967) and the [[Liefkenshoektunnel|Liefkenshoek Tunnel]] (1991).\n\nDaily congestion on the Ring led to a fourth high-volume highway link called the \"[[Oosterweelconnection]]\" being proposed. It would have entailed the construction of a long viaduct and bridge (the ''Lange Wapper'') over the docks on the north side of the city in combination with the widening of the existing motorway into a 14-lane motorway; these plans were eventually rejected in a 2009 public referendum. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn September 2010 the [[Flemish Government]] decided to replace the bridge by a series of tunnels. There are ideas to cover the Ring in a similar way as happened around Paris, Hamburg, Madrid and other cities. This would reconnect the city with its suburbs and would provide development opportunities to accommodate part of the foreseen population growth in Antwerp which currently are not possible because of the pollution and noise generated by the traffic on the Ring. An old plan to build an R2 outer ring road outside the built up urban area around the Antwerp agglomeration for port related traffic and transit traffic never materialized. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:AntwerpCS May 2012.jpg|thumb|[[Antwerpen-Centraal railway station|Antwerp Central Station]]]]\nAntwerp is the focus of lines to the north to Essen and the Netherlands, east to Turnhout, south to Mechelen, Brussels and Charleroi, and southwest to Ghent and Ostend. It is served by international trains to [[Amsterdam]] and Paris, and national trains to [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]], [[Ostend]], [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Hasselt]], [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], [[Leuven]] and [[Turnhout]].\n\n[[Antwerpen-Central railway station|Antwerp Central station]] is an architectural monument in itself, and is mentioned in [[W. G. Sebald|W G Sebald]]'s haunting novel [[Austerlitz (novel)|''Austerlitz'']]. Prior to the completion in 2007 of a tunnel that runs northwards under the city centre to emerge at the old Antwerp Dam station, Central was a terminus. Trains from Brussels to the Netherlands had to either reverse at Central or call only at Berchem station, {{convert|2|km|0|abbr=off}} to the south, and then describe a semicircle to the east, round the Singel. Now, they call at the new lower level of the station before continuing in the same direction.\n\nAntwerp is also home to Antwerpen-Noord, the largest [[classification yard]] for freight in Belgium and second largest in Europe. The majority of freight trains in Belgium depart from or arrive here. It has two classification humps and over a hundred tracks.\n\n===Public transportation===\nThe city has a web of tram and bus lines operated by [[De Lijn]] and providing access to the city centre, suburbs and the Left Bank. The [[Antwerp Tram|tram network]] has 12 lines, of which the underground section is called the \"[[Antwerp Pre-metro|premetro]]\" and includes a tunnel under the river.

Between 1848 and 1921, all mayors were from the Liberal Party (except for the so-called Meeting-intermezzo between 1863 and 1872). Between 1921 and 1932, the city had a Catholic mayor again: Frans Van Cauwelaert.\nFrom 1932 onwards and up until 2013, all mayors belonged to the [[Socialistische Partij Anders|Social Democrat]] party: [[Camille Huysmans]], [[Lode Craeybeckx]], Frans Deti\u00e8ge and [[Mathilde Schroyens]], and after the municipality fusion: Bob Cools, Leona Deti\u00e8ge en [[Patrick Janssens]].

{"title_page": "Sighnaq", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|{{more footnotes|date=July 2017}}{{refimprove|date=July 2017}}}}\n\n'''Sighnaq''' was an ancient city in [[Central Asia]] (in modern [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyzylorda Region]]), it was the capital of the [[Blue Horde]] (i.e., the White Horde of Persian sources), although the city is almost unknown. The region in which Sighnaq was situated was called [[Farab]], it was located between [[Isfijab]] and [[Jand (Transoxania)|Jand]]. The name means 'place of refuge', a name that is found also in other regions, especially in [[Transcaucasia]].\n\nAccording to Hathon, Sighnaq was located in the [[Karatau Mountains]], from where the river Kara Ichuk, a tributary of [[Syr Darya]], emanates. Klaproth says that the city was located on the banks of Mutkan, a right hand side tributary of Syr Darya, that emanates from the Karatau mountains, but he does not mention his source. Sherif al-Din speaks of Sabran and Sighnaq as two border cities of [[Turkestan]] and says that Sighnaq was located 40&nbsp;km from [[Otrar]]; the biographical book called ''Tabakatol hanefiyet'', by Ketevi, placed it near the town of Yassy (i.e. the modern city of [[Turkistan (city)|Turkistan]]). The 19th century Hungarian turkologist and traveller [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry|V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] says, without mentioning the source, that Jand was connected to a channel. It seems to have been one of the main Turkish settlements of the region east of the Caspian Sea together with Yengikent, Sawran or Sabran and others. Mahmud Kashghari expressly stated it was a town of the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]], [[al-Muqaddasi]] also associates it with Otrar and says that it was \"24 farsakhs further up the Syr Darya\". On the basis of all of this information, the most reasonable localization appears to be the area around Babai Kurgan, and finally, Sunak Kurgan, a few kilometers northeast of Tyumen Arik along the [[Orenburg]]-[[Tashkent]] railway, was identified as the ruins of Sighnaq.\n\nIt is believed that in the tenth century there was a semi-sedentary city of the Oghuz Turks near the border, where they exchanged their products with those of Muslim states to the South. The ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' indicates that bows were manufactured for export. The region was known as Dar al-Kufr. In the twelfth century it was the capital of the [[Kipchak Khanate|khanate of Kipchak]] (still pagan), and was exposed to raids of the 'ghazis'.

The region in which Sighnaq was situated was called [[Farab]], it was located between [[Isfijab]] and [[Jand (Transoxania)|Jand]]. The name means 'place of refuge', a name that is found also in other regions, especially in [[Transcaucasia]].\n\nAccording to Hathon, Sighnaq was located in the [[Karatau Mountains]], from where the river Kara Ichuk, a tributary of [[Syr Darya]], emanates. Klaproth says that the city was located on the banks of Mutkan, a right hand side tributary of Syr Darya, that emanates from the Karatau mountains, but he does not mention his source. Sherif al-Din speaks of Sabran and Sighnaq as two border cities of [[Turkestan]] and says that Sighnaq was located 40&nbsp;km from [[Otrar]]; the biographical book called ''Tabakatol hanefiyet'', by Ketevi, placed it near the town of Yassy (i.e. the modern city of [[Turkistan (city)|Turkistan]]). The 19th century Hungarian turkologist and traveller [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry|V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] says, without mentioning the source, that Jand was connected to a channel. It seems to have been one of the main Turkish settlements of the region east of the Caspian Sea together with Yengikent, Sawran or Sabran and others. Mahmud Kashghari expressly stated it was a town of the [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]], [[al-Muqaddasi]] also associates it with Otrar and says that it was \"24 farsakhs further up the Syr Darya\". On the basis of all of this information, the most reasonable localization appears to be the area around Babai Kurgan, and finally, Sunak Kurgan, a few kilometers northeast of Tyumen Arik along the [[Orenburg]]-[[Tashkent]] railway, was identified as the ruins of Sighnaq.\n\nIt is believed that in the tenth century there was a semi-sedentary city of the Oghuz Turks near the border, where they exchanged their products with those of Muslim states to the South. The ''[[Hudud al-'Alam]]'' indicates that bows were manufactured for export. The region was known as Dar al-Kufr. In the twelfth century it was the capital of the [[Kipchak Khanate|khanate of Kipchak]] (still pagan), and was exposed to raids of the 'ghazis'. At least two incursions (ghazawat) are known, one in 1152 and one in 1195, from [[Khwarezm]], the second one occurred while Kayir Toku Khan ruled Sighnaq. However, at the beginning of the thirteenth century [[Ala al-Din Muhammad]] conquered the land and annexed it to his empire; a few years later, his rule was replaced with that of [[Genghis Khan]], who conquered the region after a siege in 1220.

Many groups throughout Church history and many modern denominations have practiced foot washing as a [[Ordinance (Christian)|church ordinance]] including [[Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Free Will Baptists]], and [[Pentecostals]].<ref name=\"common\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word ''Maundy'' has at least two possibilities:\n# Through Middle English and Old French ''mand\u00e9'', from Latin ''mandatum''.\n# From the Latin ''mendicare'', Old French ''mendier'', and English ''maund'', which means \"to beg\" (verb) or a \"small basket\" (noun) held out by maunders (beggars) as they maunded (begged).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disciplingsmlc.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/notes-about-lent-and-holy-week/ |title=Notes about Lent and Holy Week |website=Discipling Ministry |location=Frazier Park, California |publisher=Shepherd of the Mountains Lutheran Church |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe root of this practice appears to be found in the hospitality customs of ancient civilizations, especially where sandals were the chief footwear. A host would provide water for guests to wash their feet, provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests or even serve the guests by washing their feet. This is mentioned in several places in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]] (e.g. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|18:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:2|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|24:32|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|43:24|KJV}}; [[I Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|25:41|KJV}}; et al.), as well as other religious and historical documents. A typical Eastern host might bow, greet, and kiss his guest, then offer water to allow the guest to wash his feet or have servants do it. Though the wearing of sandals might necessitate washing the feet, the water was also offered as a courtesy even when shoes were worn.\n\n[[I Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|25:41|KJV}} is the first biblical passage where an honored person offers to wash feet as a sign of humility. In John 12, [[Mary of Bethany]] anointed Jesus' feet presumably in gratitude for raising her brother [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, and in preparation for his death and burial. The Bible records washing of the saint's feet being practised by the [[primitive church]] in [[I Timothy]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Timothy|5:10|KJV}} perhaps in reference to piety, submission and/or humility. There are several names for this practice: ''maundy'', ''foot washing'', ''washing the saints' feet'', ''pedilavium'', and ''mandatum''.\n\nThe foot washing, described in the thirteenth chapter of the Gospel of John, is concerned with the Latin title of ''[[Servus servorum dei]]'' (\"Servant of the Servant of God\"), which was historically reserved to the Bishops and to the Pope, also called the [[Bishop of Rome]]. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, commissioned the Twelve to be Servant of the Servant of God, and this calling to the [[Imitation of Christ]] has been firstly extended to all the bishops of the Church as the direct [[Apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]]. The Apostles received the Holy Spirit from Jesus in the gospel of John chapter 20.22 and in fullness upon the day of the [[Pentecost]] in chapter 2 of the Book of Acts, for the [[evangelization]] and salvation of all the human race. This belief is common to Catholics, to some denominations of the Western Christianity, and is consistent and in keeping with Eastern Christian beliefs. \n\nA main point of contention between Eastern Orthodox Christians and Western Christians is the ''[[Filioque]]'' doctrine, and the subsequent understanding concerning the progression and movement of the Holy Spirit. The Filioque doctrine is rejected by many Eastern Orthodox, whereas it is advanced by most Western Christians. Western Christians maintain that the Holy Spirit proceeds simultaneous from God the Father and God the Son, whereas many Eastern Christians maintain that God the Holy Spirit proceeds uniquely from [[God the Father]]: Eastern Christians subsequently believe that the Apostles received the Holy Spirit with his [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit|seven gifts]] from God the Father, and all the bishops onward, like their successors. However, this variance in belief does not impact the words of Christ and the command to his apostles to be the Servant of the Servant of God. \n\nIt is also recalled in the Latin [[Magnificat#Text|text of the ''Magnificat'']], for which God \"regarded the lowliness\" of His Most Blessed Virgin Mother and, by effect of that, \"magnified\" her (\"He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the humble and meek.\"). God also did the same to all the other creatures, both before and after the Incarnation, for: \n* Jesus Christ God: as affirmed in {{bibleref2|Philippians|2:8-11|NKJV}};\n* all the angels: the Satan's mighty pride to be like God made him the [[fallen angel]] before the starting of the creation, and also it was punished with the promised mission of a woman (Mary), a Servant of God, which would have bruise his head ({{bibleref2|Genesis|3:14-15|NKJV}}). On the opposite side, the lowliness of St Michael the Archangel made him the head of the [[Hierarchy of angels#Christianity|hierarchy of angels]]; \n* all the human creatures: according to the promise of Jesus in {{bibleref2|Luke|14,1.7-11|NKJV}}.\n\n== Biblical reference ==\n[[File:Washing of the Feet - Capella dei Scrovegni - Padua 2016.jpg|thumb|''Christ Reasoning with Peter'', by [[Giotto di Bondone]] (Cappella Scrovegni a Padova).]]\n\nChristian denominations that observe foot washing do so on the basis of the authoritative example and command of [[Jesus]] as found in {{bibleverse|John|13:1\u201315|NKJV}} ([[New King James Version|NKJV]]):\n\n{{quote|Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.}} \n\nJesus demonstrates the custom of the time when he comments on the lack of hospitality in one [[Pharisees]] home by not providing water to wash his feet in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:44:\n\n{{quote|And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.}}\n\n== History ==\nThe rite of foot washing finds its roots in scripture. Even after the [[Deaths of the Twelve Apostles|death of the apostles]] or the end of the [[Apostolic Age]], the practice was continued.\n\nIt appears to have been practiced in the [[Early Christianity|early centuries of post-apostolic Christianity]], though the evidence is scant. For example, [[Tertullian]] (145\u2013220) mentions the practice in his ''De Corona'', but gives no details as to who practiced it or how it was practiced. It was practiced by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Milan|Church at Milan]] (c. 380), is mentioned by the ''[[Council of Elvira]]'' (300), and is even referenced by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (c. 400).\n\nObservance of foot washing at the time of baptism was maintained in [[Africa]], [[Gaul]], [[Germany]], [[Milan]], northern [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].\n\nAccording to the ''Mennonite Encyclopedia'' \"[[St. Benedict]]'s ''Rule'' (529) for the [[Benedictine Order]] prescribed hospitality feetwashing in addition to a communal feetwashing for humility\"; a statement confirmed by the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].<ref name=\"Washing of Hands and Feet\">{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Washing of Feet and Hands}}</ref> It apparently was established in the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Roman church]], though not in connection with baptism, by the 8th century.\n\nThe [[Albigenses]] observed footwashing in connection with communion, and the [[Waldensians|Waldenses]]' custom was to wash the feet of visiting ministers.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThere is some evidence that it was observed by the early [[Hussites]]; and the practice was a meaningful part of the 16th century [[radical reformation]]. Foot washing was often \"rediscovered\" or \"restored\" by Protestants in revivals of religion in which the participants tried to recreate the faith and practice of the [[apostolic era]] which they had abandoned or lost.\n\n== Catholic practice ==\nIn [[Catholic Church]], the ritual washing of feet is now associated with the [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]], which celebrates in a special way the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus, before which he washed the feet of his [[twelve apostles]].\n\nEvidence for the practice on this day goes back at least to the latter half of the 12th century, when \"the pope washed the feet of twelve [[sub-deacon]]s after his Mass and of thirteen poor men after his dinner.\"<ref name=\"Washing of Hands and Feet\" />  From 1570 to 1955, the [[Roman Missal]] printed, after the text of the [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a rite of washing of feet unconnected with the Mass.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For many years [[Pius IX]] performed the foot washing in the sala over the portico of [[Saint Peter's, Rome]].{{sfn|Tuker|Malleson|1897|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Court function at the Palace of Ribeira in 1748.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[John V of Portugal]] performs the Washing of the Feet rite in [[Ribeira Palace]], 1748.]]\nIn 1955 [[Pope Pius XII]] revised the ritual and inserted it into the Mass. Since then, the rite is celebrated after the [[homily]] that follows the reading of the [[gospel]] account of how [[Jesus]] washed the feet of his twelve apostles ({{bibleverse||John|13:1\u201315|KJV}}). Some persons who have been selected&nbsp;\u2013 usually twelve, but the Roman Missal does not specify the number&nbsp;\u2013 are led to chairs prepared in a suitable place. The [[priest]] goes to each and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one's feet and dries them.

Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the [[The Lord's Supper|Lord's supper]] service. There has been some revival of the practice as other liturgical churches have also rediscovered the practice.\n\n== Eastern Christian practice ==\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]]).]]\n\n=== Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic ===\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] practice the ritual of the Washing of Feet on [[Holy and Great Thursday]] (Maundy Thursday) according to their ancient rites. The service may be performed either by a [[bishop]], washing the feet of twelve priests; or by an [[Hegumen]] (Abbot) washing the feet of twelve members of the brotherhood of his [[monastery]].  The ceremony takes place at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nAfter [[Holy Communion]], and before the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]], the brethren all go in [[procession]] to the place where the Washing of Feet is to take place (it may be in the center of the [[nave]], in the [[narthex]], or a location outside). After a psalm and some [[troparion|troparia]] (hymns) an [[ektenia]] (litany) is recited, and the bishop or abbot reads a prayer. Then the [[deacon]] reads the account in the Gospel of John, while the clergy perform the roles of Christ and his apostles as each action is chanted by the deacon. The deacon stops when the dialogue between Jesus and Peter begins. The senior-ranking clergyman among those whose feet are being washed speaks the words of Peter, and the bishop or abbot speaks the words of Jesus. Then the bishop or abbot himself concludes the reading of the Gospel, after which he says another prayer and sprinkles all of those present with the water that was used for the foot washing. The procession then returns to the church and the final dismissal is given as normal.\n\n=== Oriental Orthodox ===\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] washing the feet of children.]]\nFoot washing rites are also observed in the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches on Maundy Thursday.\n\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] the service is performed by the parish priest. He blesses the water for the foot washing with the cross, just as he would for blessing [[holy water]] and he washes the feet of the entire congregation.\n\nIn the Syrian Orthodox Church, this service is performed by a bishop or priest. There will be some 12 selected men, both priests and the lay people, and the bishop or priest will wash and kiss the feet of those 12 men. It is not merely a dramatization of the past event.

Many groups throughout Church history and many modern denominations have practiced foot washing as a [[Ordinance (Christian)|church ordinance]] including [[Adventists]], [[Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]], [[Free Will Baptists]], and [[Pentecostals]].<ref name=\"common\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word ''Maundy'' has at least two possibilities:\n# Through Middle English and Old French ''mand\u00e9'', from Latin ''mandatum''.\n# From the Latin ''mendicare'', Old French ''mendier'', and English ''maund'', which means \"to beg\" (verb) or a \"small basket\" (noun) held out by maunders (beggars) as they maunded (begged).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disciplingsmlc.wordpress.com/2012/03/12/notes-about-lent-and-holy-week/ |title=Notes about Lent and Holy Week |website=Discipling Ministry |location=Frazier Park, California |publisher=Shepherd of the Mountains Lutheran Church |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\nThe root of this practice appears to be found in the hospitality customs of ancient civilizations, especially where sandals were the chief footwear. A host would provide water for guests to wash their feet, provide a servant to wash the feet of the guests or even serve the guests by washing their feet. This is mentioned in several places in the [[Old Testament]] of the [[Bible]] (e.g. [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|18:4|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|19:2|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|24:32|KJV}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|43:24|KJV}}; [[I Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|25:41|KJV}}; et al.), as well as other religious and historical documents. A typical Eastern host might bow, greet, and kiss his guest, then offer water to allow the guest to wash his feet or have servants do it. Though the wearing of sandals might necessitate washing the feet, the water was also offered as a courtesy even when shoes were worn.\n\n[[I Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Samuel|25:41|KJV}} is the first biblical passage where an honored person offers to wash feet as a sign of humility. In John 12, [[Mary of Bethany]] anointed Jesus' feet presumably in gratitude for raising her brother [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, and in preparation for his death and burial. The Bible records washing of the saint's feet being practised by the [[primitive church]] in [[I Timothy]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Timothy|5:10|KJV}} perhaps in reference to piety, submission and/or humility. There are several names for this practice: ''maundy'', ''foot washing'', ''washing the saints' feet'', ''pedilavium'', and ''mandatum''.\n\nThe foot washing, described in the thirteenth chapter of the Gospel of John, is concerned with the Latin title of ''[[Servus servorum dei]]'' (\"Servant of the Servant of God\"), which was historically reserved to the Bishops and to the Pope, also called the [[Bishop of Rome]]. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, commissioned the Twelve to be Servant of the Servant of God, and this calling to the [[Imitation of Christ]] has been firstly extended to all the bishops of the Church as the direct [[Apostolic succession|successors of the Apostles]]. The Apostles received the Holy Spirit from Jesus in the gospel of John chapter 20.22 and in fullness upon the day of the [[Pentecost]] in chapter 2 of the Book of Acts, for the [[evangelization]] and salvation of all the human race. This belief is common to Catholics, to some denominations of the Western Christianity, and is consistent and in keeping with Eastern Christian beliefs. \n\nA main point of contention between Eastern Orthodox Christians and Western Christians is the ''[[Filioque]]'' doctrine, and the subsequent understanding concerning the progression and movement of the Holy Spirit. The Filioque doctrine is rejected by many Eastern Orthodox, whereas it is advanced by most Western Christians. Western Christians maintain that the Holy Spirit proceeds simultaneous from God the Father and God the Son, whereas many Eastern Christians maintain that God the Holy Spirit proceeds uniquely from [[God the Father]]: Eastern Christians subsequently believe that the Apostles received the Holy Spirit with his [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit|seven gifts]] from God the Father, and all the bishops onward, like their successors. However, this variance in belief does not impact the words of Christ and the command to his apostles to be the Servant of the Servant of God. \n\nIt is also recalled in the Latin [[Magnificat#Text|text of the ''Magnificat'']], for which God \"regarded the lowliness\" of His Most Blessed Virgin Mother and, by effect of that, \"magnified\" her (\"He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the humble and meek.\"). God also did the same to all the other creatures, both before and after the Incarnation, for: \n* Jesus Christ God: as affirmed in {{bibleref2|Philippians|2:8-11|NKJV}};\n* all the angels: the Satan's mighty pride to be like God made him the [[fallen angel]] before the starting of the creation, and also it was punished with the promised mission of a woman (Mary), a Servant of God, which would have bruise his head ({{bibleref2|Genesis|3:14-15|NKJV}}). On the opposite side, the lowliness of St Michael the Archangel made him the head of the [[Hierarchy of angels#Christianity|hierarchy of angels]]; \n* all the human creatures: according to the promise of Jesus in {{bibleref2|Luke|14,1.7-11|NKJV}}.\n\n== Biblical reference ==\n[[File:Washing of the Feet - Capella dei Scrovegni - Padua 2016.jpg|thumb|''Christ Reasoning with Peter'', by [[Giotto di Bondone]] (Cappella Scrovegni a Padova).]]\n\nChristian denominations that observe foot washing do so on the basis of the authoritative example and command of [[Jesus]] as found in {{bibleverse|John|13:1\u201315|NKJV}} ([[New King James Version|NKJV]]):\n\n{{quote|Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him; Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not all. For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are not all clean. So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.}} \n\nJesus demonstrates the custom of the time when he comments on the lack of hospitality in one [[Pharisees]] home by not providing water to wash his feet in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 7:44:\n\n{{quote|And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.}}\n\n== History ==\nThe rite of foot washing finds its roots in scripture. Even after the [[Deaths of the Twelve Apostles|death of the apostles]] or the end of the [[Apostolic Age]], the practice was continued.\n\nIt appears to have been practiced in the [[Early Christianity|early centuries of post-apostolic Christianity]], though the evidence is scant. For example, [[Tertullian]] (145\u2013220) mentions the practice in his ''De Corona'', but gives no details as to who practiced it or how it was practiced. It was practiced by the [[Early centers of Christianity#Milan|Church at Milan]] (c. 380), is mentioned by the ''[[Council of Elvira]]'' (300), and is even referenced by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] (c. 400).\n\nObservance of foot washing at the time of baptism was maintained in [[Africa]], [[Gaul]], [[Germany]], [[Milan]], northern [[Italy]], and [[Ireland]].\n\nAccording to the ''Mennonite Encyclopedia'' \"[[St. Benedict]]'s ''Rule'' (529) for the [[Benedictine Order]] prescribed hospitality feetwashing in addition to a communal feetwashing for humility\"; a statement confirmed by the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]].<ref name=\"Washing of Hands and Feet\">{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Washing of Feet and Hands}}</ref> It apparently was established in the [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Roman church]], though not in connection with baptism, by the 8th century.\n\nThe [[Albigenses]] observed footwashing in connection with communion, and the [[Waldensians|Waldenses]]' custom was to wash the feet of visiting ministers.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThere is some evidence that it was observed by the early [[Hussites]]; and the practice was a meaningful part of the 16th century [[radical reformation]]. Foot washing was often \"rediscovered\" or \"restored\" by Protestants in revivals of religion in which the participants tried to recreate the faith and practice of the [[apostolic era]] which they had abandoned or lost.\n\n== Catholic practice ==\nIn [[Catholic Church]], the ritual washing of feet is now associated with the [[Mass of the Lord's Supper]], which celebrates in a special way the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus, before which he washed the feet of his [[twelve apostles]].\n\nEvidence for the practice on this day goes back at least to the latter half of the 12th century, when \"the pope washed the feet of twelve [[sub-deacon]]s after his Mass and of thirteen poor men after his dinner.\"<ref name=\"Washing of Hands and Feet\" />  From 1570 to 1955, the [[Roman Missal]] printed, after the text of the [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], a rite of washing of feet unconnected with the Mass.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} For many years [[Pius IX]] performed the foot washing in the sala over the portico of [[Saint Peter's, Rome]].{{sfn|Tuker|Malleson|1897|p=251}}\n\n[[File:Court function at the Palace of Ribeira in 1748.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[John V of Portugal]] performs the Washing of the Feet rite in [[Ribeira Palace]], 1748.]]\nIn 1955 [[Pope Pius XII]] revised the ritual and inserted it into the Mass. Since then, the rite is celebrated after the [[homily]] that follows the reading of the [[gospel]] account of how [[Jesus]] washed the feet of his twelve apostles ({{bibleverse||John|13:1\u201315|KJV}}). Some persons who have been selected&nbsp;\u2013 usually twelve, but the Roman Missal does not specify the number&nbsp;\u2013 are led to chairs prepared in a suitable place. The [[priest]] goes to each and, with the help of the ministers, pours water over each one's feet and dries them.

Though history shows that foot washing has at times been practiced in connection with baptism, and at times as a separate occasion, by far its most common practice has been in connection with the [[The Lord's Supper|Lord's supper]] service. There has been some revival of the practice as other liturgical churches have also rediscovered the practice.\n\n== Eastern Christian practice ==\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]]).]]\n\n=== Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic ===\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] practice the ritual of the Washing of Feet on [[Holy and Great Thursday]] (Maundy Thursday) according to their ancient rites. The service may be performed either by a [[bishop]], washing the feet of twelve priests; or by an [[Hegumen]] (Abbot) washing the feet of twelve members of the brotherhood of his [[monastery]].  The ceremony takes place at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nAfter [[Holy Communion]], and before the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]], the brethren all go in [[procession]] to the place where the Washing of Feet is to take place (it may be in the center of the [[nave]], in the [[narthex]], or a location outside). After a psalm and some [[troparion|troparia]] (hymns) an [[ektenia]] (litany) is recited, and the bishop or abbot reads a prayer. Then the [[deacon]] reads the account in the Gospel of John, while the clergy perform the roles of Christ and his apostles as each action is chanted by the deacon. The deacon stops when the dialogue between Jesus and Peter begins. The senior-ranking clergyman among those whose feet are being washed speaks the words of Peter, and the bishop or abbot speaks the words of Jesus. Then the bishop or abbot himself concludes the reading of the Gospel, after which he says another prayer and sprinkles all of those present with the water that was used for the foot washing. The procession then returns to the church and the final dismissal is given as normal.\n\n=== Oriental Orthodox ===\n[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|[[Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] washing the feet of children.]]\nFoot washing rites are also observed in the [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches on Maundy Thursday.\n\nIn the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] the service is performed by the parish priest. He blesses the water for the foot washing with the cross, just as he would for blessing [[holy water]] and he washes the feet of the entire congregation.\n\nIn the Syrian Orthodox Church, this service is performed by a bishop or priest. There will be some 12 selected men, both priests and the lay people, and the bishop or priest will wash and kiss the feet of those 12 men. It is not merely a dramatization of the past event. Further it is a prayer where the whole congregation prays to wash and cleanse them of their sins.\n\n== Moravian practice ==\nThe [[Moravian Church]] has historically practiced footwashing (pedelavium).<ref name=\"Ritter1857\">{{cite book |last1=Ritter |first1=Abraham |title=History of the Moravian Church in Philadelphia: from its foundation in 1742 to the present time : comprising notices, defensive of its founder and patron, Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorff, together with an appendix |url=https://archive.org/details/historymoravian01rittgoog |date=1857 |publisher=Hayes & Zell |language=English}}</ref> This reflected the emphasis Moravians place on practicing customs of the [[early Church]], such as the [[Lovefeast]].<ref name=\"Hutton1909\">{{cite book |author1=Joseph Edmund Hutton |title=A History of the Moravian Church |date=1909 |publisher=RDMC Publishing |isbn=9780557008261 |language=English}}</ref> In 1818, the practice was abolished.<ref name=\"Jackson1889\">{{cite book |last1=Jackson |first1=Samuel Macauley |title=The Concise Dictionary of Religious Knowledge and Gazetteer |url=https://archive.org/details/concisedictiona00jackgoog |date=1889 |publisher=Christian literature Company |language=English}}</ref>\n\n== Anabaptist practice ==\nGroups descending from the 1708 [[Schwarzenau Brethren]], such as the [[Grace Brethren]], [[Church of the Brethren]], [[The Brethren Church|Brethren Church]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], and the [[Dunkard Brethren]] regularly practice foot washing (generally called \"feetwashing\"<ref name=\"cob-practices\">{{cite web|last1=Church of the Brethren|title=Brethren practices|url=http://www.brethren.org/about/practices.html|website=COB Website|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"for-all\">{{cite book|title=For All Who Minister: A Worship Manual for the Church of the Brethren|date=1993|publisher=Brethren Press|location=Elgin, IL|pages=183\u2013226}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Neglected Practice of Foot-washing|url=http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/footwashing|website=The Anabaptist Network|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=3 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414170035/http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/footwashing|archive-date=14 April 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"ramirez\">{{cite journal|last1=Ramirez|first1=Frank|title=Learning to wash feet is theme of Brethren Journal Association luncheon|journal=Church of the Brethren Newsline|date=4 July 2014|url=http://www.brethren.org/news/2014/learning-to-wash-feet.html|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.mountainviewcob.org/about_us|website=Mountain View Church of the Brethren|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Feetwashing in the Church of the Brethren|url=http://www.anabaptistnetwork.com/node/312|website=The Anabaptist Network|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=3 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=COB Youth Peace Travel Team 2012|title=Youth Peace Travel Team goes to National Young Adult Conference 2012!|url=http://blog.brethren.org/2012/youth-peace-travel-team-goes-to-national-young-adult-conference-2012/|website=Church of the Brethren Blog|accessdate=29 March 2016|date=28 June 2012}}</ref>) as one of three ordinances that compose their [[Lovefeast]], the others being the Eucharist and a fellowship meal.  Historically related groups such as the [[Amish]] and most [[Mennonite]]s also wash feet, tracing the practice to the 1632 [[Dordrecht Confession of Faith]].

The men and women participate in separate groups, men washing men's feet and women washing women's feet. Each member of the congregation takes a turn washing the feet of another member. Each foot is placed one at a time into the basin of water, is washed by cupping the hand and pouring water over the foot, and is dried with a long towel girded around the waist of the member performing the washing.

Like the other two sacraments, namely Baptism and the Lord's Supper, members of the church believe that footwashing imparts salvific grace to the recipient\u2014in this case, to have a part with Christ ({{bibleverse||John|13:8|KJV}}).\n\nMost [[Church of God (disambiguation)|Church of God]] denominations also include footwashing in their [[Passover]] ceremony as instructed by Jesus in John 13:1\u201311.\n\nMost [[Seventh-day Adventist]] congregations schedule an opportunity for foot washing preceding each quarterly (four times a year) Communion service. As with their \"open\" Communion, all believers in attendance, not just members or pastors, are invited to share in the washing of feet with another: men with men, women with women, and frequently, spouse with spouse. This service is alternatively called the Ordinance of Foot-Washing or the Ordinance of Humility. Its primary purpose is to renew the cleansing that only comes from Christ, but secondarily to seek and celebrate reconciliation with another member before Communion/the Lord's Supper.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = ''\"Ordinance of Foot-Washing\"'', Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual\n  | publisher = Secretariat, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists\n  | location = Hagerstown, MD\n  | edition = 17th\n  | year = 2005\n  | page = 82\n  | url = http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/CM/CM2005__D.pdf\n  | isbn = 0-8280-1947-9\n}}</ref>\n\n== Progressive Judaism ==\nA number of Jewish rabbis who disagree with the initiation custom of ''[[brit milah]]'', or circumcision of a male baby, instead have offered ''[[Brit shalom (naming ceremony)|brit shalom]]'', or a multi-part naming ceremony which eschews circumcision.

In 742, the Karluks were part of an alliance led by the [[Basmyl]] and [[Uyghurs]] that rebelled against the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=142}} In the realignment of power that followed, the Karluks were elevated from a tribe led by an ''el teber'' to one led by a ''[[yabghu]]'', which was one of the highest Turkic dignitaries and also implies membership in the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan in whom the \"heaven-mandated\" right to rule resided.  The Karluks and Uyghurs later allied themselves against the Basmyl, and within two years they toppled the Basmyl khagan. The Uyghur yabghu became khagan and the Karluk leader yabghu. This arrangement lasted less than a year.  Hostilities between the Uyghur and Karluk forced the Karluk to migrate westward into the western [[Turgesh]] lands.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=349}}\n\nBy 766 the Karluks had forced the submission of the Turgesh and they established their capital at [[Suyab]] on the [[Chu River]]. The Karluk confederation by now included the Chigil and Tukshi tribes who may have been T\u00fcrgesh tribes incorporated into the Karluk union. By the mid-9th century, the Karluk confederation had gained control of the sacred lands of the Western T\u00fcrks after the destruction of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] by the [[Old Kirghiz]] Control of sacred lands, together with their affiliation with the Ashina clan, allowed the Khaganate to be passed on to the Karluks along with domination of the steppes after the previous Khagan was killed in a revolt.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=350-351}}\n\nDuring the 9th century southern Central Asia was under the rule of the [[Samanids]], while the Central Asian steppe was dominated by Turkic nomads such as the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Oghuz Turks]], and the Karluks. The domain of the Karluks reached as far north as the Irtysh and the [[Kimek tribe|Kimek]] confederation, with encampments extending to the Chi and Ili rivers, where the Chigil and Tukshi tribes lived, and east to the Ferghana valley and beyond. The area to the south and east of the Karluks was inhabited by the Yagma.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=348}} The Karluk center in the 9th and 10th centuries appears to have been at [[Balasagun]] on the Chu River. In the late 9th century the Samanids marched into the steppes and captured [[Taraz]], one of the headquarters of the Karluk khagan, and a large church was transformed into a mosque.\n\n====Formation of the Kara-Khanid Khanate====\n[[File:Sutuq Bughraxan Qebrisi.JPG|thumb|left|Tomb of Sultan Satuk Bughra Khan, the first Muslim khan, in [[Artush]], [[Xinjiang]]]]\n\nDuring the 9th century, the Karluk confederation (including the T\u00fcrgesh descended Chigil and Tukshi tribes) and the Yaghma, possible descendants of the [[Toquz Oghuz]], joined force and formed the first Karluk-Karakhanid khaganate. The Chigils appear to have formed the nucleus of the Karakhanid army. The date of its foundation and the name of its first khan is uncertain, but according to one reconstruction, the first Karakhanid ruler was [[Bilge Kul Qadir Khan]].{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The rulers of the Karakhanids were likely to be from the Chigil and Yaghma tribes \u2013 the Eastern Khagan bore the title ''Arslan Qara Khaqan'' (Arslan \"lion\" was the totem of the Chigil) and the Western Khagan the title ''Bughra Qara Khaqan'' (Bughra \"male camel\" was the totem of the Yaghma). The names of animals were a regular element in the Turkish titles of the Karakhanids: thus Aslan (lion), Bughra (camel), Toghan (falcon), B\u00f6ri (wolf), and Toghrul or Toghr\u00efl (a bird of prey).{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}  Under the Khagans were four rulers with the titles Arslan Ilig, Bughra Ilig, Arslan Tegin and Bughra Tegin.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The titles of the members of the\ndynasty changed with their changing position, normally upwards, in the dynastic hierarchy.\n\nIn the mid-10th century the Kara-Khanids converted to Islam and adopted Muslim names and honorifics, but retained Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, [[Khagan]], Ilek (Ilig) and [[Tegin]].{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |title=Asia Research Institute Working Paper Series No.44 A History of Uighur Religious Conversions (5th-16th Centuries) by Li Tang |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080119170546/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |archive-date=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later they adopted Arab titles sultan and ''sult\u0101n al-sal\u0101t\u012bn'' (sultan of sultans). According to the Ottoman historian known as Munajjim-bashi, a Karakhanid prince named [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first of the khans to convert. After conversion, he obtained a [[fatwa]] which permitted him in effect to kill his presumably still pagan father, after which he conquered [[Kashgar]] (of the old [[Shule Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}} Later in 960, according to Muslim historians [[Ebn Meskavayh|Ibn Miskawaih]] and [[Ibn al-Athir]], there was a mass conversion of the Turks (reportedly \"200,000 tents of the Turks\"), circumstantial evidence suggests these were the Karakhanids.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}}\n\n===Conquest of Transoxiana===\n[[File:Kara-Khanid Khanate.png|thumb|350px|The map of Kara-Khanid Khanate as of 1006 AD when it reached its greatest extent]]\nThe grandson of Satuk Bughra Khan, Hasan (or Harun) b.

Musa (title: Kara Khan or Arslan Khan) resumed the campaign against the Samanids, and by 999 Ali's son Nasr had taken Chach, Samarkand, and Bukhara.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Samanid domains were divided between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana. The [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\nThe Karakhanid state was divided into [[appanage]]s, as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads. The Karakhanid appanages were associated with four principal urban centers, [[Balasagun]] (then the capital of the Karakhanid state) in Zhetysu, Kashgar in Xinjiang, [[Uzgen]] in [[Fergana]], and Samarkand in Transoxiana. The dynasty's original domains of Zhetysu and Kasgar and their khans retained an implicit seniority over those who ruled in Transoxiana and Fergana.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} The four sons of Ali (Ahmad, Nasr, Mansur, Muhammad) each held their own independent appanage within the Karakhanid state.  Nasr, the conqueror of Transoxiana, held the large central area of Transoxiana (Samarkand and Bukhara), Fergana (Uzgen) and other areas, although after his death his appanage was further divided.  Ahmad held [[Zhetysu]] and [[Tashkent|Chach]] and became the head of the dynasty after the death of Ali. The brothers Ahmad and Nasr conducted different policies towards the Ghaznavids in the south \u2013 while Ahmad tried to form alliance with [[Mahmud of Ghazna]], Nasr attempted to expand unsuccessfully into the territory of the Ghaznavids.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nAhmad was succeeded by Mansur, and after the death of Mansur, the Hasan Bughra Khan branch of the Karakhanids became dominant.  Hasan's sons Muhammad Toghan Khan II, and Yusuf Kadir Khan who held [[Kashgar]], became in turn the head of the Karakhanid dynasty. The two families, i.e. the descendants of Ali Arslan Khan and Hasan Bughra Khan, would eventually split the Karakhanid Khanate in two.\n\nIn 1017\u20131018, the Karakhanids repelled an attack by a large mass of nomadic Turkish tribes in what was described in Muslim sources as a great victory.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=363}}\n\n===Conquest of western Tarim Basin===\n\nThe Islamic conquest of the Buddhist cities east of Kashgar began when the Turkic Karakhanid Satuq Bughra Khan converted to Islam  in 934 and then captured Kashgar. Satuq Bughra Khan and his son directed endeavors to proselytize Islam among the Turks and engage in military conquests.{{sfn|Hansen|2012|p=226}} In the mid-10th century, Satuq's son Musa began to put pressure on Khotan, and a long period of war between Kashgar and [[Kingdom of Khotan|Khotan]] ensued.{{sfn|Millward|2009|p=55-56}} Satok Bughra Khan's nephew or grandson Ali Arslan was said to have been killed by Buddhists during the war;<ref name=\"RingSalkin1994\">{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring|author2=Robert M.

The \"infidels\" were said to have been driven towards Khotan, however the four Imams were killed.{{sfn|Thum|2012|p=633}} In 1006, Yusuf Kadr Khan of Kashgar conquered the [[Kingdom of Khotan]], ending Khotan's existence as an independent state.<ref>Aurel Stein, [http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-7/V-1/page/0231.html.en Ancient Khotan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912230458/http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/toyobunko/VIII-5-B2-7/V-1/page/0231.html.en |date=2011-09-12 }}, Clarendon Press, pg 181.</ref> The conquest of western Tarim Basin which includes Khotan and Kashgar is significant in the eventual [[Islamicisation of Xinjiang|Turkification and Islamification of the entire Tarim Basin]], and modern [[Uyghurs]] identify with the Karakhanids even though the name \"Uyghur\" was taken from the [[Manichaean]] [[Uyghur Empire]] and the Buddhist Qocho state (Uyghuristan).{{sfn|Millward|2009|p=52-56}}{{sfn|Starr|2015|p=42}}\n\n===Division of the Kara-Khanid Khanate===\nEarly in the 11th century the unity of the Karakhanid dynasty was fractured by frequent internal warfare that eventually resulted in the formation of two independent Karakhanid states. A son of Hasan Bughra Khan, Ali Tegin, seized control of Bukhara and other towns. He expanded his territory further after the death of Mansur. The son of Nasr, [[B\u00f6ritigin]], later waged war against the sons of Ali Tegin, and won control of large part of Transoxania, and made Samarkand the capital. In 1041, another son of Nasr b. Ali, Muhammad 'Ayn ad-Dawlah (reigned 1041\u201352) took over the administration of the western branch of the family that eventually led to a formal separation of the Khara-Khanid Khanate. Ibrahim Tamghach Khan was considered by Muslim historians as a great ruler, and he brought some stability to Western Karakhanids by limiting the appanage system that caused much of the internal strife in the Kara-Khanid Khanate.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Hasan family remained in control of the Eastern Khanate. The Eastern Khanate had its capital at Balasaghun and later Kashgar. The Fergana-Zhetysu areas became the border between the two states and were frequently contested. When the two states were formed, Fergana fell into realm of the Eastern Khanate, but was later captured by Ibrahim and became part of Western Khanate.\n\n===Seljuk suzerainty===\nIn 1040, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Ghaznavids at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and entered Iran. Conflict with the Karakhanids broke out, but the Karakhanids were able to withstand attacks by the Seljuks initially, even briefly taking control of Seljuk towns in [[Greater Khorasan]]. The Karakhanids, however, developed serious conflicts with the religious classes (the ''[[ulama]]''), and the ''ulama'' of Transoxiana then requested the intervention of the Seljuks. In 1089, during the reign of Ibrahim's grandson Ahmad b. Khidr, the Seljuks entered and took control of Samarkand, together with the domains belonging to the Western Khanate. The Western Karakhanids Khanate became a [[vassal]] of the Seljuks for half a century, and the rulers of the Western Khanate were largely whomever the Seljuks chose to place on the throne. Ahmad b. Khidr was returned to power by the Seljuks, but in 1095, the ''ulama'' accused Ahmad of heresy and managed to secure his execution.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Karakhanids of Kashgar also declared their submission following a Seljuk campaign into Talas and Zhetysu, but the Eastern Khanate was a Seljuk vassal for only a short time. At the beginning of the 12th century they invaded Transoxiana and briefly occupied the Seljuk town of Termez.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n=== Qara Khitai Invasion ===\n[[File:Aisha Bibi2.jpg|thumb|upright|The restored mausoleum of [[Ayshah bibi]] near [[Taraz]].]]\n\nThe [[Qara Khitai]] host which invaded Central Asia was composed of remnants from the defunct [[Liao dynasty]] which was annihilated by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] in 1125. The Khitan noble [[Yelu Dashi]] recruited warriors from various tribes and formed a horde that moved westward to rebuild the Khitan nation. Yelu occupied Balasagun on the Chu River, then defeated the Western Karakhanids in [[Khujand]] in 1137.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} In 1141 [[Qara Khitai]] became the dominant force in the region after they dealt a devastating blow to the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] near [[Samarkand]].{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Several military commanders of Karakhanid lineages such as the father of Osman of [[Khwarezm]] fled from Karakhanid lands in the wake of the Qara Khitai invasion.\n\nDespite losing to the [[Qara Khitai]], the Karakhanid dynasty remained in power as their vassals. The Qara Khitai themselves stayed at [[Zhetysu]] near Balasagun, and allowed some of the Karakhanids to continue to rule as their tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar. Under the Qara Khitai the Karakhanids functioned as administrators for sedentary Muslim populations. While the Qara Khitai were Buddhists ruling over a largely Muslim population, they were considered fair-minded rulers whose reign was marked by religious tolerance.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Islamic religious life continued uninterrupted and Islamic authority persevered under the Qara Khitai. Kashgar became a [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] [[metropolitan see]] and Christian gravestones in the [[Chu River|Chu valley]] appeared beginning in this period.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} However, [[Kuchlug]], a [[Naimans|Naiman]] who usurped the throne of the Qara Khitai Dynasty, instituted anti-Islamic policies on the local populations under his rule.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=194-196}}\n\n=== Downfall ===\nThe decline of the Seljuks following their defeat by the Qara Khitans allowed the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], then a vassal of the Qara Khitai, to expand into former Seljuk territory. In 1207, the citizens of Bukhara revolted against the ''sadrs'' (leaders of the religious classes), which the Khwarezm-Shah [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm|'Ala' ad-Din Muhammad]] used as a pretext to conquer Bukhara. Muhammad then formed an alliance with the Western Karakhanid ruler Uthman (who later married Muhammad's daughter) against the Qara Khitai. In 1210, the [[Khwarezm-Shah]] took Samarkand after the Qara Khitai retreated to deal with the rebellion from the Naiman Kuchlug, who had seized the Qara Khitans' treasury at Uzgen.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Khwarezm-Shah then defeated the Qara Khitai near Talas. Muhammad and Kuchlug had, apparently, agreed to divide up the Qara Khitan's empire.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=370}} In 1212, the population of Samarkand staged a revolt against the Khwarezmians, a revolt which Uthman supported, and massacred them. The Khwarezm-Shah returned, recaptured Samarkand and executed Uthman. He demanded the submission of all leading Karakhanids, and finally extinguished the Western Karakhanid state.\n\nIn 1204, a rebellion of the Eastern Kara-Khanid in Kashgar was suppressed by the Kara-Khitai who took the prince Yusuf hostage to Balasagun.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}   The prince was later released but he was killed in Kashgar by rebels in 1211, effectively ending the Eastern Kara-Khanid.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1214, the rebels in Kashgar surrendered to [[Kuchlug]], who had usruped the Kara-Khitai throne.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1218, Kuchlug was killed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol army]].  Some of the Kara-Khitai's eastern vassels including Eastern Kara-Khanids then joined the Mongol forces that conquered the Khwarezmian Empire.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=87}} \n<!--- ==Communication with Song China==\n:''This section require some translation''\n1009, \u9ed1\u6c57\u738b Karakhanid ruler send envoys to [[Song Dynasty|Song]] China.<br>\n1063, Karakhanid ask Song emperor to grant title of \"\u5f52\u5fe0\u4fdd\u987a[\u77f3\u540e]\u9cde\u9ed1\u97e9\u738b\".<br>\n1081, Kara-Khanid ruler sent envoy with letter said, \u201c\u4e8e\u9617\u56fd\u507b\u5138\u6709\u798f\u529b\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u6cd5\u9ed1\u6c57\u738b\uff0c\u4e66\u4e0e\u4e1c\u65b9\u65e5\u51fa\u5904\u5927\u4e16\u754c\u7530\u5730\u4e3b\u6c49\u5bb6\u963f\u8205\u5927\u5b98\u5bb6\u201d, he mentioned marriage relationship with Song emperor.<br>\nAlthough Karakhanid is the first Islamic kingdom established in this area, it still refer it as an oriental culture.<br>\nIn Kara-Khanid coin, it always showed \u201c\u6843\u82b1\u77f3\u00b7\u535c\u683c\u62c9\u6c57\u201d\u3001\u201c\u79e6\u4e4b\u738b\u201d\u3001\u201c\u79e6\u4e0e\u4e1c\u65b9\u4e4b\u738b\u201d.\u3002\u6843\u82b1\u77f3 and \u79e6 always refer to China.<br>\nIn \"D\u012bw\u0101n lugh\u0101t al-Turk\" (\u300a\u7a81\u53a5\u8bed\u8f9e\u5178\u300b) written by Mahm\u016bd al-Kashghar\u012b, refer  Karakhanid, Song, Khitan as China. --->\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Burana 01.jpg|thumb|right|Burana tower, [[Balasagun]], today [[Kyrgyzstan]].]]\n\nThe takeover by the Karakhanids did not change the essentially Iranian character of Central Asia, though it set into motion a demographic and ethnolinguistic shift. During the Karakhanid era, the local population began using Turkic in speech \u2013 initially the shift was linguistic with the local people adopting the Turkic language.{{sfn|Golden|2011}} While Central Asia became Turkicized over the centuries, culturally the Turks came close to being Persianized or, in certain respects, Arabicized.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Nevertheless, the official or court language used in Kashgar and other Karakhanid centers, referred to as \"Khaqani\" (royal), remained Turkic.  The language was partly based on dialects spoken by the Turkic tribes that made up the Karakhanids and possessed qualities of linear descent from [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks|K\u00f6k]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] Turkic.

He wrote this first comprehensive dictionary of Turkic languages in Arabic for the Caliphs of Baghdad in 1072\u201376.

The earliest example of ''[[madrasas]]'' in Central Asia was founded in Samarkand by Ibrahim Tamghach Khan. Ibrahim also founded a hospital to care for the sick as well as providing shelter for the poor.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} His son Nasr Shams al-Mulk built [[ribat]]s for the [[caravanserais]] on the route between Bukhara and Samarkand, as well as a palace near Bukhara. Some of the buildings constructed by the Karakhanids still survive today, including the [[Kalyan minaret]] built by Mohammad Aslan Khan beside the main mosque in Bukhara, and three mausolea in Uzgend. The early Karakhanid rulers, as nomads, lived not in the city but in an army encampment outside the capital, and while by the time of Ibrahim the Karakhanids still maintained a nomadic tradition, their extensive religious and civil constructions showed that they had assimilated the culture and traditions of the settled population of Transoxiana.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nKara-Khanid is arguably the most enduring cultural heritage among coexisting cultures in Central Asia from the 9th to the 13th centuries. The Karluk-Uyghur dialect spoken by the nomadic tribes and turkified sedentary populations under Kara-Khanid rule formed two major branches of the Turkic language family, the [[Chagatai language|Chagatay]] and the [[Kypchak]]. The Kara-Khanid cultural model that combined nomadic Turkic culture with Islamic, sedentary institutions spread east into former [[Gaochang|Kara-Khoja]] and [[Tangut people|Tangut]] territories and west and south into the subcontinent, Khorasan (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Northern Iran), [[Golden Horde]] territories ([[Tataristan]]), and [[Turkey]].

In 742, the Karluks were part of an alliance led by the [[Basmyl]] and [[Uyghurs]] that rebelled against the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s.{{sfn|Beckwith|2009|p=142}} In the realignment of power that followed, the Karluks were elevated from a tribe led by an ''el teber'' to one led by a ''[[yabghu]]'', which was one of the highest Turkic dignitaries and also implies membership in the [[Ashina tribe|Ashina]] clan in whom the \"heaven-mandated\" right to rule resided.  The Karluks and Uyghurs later allied themselves against the Basmyl, and within two years they toppled the Basmyl khagan. The Uyghur yabghu became khagan and the Karluk leader yabghu. This arrangement lasted less than a year.  Hostilities between the Uyghur and Karluk forced the Karluk to migrate westward into the western [[Turgesh]] lands.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=349}}\n\nBy 766 the Karluks had forced the submission of the Turgesh and they established their capital at [[Suyab]] on the [[Chu River]]. The Karluk confederation by now included the Chigil and Tukshi tribes who may have been T\u00fcrgesh tribes incorporated into the Karluk union. By the mid-9th century, the Karluk confederation had gained control of the sacred lands of the Western T\u00fcrks after the destruction of the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] by the [[Old Kirghiz]] Control of sacred lands, together with their affiliation with the Ashina clan, allowed the Khaganate to be passed on to the Karluks along with domination of the steppes after the previous Khagan was killed in a revolt.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=350-351}}\n\nDuring the 9th century southern Central Asia was under the rule of the [[Samanids]], while the Central Asian steppe was dominated by Turkic nomads such as the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Oghuz Turks]], and the Karluks. The domain of the Karluks reached as far north as the Irtysh and the [[Kimek tribe|Kimek]] confederation, with encampments extending to the Chi and Ili rivers, where the Chigil and Tukshi tribes lived, and east to the Ferghana valley and beyond. The area to the south and east of the Karluks was inhabited by the Yagma.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=348}} The Karluk center in the 9th and 10th centuries appears to have been at [[Balasagun]] on the Chu River. In the late 9th century the Samanids marched into the steppes and captured [[Taraz]], one of the headquarters of the Karluk khagan, and a large church was transformed into a mosque.\n\n====Formation of the Kara-Khanid Khanate====\n[[File:Sutuq Bughraxan Qebrisi.JPG|thumb|left|Tomb of Sultan Satuk Bughra Khan, the first Muslim khan, in [[Artush]], [[Xinjiang]]]]\n\nDuring the 9th century, the Karluk confederation (including the T\u00fcrgesh descended Chigil and Tukshi tribes) and the Yaghma, possible descendants of the [[Toquz Oghuz]], joined force and formed the first Karluk-Karakhanid khaganate. The Chigils appear to have formed the nucleus of the Karakhanid army. The date of its foundation and the name of its first khan is uncertain, but according to one reconstruction, the first Karakhanid ruler was [[Bilge Kul Qadir Khan]].{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The rulers of the Karakhanids were likely to be from the Chigil and Yaghma tribes \u2013 the Eastern Khagan bore the title ''Arslan Qara Khaqan'' (Arslan \"lion\" was the totem of the Chigil) and the Western Khagan the title ''Bughra Qara Khaqan'' (Bughra \"male camel\" was the totem of the Yaghma). The names of animals were a regular element in the Turkish titles of the Karakhanids: thus Aslan (lion), Bughra (camel), Toghan (falcon), B\u00f6ri (wolf), and Toghrul or Toghr\u00efl (a bird of prey).{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}  Under the Khagans were four rulers with the titles Arslan Ilig, Bughra Ilig, Arslan Tegin and Bughra Tegin.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=355-356}} The titles of the members of the\ndynasty changed with their changing position, normally upwards, in the dynastic hierarchy.\n\nIn the mid-10th century the Kara-Khanids converted to Islam and adopted Muslim names and honorifics, but retained Turkic regnal titles such as Khan, [[Khagan]], Ilek (Ilig) and [[Tegin]].{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |title=Asia Research Institute Working Paper Series No.44 A History of Uighur Religious Conversions (5th-16th Centuries) by Li Tang |access-date=2008-01-19 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080119170546/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/showfile.asp?pubid=518&type=2 |archive-date=2008-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Later they adopted Arab titles sultan and ''sult\u0101n al-sal\u0101t\u012bn'' (sultan of sultans). According to the Ottoman historian known as Munajjim-bashi, a Karakhanid prince named [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first of the khans to convert. After conversion, he obtained a [[fatwa]] which permitted him in effect to kill his presumably still pagan father, after which he conquered [[Kashgar]] (of the old [[Shule Kingdom]]).{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}} Later in 960, according to Muslim historians [[Ebn Meskavayh|Ibn Miskawaih]] and [[Ibn al-Athir]], there was a mass conversion of the Turks (reportedly \"200,000 tents of the Turks\"), circumstantial evidence suggests these were the Karakhanids.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=357}}\n\n===Conquest of Transoxiana===\n[[File:Kara-Khanid Khanate.png|thumb|350px|The map of Kara-Khanid Khanate as of 1006 AD when it reached its greatest extent]]\nThe grandson of Satuk Bughra Khan, Hasan (or Harun) b.

Musa (title: Kara Khan or Arslan Khan) resumed the campaign against the Samanids, and by 999 Ali's son Nasr had taken Chach, Samarkand, and Bukhara.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Samanid domains were divided between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana. The [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\nThe Karakhanid state was divided into [[appanage]]s, as was common of Turkic and Mongol nomads. The Karakhanid appanages were associated with four principal urban centers, [[Balasagun]] (then the capital of the Karakhanid state) in Zhetysu, Kashgar in Xinjiang, [[Uzgen]] in [[Fergana]], and Samarkand in Transoxiana. The dynasty's original domains of Zhetysu and Kasgar and their khans retained an implicit seniority over those who ruled in Transoxiana and Fergana.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} The four sons of Ali (Ahmad, Nasr, Mansur, Muhammad) each held their own independent appanage within the Karakhanid state.  Nasr, the conqueror of Transoxiana, held the large central area of Transoxiana (Samarkand and Bukhara), Fergana (Uzgen) and other areas, although after his death his appanage was further divided.  Ahmad held [[Zhetysu]] and [[Tashkent|Chach]] and became the head of the dynasty after the death of Ali. The brothers Ahmad and Nasr conducted different policies towards the Ghaznavids in the south \u2013 while Ahmad tried to form alliance with [[Mahmud of Ghazna]], Nasr attempted to expand unsuccessfully into the territory of the Ghaznavids.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nAhmad was succeeded by Mansur, and after the death of Mansur, the Hasan Bughra Khan branch of the Karakhanids became dominant.

A son of Hasan Bughra Khan, Ali Tegin, seized control of Bukhara and other towns. He expanded his territory further after the death of Mansur. The son of Nasr, [[B\u00f6ritigin]], later waged war against the sons of Ali Tegin, and won control of large part of Transoxania, and made Samarkand the capital. In 1041, another son of Nasr b. Ali, Muhammad 'Ayn ad-Dawlah (reigned 1041\u201352) took over the administration of the western branch of the family that eventually led to a formal separation of the Khara-Khanid Khanate. Ibrahim Tamghach Khan was considered by Muslim historians as a great ruler, and he brought some stability to Western Karakhanids by limiting the appanage system that caused much of the internal strife in the Kara-Khanid Khanate.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Hasan family remained in control of the Eastern Khanate. The Eastern Khanate had its capital at Balasaghun and later Kashgar. The Fergana-Zhetysu areas became the border between the two states and were frequently contested. When the two states were formed, Fergana fell into realm of the Eastern Khanate, but was later captured by Ibrahim and became part of Western Khanate.\n\n===Seljuk suzerainty===\nIn 1040, the [[Seljuk Turks]] defeated the Ghaznavids at the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]] and entered Iran. Conflict with the Karakhanids broke out, but the Karakhanids were able to withstand attacks by the Seljuks initially, even briefly taking control of Seljuk towns in [[Greater Khorasan]]. The Karakhanids, however, developed serious conflicts with the religious classes (the ''[[ulama]]''), and the ''ulama'' of Transoxiana then requested the intervention of the Seljuks. In 1089, during the reign of Ibrahim's grandson Ahmad b. Khidr, the Seljuks entered and took control of Samarkand, together with the domains belonging to the Western Khanate. The Western Karakhanids Khanate became a [[vassal]] of the Seljuks for half a century, and the rulers of the Western Khanate were largely whomever the Seljuks chose to place on the throne. Ahmad b. Khidr was returned to power by the Seljuks, but in 1095, the ''ulama'' accused Ahmad of heresy and managed to secure his execution.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\nThe Karakhanids of Kashgar also declared their submission following a Seljuk campaign into Talas and Zhetysu, but the Eastern Khanate was a Seljuk vassal for only a short time. At the beginning of the 12th century they invaded Transoxiana and briefly occupied the Seljuk town of Termez.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n=== Qara Khitai Invasion ===\n[[File:Aisha Bibi2.jpg|thumb|upright|The restored mausoleum of [[Ayshah bibi]] near [[Taraz]].]]\n\nThe [[Qara Khitai]] host which invaded Central Asia was composed of remnants from the defunct [[Liao dynasty]] which was annihilated by the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]] in 1125. The Khitan noble [[Yelu Dashi]] recruited warriors from various tribes and formed a horde that moved westward to rebuild the Khitan nation. Yelu occupied Balasagun on the Chu River, then defeated the Western Karakhanids in [[Khujand]] in 1137.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} In 1141 [[Qara Khitai]] became the dominant force in the region after they dealt a devastating blow to the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmad Sanjar]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] near [[Samarkand]].{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Several military commanders of Karakhanid lineages such as the father of Osman of [[Khwarezm]] fled from Karakhanid lands in the wake of the Qara Khitai invasion.\n\nDespite losing to the [[Qara Khitai]], the Karakhanid dynasty remained in power as their vassals. The Qara Khitai themselves stayed at [[Zhetysu]] near Balasagun, and allowed some of the Karakhanids to continue to rule as their tax collectors in Samarkand and Kashgar. Under the Qara Khitai the Karakhanids functioned as administrators for sedentary Muslim populations. While the Qara Khitai were Buddhists ruling over a largely Muslim population, they were considered fair-minded rulers whose reign was marked by religious tolerance.{{sfn|Soucek|2000}} Islamic religious life continued uninterrupted and Islamic authority persevered under the Qara Khitai. Kashgar became a [[Nestorian Christianity|Nestorian]] [[metropolitan see]] and Christian gravestones in the [[Chu River|Chu valley]] appeared beginning in this period.{{sfn|Asimov|1998}} However, [[Kuchlug]], a [[Naimans|Naiman]] who usurped the throne of the Qara Khitai Dynasty, instituted anti-Islamic policies on the local populations under his rule.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=194-196}}\n\n=== Downfall ===\nThe decline of the Seljuks following their defeat by the Qara Khitans allowed the [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], then a vassal of the Qara Khitai, to expand into former Seljuk territory. In 1207, the citizens of Bukhara revolted against the ''sadrs'' (leaders of the religious classes), which the Khwarezm-Shah [['Ala' ad-Din Muhammad]] used as a pretext to conquer Bukhara. Muhammad then formed an alliance with the Western Karakhanid ruler Uthman (who later married Muhammad's daughter) against the Qara Khitai. In 1210, the [[Khwarezm-Shah]] took Samarkand after the Qara Khitai retreated to deal with the rebellion from the Naiman Kuchlug, who had seized the Qara Khitans' treasury at Uzgen.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}} The Khwarezm-Shah then defeated the Qara Khitai near Talas. Muhammad and Kuchlug had, apparently, agreed to divide up the Qara Khitan's empire.{{sfn|Golden|1990|p=370}} In 1212, the population of Samarkand staged a revolt against the Khwarezmians, a revolt which Uthman supported, and massacred them. The Khwarezm-Shah returned, recaptured Samarkand and executed Uthman. He demanded the submission of all leading Karakhanids, and finally extinguished the Western Karakhanid state.\n\nIn 1204, a rebellion of the Eastern Kara-Khanid in Kashgar was suppressed by the Kara-Khitai who took the prince Yusuf hostage to Balasagun.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}   The prince was later released but he was killed in Kashgar by rebels in 1211, effectively ending the Eastern Kara-Khanid.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1214, the rebels in Kashgar surrendered to [[Kuchlug]], who had usruped the Kara-Khitai throne.{{sfn|Biran|2005|p=81}}  In 1218, Kuchlug was killed by the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol army]].

The early Karakhanid rulers, as nomads, lived not in the city but in an army encampment outside the capital, and while by the time of Ibrahim the Karakhanids still maintained a nomadic tradition, their extensive religious and civil constructions showed that they had assimilated the culture and traditions of the settled population of Transoxiana.{{sfn|Asimov|1998|p=119-144}}\n\n== Legacy ==\nKara-Khanid is arguably the most enduring cultural heritage among coexisting cultures in Central Asia from the 9th to the 13th centuries.
