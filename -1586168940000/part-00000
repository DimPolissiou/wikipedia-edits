These are called \"undefined\" entries. Undefined entries must begin with a letter later in the alphabet.\n\nThe 25 subsequent turns proceed consecutively through the letters of the alphabet, one letter per turn. In a turn, each player writes one entry that begins with the turn's specified letter. If one or more undefined entries are available that begin with the letter, a player must choose and write an undefined entry before any new entries can be created under that letter.

Some games permit other players to post comments or expansions of earlier entries. The optional \"Rule of X\" treats X (or any other appropriate letter) as a wild card; entries for the X turn may begin with any letter. \"Telephone pad\" is a shorter variant with 8 turns (corresponding to the letters on a telephone keypad) instead of 26 turns (one per letter of the alphabet).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080617213627/http://www.20by20room.com/2003/11/lexicon_an_rpg.html Lexicon: An RPG] &mdash; the original idea for Lexicon.\n* [http://www.twistedconfessions.com/confessional/index.php?n=Lexicon.HomePage Lexicon Rules] &mdash; A collection and clarification of the original rules, combined with a compilation of almost every variant.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061020091532/http://www.gamegrene.com/wiki/Lexicon_games An (old) list of Lexicon games]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/harriganlexicon/ The New Metamorphoses: A Lexicon]\n\n[[Category:Collaborative fiction]]\n[[Category:Indie role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Universal role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2003]]\n\n\n{{rpg-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{Notability|Products|date=October 2011}}\n{{primary sources|date=October 2011}}\n{{no footnotes|date=October 2011}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox RPG\n|title=Lexicon\n|italic title = no\n|image=\n|caption=\n|designer=Neel Krishnaswami\n|publisher=\n|date=2003\n|genre=\n|system=Custom\n|footnotes=\n}}\n'''Lexicon''' is a [[computer-assisted role-playing game]] invented by [[Neel Krishnaswami]] and popularised by the [[indie role-playing game]] community.

{"title_page": "Fast Fourier transform", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=March 2019}}\n{{Short description|O(N logN) divide and conquer algorithm to calculate the discrete Fourier transforms}}\n[[File:DIT-FFT-butterfly.png|thumb|An example FFT algorithm structure, using a decomposition into half-size FFTs]]\n[[File:FFT of Cosine Summation Function.svg|thumb|A discrete Fourier analysis of a sum of cosine waves at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50&nbsp;Hz]]\n\nA '''fast Fourier transform''' ('''FFT''') is an [[algorithm]] that computes the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IDFT). [[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[Matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(N \\log N)</math>, where <math>N</math> is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]].\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|applications]] in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\",<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] magazine ''Computing in Science & Engineering''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(N \\log N)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when ''N'' is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi k n/N} \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,N-1, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i 2\\pi/N}</math> is a [[Primitive root of unity|primitive]] {{mvar|N}}th root of 1.\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]]<math>(N \\log N)</math> operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N'' \u2212 1) complex additions, of which <math>O(N)</math> operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> to <math>O(N \\log N)</math> remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal fast Fourier transform}}\n\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. [[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''N''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''N'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N'' \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal fast Fourier transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs.<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/> Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]]/[[discrete sine transform|sine transform(s)]] ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing work by [[Shmuel Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only <math>4N - 2\\log_2^2(N) - 2\\log_2(N) - 4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N = 2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2(N) - 6N + 8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N'' \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N'' \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''{{nnbsp}}log(''N''){{nnbsp}}log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n} = \\left(n_1, \\ldots, n_d\\right)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j - 1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = \\left(n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d\\right)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      & \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n  ={} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\right)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1\\right)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, [[additive synthesis]] and [[pitch correction]] software.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Richard James |title=The History of Music Production |date=2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199357178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain.

The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n; Approximate FFTs: For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies. Multipole based approaches can compute approximate quantities with factor of runtime increase.<ref name=\"Dutt_Rokhlin_1993\"/>\n; [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Group FFTs]]: The FFT may also be explained and interpreted using [[Group representation|group representation theory]] that allows for further generalization. A function on any compact group, including non cyclic, has an expansion in terms of a basis of irreducible matrix elements. It remains active area of research to find efficient algorithm for performing this change of basis. Applications including efficient [[spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic]] expansion, analyzing certain [[Markov process]]es, robotics etc.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2004\"/>\n; [[Quantum Fourier transform|Quantum FFTs]]: Shor's fast algorithm for [[integer factorization]] on a quantum computer has a subroutine to compute DFT of a binary vector. This is implemented as sequence of 1- or 2-bit quantum gates now known as quantum FFT, which is effectively the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT realized as a particular factorization of the Fourier matrix.

[[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[Matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(N \\log N)</math>, where <math>N</math> is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]].\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|applications]] in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\",<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] magazine ''Computing in Science & Engineering''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(N \\log N)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when ''N'' is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi k n/N} \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,N-1, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i 2\\pi/N}</math> is a [[Primitive root of unity|primitive]] {{mvar|N}}th root of 1.\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]]<math>(N \\log N)</math> operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N'' \u2212 1) complex additions, of which <math>O(N)</math> operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> to <math>O(N \\log N)</math> remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal fast Fourier transform}}\n\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. [[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''N''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''N'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N'' \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal fast Fourier transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs.<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/> Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]]/[[discrete sine transform|sine transform(s)]] ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing work by [[Shmuel Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only <math>4N - 2\\log_2^2(N) - 2\\log_2(N) - 4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N = 2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2(N) - 6N + 8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N'' \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N'' \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''{{nnbsp}}log(''N''){{nnbsp}}log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n} = \\left(n_1, \\ldots, n_d\\right)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j - 1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = \\left(n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d\\right)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      & \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n  ={} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\right)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1\\right)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, [[additive synthesis]] and [[pitch correction]] software.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Richard James |title=The History of Music Production |date=2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199357178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of the FFT include:<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/><ref name=\"Chu_George_1999\"/>\n* Fast large-integer and polynomial multiplication\n* Efficient matrix-vector multiplication for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz]], [[Circulant matrix|circulant]] and other structured matrices\n* Filtering algorithms (see [[Overlap-add method|overlap-add]] and [[Overlap-save method|overlap-save]] methods)\n* Fast algorithms for [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]] or [[discrete sine transform|sine transforms]] (e.g. [[Discrete cosine transform|fast DCT]] used for [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]]/[[MP3]] encoding and decoding)\n* Fast [[Chebyshev approximation]]\n* Solving [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]]s\n* Computation of [[Mass spectrometry|isotopic distributions]].<ref name=\"Fernandez-de-Cossio_2012\"/>\n\n==Research areas==\n; Big FFTs: With the explosion of big data in fields such as astronomy, the need for 512k FFTs has arisen for certain interferometry calculations. The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n; Approximate FFTs: For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies. Multipole based approaches can compute approximate quantities with factor of runtime increase.<ref name=\"Dutt_Rokhlin_1993\"/>\n; [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Group FFTs]]: The FFT may also be explained and interpreted using [[Group representation|group representation theory]] that allows for further generalization. A function on any compact group, including non cyclic, has an expansion in terms of a basis of irreducible matrix elements. It remains active area of research to find efficient algorithm for performing this change of basis. Applications including efficient [[spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic]] expansion, analyzing certain [[Markov process]]es, robotics etc.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2004\"/>\n; [[Quantum Fourier transform|Quantum FFTs]]: Shor's fast algorithm for [[integer factorization]] on a quantum computer has a subroutine to compute DFT of a binary vector. This is implemented as sequence of 1- or 2-bit quantum gates now known as quantum FFT, which is effectively the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT realized as a particular factorization of the Fourier matrix. Extension to these ideas is currently being explored.\n\n==Language reference==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Command/Method\n!Pre-requisites\n|-\n|[[R (programming

The account reads: \"And on Friday the 17th instant, about three in the afternoon, the king died, the day he always fasted in memory of our blessed Saviour's passion, the day he ever desired to die on, and the ninth hour, according to the Jewish account, when our Saviour was crucified.\" As 17 September 1701 [[New Style]] falls on a Saturday and the author insists that James died on Friday, \"the day he ever desired to die on\", an inevitable conclusion is that the author miscalculated the date, which later made it to various reference works.

He was the last [[Roman Catholic]] monarch of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]; his reign is now remembered primarily for struggles over religious tolerance. However, it also involved the principles of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and [[divine right of kings]], and his deposition ended a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quinn|first1=Stephen|title=The Glorious Revolution|url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-glorious-revolution-of-1688/|website=Economic History Association EH.net|accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nJames inherited the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland from his elder brother [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] with widespread support in all three countries, largely based on the principle of divine right or birth.<ref>Harris, 6\u20137</ref> Tolerance for his personal Catholicism did not apply to it in general and when the [[English Parliament|English]] and [[Scottish Parliament]]s refused to pass his measures, James attempted to impose them by decree; it was a political principle, rather than a religious one, that ultimately led to his removal.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Harris|editor-first1=Tim|editor-last2=Taylor|editor-first2=Stephen|title=The Final Crisis of the Stuart Monarchy|date=2015|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=1783270446|pages=144\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis; the first on 10 June was the birth of James's son and heir [[James Francis Edward]], threatening to create a Roman Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her Protestant husband [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. The second was the prosecution of the [[Seven Bishops]] for [[seditious libel]]; this was viewed as an assault on the [[Church of England]] and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England. Anti-Catholic riots in England and Scotland now made it seem only his removal as monarch could prevent a civil war.<ref>Harris, 264\u2013268</ref>\n\nLeading members of the English political class [[Invitation to William|invited William of Orange]] to assume the English throne; after he landed in [[Brixham]] on 5 November 1688, James's army deserted, and he went into exile in France on 23 December. In February 1689, a special [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] held that the king had \"vacated\" the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs, establishing the principle that [[sovereignty]] derived from Parliament, not birth. James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms, but despite a simultaneous [[Jacobite rising of 1689|rising in Scotland]], in April a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] followed that of England by finding that James had \"forfeited\" the throne and offered it to William and Mary. After his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in July 1690, James returned to France, where he spent the rest of his life in exile at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]], protected by [[Louis XIV]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Charles I and James II.png|thumb|James with his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by [[Sir Peter Lely]], 1647]]\n\nJames, the second surviving son of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], was born at [[St James's Palace]] in London on 14 October 1633.<ref>Miller, 1</ref> Later that same year, he was baptised by [[William Laud]], the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=callow31>Callow, 31</ref> He was educated by private tutors, along with his older brother, the future [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and the two sons of the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George]] and Francis Villiers.<ref>Callow, 34</ref> At the age of three, James was appointed [[Lord High Admiral of England|Lord High Admiral]]; the position was initially honorary, but would become a substantive office after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], when James was an adult.<ref>Miller, 10; Callow, 101</ref>\n\nHe was designated [[Duke of York]] at birth,<ref name=\"weir\"/> invested with the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1642,<ref>Callow, 36</ref> and formally created Duke of York in January 1644.<ref name=callow31/><ref name=\"weir\"/>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe King's disputes with the [[English Parliament]] grew into the [[English Civil War]].

Although he was proclaimed King in [[Jersey]], Charles was unable to secure the [[The Crown|crown of England]] and consequently fled to France and exile.<ref name=royle517/>\n\n===Exile in France===\n[[File:Henri-turenne 2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Turenne, James's commander in France]]\n\nLike his brother, James sought refuge in France, serving in the French army under [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]] against the [[Fronde]], and later against their Spanish allies.<ref name=miller16>Miller, 16\u201317</ref> In the French army James had his first true experience of battle where, according to one observer, he \"ventures himself and chargeth gallantly where anything is to be done\".<ref name=miller16/> Turenne's favour led to James being given command of a captured Irish regiment in December 1652, and being appointed Lieutenant-General in 1654.<ref name=compeerage3/>\n\nIn the meantime, Charles was attempting to reclaim his throne, but France, although hosting the exiles, had allied itself with [[Oliver Cromwell]]. In 1656, Charles turned instead to Spain \u2013 an enemy of France \u2013 for support, and an alliance was made. In consequence, James was expelled from France and forced to leave Turenne's army.<ref>Miller, 19\u201320</ref> James quarrelled with his brother over the diplomatic choice of Spain over France. Exiled and poor, there was little that either Charles or James could do about the wider political situation, and James ultimately travelled to [[Bruges]] and (along with his younger brother, [[Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester|Henry]]) joined the Spanish army under [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9]] in Flanders, where he was given command as Captain-General of six regiments of British volunteers<ref name=compeerage3/> and fought against his former French comrades at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of the Dunes]].<ref>Miller, 19\u201325</ref>\n\nDuring his service in the Spanish army, James became friendly with two Irish Catholic brothers in the Royalist entourage, [[Archbishop Peter Talbot|Peter]] and [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Richard Talbot]], and became somewhat estranged from his brother's Anglican advisers.<ref>Miller, 22\u201323</ref> In 1659, the French and Spanish [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|made peace]].

W.

Harris|Tim Harris's]] conclusions from his 2006 book summarised the ambivalence of modern scholarship towards James II:{{quote|The jury will doubtless remain out on James for a long time&nbsp;... Was he an egotistical bigot&nbsp;... a tyrant who rode roughshod over the will of the vast majority of his subjects (at least in England and Scotland)&nbsp;... simply na\u00efve, or even perhaps plain stupid, unable to appreciate the realities of political power&nbsp;... Or was he a well-intentioned and even enlightened ruler\u2014an enlightened despot well ahead of his time, perhaps\u2014who was merely trying to do what he thought was best for his subjects?<ref>Harris, 478\u2013479</ref>}}\n\nIn 2009, [[Steven Pincus]] confronted that scholarly ambivalence in ''1688: The First Modern Revolution.'' Pincus claims that James's reign must be understood within a context of economic change and European politics, and makes two major assertions about James II. The first of these is that James purposefully \"followed the French Sun King, Louis XIV, in trying to create a modern Catholic polity. This involved not only trying to Catholicize England&nbsp;... but also creating a modern, centralizing, and extremely bureaucratic state apparatus.\"<ref>Pincus, 475</ref> The second is that James was undone in 1688 far less by Protestant reaction against Catholicization than by nationwide hostile reaction against his intrusive bureaucratic state and taxation apparatus, expressed in massive popular support for William of Orange's armed invasion of England. Pincus presents James as neither na\u00efve nor stupid nor egotistical. Instead, readers are shown an intelligent, clear-thinking strategically motivated monarch whose vision for a French authoritarian political model and alliance clashed with, and lost out to, alternative views that favoured an entrepreneurial Dutch economic model, feared French power, and were outraged by James's authoritarianism.\n\n[[Scott Sowerby]] countered Pincus's thesis in 2013 in ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution.''  He noted that English taxes remained low during James II's reign, at about 4% of the English national income, and thus it was unlikely that James could have built a bureaucratic state on the model of Louis XIV's France, where taxes were at least twice as high as a proportion of GDP.<ref>Sowerby, 51\u201353</ref>  Sowerby also contends that James's policies of religious toleration attracted substantial support from religious nonconformists, including Quakers, Baptists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians, who were attracted by the king's push for a new \"Magna Carta for liberty of conscience\".<ref>Sowerby, 43\u201344</ref> The king was overthrown, in Sowerby's view, largely because of fears among the Dutch and English elites that James might be aligning himself with Louis XIV in a supposed \"holy league\" to destroy Protestantism across northern Europe.<ref>Sowerby, 227\u2013239</ref> Sowerby presents James's reign as a struggle between those who believed that the king was sincerely devoted to liberty of conscience and those who were sceptical of the king's espousals of toleration and believed that he had a hidden agenda to overthrow English Protestantism.\n\n==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==\n[[File:James2coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half crown coin]] of James II, 1686]]\n===Titles and styles===\n* 14 October 1633 \u2013 6 February 1685: <!--sources from the time call him HRH after 1680 but not before 1660--> The Duke of York\n* 10 May 1659 \u2013 6 February 1685: The Earl of Ulster<ref name=\"weir\">[[Alison Weir|Weir, Alison]] (1996). 258.

The account reads: \"And on Friday the 17th instant, about three in the afternoon, the king died, the day he always fasted in memory of our blessed Saviour's passion, the day he ever desired to die on, and the ninth hour, according to the Jewish account, when our Saviour was crucified.\" As 17 September 1701 [[New Style]] falls on a Saturday and the author insists that James died on Friday, \"the day he ever desired to die on\", an inevitable conclusion is that the author miscalculated the date, which later made it to various reference works.

However, it also involved the principles of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and [[divine right of kings]], and his deposition ended a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quinn|first1=Stephen|title=The Glorious Revolution|url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-glorious-revolution-of-1688/|website=Economic History Association EH.net|accessdate=3 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nJames inherited the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland from his elder brother [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] with widespread support in all three countries, largely based on the principle of divine right or birth.<ref>Harris, 6\u20137</ref> Tolerance for his personal Catholicism did not apply to it in general and when the [[English Parliament|English]] and [[Scottish Parliament]]s refused to pass his measures, James attempted to impose them by decree; it was a political principle, rather than a religious one, that ultimately led to his removal.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Harris|editor-first1=Tim|editor-last2=Taylor|editor-first2=Stephen|title=The Final Crisis of the Stuart Monarchy|date=2015|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|isbn=1783270446|pages=144\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1688, two events turned dissent into a crisis; the first on 10 June was the birth of James's son and heir [[James Francis Edward]], threatening to create a Roman Catholic dynasty and excluding his Anglican daughter [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and her Protestant husband [[William III of England|William of Orange]]. The second was the prosecution of the [[Seven Bishops]] for [[seditious libel]]; this was viewed as an assault on the [[Church of England]] and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England. Anti-Catholic riots in England and Scotland now made it seem only his removal as monarch could prevent a civil war.<ref>Harris, 264\u2013268</ref>\n\nLeading members of the English political class [[Invitation to William|invited William of Orange]] to assume the English throne; after he landed in [[Brixham]] on 5 November 1688, James's army deserted, and he went into exile in France on 23 December. In February 1689, a special [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] held that the king had \"vacated\" the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs, establishing the principle that [[sovereignty]] derived from Parliament, not birth. James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms, but despite a simultaneous [[Jacobite rising of 1689|rising in Scotland]], in April a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] followed that of England by finding that James had \"forfeited\" the throne and offered it to William and Mary. After his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in July 1690, James returned to France, where he spent the rest of his life in exile at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]], protected by [[Louis XIV]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Charles I and James II.png|thumb|James with his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by [[Sir Peter Lely]], 1647]]\n\nJames, the second surviving son of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], was born at [[St James's Palace]] in London on 14 October 1633.<ref>Miller, 1</ref> Later that same year, he was baptised by [[William Laud]], the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=callow31>Callow, 31</ref> He was educated by private tutors, along with his older brother, the future [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and the two sons of the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George]] and Francis Villiers.<ref>Callow, 34</ref> At the age of three, James was appointed [[Lord High Admiral of England|Lord High Admiral]]; the position was initially honorary, but would become a substantive office after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], when James was an adult.<ref>Miller, 10; Callow, 101</ref>\n\nHe was designated [[Duke of York]] at birth,<ref name=\"weir\"/> invested with the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1642,<ref>Callow, 36</ref> and formally created Duke of York in January 1644.<ref name=callow31/><ref name=\"weir\"/>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe King's disputes with the [[English Parliament]] grew into the [[English Civil War]].

Or was he a well-intentioned and even enlightened ruler\u2014an enlightened despot well ahead of his time, perhaps\u2014who was merely trying to do what he thought was best for his subjects?<ref>Harris, 478\u2013479</ref>}}\n\nIn 2009, [[Steven Pincus]] confronted that scholarly ambivalence in ''1688: The First Modern Revolution.'' Pincus claims that James's reign must be understood within a context of economic change and European politics, and makes two major assertions about James II. The first of these is that James purposefully \"followed the French Sun King, Louis XIV, in trying to create a modern Catholic polity. This involved not only trying to Catholicize England&nbsp;... but also creating a modern, centralizing, and extremely bureaucratic state apparatus.\"<ref>Pincus, 475</ref> The second is that James was undone in 1688 far less by Protestant reaction against Catholicization than by nationwide hostile reaction against his intrusive bureaucratic state and taxation apparatus, expressed in massive popular support for William of Orange's armed invasion of England. Pincus presents James as neither na\u00efve nor stupid nor egotistical. Instead, readers are shown an intelligent, clear-thinking strategically motivated monarch whose vision for a French authoritarian political model and alliance clashed with, and lost out to, alternative views that favoured an entrepreneurial Dutch economic model, feared French power, and were outraged by James's authoritarianism.\n\n[[Scott Sowerby]] countered Pincus's thesis in 2013 in ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution.''  He noted that English taxes remained low during James II's reign, at about 4% of the English national income, and thus it was unlikely that James could have built a bureaucratic state on the model of Louis XIV's France, where taxes were at least twice as high as a proportion of GDP.<ref>Sowerby, 51\u201353</ref>  Sowerby also contends that James's policies of religious toleration attracted substantial support from religious nonconformists, including Quakers, Baptists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians, who were attracted by the king's push for a new \"Magna Carta for liberty of conscience\".<ref>Sowerby, 43\u201344</ref> The king was overthrown, in Sowerby's view, largely because of fears among the Dutch and English elites that James might be aligning himself with Louis XIV in a supposed \"holy league\" to destroy Protestantism across northern Europe.<ref>Sowerby, 227\u2013239</ref> Sowerby presents James's reign as a struggle between those who believed that the king was sincerely devoted to liberty of conscience and those who were sceptical of the king's espousals of toleration and believed that he had a hidden agenda to overthrow English Protestantism.\n\n==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==\n[[File:James2coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half crown coin]] of James II, 1686]]\n===Titles and styles===\n* 14 October 1633 \u2013 6 February 1685: <!--sources from the time call him HRH after 1680 but not before 1660--> The Duke of York\n* 10 May 1659 \u2013 6 February 1685: The Earl of Ulster<ref name=\"weir\">[[Alison Weir|Weir, Alison]] (1996). 258.
