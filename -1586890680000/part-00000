[n 1813 he is burnt alive, in 1819 rescued by his wife.]\n\n''Night the Second''\n\nIn 'Glen-Avin', the ninth bard, Farquhar of Spey, sings of a sage who dies defying the Spirit of the Storm in the Cairngorms.\n\nIn 'Old David', the tenth bard, from Hogg's Ettrick, sings of the rescue by David and his seven sons of the beloved of one of them from a cave where she is imprisoned by marauders taken to be fairies.\n\nThe eleventh bard, from Lomond, sings 'The Spectre's Cradle-Song' and 'Macgregor', the latter telling of the eponymous warrior's abduction by a mysterious fatal woman.\n\nIn 'Earl Walter', the twelfth bard, from Clyde, sings of Walter Hamilton's defeating Lord Darcie in single combat before the king.\n\nIn  'Kilmeny', the thirteenth bard, Drummond of Ern, sings of a young woman who is taken to 'the land of thochte' and returns for a period to impart 'wordis of wonder, and wordis of truthe'.\n\n''Night the Third''\n\nIn 'Mary Scott', the fourteenth bard, from the Borders, sings of how Lord Pringle of Torwoodlee disguises himself as an abbot to visit his beloved Mary, daughter of his rival Tushilaw. When their liaison is discovered, her mother poisons her, but after his forces have triumphed Lord Pringle restores her to life with a kiss, they marry, and peace prevails.\n\nIn 'King Edward's Dream', the fifteenth bard, from Lammermoor, sings of the dying Edward I's vision of a future free Scotland entering into a voluntary union with England.\n\nIn 'Drumlanrig', the sixteenth bard, from Nithsdale, sings of the defeat of the Earl of Lennox's invading force by James Douglas of Drumlanrig. Douglas is encouraged by May Morison, who had been abducted by the English and whose brother falls in the conflict, and at the end he takes her as his bride.\n\nIn 'The Abbot M'Kinnon', the seventeenth bard, from the Hebrides, sings of the sinking of the Abbot of Iona's ship in retribution for his liaison with Matilda of Skye in male disguise.\n\n''Conclusion''\n\nAfter a passionate debate between the factions at Court, Queen Mary's harp is awarded to Gardyn. The Ettrick bard is happy to receive a less elaborate instrument, which will eventually be inherited by Hogg.\n\n==Reception==\nThe first edition of ''The Queen's Wake'' was enthusiastically received by almost all of the reviewers as a triumph by a self-taught genius.

Mexican pop was limited to Latin America until the mid-1990s, when an interest towards this type of music increased after [[Selena]]'s, [[Luis Miguel]]'s, [[Paulina Rubio]]'s, [[Thal\u00eda]]'s and [[Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda]]'s debuts before the mainstream USA audience.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, most of the pop music produced in Mexico consisted on Spanish-language versions of English-language [[rock-and-roll]] hits. Singers and musical groups like [[C\u00e9sar Costa]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda]], [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Alberto V\u00e1zquez (singer)|Alberto V\u00e1zquez]], [[Manolo Mu\u00f1oz]], [[Johnny Laboriel]], [[Julissa]] or Los Teen Tops performed cover versions of songs by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Nancy Sinatra]], [[Paul Anka]] and others.\n\n==1970s and 1980s==\n[[File:Escultura_de_Jos\u00e9_Jos\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|[[bronze statue|Statue]] of [[crooner]] [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]] El Pr\u00edncipe de la Canci\u00f3n (The [[Prince]] of Song) in Mexico City.]]\n[[File:Juan Gabriel in 2006.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Juan Gabriel]] a.k.a El Divo de Ju\u00e1rez (The Divo of Juarez).]]\n\nOn September 13, 1969, [[Televisa]], a Mexican company and the world's largest Spanish-language [[television network]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Televisa Brings 2006 FIFA World Cup to Mexico in HD With Snell & Wilcox Kahuna SD/HD Production Switcher |work=Press release |date=2006-06-27 |publisher=[[Snell Limited|Snell & Wilcox]] |url=http://www.snellwilcox.com/news_events/press_releases/203 |accessdate=2007-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811082252/http://www.snellwilcox.com/news_events/press_releases/203 |archivedate=2006-08-11}}</ref> launched the [[variety show]] ''[[Siempre en Domingo]]'' (''Always on Sundays'') hosted by [[Ra\u00fal Velasco]]. ''Siempre en Domingo'' became one of the most popular TV shows in Latin America with about 420 million television viewers around the world (according to Televisa and their partners). ''Siempre en Domingo'' was a TV show where many artists performed and debuted. At the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success and performers considered an appearance on the program as a guarantee of stardom similar to [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] in the United States. Velasco encouraged many Mexican singers such as [[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]], [[Lucero (actress)|Lucero]], [[Emmanuel Acha|Emmanuel]], [[Manuel Mijares|Mijares]], [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Timbiriche]], and [[Lorenzo Antonio]], and helped many of these to become full-fledged stars within the county. Moreover, Velasco presented foreign artists such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Chayanne]] and [[Ricky Martin]]. Artists that would bring pop music to Latin America, were, in part by ''Siempre en Domingo'', helped in that effort thanks for their appearances in the program.\n\n1970 Jose Jose jumped to fame when he sang \"El Triste\" at the [[Festival Mundial de la Canci\u00f3n Latina|Festival de la Canci\u00f3n Latina]]. He didn't win the prestigious singing contest but his performance was so memorable that fans across Latin America considered him the actual winner.\n\n[[File:Luc\u00eda Leticia M\u00e9ndez P\u00e9rez.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]] Actress and Singer]]\nDuring the 1980s songwriters like Guillermo M\u00e9ndez Gui\u00fa, Rafael P\u00e9rez Botija or Aureo Baqueiro wrote songs for singers like [[Yuri (Mexican)|Yuri]], Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez and musical groups like Timbiriche, [[Flans]] and [[Fandango (Mexican band)|Fandango]]. These groups headed the radio charts in Mexico and launched international career by promoting their music in Latin America.

Although not all of these singers are from Mexico.\n\nThe most well-known Mexican singer of the 1970s and 1980s was [[Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9]]. Known as \"El Principe de La Cancion\" (The Prince of the Song), he is recognizable for his romantic ballads and gifted vocals. Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 has sold over 40 million albums in his career and became a huge influence to very popular singers like: [[Cristian Castro]], [[Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Nelson Ned]], [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Manuel Mijares]], [[Lupita D'Alessio]], and [[Reyli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.famaweb.com/jose_jose_quotesta_es_mi_vidaquot_lanzamiento-6005.html |title=Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 \"Esta es mi Vida\" LANZAMIENTO |publisher=Famaweb.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319025440/http://www.famaweb.com/jose_jose_quotesta_es_mi_vidaquot_lanzamiento-6005.html |archivedate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Thal\u00eda]] became part of Timbiriche in the 1980s, tension with [[Paulina Rubio|Paulina]] a group member became instantaneous and the rivalry to monopolize the lead role was warming the atmosphere and culminated at a point in which they ended up graving each other's hairs on stage.

Before the teen [[bubblegum pop]] explosion in the US during the late 1990s, many pop acts came to light during the mid-1990s in Mexico and became successful. Most of them lasted until the end of the decade. This includes boybands Mercurio, Ragazzi, Tierra Cero and Kairo, female singers [[Lynda Thomas]], [[Fey (singer)|Fey]], [[Alessandra Rosaldo]], [[Jeans (band)|Jeans]], [[Ir\u00e1n Castillo]], [[Edith M\u00e1rquez]], [[Bibi Gaytan]], [[Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 (singer)|Maria Jose]], [[Patricia Manterola]] and boy/girl groups [[Pandora (musical group)|Pandora]], [[Sentidos Opuestos]], [[Onda Vaselina]], [[Kabah (band)|Kabah]], [[Sentidos Opuestos]]. [[Cal\u00f3 (banda)|Calo]] and the comeback of [[Timbiriche]] in 1998. Minor one-hit wonder acts were successful during this era which were also focused on a teen pop formula.\n\n[[File:LuceroHogazaLeon.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lucero (entertainer)|Lucero]] gained fame for his particular tone of voice, \nthat launched her to stardom within the pop genre. Affectionately known as La Novia de America (The [[Bride]] of [[Americas|America]]).]]\n\nIn 1992 [[Vikki Carr]] an American from El Paso, Texas, born to parents of Mexican ancestry won the [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album]] for [[Cosas del Amor (Vikki Carr album)|Cosas del Amor]] an album with the  lead single being a [[duet]] with [[Ana Gabriel]] of the same name. The track earned awards such as a [[Lo Nuestro Awards]] for [[Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year|Best Pop Song]] and the Single of the Year mention by the [[Radio & Records|Radio y M\u00fasica]] journal.\n\nBy the early to mid 1990s, the torch for Mexican music was carried by another [[Mexican-American]] singer who had grown up speaking English and learned Spanish as a second language. Texas-born [[Selena Quintanilla Perez|Selena]] was a [[Grammy Award]] winning [[Tejano (music)|Tejano]] singer, who also sang many genres. After bypassing all the Tejano barriors{{typo help inline|reason=similar to barriers|date=November 2019}}, she quickly earned the title \"Queen of Tejano Music.\" Selena became the first Latin artist to have four number ones in one year in 1994. The four were [[Donde Quiera Que Est\u00e9s]], [[Amor Prohibido (song)|Amor Prohibido]], [[Bidi Bidi Bom Bom]] and [[No Me Queda Mas]]. After her success in Spanish and winning a Grammy Award, Selena went to work on her very first English album. The irony was that English was Selena's first language, as she had grown up in Texas and Spanish was actually her ''second'' language. Sadly, Selena was murdered in March 1995.\n\n[[File:Luismiguelcomplices2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Luis Miguel]] \"El sol de Mexico\" (The Sun of Mexico) in [[Mexico city]].]]\n\nSelena only recorded 4 songs for her [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] album and was scheduled to have 13 songs in English for her album. The crossover album titled [[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]] was released in the summer of 1995. It quickly became an International Success. Selena's songs [[Dreaming of You (Selena song)|Dreaming of You]] and [[I Could Fall In Love]] quickly became crossover hits on American English language Top-40 and Adult Contemporary radio stations, with the single \"Dreaming of You\" also certified Gold. The album became among the \"Top ten best-selling debuts of all time\" along with being the \"Best-selling debuts for a Lat\u00edn Female artist.\" Selena became the first Latin Artist, male or female, to have ever debuted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200]] all-genres album chart. This career achievement helped create the Lat\u00edn boom in the late 1990s\n\n[[File:Thal\u00eda in concert2.jpg|thumb|upright|Thal\u00eda rose to fame as a member of the musical group Timbiriche.]]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Ricky Martin's success in Europe with the hit ''[[Mar\u00eda (Ricky Martin song)|Mar\u00eda]]'' and the international launch of [[1998 World Cup]]'s theme song, ''[[The Cup of Life]]'', and [[Enrique iglesias]] success launched a renewed interest in Latin American music. Mexican pop music started to look attractive to international markets.\n\nThe most successful Mexican singer of the 1990s was [[Luis Miguel]]. Best known for his technically skilled and smooth crooning vocals, Luis Miguel's super-stardom began since the late 1980s. In 1991, his career went to even greater heights and earned him the respect of a wider audience with the release of ''[[Romance (Luis Miguel album)|Romance]]'', an album of romantic [[bolero]]s. Most of them were from the 1940s and 1950s. Despite singing boleros from years past, Luis Miguel was recognized for reinventing the bolero for modern audiences. The album ''Romance'', which became his most successful album ever, eventually sold 15 million units worldwide. Luis Miguel has successfully performed [[pop music]], bolero, [[mariachi]] and romantic ballads. He has won four [[Latin Grammy Awards]], five [[Grammy Awards]], and has sold an estimate of 90 million albums until today. He is known in Latin America and Spain as \"El Sol de M\u00e9xico\" (The Sun of Mexico).\n\n[[Image:Paulina2014.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Paulina Rubio]] rose to fame as a member of the musical group Timbiriche.]]\n\n[[Thal\u00eda]] often referred to as the \"Queen of Latin Pop\"\nTelevisa has exported media to many countries. This has allowed Mexican actors to take advantage of their popularity to launch music careers in countries where Televisa [[telenovela]]s are popular. Some examples of these actors are Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez, [[Ver\u00f3nica Castro]] and [[Guillermo Capetillo]]. Ver\u00f3nica's son, [[Cristian Castro]], started his career around this time and became popular throughout Latin America.\n\nThe most successful singer to combine [[ranchera]], [[mariachi]] and [[pop music]] was [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. He originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music. However, his later work was focused on mainstream pop music.\n\nSingers such as [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Gloria Trevi]], and [[Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula]] have also produced songs that combine traditional Mexican music with popular music. The Mexican pop singers who were very successful in Mexico and the rest of North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia are [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Paulina Rubio]].\n\nThe idea of creating a pop band after a telenovela was first explored in 1991 with the cast of [[Mu\u00f1ecos de Papel]] (With [[Ricky Martin]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Rivera]], and former Timbiriche members [[Sasha Sokol]] and [[Erik Rubin]]). In 1999, the same formula was explored with the telenovela [[DKDA]] with Alessandra Rossaldo (then member of [[Sentidos Opuestos]]), [[Patricio Borghetti]] and [[Ernesto D'Alessio]]. This formula would be explored again in 2004 with the creation of the most successful group in Latinamerica [[RBD]].\n\n==2000s and 2010s==\n[[Image:Natalia Lafourcade 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Natalia Lafourcade]] since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in the pop rock scene in Latin America.]]\n\nIn 2000, Gloria Trevi, Andrade, and backup singer Maria Raquenel Portillo were arrested in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on charges of corrupting minors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/14/world/mexican-star-in-sex-case-is-arrested-in-rio.html Mexican Star in Sex Case Is Arrested in Rio]</ref><ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-12-23-trevi_x.htm Prosecutor wants charges against Trevi]</ref> Trevi was cleared of the charges in 2004, due to lack of evidence, after spending four years and eight months in prison.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/23/artsnews.mexico Mexico's Madonna free at last in climax to real-life soap]</ref>\n\nThe century saw new groups [[Sin Bandera]], [[RBD]], [[Belanova]], [[Playa Limbo]], and [[Jotdog]] as well as new and solo debut singers like [[Dulce Maria]], [[Anah\u00ed]], [[Belinda (entertainer)|Belinda]], [[Maite Perroni]], [[Julieta Venegas]], [[Ximena Sari\u00f1ana]] and [[Kika Edgar]].

''Siempre en Domingo'' became one of the most popular TV shows in Latin America with about 420 million television viewers around the world (according to Televisa and their partners). ''Siempre en Domingo'' was a TV show where many artists performed and debuted. At the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success and performers considered an appearance on the program as a guarantee of stardom similar to [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] in the United States. Velasco encouraged many Mexican singers such as [[Luc\u00eda M\u00e9ndez]], [[Lucero (actress)|Lucero]], [[Emmanuel Acha|Emmanuel]], [[Manuel Mijares|Mijares]], [[Gloria Trevi]], [[Timbiriche]], and [[Lorenzo Antonio]], and helped many of these to become full-fledged stars within the county. Moreover, Velasco presented foreign artists such as [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Raphael (singer)|Raphael]], [[Miguel Bos\u00e9]], [[Chayanne]] and [[Ricky Martin]]. Artists that would bring pop music to Latin America, were, in part by ''Siempre en Domingo'', helped in that effort thanks for their appearances in the program.\n\n1970 Jose Jose jumped to fame when he sang \"El Triste\" at the [[Festival Mundial de la Canci\u00f3n Latina|Festival de la Canci\u00f3n Latina]].

Before the teen [[bubblegum pop]] explosion in the US during the late 1990s, many pop acts came to light during the mid-1990s in Mexico and became successful. Most of them lasted until the end of the decade.

Texas-born [[Selena Quintanilla Perez|Selena]] was a [[Grammy Award]] winning [[Tejano (music)|Tejano]] singer, who also sang many genres. After bypassing all the Tejano barriors{{typo help inline|reason=similar to barriers|date=November 2019}}, she quickly earned the title \"Queen of Tejano Music.\" Selena became the first Latin artist to have four number ones in one year in 1994. The four were [[Donde Quiera Que Est\u00e9s]], [[Amor Prohibido (song)|Amor Prohibido]], [[Bidi Bidi Bom Bom]] and [[No Me Queda Mas]]. After her success in Spanish and winning a Grammy Award, Selena went to work on her very first English album. The irony was that English was Selena's first language, as she had grown up in Texas and Spanish was actually her ''second'' language. Sadly, Selena was murdered in March 1995.\n\n[[File:Luismiguelcomplices2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Luis Miguel]] \"El sol de Mexico\" (The Sun of Mexico) in [[Mexico city]].]]\n\nSelena only recorded 4 songs for her [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] album and was scheduled to have 13 songs in English for her album. The crossover album titled [[Dreaming of You (Selena album)|Dreaming of You]] was released in the summer of 1995. It quickly became an International Success. Selena's songs [[Dreaming of You (Selena song)|Dreaming of You]] and [[I Could Fall In Love]] quickly became crossover hits on American English language Top-40 and Adult Contemporary radio stations, with the single \"Dreaming of You\" also certified Gold. The album became among the \"Top ten best-selling debuts of all time\" along with being the \"Best-selling debuts for a Lat\u00edn Female artist.\" Selena became the first Latin Artist, male or female, to have ever debuted at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200]] all-genres album chart.

Ver\u00f3nica's son, [[Cristian Castro]], started his career around this time and became popular throughout Latin America.\n\nThe most successful singer to combine [[ranchera]], [[mariachi]] and [[pop music]] was [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. He originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk and country music. However, his later work was focused on mainstream pop music.\n\nSingers such as [[Pepe Aguilar]], [[Paulina Rubio]], [[Gloria Trevi]], and [[Aracely Ar\u00e1mbula]] have also produced songs that combine traditional Mexican music with popular music. The Mexican pop singers who were very successful in Mexico and the rest of North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia are [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Gloria Trevi]] and [[Paulina Rubio]].\n\nThe idea of creating a pop band after a telenovela was first explored in 1991 with the cast of [[Mu\u00f1ecos de Papel]] (With [[Ricky Martin]], [[Ang\u00e9lica Rivera]], and former Timbiriche members [[Sasha Sokol]] and [[Erik Rubin]]). In 1999, the same formula was explored with the telenovela [[DKDA]] with Alessandra Rossaldo (then member of [[Sentidos Opuestos]]), [[Patricio Borghetti]] and [[Ernesto D'Alessio]]. This formula would be explored again in 2004 with the creation of the most successful group in Latinamerica [[RBD]].\n\n==2000s and 2010s==\n[[Image:Natalia Lafourcade 2014.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Natalia Lafourcade]] since her debut in 2003 has been one of the most successful singers in the pop rock scene in Latin America.]]\n\nIn 2000, Gloria Trevi, Andrade, and backup singer Maria Raquenel Portillo were arrested in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], on charges of corrupting minors.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/14/world/mexican-star-in-sex-case-is-arrested-in-rio.html Mexican Star in Sex Case Is Arrested in Rio]</ref><ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/2002-12-23-trevi_x.htm Prosecutor wants charges against Trevi]</ref> Trevi was cleared of the charges in 2004, due to lack of evidence, after spending four years and eight months in prison.<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/23/artsnews.mexico Mexico's Madonna free at last in climax to real-life soap]</ref>\n\nThe century saw new groups [[Sin Bandera]], [[RBD]], [[Belanova]], [[Playa Limbo]], and [[Jotdog]] as well as new and solo debut singers like [[Dulce Maria]], [[Anah\u00ed]], [[Belinda (entertainer)|Belinda]], [[Maite Perroni]], [[Julieta Venegas]], [[Ximena Sari\u00f1ana]] and [[Kika Edgar]].

He was considered one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.stretford-end.com/united-articles/billy-meredith-legend.html |title=Legends: Billy Meredith Player Profile |publisher=Stretford-end.com |accessdate=25 February 2009 }}</ref> He won each domestic trophy in the [[English football league system|English football league]] and gained 48 caps for [[Wales national football team|Wales]], for whom he scored 11 goals and won two [[British Home Championship]] titles. His favoured position was [[Outside forward|outside right]], and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a [[toothpick]] during games made him instantly recognisable.\n\nIn 27 seasons in [[the Football League]] from 1892 to 1924 (not including the four seasons lost to the First World War and the 1905\u201306 season in which he was banned for bribing an opposition player), he scored 176 goals in 740 league and cup appearances. He played for [[Chirk AAA F.C.|Chirk]], before joining [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] in 1892. His career took off when he signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895. He captained the team to the club's first major honour, a 1\u20130 victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[1904 FA Cup Final]]. He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] half-back [[Alex Leake]] \u00a310 to lose a match. There he won the league title in 1907\u201308 and 1910\u201311, the FA Cup in [[1909 FA Cup Final|1909]], as well as two [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]]s. He also helped to set up the [[Players' Union]], which was a fore-runner of the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]. He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at the age of 47 and played a further 32 games before retiring in 1924, making him the oldest ever player for City, United and Wales. He later ran the Stretford Road Hotel and helped to coach the short-lived [[Manchester Central F.C.|Manchester Central]].\n\n==Early life==\nMeredith was born in 1874 in [[Chirk]], a small mining town in [[Denbighshire]], Wales, just south of [[Wrexham]]. He started work at [[Black Park]] [[Coal mining|Colliery]] as a [[pit pony]] driver at the age of 12.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=7|ps=}} His family were [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodists]], and Meredith himself remained a lifelong [[Teetotalism|teetotaller]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=9|ps=}} He spent eight years working in the mines, and worked during a tough time for the industry, enduring a 25% pay cut which led to [[strike action]] in 1893; this experience helped to shape his political views, which would become significant later in his life.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} An interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers. Elias, the eldest, was a [[Railroad engineer|train driver]] for the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} His work allowed him to take Meredith to watch professional teams such as [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} Football was a keen pastime for the miners, and the standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east Wales was high as a result; [[Chirk AAA F.C.|Chirk]] won the [[Welsh Cup]] five times between 1887 and 1894, with miners making up a large proportion of the team.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} All the Meredith brothers played football, but [[Sam Meredith|Sam]], two years older than Billy, was the first to make an impression. He left Chirk to attempt a professional career, and went on to play for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] as a full-back.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}}\n\nMeredith made his debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=15|ps=}} The club played in [[The Combination]], a league which contained a mixture of town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=15|ps=}} At the end of his first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2\u20131 to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=17|ps=}} Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside-right [[William Owen (footballer, born 1862)|William Owen]], a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners' strike.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=16|ps=}} In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk, but accepted an offer to play for Football League club [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] as well, who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=16|ps=}} Northwich were a struggling side, who withdrew from [[the Football League]] at the end of the [[1893\u201394 Football League|1893\u201394]] season after finishing bottom of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=16|ps=}} Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup.{{sfn|Ward|1984|ps=}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===First spell at Manchester City===\nMeredith's performances for Northwich gained the attention of several other clubs in [[the Football League]]. [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] full-back [[Di Jones]], a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary [[John Bentley (football manager)|J.J. Bentley]] felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=22|ps=}} [[Lawrence Furniss]], an official at [[Manchester City F.C.|Ardwick]], had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}} Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=23|ps=}} Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager [[Joshua Parlby]], the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}}{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=23|ps=}} The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}} Meredith did not wish to abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: \"It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away&nbsp;... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements&nbsp;... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished.\"{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}} Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=22|ps=}} He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=23|ps=}}\n\nMeredith made his Manchester City debut in November 1894 in a 5\u20134 loss to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].{{sfn|Penney|1995|p=139|ps=}} The following week he played his first home match for the club at [[Hyde Road Football Stadium|Hyde Road]], and scored two goals against Newton Heath&nbsp;\u2013 who later became [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]&nbsp;\u2013 in the first [[Manchester derby]] to take place in the league.

He was considered one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.stretford-end.com/united-articles/billy-meredith-legend.html |title=Legends: Billy Meredith Player Profile |publisher=Stretford-end.com |accessdate=25 February 2009 }}</ref> He won each domestic trophy in the [[English football league system|English football league]] and gained 48 caps for [[Wales national football team|Wales]], for whom he scored 11 goals and won two [[British Home Championship]] titles. His favoured position was [[Outside forward|outside right]], and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a [[toothpick]] during games made him instantly recognisable.\n\nIn 27 seasons in [[the Football League]] from 1892 to 1924 (not including the four seasons lost to the First World War and the 1905\u201306 season in which he was banned for bribing an opposition player), he scored 176 goals in 740 league and cup appearances. He played for [[Chirk AAA F.C.|Chirk]], before joining [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] in 1892. His career took off when he signed with Manchester City in 1894 and turned professional in January 1895. He captained the team to the club's first major honour, a 1\u20130 victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in the [[1904 FA Cup Final]]. He moved to Manchester United in May 1906 after being banned for bribing [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] half-back [[Alex Leake]] \u00a310 to lose a match. There he won the league title in 1907\u201308 and 1910\u201311, the FA Cup in [[1909 FA Cup Final|1909]], as well as two [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]]s. He also helped to set up the [[Players' Union]], which was a fore-runner of the [[Professional Footballers' Association]]. He returned to Manchester City in 1921 at the age of 47 and played a further 32 games before retiring in 1924, making him the oldest ever player for City, United and Wales. He later ran the Stretford Road Hotel and helped to coach the short-lived [[Manchester Central F.C.|Manchester Central]].\n\n==Early life==\nMeredith was born in 1874 in [[Chirk]], a small mining town in [[Denbighshire]], Wales, just south of [[Wrexham]]. He started work at [[Black Park]] [[Coal mining|Colliery]] as a [[pit pony]] driver at the age of 12.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=7|ps=}} His family were [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodists]], and Meredith himself remained a lifelong [[Teetotalism|teetotaller]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=9|ps=}} He spent eight years working in the mines, and worked during a tough time for the industry, enduring a 25% pay cut which led to [[strike action]] in 1893; this experience helped to shape his political views, which would become significant later in his life.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} An interest in football was kindled by his elder brothers. Elias, the eldest, was a [[Railroad engineer|train driver]] for the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} His work allowed him to take Meredith to watch professional teams such as [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} Football was a keen pastime for the miners, and the standard of amateur teams from towns and villages in north east Wales was high as a result; [[Chirk AAA F.C.|Chirk]] won the [[Welsh Cup]] five times between 1887 and 1894, with miners making up a large proportion of the team.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=8|ps=}} All the Meredith brothers played football, but [[Sam Meredith|Sam]], two years older than Billy, was the first to make an impression. He left Chirk to attempt a professional career, and went on to play for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] as a full-back.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}}\n\nMeredith made his debut for the Chirk first team in September 1892.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=15|ps=}} The club played in [[The Combination]], a league which contained a mixture of town clubs and reserve teams of clubs from big cities.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=15|ps=}} At the end of his first season Meredith played in the 1893 Welsh Cup final, which Chirk lost 2\u20131 to [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=17|ps=}} Meredith formed a solid understanding with inside-right [[William Owen (footballer, born 1862)|William Owen]], a former Wales international. Chirk withdrew from The Combination and entered only the Welsh league in 1893 due to low attendances caused by the coal miners' strike.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=16|ps=}} In an attempt to make ends meet, Meredith not only played for Chirk, but accepted an offer to play for Football League club [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] as well, who gave him a small fee on top of his expenses.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=16|ps=}} Northwich were a struggling side, who withdrew from [[the Football League]] at the end of the [[1893\u201394 Football League|1893\u201394]] season after finishing bottom of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. The club won just three league matches; Meredith featured in each win.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=16|ps=}} Back at Chirk, Meredith gained his first honour as part of the team that beat Westminster Rovers to win the 1894 Welsh Cup.{{sfn|Ward|1984|ps=}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===First spell at Manchester City===\nMeredith's performances for Northwich gained the attention of several other clubs in [[the Football League]]. [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] full-back [[Di Jones]], a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary [[John Bentley (football manager)|J.J. Bentley]] felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=22|ps=}} [[Lawrence Furniss]], an official at [[Manchester City F.C.|Ardwick]], had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}} Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=23|ps=}} Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager [[Joshua Parlby]], the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}}{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=23|ps=}} The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues.{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}} Meredith did not wish to abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: \"It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away&nbsp;... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements&nbsp;... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished.\"{{sfn|James|2005|p=88|ps=}} Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=22|ps=}} He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=23|ps=}}\n\nMeredith made his Manchester City debut in November 1894 in a 5\u20134 loss to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].{{sfn|Penney|1995|p=139|ps=}} The following week he played his first home match for the club at [[Hyde Road Football Stadium|Hyde Road]], and scored two goals against Newton Heath&nbsp;\u2013 who later became [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]&nbsp;\u2013 in the first [[Manchester derby]] to take place in the league. Newton Heath won the match 5\u20132. He turned professional in January 1895,{{sfn|Penney|1995|p=139|ps=}} and ended the [[1894\u201395 Manchester City F.C. season|1894\u201395]] season with 12 goals in 18 appearances, just three strikes behind top-scorer [[Pat Finnerhan]], who had played an extra 12 games.\n\nIn his [[1895\u201396 Manchester City F.C. season|first full season]] at Manchester City, Meredith finished as top scorer.{{sfn|James|2006|p=277}} He was appointed club captain in his [[1896\u201397 Manchester City F.C. season|second season]] at the club, aged just 21.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=34|ps=}} The club finished as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] runners-up in [[1895\u201396 Manchester City F.C. season|1895\u201396]], but were denied promotion after heavy defeats to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]] in the [[playoffs|test matches]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=39|ps=}} After the departure of strike partner Pat Finnerhan to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in March 1897, Meredith remained as City's star player.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=36|ps=}}\n\nHis new partner for the [[1897\u201398 Manchester City F.C. season|1897\u201398]] season was [[Stockport Smith|William Smith]] (known as \"Stockport Smith\" to differentiate him from another William Smith in the team), whilst [[Billie Gillespie]] was placed at centre-forward.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=41|ps=}} Meredith provided Gillespie with many crosses into the box,{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=41|ps=}} picking up numerous assists as Gillespie outscored Meredith by 19 goals to 12. Meredith also acted as a mentor for the slightly younger Gillespie, steering him away from drinking sessions by taking him along on fishing trips.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=42|ps=}} The final match of the season saw Meredith score his first [[hat-trick]] for the club in an emphatic 9\u20130 win against [[Burton Swifts F.C.|Burton Swifts]].{{sfn|James|2006|pp=280\u201328|ps=}}\n{{Quote box|quote=\"Oh I wish I was you Billy Meredith<br />I wish I was you, I envy you, indeed I do!<br />It ain't that you're tricky with your feet,<br />But it's those centres that you send in<br />Which Turnbull then heads in,<br />Oh, I wish I was you,<br />Indeed I do<br />Indeed I do\"|source=\u2014 One of the popular songs sung on the terraces at Hyde Road.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=82|ps=}}|width=20%|align=right}}\n\nCity dominated the Second Division in the [[1898\u201399 Manchester City F.C. season|1898\u201399]] season, and won promotion as champions.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=42|ps=}} Helping them to keep them in winning ways in the close season was late signing [[Jimmy Ross (footballer born 1866)|Jimmy Ross]], a veteran forward who Meredith considered to be his \"favourite hero\".{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=42|ps=}} Meredith claimed 30 goals in 35 games, including hat-tricks against [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]], [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough]], [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]] and [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]].\n\nMeredith scored City's first goal in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] on the opening day of the [[1899\u20131900 Manchester City F.C. season|1899\u20131900]] season in a 4\u20133 defeat to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] on 2 September.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=45|ps=}} Seven days later he claimed two goals in a 4\u20130 home victory over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], and \"led the field that day\" by dribbling the ball almost the whole length of the pitch before launching a powerful shot that settled into the corner of [[Jack Fryer (footballer born 1877)|Jack Fryer's]] net.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=45|ps=}} The ''[[Athletic News]]'' reported that \"for real brilliance the right-wing [Meredith and Ross] took the biscuit\".{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=46|ps=}}\n\nFirst Division defences managed to limit Meredith's contribution in the [[1900\u201301 Manchester City F.C. season|1900\u201301]] campaign by singling him out for rough treatment, though [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] manager [[Tom Watson (football manager)|Tom Watson]] felt compelled to write a letter to Manchester City denying that a Liverpool director had stated that \"all that the opposition had to do was watch Meredith \u2013 the rest are no good\".{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=61|ps=}} He finished the season with just seven goals in 35 appearances.\n\nMeredith found the net eight times in 38 games in the [[1901\u201302 Manchester City F.C. season|1901\u201302]] campaign, as City were relegated back out of the First Division. The club's secretary, [[Sam Ormerod]], selected 29 different players as the club slumped to defeat in 13 of the opening 20 games.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=62|ps=}} Ormerod was forced to step down, as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign promising young Scottish players.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=66|ps=}} New manager [[Tom Maley]] was more willing than his predecessor to confront Meredith over his tendency to stray out of position and attempt to dominate the City attack.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=67|ps=}}\n\nCity won immediate promotion as Second Division champions in [[1902\u201303 Manchester City F.C. season|1902\u201303]], with Meredith scoring 22 goals in 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield Town]]. Maley managed to find him a suitable inside-right partner in [[Jimmy Bannister]], who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=69|ps=}} He also played [[Sammy Frost]] at half-back, who was able to win the ball and bring Meredith into the play, and signed outside-left [[Frank Booth (footballer)|Frank Booth]] to balance the attack.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=71|ps=}} Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=71|ps=}}\n\nMeredith was partnered with [[George Livingstone]] for the [[1903\u201304 Manchester City F.C. season|1903\u201304]] campaign, who was able to supply him and the rest of the team with quality passes.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=71|ps=}} Drawn against a strong [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] outfit in the First Round of the [[FA Cup]], Meredith was the \"raider-in-chief\" as City claimed a 3\u20132 victory at Hyde Road.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=76|ps=}} City then defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] to reach the semi-finals.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=78|ps=}} There they faced [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] at [[Goodison Park]], and Meredith scored one goal (bundled in by Gillespie) and claimed two assists as City won the game 3\u20131.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=79|ps=}} Their opponents in [[1904 FA Cup Final|the final]] at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] were mid-table Second Division outfit [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], and Meredith was cautiously optimistic before the match, stating \"We ought to win&nbsp;... if we play anything like our normal game the cup is ours&nbsp;... but this is the cup final and, well, anything might happen.\"{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=85|ps=}} With just over 20 minutes played, Livingstone found Meredith with a long ball, who then beat goalkeeper [[Dai Davies (footballer born 1880)|Dai Davies]] to score the only goal of the game; Bolton supporters long maintained that Meredith had been offside.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=90|ps=}} As captain, Meredith was handed the trophy by Prime Minister [[Arthur Balfour]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=94|ps=}}\n\nHe scored nine goals in 36 games in the [[1904\u201305 Manchester City F.C. season|1904\u201305]] season, as City came within two points and two places of champions [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. The season ended in controversial circumstances at [[Villa Park]], and with a 3\u20132 defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] ending any hopes of winning the league, [[Sandy Turnbull]] and Villa captain [[Alex Leake]] exchanged blows.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=105|ps=}} [[The Football Association]] launched [[English football bribery scandal|an investigation into the violence]], and the findings shocked the sporting world as Meredith was suspended for the entirety of the [[1905\u201306 Manchester City F.C. season|1905\u201306]] season for (unsuccessfully) attempting to bribe Alex Leake.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=110|ps=}} No evidence was taken from Meredith, who denied the charge, and the evidence was not made public.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=111|ps=}} The club, fearful of FA sanctions, refused to pay Meredith during the campaign.

May I be there at the death.\"{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=179|ps=}}\n\nAfter draws with Ireland and Scotland, Meredith \"wept unashamedly\" as he helped Wales to beat England 2\u20131 at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] to claim the [[1919\u201320 British Home Championship|1920 British Home Championship]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=206|ps=}} It was only his second victory against the English in 20 attempts, and it marked the last of his 48 caps.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=207|ps=}} Though his record number of caps was later surpassed, at 45 years and 229 days he remains the [[Wales national football team records|oldest player]] to win a Wales cap. He was actually chosen by the selectors for 71 consecutive matches, but only made 48 appearances as his clubs regularly refused to release him for international duty.{{sfn|Brandon|1978|p=170|ps=}}\n\n==Style of play==\nMeredith was able to avoid injury throughout his career, despite the extremely physical nature of the game during the period.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=51|ps=}} This was due in part to his extraordinary balance and agility, which allowed him to avoid clumsy challenges, and the toughness he had built up from spending his adolescence working in the mines.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=52|ps=}} A model professional, he spent his spare time improving his game with extra training sessions and maintained peak physical fitness by avoiding alcohol and tobacco.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=53|ps=}} His \"gimmick\" was to chew on a [[toothpick]] during matches, and this unusual trait was picked up on by cartoonists of the time.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=54|ps=}}\n\nWriting a 1947 critique of [[Stanley Matthews]], Meredith criticised the lack of direct play on show in the 1940s and stated that when he was playing that \"I knew what was expected of me&nbsp;\u2013 to beat the wing-half and the full-back, take the ball down to the corner flag and centre\".{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=241|ps=}} His ball control skills were unparalleled, leaving opposition players unable to tackle him.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=242|ps=}} He also was an extremely accurate passer and crosser of the ball.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=244|ps=}} His dribbling and crossing gave him a large advantage over rival wingers, who relied solely on speed to beat opposition full-backs.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=244|ps=}} In addition to wing-play, he was also highly skilled at sending in long-range shots across the face of the goal, and could be relied upon to meet crosses from his left-winger with a powerful volley.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=246|ps=}}\n\nMeredith had to deal with extremely physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=246|ps=}} As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=247|ps=}} This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=250|ps=}} A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=250|ps=}} The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able to make the most of his accurate crosses.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=250|ps=}}\n\n==Players' Union==\n{{Quote box|quote=\"I have devoted myself to football and I have become a better player than most men because I have denied myself much that men prize&nbsp;... They congratulate me and give me caps but they will not give me a penny more than men are earning in the reserve team, some of them perhaps do not trouble themselves to improve themselves and don't worry about taking care of condition. If football is a man's livelihood and he does more than others for his employer, why is he not entitled to better pay than others? So far as I can make out, the sole reason why the best footballers in England are prevented from earning better than men of lesser ability and experience is purely sentimental.\"|source=\u2014 Meredith made a passionate and eloquent case for abandoning the maximum wage.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=126|ps=}}|width=35%|align=right}}\nMeredith organised the first meeting of the [[Players' Union]] (PU) in December 1907.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=129|ps=}} Meredith had previously been involved with the [[Association Footballers' Union]] (the \"AFU\"), the first attempt by football players in England to organise a [[trade union]]. The Players' Union, like the AFU before it, sought the relaxation of restrictions on transfers and wages.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/how-players-won-footballs-100-years-war-431441.html |newspaper=The Independent |title=How players won football's 100 years war |date=10 January 2007}}</ref> Others made the argument that a free market wage structure would ruin the amateur principles the sport was founded on, but Meredith felt that these words rang hollow considering that club directors and shareholders made vast profits.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=127|ps=}} At the first annual meeting in December 1908, the PU stated their aims as to allow unlimited wages, the right to transfer from club to club, and for players to take a percentage of any transfer fee.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=130|ps=}}\n\nWith the union threatening strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909 [[the Football Association]] insisted that all players agree to leave the union and pledge loyalty to the FA.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=133|ps=}} Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players, and FA suspended the entire squad.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=135}} The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club's office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=135}} The players continued to train, and captain [[Charlie Roberts]] came up with the name of Outcasts F.C.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=137|ps=}} The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman [[Charles Clegg (footballer)|Charles Clegg]] failed to win them over, and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=140|ps=}}\n\nIn October 1909, the Union balloted its members over the organisation's membership of the [[General Federation of Trade Unions (United Kingdom)|General Federation of Trade Unions]] (GTFU).{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=140|ps=}} The result of the vote, a decisive \"no\" to GFTU support, effectively supported the FA's position that professional footballers were fundamentally different from workmen in other industries.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=140|ps=}} Meredith resumed league football in November 1909, bemoaning his view that \"many players refuse to take things seriously and continue to live a kind of schoolboy life\".{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=143|ps=}}\n\n==Personal life and legacy==\nHe married Ellen Negus in 1901, and the couple had two daughters.{{sfn|Harding|1998|pp=48\u20139|ps=}} He was a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=125|ps=}} He ran businesses throughout his career, with little success, and was declared bankrupt in July 1909 after his outfitting shop was damaged by fire.{{sfn|harvnb|Harding|1998|p=135}} During the 1910s he ran a [[public house]] (despite being a teetotaller) and later pursued an interest in the film industry by buying shares in numerous [[Stretford]] [[Movie theater|cinemas]] in the 1930s.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=209|ps=}} He also starred in 1926 picture ''[[The Ball of Fortune]]'', playing himself as a football trainer; the film received generally positive reviews.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=225|ps=}} In 1928, together with former colleague [[Charlie Roberts]] he became a coach for the ambitious but short-lived [[Manchester Central F.C.|Manchester Central]]. Meredith's son-in-law, former City captain [[Charlie Pringle]], was a player.{{sfn|James|2008|pp=147\u2013166|ps=}} He retained a passion for football, and spent much of his retirement discussing the game with former colleagues and regulars at his hotel, the Stretford Road Hotel, which he ran from 1930 to 1945.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=230|ps=}} He rarely missed the chance to attend a Wales game in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|Harding|1998|p=230|ps=}}\n\n[[File:Meredith shirt.jpg|thumb|200px|A Wales national team football shirt which was worn by Billy Meredith in the early 1900s, with Welsh cap.
