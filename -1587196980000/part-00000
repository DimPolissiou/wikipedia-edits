{"title_page": "Central limit theorem", "text_new": "In [[probability theory]], the '''central limit theorem''' ('''CLT''') establishes that, in some situations, when [[Statistical independence|independent random variables]] are added, their properly normalized sum tends toward a [[normal distribution]] (informally a ''bell curve'') even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.\n\nMathematically, if <math display=\"inline\">X_1, X_2 , ... , X_n</math> is a [[random sample]] of size <math display=\"inline\">n</math> taken from a population with mean <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> and finite variance <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma^2</math> and if <math display=\"inline\">\\bar{X}</math> is the sample mean, the limiting form of the distribution of <math display=\"inline\">Z=\\left ( \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\surd n} \\right )</math> as <math display=\"inline\">n \\to \\infty</math>, is the standard normal distribution.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Douglas C.|title=Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers |edition=6th|last2=Runger|first2=George C.|publisher=Wiley|year=2014|isbn=9781118539712|location=|page=241}}</ref>\n\nFor example, suppose that a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] is obtained containing many [[Random variate|observations]], each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the [[arithmetic mean]] of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the [[probability distribution]] of the average will closely approximate a normal distribution. A simple example of this is that if one [[Coin flipping|flips a coin many times]], the probability of getting a given number of heads will approach a normal distribution, with the mean equal to half the total number of flips. At the limit of an infinite number of flips, it will equal a normal distribution.\n\nThe central limit theorem has several variants. In its common form, the random variables must be identically distributed. In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions or for non-independent observations, if they comply with certain conditions.\n\nThe earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the [[binomial distribution]], is the [[de Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem]].\n\n==Independent sequences==\n[[File:Central limit thm.png|400px|thumb|right|A distribution being \"smoothed out\" by [[summation]], showing original [[Probability density function|density of distribution]] and three subsequent summations; see [[Illustration of the central limit theorem]] for further details.]]\n[[File:IllustrationCentralTheorem.png|400px|thumb|right|Whatever the form of the population distribution, the sampling distribution tends to a Gaussian, and its dispersion is given by the Central Limit Theorem.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rouaud |first=Mathieu |title=Probability, Statistics and Estimation|year=2013 |page=10 |url=http://www.incertitudes.fr/book.pdf }}</ref>]]\n\n===Classical CLT===\nLet <math display=\"inline\">\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}</math> be a [[random sample]] of size <math display=\"inline\">n</math>\u2014that is, a sequence of [[independent and identically distributed]] (i.i.d.) random variables drawn from a distribution of [[expected value]] given by <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> and finite [[variance]] given by <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma^2</math>. Suppose we are interested in the [[sample mean|sample average]]\n\n:<math>S_n := \\frac{X_1+\\cdots+X_n}{n}</math>\n\nof these random variables. By the [[law of large numbers]], the sample averages [[Convergence in probability|converge in probability]] and [[Almost sure convergence|almost surely]] to the expected value <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> as <math display=\"inline\">n\\to\\infty</math>. The classical central limit theorem describes the size and the distributional form of the stochastic fluctuations around the deterministic number <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> during this convergence. More precisely, it states that as <math display=\"inline\">n</math> gets larger, the distribution of the difference between the sample average <math display=\"inline\">S_n</math> and its limit <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math>, when multiplied by the factor <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{n}</math> (that is <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{n}(S_n - \\mu)</math>), approximates the [[normal distribution]] with mean 0 and variance <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma^2</math>. For large enough {{mvar|n}}, the distribution of <math display=\"inline\">S_n</math> is close to the normal distribution with mean <math display=\"inline\">\\mu</math> and variance <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma^2/n</math>. The usefulness of the theorem is that the distribution of <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{n}(S_n - \\mu)</math> approaches normality regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual <math display=\"inline\">X_i</math>. Formally, the theorem can be stated as follows:\n\n<blockquote>'''Lindeberg\u2013L\u00e9vy CLT.''' Suppose <math display=\"inline\">\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}</math> is a sequence of [[independent and identically distributed|i.i.d.]] random variables with <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{E}[X_i] = \\mu</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{Var}[X_i] = \\sigma_i^2 < \\infty</math>. Then as <math display=\"inline\">n</math> approaches infinity, the random variables <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{n}(S_n - \\mu)</math> [[convergence in distribution|converge in distribution]] to a [[normal distribution|normal]] <math display=\"inline\">N(0, \\sigma^2)</math>:<ref>Billingsley (1995, p.&nbsp;357)</ref>\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{n}\\left(S_n - \\mu\\right)\\ \\xrightarrow{d}\\ N\\left(0,\\sigma^2\\right).</math></blockquote>\n\nIn the case <math display=\"inline\">\\sigma > 0</math>, convergence in distribution means that the [[cumulative distribution function]]s of <math display=\"inline\">\\sqrt{n}(S_n - \\mu)</math> converge pointwise to the cdf of the <math display=\"inline\">N(0, \\sigma^2)</math> distribution: for every real number&nbsp;<math display=\"inline\">z</math>,\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\Pr\\left[\\sqrt{n}(S_n-\\mu) \\le z\\right] = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\Pr\\left[\\frac{\\sqrt{n}(S_n-\\mu)}{\\sigma } \\le \\frac{z}{\\sigma}\\right]= \\Phi\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sigma}\\right) ,</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">\\Phi(z)</math> is the standard normal cdf evaluated at&nbsp;<math display=\"inline\">z</math>. The convergence is uniform in <math display=\"inline\">z</math> in the sense that\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\sup_{z\\in\\R}\\left|\\Pr\\left[\\sqrt{n}(S_n-\\mu) \\le z\\right] - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{z}{\\sigma}\\right)\\right| = 0,</math>\n\nwhere <math display=\"inline\">\\mathrm{sup}</math> denotes the least upper bound (or [[supremum]]) of the set.<ref>Bauer (2001, Theorem 30.13, p.199)</ref>\n\n===Lyapunov CLT===\nThe theorem is named after Russian mathematician [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]].

A sum of [[discrete random variable]]s is still a [[discrete random variable]], so that we are confronted with a sequence of [[discrete random variable]]s whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable (namely that of the [[normal distribution]]).  This means that if we build a [[histogram]] of the realisations of the sum of {{mvar|n}} independent identical discrete variables, the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity, this relation is known as [[de Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem]].

Thus the central limit theorem can be interpreted as a statement about the properties of density functions under convolution: the convolution of a number of density functions tends to the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound. These theorems require stronger hypotheses than the forms of the central limit theorem given above. Theorems of this type are often called local limit theorems.

Specifically, an appropriate scaling factor needs to be applied to the argument of the characteristic function.\n\nAn equivalent statement can be made about [[Fourier transform]]s, since the characteristic function is essentially a Fourier transform.\n\n===Calculating the variance===\nLet {{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}} be the sum of {{mvar|n}} random variables. Many central limit theorems provide conditions such that {{math|{{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}}/{{sqrt|Var({{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}})}}}} converges in distribution to {{math|''N''(0,1)}} (the normal distribution with mean 0, variance 1) as {{math|{{mvar|n}}\u2192 \u221e}}.  In some cases, it is possible to find a constant {{mvar|\u03c3<sup>2</sup>}}  and function {{mvar|f(n)}} such that {{math|{{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}}/(\u03c3{{sqrt|{{mvar|n\u22c5f}}({{mvar|n}})}})}} converges in distribution to {{math|''N''(0,1)}} as {{math|{{mvar|n}}\u2192 \u221e}}.\n\n<blockquote>'''Lemma.'''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Asymptotic distribution of rewards accumulated by alternating renewal processes|journal=Statistics and Probability Letters|date=2017|volume=129|pages=355\u2013359|doi=10.1016/j.spl.2017.06.027}}</ref> Suppose <math>X_1, X_2, \\dots</math> is a sequence of real-valued and strictly stationary random variables with <math>\\mathbb{E}(X_i) = 0</math> for all <math>i</math>, <math>g : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}</math>, and <math>S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(\\tfrac{i}{n}) X_i</math>.

Therefore, when the logarithm of a product of random variables that take only positive values approaches a normal distribution, the product itself approaches a [[log-normal distribution]].  Many physical quantities (especially mass or length, which are a matter of scale and cannot be negative) are the products of different [[random]] factors, so they follow a log-normal distribution.  This multiplicative version of the central limit theorem is sometimes called [[Gibrat's law]].\n\nWhereas the central limit theorem for sums of random variables requires the condition of finite variance, the corresponding theorem for products requires the corresponding condition that the density function be square-integrable.<ref name=Rempala/>\n\n==Beyond the classical framework==\nAsymptotic normality, that is, [[Convergence in distribution|convergence]] to the normal distribution after appropriate shift and rescaling, is a phenomenon much more general than the classical framework treated above, namely, sums of independent random variables (or vectors). New frameworks are revealed from time to time; no single unifying framework is available for now.\n\n===Convex body===\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.'''

Convergence in total variation is stronger than weak convergence.\n\nAn important example of a log-concave density is a function constant inside a given convex body and vanishing outside; it corresponds to the uniform distribution on the convex body, which explains the term \"central limit theorem for convex bodies\".\n\nAnother example: {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x<sub>n</sub>'') {{=}} const \u00b7 exp( \u2212 ({{abs|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}<sup>''\u03b1''</sup> + \u2026 + {{abs|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}<sup>''\u03b1''</sup>)<sup>''\u03b2''</sup>)}} where {{math|''\u03b1'' > 1}} and {{math|''\u03b1\u03b2'' > 1}}.

In cases like electronic noise, examination grades, and so on, we can often regard a single measured value as the weighted average of many small effects. Using generalisations of the central limit theorem, we can then see that this would often (though not always) produce a final distribution that is approximately normal.\n\nIn general, the more a measurement is like the sum of independent variables with equal influence on the result, the more normality it exhibits. This justifies the common use of this distribution to stand in for the effects of unobserved variables in models like the [[linear model]].\n\n==Regression==\n[[Regression analysis]] and in particular [[ordinary least squares]] specifies that a [[dependent variable]] depends according to some function upon one or more [[independent variable]]s, with an additive [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error term]]. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption can be justified by assuming that the error term is actually the sum of many independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be well approximated by a normal distribution.\n\n===Other illustrations===\n{{Main|Illustration of the central limit theorem}}\nGiven its importance to statistics, a number of papers and computer packages are available that demonstrate the convergence involved in the central limit theorem.<ref name=\"Marasinghe\">{{cite journal|last1=Marasinghe |first1=M. |last2=Meeker |first2=W. |last3=Cook |first3=D. |last4=Shin |first4=T.

The first version of this theorem was postulated by the French-born mathematician [[Abraham de Moivre]] who, in a remarkable article published in 1733, used the normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the number of heads resulting from many tosses of a fair coin. This finding was far ahead of its time, and was nearly forgotten until the famous French mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] rescued it from obscurity in his monumental work ''Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s'', which was published in 1812.  Laplace expanded De Moivre's finding by approximating the binomial distribution with the normal distribution. But as with De Moivre, Laplace's finding received little attention in his own time. It was not until the nineteenth century was at an end that the importance of the central limit theorem was discerned, when, in 1901, Russian mathematician [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] defined it in general terms and proved precisely how it worked mathematically. Nowadays, the central limit theorem is considered to be the unofficial sovereign of probability theory.}}\n\nSir [[Francis Galton]] described the Central Limit Theorem in this way:<ref>{{cite book|last=Galton|first= F. |date=1889 |title=Natural Inheritance |url=http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/books/natural-inheritance/pages/natural-inheritance_0073.htm |page= 66}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the \"Law of Frequency of Error\".

The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.\n\nMathematically, if <math>X_1, X_2 , ... , X_n</math> is a [[random sample]] of size n taken from a population with mean \u03bc and finite variance \u03c3<sup>2</sup> and if <math>\\bar{X}</math> is the sample mean, the limiting form of the distribution of <math>Z=\\left ( \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu}{\\sigma/\\surd n} \\right )</math> as n \u2192 \u221e, is the standard normal distribution.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Montgomery|first1=Douglas C.|title=Applied Statistics and Probability for Engineers |edition=6th|last2=Runger|first2=George C.|publisher=Wiley|year=2014|isbn=9781118539712|location=|page=241}}</ref>\n\nFor example, suppose that a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] is obtained containing many [[Random variate|observations]], each observation being randomly generated in a way that does not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the [[arithmetic mean]] of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed many times, the central limit theorem says that the [[probability distribution]] of the average will closely approximate a normal distribution. A simple example of this is that if one [[Coin flipping|flips a coin many times]], the probability of getting a given number of heads will approach a normal distribution, with the mean equal to half the total number of flips. At the limit of an infinite number of flips, it will equal a normal distribution.\n\nThe central limit theorem has several variants. In its common form, the random variables must be identically distributed. In variants, convergence of the mean to the normal distribution also occurs for non-identical distributions or for non-independent observations, if they comply with certain conditions.\n\nThe earliest version of this theorem, that the normal distribution may be used as an approximation to the [[binomial distribution]], is the [[de Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem]].\n\n==Independent sequences==\n[[File:Central limit thm.png|400px|thumb|right|A distribution being \"smoothed out\" by [[summation]], showing original [[Probability density function|density of distribution]] and three subsequent summations; see [[Illustration of the central limit theorem]] for further details.]]\n[[File:IllustrationCentralTheorem.png|400px|thumb|right|Whatever the form of the population distribution, the sampling distribution tends to a Gaussian, and its dispersion is given by the Central Limit Theorem.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rouaud |first=Mathieu |title=Probability, Statistics and Estimation|year=2013 |page=10 |url=http://www.incertitudes.fr/book.pdf }}</ref>]]\n\n===Classical CLT===\nLet {{math|{''X''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''X<sub>n</sub>''}}} be a [[random sample]] of size {{mvar|n}}\u2014that is, a sequence of [[independent and identically distributed]] (i.i.d.) random variables drawn from a distribution of [[expected value]] given by {{mvar|\u00b5}} and finite [[variance]] given by {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}. Suppose we are interested in the [[sample mean|sample average]]\n\n:<math>S_n := \\frac{X_1+\\cdots+X_n}{n}</math>\n\nof these random variables. By the [[law of large numbers]], the sample averages [[Convergence in probability|converge in probability]] and [[Almost sure convergence|almost surely]] to the expected value {{mvar|\u00b5}} as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}}. The classical central limit theorem describes the size and the distributional form of the stochastic fluctuations around the deterministic number {{mvar|\u00b5}} during this convergence. More precisely, it states that as {{mvar|n}} gets larger, the distribution of the difference between the sample average {{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}} and its limit {{mvar|\u00b5}}, when multiplied by the factor {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} (that is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}(''S<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''\u00b5'')}}), approximates the [[normal distribution]] with mean 0 and variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}. For large enough {{mvar|n}}, the distribution of {{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}} is close to the normal distribution with mean {{mvar|\u00b5}} and variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}/{{math|''n''}}. The usefulness of the theorem is that the distribution of {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}(''S<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''\u00b5'')}} approaches normality regardless of the shape of the distribution of the individual {{mvar|X<sub>i</sub>}}. Formally, the theorem can be stated as follows:\n\n<blockquote>'''Lindeberg\u2013L\u00e9vy CLT.'''

In this variant of the central limit theorem the random variables {{mvar|X<sub>i</sub>}} have to be independent, but not necessarily identically distributed. The theorem also requires that random variables {{math|{{abs|''X<sub>i</sub>''}}}} have [[moment (mathematics)|moment]]s of some order {{math|(2 + ''\u03b4'')}}, and that the rate of growth of these moments is limited by the Lyapunov condition given below.\n\n<blockquote>'''Lyapunov CLT.'''<ref>Billingsley (1995, p.362)</ref> Suppose {{math|{''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026}}} is a sequence of independent random variables, each with finite expected value {{mvar|\u03bc<sub>i</sub>}} and variance {{math|''\u03c3''{{su|b=''i''|p=2}}}}.

The converse implication, however, does not hold.\n\n===Lindeberg CLT===\n{{Main|Lindeberg's condition}}\n\nIn the same setting and with the same notation as above, the Lyapunov condition can be replaced with the following weaker one (from [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg|Lindeberg]] in 1920).\n\nSuppose that for every {{math|''\u03b5'' > 0}}\n\n:<math>  \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{s_n^2}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\operatorname{E}\\left[(X_i - \\mu_i)^2 \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{ | X_i - \\mu_i | > \\varepsilon s_n \\}}  \\right] = 0</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''1'''<sub>{\u2026}</sub>}} is the [[indicator function]].

Summation of these vectors is being done componentwise. The multidimensional central limit theorem  states that when scaled, sums converge to a [[multivariate normal distribution]].<ref>{{Cite book|last = Van der Vaart|first = A.

A sum of [[discrete random variable]]s is still a [[discrete random variable]], so that we are confronted with a sequence of [[discrete random variable]]s whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable (namely that of the [[normal distribution]]).  This means that if we build a [[histogram]] of the realisations of the sum of {{mvar|n}} independent identical discrete variables, the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity, this relation is known as [[de Moivre\u2013Laplace theorem]]. The [[binomial distribution]] article details such an application of the central limit theorem in the simple case of a discrete variable taking only two possible values.\n\n===Relation to the law of large numbers===\n[[Law of large numbers|The law of large numbers]] as well as the central limit theorem are partial solutions to a general problem: \"What is the limiting behaviour of {{math|S<sub>{{mvar|n}}</sub>}} as {{mvar|n}} approaches infinity?\" In mathematical analysis, [[asymptotic series]] are one of the most popular tools employed to approach such questions.\n\nSuppose we have an asymptotic expansion of {{math|''f''(''n'')}}:\n\n: <math>f(n)= a_1 \\varphi_{1}(n)+a_2 \\varphi_{2}(n)+O\\big(\\varphi_{3}(n)\\big) \\qquad  (n \\rightarrow \\infty).</math>\n\nDividing both parts by {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>(''n'')}} and taking the limit will produce {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>}}, the coefficient of the highest-order term in the expansion, which represents the rate at which {{math|''f''(''n'')}} changes in its leading term.\n\n: <math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(n)}{\\varphi_{1}(n)}=a_1.</math>\n\nInformally, one can say: \"{{math|''f''(''n'')}} grows approximately as {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>(''n'')}}\". Taking the difference between {{math|''f''(''n'')}} and its approximation and then dividing by the next term in the expansion, we arrive at a more refined statement about {{math|''f''(''n'')}}:\n\n: <math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{f(n)-a_1 \\varphi_{1}(n)}{\\varphi_{2}(n)}=a_2 .</math>\n\nHere one can say that the difference between the function and its approximation grows approximately as {{math|''a''<sub>2</sub>''\u03c6''<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}}.  The idea is that dividing the function by appropriate normalizing functions, and looking at the limiting behavior of the result, can tell us much about the limiting behavior of the original function itself.\n\nInformally, something along these lines happens when the sum, {{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}}, of independent identically distributed random variables, {{math|''X''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''X<sub>n</sub>''}}, is studied in classical probability theory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  If each {{mvar|X<sub>i</sub>}} has finite mean {{mvar|\u03bc}}, then by the law of large numbers, {{math|{{sfrac|''S<sub>n</sub>''|''n''}} \u2192 ''\u03bc''}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rosenthal |first=Jeffrey Seth |date=2000 |title=A First Look at Rigorous Probability Theory |publisher=World Scientific |ISBN=981-02-4322-7 |at=Theorem 5.3.4, p. 47}}</ref>  If in addition each {{mvar|X<sub>i</sub>}} has finite variance {{math|''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>}}, then by the central limit theorem,\n\n: <math> \\frac{S_n-n\\mu}{\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow \\xi ,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03be}} is distributed as {{math|''N''(0,''\u03c3''<sup>2</sup>)}}.

Specifically it says that the normalizing function {{math|{{sqrt|''n'' log log ''n''}}}}, intermediate in size between {{mvar|n}} of the law of large numbers and {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} of the central limit theorem, provides a non-trivial limiting behavior.\n\n===Alternative statements of the theorem===\n\n====Density functions====\nThe [[probability density function|density]] of the sum of two or more independent variables is the [[convolution]] of their densities (if these densities exist).  Thus the central limit theorem can be interpreted as a statement about the properties of density functions under convolution: the convolution of a number of density functions tends to the normal density as the number of density functions increases without bound. These theorems require stronger hypotheses than the forms of the central limit theorem given above. Theorems of this type are often called local limit theorems.

Specifically, an appropriate scaling factor needs to be applied to the argument of the characteristic function.\n\nAn equivalent statement can be made about [[Fourier transform]]s, since the characteristic function is essentially a Fourier transform.\n\n===Calculating the variance===\nLet {{mvar|S<sub>n</sub>}} be the sum of {{mvar|n}} random variables.

Therefore, when the logarithm of a product of random variables that take only positive values approaches a normal distribution, the product itself approaches a [[log-normal distribution]].  Many physical quantities (especially mass or length, which are a matter of scale and cannot be negative) are the products of different [[random]] factors, so they follow a log-normal distribution.  This multiplicative version of the central limit theorem is sometimes called [[Gibrat's law]].\n\nWhereas the central limit theorem for sums of random variables requires the condition of finite variance, the corresponding theorem for products requires the corresponding condition that the density function be square-integrable.<ref name=Rempala/>\n\n==Beyond the classical framework==\nAsymptotic normality, that is, [[Convergence in distribution|convergence]] to the normal distribution after appropriate shift and rescaling, is a phenomenon much more general than the classical framework treated above, namely, sums of independent random variables (or vectors).

In cases like electronic noise, examination grades, and so on, we can often regard a single measured value as the weighted average of many small effects. Using generalisations of the central limit theorem, we can then see that this would often (though not always) produce a final distribution that is approximately normal.\n\nIn general, the more a measurement is like the sum of independent variables with equal influence on the result, the more normality it exhibits. This justifies the common use of this distribution to stand in for the effects of unobserved variables in models like the [[linear model]].\n\n==Regression==\n[[Regression analysis]] and in particular [[ordinary least squares]] specifies that a [[dependent variable]] depends according to some function upon one or more [[independent variable]]s, with an additive [[Errors and residuals in statistics|error term]]. Various types of statistical inference on the regression assume that the error term is normally distributed. This assumption can be justified by assuming that the error term is actually the sum of many independent error terms; even if the individual error terms are not normally distributed, by the central limit theorem their sum can be well approximated by a normal distribution.\n\n===Other illustrations===\n{{Main|Illustration of the central limit theorem}}\nGiven its importance to statistics, a number of papers and computer packages are available that demonstrate the convergence involved in the central limit theorem.<ref name=\"Marasinghe\">{{cite journal|last1=Marasinghe |first1=M. |last2=Meeker |first2=W. |last3=Cook |first3=D. |last4=Shin |first4=T.

The first version of this theorem was postulated by the French-born mathematician [[Abraham de Moivre]] who, in a remarkable article published in 1733, used the normal distribution to approximate the distribution of the number of heads resulting from many tosses of a fair coin. This finding was far ahead of its time, and was nearly forgotten until the famous French mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] rescued it from obscurity in his monumental work ''Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s'', which was published in 1812.  Laplace expanded De Moivre's finding by approximating the binomial distribution with the normal distribution. But as with De Moivre, Laplace's finding received little attention in his own time. It was not until the nineteenth century was at an end that the importance of the central limit theorem was discerned, when, in 1901, Russian mathematician [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] defined it in general terms and proved precisely how it worked mathematically. Nowadays, the central limit theorem is considered to be the unofficial sovereign of probability theory.}}\n\nSir [[Francis Galton]] described the Central Limit Theorem in this way:<ref>{{cite book|last=Galton|first= F. |date=1889 |title=Natural Inheritance |url=http://galton.org/cgi-bin/searchImages/galton/search/books/natural-inheritance/pages/natural-inheritance_0073.htm |page= 66}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the \"Law of Frequency of Error\".

Its authority can be compared to that of the German [[Bundestag]], the [[United States]] [[House of Representatives]] or the [[House of Commons]].\n\nThe Sejm has been the highest governing body of the [[History of Poland|Third Polish Republic]] since the transition of government in 1989. Along with the [[upper house]] of parliament, the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], it forms the national [[legislature]] in Poland. The [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] is composed of 460 [[Member of parliament|deputies]] (singular ''deputowany'' or ''pose\u0142'' \u2013 \"envoy\") elected every four years by a [[Universal suffrage|universal ballot]]. The Sejm is presided over by a [[Speaker of parliament|speaker]] called the \"Marshal of the Sejm\" (''Marsza\u0142ek Sejmu'').\n\nThe first true lower house of parliament was founded in 1493 as an assembly of [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] and their representatives. In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], the term \"''Sejm''\" referred to an entire two-[[Chambers of parliament|chamber]] parliament, comprising the Chamber of Deputies ({{lang-pl|Izba Poselska}}), the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] and the King. It was thus a three-estate parliament, and the absolute authority of the monarch was diminished by parliament's ruling under the ''[[nihil novi]]'' act from 1505. The [[Henrician Articles]] from 1573 further strengthened the assembly's jurisdiction, making Poland a [[elective monarchy|constitutional elective]] monarchy. Since the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918\u20131939), \"''Sejm''\" has referred only to the larger house of the parliament.\n\n== History == <!--[[Confederation]] links here-->\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n{{main|Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland}} \n[[File:The_First_Sejm_1182.jpg|thumb|left|The First Sejm in \u0141\u0119czyca. Recording of laws. A.D. 1180]]\n\nThe origin of the contemporary ''Sejm'' (meaning \"gathering\") is traced back to the King's Councils \u2013 ''[[wiec]]e'' \u2013 which gained considerable authority during the time of [[History of Poland (966-1385)#Fragmentation and Invasion, (1146-1295)|Poland's fragmentation]] between 1146 and 1295. The 1180 Sejm in [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] (known as the 'First Polish parliament') was the most notable of these councils, in that for the first time in Poland's history it established laws constraining the power of the ruler. It forbade arbitrary sequestration of supplies in the countryside and takeover of bishopric lands after the death of a bishop. These early ''Sejm''s were not a regular event, they convened at the King's behest. \n\nFollowing the 1493 ''Sejm'' in [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]], it became a regularly convening body, to which indirect elections were held every two years. The [[bicameral system]] was also established; the ''Sejm'' then comprised two chambers: the ''Senat'' (Senate) of 81 bishops and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]]; and the Chamber of Deputies, made up of 54 envoys elected by smaller local ''sejmik'' ([[Sejmik|assemblies of landed nobility]]) in each of the Kingdom's provinces. At the time, Poland's nobility, which accounted for around 10% of the state's population (then the highest amount in Europe), was becoming particularly influential, and with the eventual development of the [[Golden Liberty]], the ''Sejm'''s powers increased dramatically.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://opis.sejm.gov.pl/en/historiasejmu.php |title=Poznaj Sejm |website=opis.sejm.gov.pl |date= |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth===\n{{main|Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth}}\n[[File:Kazimierz Wojniakowski, Uchwalenie Konstytucji 3 Maja.jpg|thumb|left|In 1791, the \"[[Great Sejm|Great ''Sejm'']]\" or [[Four-Year Sejm|Four-Year ''Sejm'']] of 1788\u20131792 and Senate adopted the [[May 3rd Constitution]] at the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]] Over time, the envoys in the [[lower chamber]] grew in number and power as they pressed the king for more privileges. The ''Sejm'' eventually became even more active in supporting the goals of the privileged classes when the King ordered that the landed nobility and their estates (peasants) be drafted into [[Pospolite ruszenie|military service]]. \n{{Politics of Poland}}\nThe [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, united the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385-1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] as one single state, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and thus the ''Sejm'' was supplemented with new envoys from among the [[Lithuanian nobility]]. The Commonwealth ensured that the state of affairs surrounding the three-estates system continued, with the ''Sejm'', Senate and King forming the estates and supreme deliberating body of the state. In the first few decades of the 16th century, the Senate had established its precedence over the ''Sejm''; however, from the mid-1500s onwards, the ''Sejm'' became a very powerful representative body of the ''[[szlachta]]'' (\"middle nobility\"). Its chambers reserved the final decisions in legislation, taxation, [[budget]], and [[treasury]] matters (including military funding), [[foreign policy]], and the [[Ennoblement|confirment of nobility]]. \n\nThe 1573 [[Warsaw Confederation]] saw the nobles of the ''Sejm'' officially sanction and guarantee [[religious tolerance]] in Commonwealth territory, ensuring a refuge for those fleeing the ongoing [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] wars in Europe. \n\nUntil the end of the 16th century, [[unanimity]] was not required, and the [[majority voting|majority-voting]] process was the most commonly used system for voting. Later, with the rise of the [[Polish magnate]]s and their increasing power, the [[unanimity]] principle was re-introduced with the institution of the nobility's right of ''[[liberum veto]]'' ([[Latin]]: \"I freely forbid\"). Additionally, if the envoys were unable to reach a unanimous decision within six weeks (the time limit of a single session), deliberations were declared void and all previous acts passed by that ''Sejm'' were annulled. From the mid-17th century onward, any objection to a ''Sejm'' resolution, by either an envoy or a senator, automatically caused the rejection of other, previously approved resolutions. This was because all resolutions passed by a given session of the ''Sejm'' formed a whole resolution, and, as such, was published as the annual \"constituent act\" of the ''Sejm'', e.g. the \"''[[Anno Domini]]'' 1667\" act. In the 16th century, no single person or small group dared to hold up proceedings, but, from the second half of the 17th century, the ''liberum veto'' was used to virtually paralyze the ''Sejm'', and brought the Commonwealth to the brink of collapse. \n\nThe ''liberum veto'' was abolished with the adoption of Poland's [[May Constitution of Poland|3rd May Constitution]] in 1791, a piece of legislation which was passed as the \"Government Act\", and for which the ''Sejm'' required four years to propagate and adopt. The constitution's acceptance, and the possible long-term consequences it may have had, is arguably the reason for which the powers of [[Habsburg Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] then decided to partition the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, thus putting an end to over 300 years of Polish parliamentary continuity. It is estimated that between 1493 and 1793, a ''Sejm'' was held 240 times, the total debate-time sum of which was 44 years.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n===Partitions===\n[[File:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|left|thumb|280px|[[Tadeusz Rejtan]] tries to prevent the legalisation of the [[Partitions of Poland|first partition of Poland]] by preventing the members of the ''Sejm'' from leaving the chamber (1773). [[Rejtan (painting)|Painting]] by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], which existed as a [[Napoleon]]ic [[client state]] between 1807 and 1815, and its short-lived [[Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw|''Sejm'' of the Duchy of Warsaw]], the [[Sejm of Congress Poland|''Sejm'' of Congress Poland]] was established in [[Congress Poland]] of the Russian Empire; it was composed of the king (the Russian emperor), the upper house (Senate), and the lower house (Chamber of Deputies). Overall, during the period from 1795 until the re-establishment of Poland's sovereignty in 1918, little power was actually held by any Polish legislative body and the occupying powers of Russia, Prussia (later united [[German Empire|Germany]]) and Austria propagated legislation for their own respective formerly-Polish territories at a national level.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n====Congress Poland====\n{{main|Sejm of Congress Poland}}\nThe Chamber of Deputies, despite its name, consisted not only of 77 envoys (sent by local assemblies) from the hereditary nobility, but also of 51 [[Chamber of Deputies|deputies]], elected by the non-noble population. All deputies were covered by [[Parliamentary immunity]], with each individual serving for a term of office of six years, with third of the deputies being elected every two years. Candidates for deputy had to be able to [[Literacy|read and write]], and have a certain amount of wealth. The legal voting age was 21, except for those citizens serving in the military, the personnel of which were not allowed to vote. Parliamentary sessions were initially convened every two years, and lasted for (at least) 30 days. However, after many clashes between liberal deputies and conservative government officials, sessions were later called only four times (1818, 1820, 1826, and 1830, with the last two sessions being secret). The ''Sejm'' had the right to call for votes on [[Common law|civil]] and [[Administrative law|administrative]] legal issues, and, with permission from the king, it could also vote on matters related to the [[fiscal policy]] and the military. It had the right to exercise control over government officials, and to file [[petition]]s. The 64-member Senate on the other hand, was composed of ''[[voivode]]s''  and ''[[Castellan|kasztelan]]s'' (both types of provincial governors), Russian \"[[Prince du Sang|princes of the blood]]\", and nine bishops. It acted as the Parliamentary Court, had the right to control \"citizens' books\", and had similar [[Legislature|legislative]] rights as did the Chamber of Deputies.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n====Germany and Austria-Hungary====\nIn the [[Free City of Cracow]] (1815\u20131846), a unicameral Assembly of Representatives was established, and from 1827, a unicameral [[Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Posen|provincial ''sejm'']] existed in the [[Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144]]. Poles were elected to and represented the majority in both of these legislatures; however, they were largely powerless institutions and exercised only very limited power. After numerous failures in securing legislative sovereignty in the early 19th century, many Poles simply gave up trying to attain a degree of independence from their foreign master-states. In the [[Austrian partition]], a relatively powerless [[Sejm of the Estates|''Sejm'' of the Estates]] operated until the time of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]]. After this, in the mid to late 19th century, only in autonomous [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (1861\u20131914) was there a unicameral and functional National ''Sejm'', the [[Sejm of the Land|''Sejm'' of the Land]]. It is recognised today as having played a major and overwhelming positive role in the development of Polish national institutions.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Poles were able to become members of the parliaments of Austria, Prussia and Russia, where they formed Polish Clubs. Deputies of Polish nationality were elected to the Prussian ''Landtag'' from 1848, and then to the [[German Empire]]'s ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' from 1871. Polish Deputies were members of the Austrian State Council (from 1867), and from 1906 were also elected to the Russian Imperial State ''Duma'' (lower chamber) and to the State Council (upper chamber).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Second Polish Republic===\n[[File:Dubois w Sejmie. 1-A-849-4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stanis\u0142aw Dubois]] speaking to envoys and diplomats in the ''Sejm'', 1931]]\nAfter the [[First World War]] and re-establishment of Polish independence, the convocation of parliament, under the democratic electoral law of 1918, became an enduring symbol of the new state's wish to demonstrate and establish continuity with the 300-year Polish parliamentary traditions established before the time of the partitions. Maciej Rataj emphatically paid tribute to this with the phrase: \"There is Poland there, and so is the ''Sejm''\".\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] of Poland's independence, the first [[1919 Polish legislative election|Legislative ''Sejm'' of 1919]], a Constituent Assembly, passed the [[Small Constitution of 1919]], which introduced a [[parliamentary republic]] and proclaimed the principle of the ''Sejm'''s [[sovereignty]]. This was then strengthened, in 1921, by the [[March Constitution of Poland|March Constitution]], one of the most democratic European constitutions enacted after the end of World War I. The constitution established a political system which was based on [[Montesquieu]]'s doctrine of separation of powers, and which restored the bicameral ''Sejm'' consisting of a chamber of deputies (to which alone the name of \"''Sejm''\" was from then on applied) and the Senate. In 1919, [[Roza Pomerantz-Meltzer]], a member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] party, became the first woman ever elected to the ''Sejm''.<ref>{{cite book |title=God's Playground: A History of Poland |last=Davies |first=Norman |year=1982 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn= |page=302}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism, 1870-1933/39 |last=Strauss |first=Herbert Arthur |authorlink= |author2= |year=1993 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location= |isbn= |page=985}}</ref>\n\nThe legal content of the March Constitution allowed for ''Sejm'' supremacy in the system of state institutions at the expense of the executive powers, thus creating a parliamentary republic out of the Polish state. An attempt to strengthen executive powers in 1926 (through the August Amendment) proved too limited and largely failed in helping avoid legislative grid-lock which had ensued as a result of too-great parliamentary power in a state which had numerous diametrically-opposed political parties sitting in its legislature. In 1935, the parliamentary republic was weakened further when, by way of, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], the president was forced to sign the [[Polish Constitution of 1935|April Constitution of 1935]], an act through which the head of state assumed the dominant position in legislating for the state and the Senate increased its power at the expense of the ''Sejm''.\n\n[[File:Beck przem\u00f3wienie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[J\u00f3zef Beck]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, delivers his famous Honour Speech in the ''Sejm'', 5 May 1939.]]\nOn 2 September 1939, the ''Sejm'' held its final pre-war session, during which it declared Poland's readiness to defend itself against invading German forces. On 2 November 1939, the President dissolved the ''Sejm'' and the Senate, which were then, according to plan, to resume their activity within two months after the end of the Second World War; this, however, never happened. During wartime, the National Council (1939\u20131945) was established to represent the legislature as part of the [[Polish Government in Exile]]. Meanwhile, in [[Nazi-occupied Poland]], the Council of National Unity was set up; this body functioned from 1944 to 1945 as the parliament of the [[Polish Underground State]]. With the cessation of hostilities in 1945, and subsequent rise to power of the Communist-backed [[Provisional Government of National Unity]], the [[Second Polish Republic]] legally ceased to exist.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Polish People's Republic===\nThe ''Sejm'' in the [[Polish People's Republic]] had 460 deputies throughout most of its history. At first, this number was declared to represent one deputy per 60,000 citizens (425 were elected in 1952), but, in 1960, as the population grew, the declaration was changed: The constitution then stated that the deputies were representative ''of'' the people and could be recalled ''by'' the people, but this article was never used, and, instead of the \"[[five-point electoral law]]\", a non-proportional, \"four-point\" version was used. Legislation was passed with [[majority voting]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|1952 Constitution]], the Sejm was defined as \"the highest organ of State authority\" in Poland, as well as \"the highest spokesman of the will of the people in town and country.\" On paper, it was vested with great lawmaking and oversight powers. For instance, it was empowered with control over \"the functioning of other organs of State authority and administration,\" and ministers were required to answer questions posed by deputies within seven days.<ref name=PolandConstitutionChapter3>[http://libr.sejm.gov.pl/tek01/txt/kpol/e1952a-r3.html Chapter 3] of 1952 Constitution</ref> In practice, it did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the Communist [[Polish United Workers Party]] and its executive bodies.<ref name=cs>[http://countrystudies.us/poland/80.htm Poland: a country study]. [[Library of Congress]] Federal Research Division, December 1989.</ref> This was standard practice in nearly all Communist regimes due to the principle of [[democratic centralism]].\n\nThe ''Sejm'' voted on the [[budget]] and on the periodic [[Planned economy|national plans]] that were a fixture of communist economies. The ''Sejm'' deliberated in sessions that were ordered to convene by the [[State Council of Poland|State Council]].\n\nThe ''Sejm'' also chose a ''[[Presidium|Prezydium]]'' (\"presiding body\") from among its members. The ''Prezydium'' was headed by the speaker, or [[Marshal of the Sejm|Marshal]], who was always a member of the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. In its preliminary session, the ''Sejm'' also nominated the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]], the [[Council of Ministers of Poland]], and members of the State Council. It also chose many other government officials, including the head of the [[Supreme Audit Office (Poland)|Supreme Chamber of Control]] and members of the [[State Tribunal of Poland|State Tribunal]] and the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]], as well as the [[Polish Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] (the last three bodies of which were created in the 1980s).\n\nWhen the Sejm was not in session, the State Council had the power to issue decrees that had the force of law. However, those decrees had to be approved by the Sejm at its next session.<ref name=PolandConstitutionChapter3/> In practice, the principles of democratic centralism meant that such approval was only a formality.\n\nThe [[Senate of Poland]] was abolished by the [[1946 Polish people's referendum|Polish people's referendum]] in 1946, after which the ''Sejm'' became the sole legislative body in Poland.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Even though the ''Sejm'' was largely subservient to the Communist party, one deputy, Romuald Bukowski (an independent) voted against the imposition of martial law in 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/22/obituaries/romuald-bukowski-polish-legislator-64.html|title=Romuald Bukowski; Polish Legislator, 64|author=The Associated Press|date=22 October 1992|work=The New York Times|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n===Third Polish Republic===\nAfter the [[Revolutions of 1989|end of communism]] in 1989, the Senate was reinstated as the second house of a bicameral [[National Assembly of Poland|national assembly]], while the ''Sejm'' remained the first house. The ''Sejm'' is now composed of 460 deputies elected by [[proportional representation]] every four years.\n\nBetween 7 and 19 deputies are elected from each constituency using the [[d'Hondt method]] (with one exception, in 2001, when the [[Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method]] was used), their number being proportional to their constituency's population. Additionally, a threshold is used, so that candidates are chosen only from parties that gained at least 5% of the nationwide vote (candidates from ethnic-minority parties are exempt from this threshold).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Sejm RP.jpg|The ''Sejm'' building in [[Warsaw]]\nFile:PolskiSejm007.jpg|The ''Sejm'''s main hall\nFile:Sala posiedzen Sejmu.JPG|Sessions chamber in the ''Sejm''\nFile:Sejm Plenary Hall viewed from the rostrum.JPG|Sessions chamber viewed from the rostrum\nFile:Sejm cross.JPG|[[Sejm cross|''Sejm'' cross]]\nFile:PolskiSejm010.jpg|Column hall in the ''Sejm''\n</gallery>\n\n== Standing committees ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* Administration and Internal Affairs\n* Agriculture and Rural Development\n* Liaison with Poles Abroad\n* Constitutional Accountability\n* Culture and Media\n* Deputies' Ethics\n* Economic Committee\n* Education, Science and Youth\n* Enterprise Development\n* Environment Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry\n* European Union Affairs\n* Family and Women Rights\n* Foreign Affairs\n* Health\n* Infrastructure\n* Justice and Human Rights\n* Legislative\n* Local Self-Government and Regional Policy\n* National and Ethnic Minorities\n* National Defence\n* Physical Education and Sport\n* Public Finances\n* Rules and Deputies' Affairs\n* Social Policy\n* Special Services\n* State Control\n* State Treasury\n* Work\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Current standings ==\n{{9th term Sejm and 10th term Senate of Poland}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Electoral districts of Poland (1935 -

Its authority can be compared to that of the German [[Bundestag]], the [[United States]] [[House of Representatives]] or the [[House of Commons]].\n\nThe Sejm has been the highest governing body of the [[History of Poland|Third Polish Republic]] since the transition of government in 1989. Along with the [[upper house]] of parliament, the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]], it forms the national [[legislature]] in Poland. The [[Diet (assembly)|Diet]] is composed of 460 [[Member of parliament|deputies]] (singular ''deputowany'' or ''pose\u0142'' \u2013 \"envoy\") elected every four years by a [[Universal suffrage|universal ballot]]. The Sejm is presided over by a [[Speaker of parliament|speaker]] called the \"Marshal of the Sejm\" (''Marsza\u0142ek Sejmu'').\n\nThe first true lower house of parliament was founded in 1493 as an assembly of [[szlachta|Polish nobles]] and their representatives. In the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]], the term \"''Sejm''\" referred to an entire two-[[Chambers of parliament|chamber]] parliament, comprising the Chamber of Deputies ({{lang-pl|Izba Poselska}}), the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] and the King. It was thus a three-estate parliament, and the absolute authority of the monarch was diminished by parliament's ruling under the ''[[nihil novi]]'' act from 1505. The [[Henrician Articles]] from 1573 further strengthened the assembly's jurisdiction, making Poland a [[elective monarchy|constitutional elective]] monarchy. Since the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918\u20131939), \"''Sejm''\" has referred only to the larger house of the parliament.\n\n== History == <!--[[Confederation]] links here-->\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n{{main|Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland}} \n[[File:The_First_Sejm_1182.jpg|thumb|left|The First Sejm in \u0141\u0119czyca. Recording of laws. A.D. 1180]]\n\nThe origin of the contemporary ''Sejm'' (meaning \"gathering\") is traced back to the King's Councils \u2013 ''[[wiec]]e'' \u2013 which gained considerable authority during the time of [[History of Poland (966-1385)#Fragmentation and Invasion, (1146-1295)|Poland's fragmentation]] between 1146 and 1295. The 1180 Sejm in [[\u0141\u0119czyca]] (known as the 'First Polish parliament') was the most notable of these councils, in that for the first time in Poland's history it established laws constraining the power of the ruler. It forbade arbitrary sequestration of supplies in the countryside and takeover of bishopric lands after the death of a bishop. These early ''Sejm''s were not a regular event, they convened at the King's behest. \n\nFollowing the 1493 ''Sejm'' in [[Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski|Piotrk\u00f3w]], it became a regularly convening body, to which indirect elections were held every two years. The [[bicameral system]] was also established; the ''Sejm'' then comprised two chambers: the ''Senat'' (Senate) of 81 bishops and [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth#Senatorial offices|other dignitaries]]; and the Chamber of Deputies, made up of 54 envoys elected by smaller local ''sejmik'' ([[Sejmik|assemblies of landed nobility]]) in each of the Kingdom's provinces. At the time, Poland's nobility, which accounted for around 10% of the state's population (then the highest amount in Europe), was becoming particularly influential, and with the eventual development of the [[Golden Liberty]], the ''Sejm'''s powers increased dramatically.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://opis.sejm.gov.pl/en/historiasejmu.php |title=Poznaj Sejm |website=opis.sejm.gov.pl |date= |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth===\n{{main|Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth}}\n[[File:Kazimierz Wojniakowski, Uchwalenie Konstytucji 3 Maja.jpg|thumb|left|In 1791, the \"[[Great Sejm|Great ''Sejm'']]\" or [[Four-Year Sejm|Four-Year ''Sejm'']] of 1788\u20131792 and Senate adopted the [[May 3rd Constitution]] at the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle in Warsaw]]]] Over time, the envoys in the [[lower chamber]] grew in number and power as they pressed the king for more privileges. The ''Sejm'' eventually became even more active in supporting the goals of the privileged classes when the King ordered that the landed nobility and their estates (peasants) be drafted into [[Pospolite ruszenie|military service]]. \n{{Politics of Poland}}\nThe [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, united the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385-1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] as one single state, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and thus the ''Sejm'' was supplemented with new envoys from among the [[Lithuanian nobility]]. The Commonwealth ensured that the state of affairs surrounding the three-estates system continued, with the ''Sejm'', Senate and King forming the estates and supreme deliberating body of the state. In the first few decades of the 16th century, the Senate had established its precedence over the ''Sejm''; however, from the mid-1500s onwards, the ''Sejm'' became a very powerful representative body of the ''[[szlachta]]'' (\"middle nobility\"). Its chambers reserved the final decisions in legislation, taxation, [[budget]], and [[treasury]] matters (including military funding), [[foreign policy]], and the [[Ennoblement|confirment of nobility]]. \n\nThe 1573 [[Warsaw Confederation]] saw the nobles of the ''Sejm'' officially sanction and guarantee [[religious tolerance]] in Commonwealth territory, ensuring a refuge for those fleeing the ongoing [[Protestant reformation|Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]] wars in Europe. \n\nUntil the end of the 16th century, [[unanimity]] was not required, and the [[majority voting|majority-voting]] process was the most commonly used system for voting. Later, with the rise of the [[Polish magnate]]s and their increasing power, the [[unanimity]] principle was re-introduced with the institution of the nobility's right of ''[[liberum veto]]'' ([[Latin]]: \"I freely forbid\"). Additionally, if the envoys were unable to reach a unanimous decision within six weeks (the time limit of a single session), deliberations were declared void and all previous acts passed by that ''Sejm'' were annulled. From the mid-17th century onward, any objection to a ''Sejm'' resolution, by either an envoy or a senator, automatically caused the rejection of other, previously approved resolutions. This was because all resolutions passed by a given session of the ''Sejm'' formed a whole resolution, and, as such, was published as the annual \"constituent act\" of the ''Sejm'', e.g. the \"''[[Anno Domini]]'' 1667\" act. In the 16th century, no single person or small group dared to hold up proceedings, but, from the second half of the 17th century, the ''liberum veto'' was used to virtually paralyze the ''Sejm'', and brought the Commonwealth to the brink of collapse. \n\nThe ''liberum veto'' was abolished with the adoption of Poland's [[May Constitution of Poland|3rd May Constitution]] in 1791, a piece of legislation which was passed as the \"Government Act\", and for which the ''Sejm'' required four years to propagate and adopt. The constitution's acceptance, and the possible long-term consequences it may have had, is arguably the reason for which the powers of [[Habsburg Austria]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] then decided to partition the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, thus putting an end to over 300 years of Polish parliamentary continuity. It is estimated that between 1493 and 1793, a ''Sejm'' was held 240 times, the total debate-time sum of which was 44 years.<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n===Partitions===\n[[File:Rejtan Upadek Polski Matejko.jpg|left|thumb|280px|[[Tadeusz Rejtan]] tries to prevent the legalisation of the [[Partitions of Poland|first partition of Poland]] by preventing the members of the ''Sejm'' from leaving the chamber (1773). [[Rejtan (painting)|Painting]] by [[Jan Matejko]]]]\nAfter the fall of the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], which existed as a [[Napoleon]]ic [[client state]] between 1807 and 1815, and its short-lived [[Sejm of the Duchy of Warsaw|''Sejm'' of the Duchy of Warsaw]], the [[Sejm of Congress Poland|''Sejm'' of Congress Poland]] was established in [[Congress Poland]] of the Russian Empire; it was composed of the king (the Russian emperor), the upper house (Senate), and the lower house (Chamber of Deputies). Overall, during the period from 1795 until the re-establishment of Poland's sovereignty in 1918, little power was actually held by any Polish legislative body and the occupying powers of Russia, Prussia (later united [[German Empire|Germany]]) and Austria propagated legislation for their own respective formerly-Polish territories at a national level.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n====Congress Poland====\n{{main|Sejm of Congress Poland}}\nThe Chamber of Deputies, despite its name, consisted not only of 77 envoys (sent by local assemblies) from the hereditary nobility, but also of 51 [[Chamber of Deputies|deputies]], elected by the non-noble population. All deputies were covered by [[Parliamentary immunity]], with each individual serving for a term of office of six years, with third of the deputies being elected every two years. Candidates for deputy had to be able to [[Literacy|read and write]], and have a certain amount of wealth. The legal voting age was 21, except for those citizens serving in the military, the personnel of which were not allowed to vote. Parliamentary sessions were initially convened every two years, and lasted for (at least) 30 days. However, after many clashes between liberal deputies and conservative government officials, sessions were later called only four times (1818, 1820, 1826, and 1830, with the last two sessions being secret). The ''Sejm'' had the right to call for votes on [[Common law|civil]] and [[Administrative law|administrative]] legal issues, and, with permission from the king, it could also vote on matters related to the [[fiscal policy]] and the military. It had the right to exercise control over government officials, and to file [[petition]]s. The 64-member Senate on the other hand, was composed of ''[[voivode]]s''  and ''[[Castellan|kasztelan]]s'' (both types of provincial governors), Russian \"[[Prince du Sang|princes of the blood]]\", and nine bishops. It acted as the Parliamentary Court, had the right to control \"citizens' books\", and had similar [[Legislature|legislative]] rights as did the Chamber of Deputies.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n====Germany and Austria-Hungary====\nIn the [[Free City of Cracow]] (1815\u20131846), a unicameral Assembly of Representatives was established, and from 1827, a unicameral [[Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Posen|provincial ''sejm'']] existed in the [[Grand Duchy of Pozna\u0144]]. Poles were elected to and represented the majority in both of these legislatures; however, they were largely powerless institutions and exercised only very limited power. After numerous failures in securing legislative sovereignty in the early 19th century, many Poles simply gave up trying to attain a degree of independence from their foreign master-states. In the [[Austrian partition]], a relatively powerless [[Sejm of the Estates|''Sejm'' of the Estates]] operated until the time of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Spring of Nations]]. After this, in the mid to late 19th century, only in autonomous [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (1861\u20131914) was there a unicameral and functional National ''Sejm'', the [[Sejm of the Land|''Sejm'' of the Land]]. It is recognised today as having played a major and overwhelming positive role in the development of Polish national institutions.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Poles were able to become members of the parliaments of Austria, Prussia and Russia, where they formed Polish Clubs. Deputies of Polish nationality were elected to the Prussian ''Landtag'' from 1848, and then to the [[German Empire]]'s ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' from 1871. Polish Deputies were members of the Austrian State Council (from 1867), and from 1906 were also elected to the Russian Imperial State ''Duma'' (lower chamber) and to the State Council (upper chamber).<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Second Polish Republic===\n[[File:Dubois w Sejmie. 1-A-849-4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stanis\u0142aw Dubois]] speaking to envoys and diplomats in the ''Sejm'', 1931]]\nAfter the [[First World War]] and re-establishment of Polish independence, the convocation of parliament, under the democratic electoral law of 1918, became an enduring symbol of the new state's wish to demonstrate and establish continuity with the 300-year Polish parliamentary traditions established before the time of the partitions. Maciej Rataj emphatically paid tribute to this with the phrase: \"There is Poland there, and so is the ''Sejm''\".\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] of Poland's independence, the first [[1919 Polish legislative election|Legislative ''Sejm'' of 1919]], a Constituent Assembly, passed the [[Small Constitution of 1919]], which introduced a [[parliamentary republic]] and proclaimed the principle of the ''Sejm'''s [[sovereignty]]. This was then strengthened, in 1921, by the [[March Constitution of Poland|March Constitution]], one of the most democratic European constitutions enacted after the end of World War I. The constitution established a political system which was based on [[Montesquieu]]'s doctrine of separation of powers, and which restored the bicameral ''Sejm'' consisting of a chamber of deputies (to which alone the name of \"''Sejm''\" was from then on applied) and the Senate. In 1919, [[Roza Pomerantz-Meltzer]], a member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] party, became the first woman ever elected to the ''Sejm''.<ref>{{cite book |title=God's Playground: A History of Poland |last=Davies |first=Norman |year=1982 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn= |page=302}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Hostages of Modernization: Studies on Modern Antisemitism, 1870-1933/39 |last=Strauss |first=Herbert Arthur |authorlink= |author2= |year=1993 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |location= |isbn= |page=985}}</ref>\n\nThe legal content of the March Constitution allowed for ''Sejm'' supremacy in the system of state institutions at the expense of the executive powers, thus creating a parliamentary republic out of the Polish state. An attempt to strengthen executive powers in 1926 (through the August Amendment) proved too limited and largely failed in helping avoid legislative grid-lock which had ensued as a result of too-great parliamentary power in a state which had numerous diametrically-opposed political parties sitting in its legislature. In 1935, the parliamentary republic was weakened further when, by way of, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]'s [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], the president was forced to sign the [[Polish Constitution of 1935|April Constitution of 1935]], an act through which the head of state assumed the dominant position in legislating for the state and the Senate increased its power at the expense of the ''Sejm''.\n\n[[File:Beck przem\u00f3wienie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[J\u00f3zef Beck]], Minister of Foreign Affairs, delivers his famous Honour Speech in the ''Sejm'', 5 May 1939.]]\nOn 2 September 1939, the ''Sejm'' held its final pre-war session, during which it declared Poland's readiness to defend itself against invading German forces. On 2 November 1939, the President dissolved the ''Sejm'' and the Senate, which were then, according to plan, to resume their activity within two months after the end of the Second World War; this, however, never happened. During wartime, the National Council (1939\u20131945) was established to represent the legislature as part of the [[Polish Government in Exile]]. Meanwhile, in [[Nazi-occupied Poland]], the Council of National Unity was set up; this body functioned from 1944 to 1945 as the parliament of the [[Polish Underground State]]. With the cessation of hostilities in 1945, and subsequent rise to power of the Communist-backed [[Provisional Government of National Unity]], the [[Second Polish Republic]] legally ceased to exist.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Polish People's Republic===\nThe ''Sejm'' in the [[Polish People's Republic]] had 460 deputies throughout most of its history. At first, this number was declared to represent one deputy per 60,000 citizens (425 were elected in 1952), but, in 1960, as the population grew, the declaration was changed: The constitution then stated that the deputies were representative ''of'' the people and could be recalled ''by'' the people, but this article was never used, and, instead of the \"[[five-point electoral law]]\", a non-proportional, \"four-point\" version was used. Legislation was passed with [[majority voting]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of the Polish People's Republic|1952 Constitution]], the Sejm was defined as \"the highest organ of State authority\" in Poland, as well as \"the highest spokesman of the will of the people in town and country.\" On paper, it was vested with great lawmaking and oversight powers. For instance, it was empowered with control over \"the functioning of other organs of State authority and administration,\" and ministers were required to answer questions posed by deputies within seven days.<ref name=PolandConstitutionChapter3>[http://libr.sejm.gov.pl/tek01/txt/kpol/e1952a-r3.html Chapter 3] of 1952 Constitution</ref> In practice, it did little more than rubber-stamp decisions already made by the Communist [[Polish United Workers Party]] and its executive bodies.<ref name=cs>[http://countrystudies.us/poland/80.htm Poland: a country study]. [[Library of Congress]] Federal Research Division, December 1989.</ref> This was standard practice in nearly all Communist regimes due to the principle of [[democratic centralism]].\n\nThe ''Sejm'' voted on the [[budget]] and on the periodic [[Planned economy|national plans]] that were a fixture of communist economies. The ''Sejm'' deliberated in sessions that were ordered to convene by the [[State Council of Poland|State Council]].\n\nThe ''Sejm'' also chose a ''[[Presidium|Prezydium]]'' (\"presiding body\") from among its members. The ''Prezydium'' was headed by the speaker, or [[Marshal of the Sejm|Marshal]], who was always a member of the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]]. In its preliminary session, the ''Sejm'' also nominated the [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]], the [[Council of Ministers of Poland]], and members of the State Council. It also chose many other government officials, including the head of the [[Supreme Audit Office (Poland)|Supreme Chamber of Control]] and members of the [[State Tribunal of Poland|State Tribunal]] and the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]], as well as the [[Polish Ombudsman|Ombudsman]] (the last three bodies of which were created in the 1980s).\n\nWhen the Sejm was not in session, the State Council had the power to issue decrees that had the force of law.

Monmouth's population in the 2011 census was 10,508, rising from 8,877 in 2001.\n\nThe town was the site of a small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] fort, [[Blestium]], and became established after the [[Normans]] built a [[Monmouth Castle|castle]] here after 1067.  Its [[mediaeval|medieval]] [[Monnow Bridge|stone gated bridge]] is the only one of its type remaining in Britain.

The town gained representation in the [[English Parliament]] at the same time, and its priory was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]].  In 1605, [[James I of England|James I]] granted Monmouth a [[town charter]] by [[letters patent]].

These crimes included theft of livestock, clothing, food, valuables, fuel (wood and coal); assault; vandalism; highway robbery; fraud; passing counterfeit coin; prostitution, and indecent exposure, as well as the more serious crimes of concealing the death of an infant, carnal knowledge without consent, and murder.  The constable would have been present in court at [[Monmouth Shire Hall|Shire Hall]] when many of these cases came before the [[Quarter Sessions]] or [[Assizes]].  Once the court had passed sentence there was a wide range of punishment available to the authorities. Capital offences were dealt with at [[Monmouth County Gaol]], as were whippings and sentences of hard labour.  Although a police force of four constables and a sergeant was established in Monmouth in 1836, uncertain finances meant that within two years the force was reduced to just two constables.<ref name=\"kissack making\"/>\n\nFour railways were built to serve Monmouth between 1857 and 1883: the [[Coleford, Monmouth, Usk and Pontypool Railway]], the [[Ross and Monmouth Railway]], the [[Wye Valley Railway]], and the [[Coleford Railway]].

The constable would have been present in court at [[Monmouth Shire Hall|Shire Hall]] when many of these cases came before the [[Quarter Sessions]] or [[Assizes]].  Once the court had passed sentence there was a wide range of punishment available to the authorities. Capital offences were dealt with at [[Monmouth County Gaol]], as were whippings and sentences of hard labour.

Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges, the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading awareness about their own script.\n\nMany Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].\n\nBetween 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in [[Manipur]].\n\nIt is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.\n\nThere are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.\n\n===Latin script===\nThere exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling, on the whole, offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is \"practical\" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can, therefore, be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /\u0250/ and /a/, which are usually both written \"a\", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as \"aa\" to distinguish it from /\u0250/.\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! IPA !!

Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S. Indrakumar |date=November 2013 |title=Agreements in Manipuri |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/nov2013/indrakumaragreementsmanipurifinal.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Noun (Meitei) !! Noun (English) !! Example (Meitei) !! Example (English)\n|-\n| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.\n|-\n| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.\n|}\n\nWhen adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun. Examples are show in the chart below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Adjective (Meitei) !! Adjective (English) !! Example (Meitei) !! Example (English)\n|-\n| ama || one || mi ama laak\u2019i || A person comes.\n|-\n| khara || some || mi khara laak\u2019i || Some persons come.\n|-\n| mayaam || many || mi mayaam laak\u2019i || Many persons come.\n|}\n\n=== Compound verbs ===\nCompound verbs are created by combining root verbs each ending with aspect markers. While the variety of suffixes is high, all compound verbs utilise one of two:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Devi |first1=M.

Suffix !! English translation\n|-\n| -thok|| out/ come out\n|-\n| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire\n|}\n\nAspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb. Overall, the formula to construct a compound verb becomes [root verb] + [suffix] + [aspect marker]:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Language !! Root verb !! Suffix !! Aspect marker !! Combined form\n|-\n| Meitei || tum || -thok || -le || tumthokle\n|-\n| English || sleep || out/ come out || perfect aspect || has started sleeping\n|-\n| Meitei || tum || -ning || -le || tumningle\n|-\n| English || sleep || want || perfect aspect || has felt sleepy\n|}\n\nCompound verbs can also be formed utilising both compound suffixes as well, allowing utterances such as ''pithokningle'' meaning \"want to give out\".\n\n==Number words==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Young children who do not know about the tales that have been passed on from generation to generation are very rare. Regarding the history behind the ancient use of [[proverb]]s that defines the way conversation is held with the Meitei language, it is a way of expressing and telling stories and even using modern slang with old proverbs to communicate between one another.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Betholia |first1=C. |date=August 2008 |title=Manipuri Culture Seen Through Proverbs |url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFL/article/view/111/883 |journal=Indian Folklife |issue=30 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref> \n\nThe Meitei language is known to be one of the oldest languages in [[Northeast India|northeastern India]] and has a lengthy 2000-year period of existence.

Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges, the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading awareness about their own script.\n\nMany Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].\n\nBetween 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in [[Manipur]].\n\nIt is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.\n\nThere are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.\n\n===Latin script===\nThere exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling, on the whole, offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is \"practical\" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can, therefore, be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /\u0250/ and /a/, which are usually both written \"a\", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as \"aa\" to distinguish it from /\u0250/.\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! IPA !!

Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S.

Example (English)\n|-\n| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.\n|-\n| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.\n|}\n\nWhen adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun.

English translation\n|-\n| -thok|| out/ come out\n|-\n| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire\n|}\n\nAspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb.

The pipelines are in significantly worse condition than those in other large networks nationwide, and there has been a recent history of serious failures.  The water supply to the region is also at significant risk during a severe earthquake, although some projects are underway to improve resilience.\n\nWater supplies to the Wellington urban area meet the requirements of the Health Act and conform with drinking water standards.  However, for some of the towns in the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa regions, there have been occasional non-conformances with the required standards for drinking water quality and safety.\n\nBenchmarking data published by Water New Zealand as part of their 2018/19 National Performance Review showed that capital expenditure on three waters assets in the Wellington urban area is well below the average of the expenditure on networks in most other major centres, and for the wastewater network, expenditure was the lowest out of the seven large networks in the review.\n<ref name=\"Capex\">{{cite web| url=https://www.waternz.org.nz/Category?Action=View&Category_id=1018| title= Annual capital expenditure per property connected to the network| publisher= Water New Zealand| accessdate=13 April 2020 }}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Drinking water==\n===Regional water supply networks===\nThe supply of reticulated drinking water is regulated under the Health Act, and suppliers are registered and subject to a testing regime.

There are two large storage lakes that can be used to supplement the supply during these periods.\n\n====Hutt River catchment====\nThe [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt river]] water supply catchment covers almost 9,000 hectares of bush-clad mountains and valleys at the southern edge of the [[Tararua Forest Park]] and adjoining the [[Kaitoke Regional Park]]. Rainwater from tributary streams flows into the Hutt River and is intercepted at a [[weir]] at [[Kaitoke]], north of [[Upper Hutt]].  The water is then strained to remove sticks, leaves and silt, and piped through tunnels to the [[Te Marua]] Water Treatment Plant. Up to 150 million litres of water per day may be diverted from the Hutt River, provided an adequate flow is maintained downstream of the weir. The Hutt water supply catchment provides about 40 percent of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\n====Macaskill storage lakes====\nThere are two large storage lakes at Te Marua \u2013 the Macaskill Lakes. These lakes are filled from the Hutt River intake when the water is clean and there is sufficient flow available. Stored water is pumped from the lakes into the treatment plant when there is not enough water in the river to meet public demand.  The storage lakes are also used to meet demand when the river is too dirty \u2013 after heavy rainfall \u2013 or when it is in flood and the intake is closed to prevent rocks and gravel from entering the intake pipes.\n\nThe Macaskill Lakes are 17.3 metres deep and have a combined usable capacity of approximately 3,350 million litres, or enough to meet average water use for around 23 days.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nBuilding the lakes was first proposed in 1975. The construction of the two lakes proved difficult because of weather and on-site conditions, resulting in cost increases and litigation.  There were also problems with leaks after completion, leading to further litigation.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Neill |first= Andrea |title= Upper Hutt lakes leak water and money |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |work= Stuff |location= |date= 30 June 2015|access-date= 7 April 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412011422/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wainuiomata/Orongorongo rivers====\nThe Wainuiomata/Orongorongo water supply catchment area lies within the [[Remutaka Range]]s to the east of [[Wainuiomata]]. The collection area covers 7,600 hectares. Five low dams (weirs) with intake pipes provide water from the rivers to the Wainuiomata Water Treatment Plant. These catchment areas provide approximately 20% of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\"/>\n\n====Waiwhetu aquifer====\nThe Waiwhetu [[artesian aquifer]] is a zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley. Water from the Hutt River starts to flow underground around Taita Gorge. From Melling southwards, the water becomes naturally pressurised beneath a layer of hard clay. This pressurised zone, the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, stretches as far south as the harbour. It is estimated to be up to 70 metres thick at its western edge against the Wellington fault line, and 20 metres thick at the eastern edge of the harbour. The pressure in the aquifer has resulted in several fresh water springs in the harbour floor.\n\nWater takes more than 12 months to pass through the aquifer to wells where it is extracted for distribution via the water network. Extraction is monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of [[saline intrusion]]. The Waiwhetu aquifer provides around 40 percent of the annual water supply.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street, [[Petone]] provides untreated water from the aquifer free to the public. \n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/\n| title= Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life)| publisher= Jackson Street Program| archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409022604/https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/|archive-date=9 April 2020| accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/petone_water.pdf| title= Hutt City \u2013 Petone's Artesian Water |publisher= Hutt City Council |date=13 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230407/http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/Petone_water.pdf|archive-date= 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Water sources for remaining areas===\n\nThe water sources for the South Wairarapa District Council area are the [[Waiohine River|Waiohine]] catchment for Featherston, the Kuratawhiti Street bore for Greytown residents, and the Herricks bore field for users in Martinborough. \n<ref name=\"SWDC\">{{cite web| url=https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage#water| title= Water and sewerage| publisher= South Wairarapa District Council | accessdate=7 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409085630/https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage |archive-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supplies for the Kapiti Coast region are sourced from combination of bores and surface water from the [[Waikanae]] River.\n<ref name=\"Kapiti_water\">{{cite web| url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/| title= Water supply| publisher= Kapiti Coast District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091317/https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supply for the Carterton district comes from the Kaipatangata Stream and two underground bores.\n<ref name=\"Carterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water | title= Water supply| publisher= Carterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091614/https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMasterton's drinking water is sourced Waingawa River, about 10&nbsp;km west of Masterton.\n<ref name=\"Masterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/| title= Services \u2013 Water| publisher= Masterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091846/https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/%7C |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Water treatment===\n====Wellington urban area====\nThere are four [[Water purification|water treatment]] plants located in the Hutt Valley (Te Marua, Waterloo, Gear Island and Wainuiomata).

The base case studies show that in a major earthquake, the Wellington region would be likely to lose its water supplies for a period of between 3 and 6 months, with treated water potentially not available for up to 12 months.  A wide range of risk mitigation projects were identified and included in modelling to show the potential improvements in resilience.  The risk mitigation projects included works to reduce the risk posed to the bulk water supply that runs parallel to the line of the main Wellington fault.  The modelling of outages indicates that the outage time would reduce to between one and three months, if all the identified risk mitigations were implemented.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project \u2013 Regional Resilience Report | publisher= Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe report called on its 16 member organisations to help deliver 25 key infrastructure projects across the region over the next two decades, at a cost of $5.3b.

This study estimated that for a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale earthquake, there would be about 30 breaks on the main trunk pipelines and 60 breaks on the smaller branch lines. There could be as many as 8,000 breaks in the Wellington City local supply network. Bulk water supply and treatment facilities are also expected to suffer damage requiring repair. Wellington Water and Greater Wellington Regional Council estimated that it would take around 60\u201070 days to restore bulk water supply to parts of the Wellington metropolitan area.It could take several years to fully repair damage to the local water distribution network resulting from a severe earthquake, as much of the network may have to be rebuilt.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215\n|title= Prince of Wales \u2013 Om\u0101roro Reservoir \u2013 Town Belt Easement Request \u2013 Includes Appendix A|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 1 June 2017|website= |publisher= Wellington Water |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412204753/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, an independent panel recommended that Wellington City Council confirm the designation of the easement for the reservoir.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir\n|title= Green light for Om\u0101roro/Prince of Wales Park reservoir|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 14 May 2018|website= |publisher= Wellington City Council |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412212844/https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe reservoir provides a significant increase in water storage for the city, and forms part of the city's resilience strategy to help ensure that fresh water is available to residents after a natural disaster or major network failure.\n\nPreparatory earthworks for the project commenced in February 2019.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Hunt|first=Tom |date= 5 February 2019|title=  Reservoir earthworks marks beginning of Wellington's Mt Cook becoming a 'building-site suburb'|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|work= Stuff|location= |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412010647/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stormwater==\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average stormwater pipeline age and condition across networks. The data for the Wellington Water network shows that 16% of the pipelines are in poor or very poor condition.  The Wellington stormwater network ranks the worst on this measure out of the six large networks nationwide.\n<ref name=\"Pipeline_condition\" />\nThe review also includes average pipeline age. The Wellington stormwater network has an average age of 49 years, and ranks as the second oldest of the six large networks.\n<ref name=\"Pipeline_age\" />\n\n==Wastewater==\nProperties in urban areas in the Wellington Region are generally all connected to a wastewater system via a [[gravity sewer]].  In some cases, pumps are used to pump wastewater to a treatment plant, or to lift wastewater from lower level drains into a higher elevation gravity sewer so that it can flow to a treatment plant. \n===Wellington urban area===\nWellington's population grew rapidly in the late 19th century after it became the capital city in 1865.\nThere were increasing cases of typhoid and cholera which were attributed to poor sanitation. In 1879 there were 75 deaths in Wellington from typhoid, diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles and cholera \u2013 mostly in the central Te Aro area. \n<ref>{{cite web| last= Roberts| first=Sofia|url=https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/wellingtons-unsightly-and-smelly-past/| title= Wellington\u2019s unsightly and smelly past | publisher= Museums Wellington| accessdate=14 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200414015917/https://www.museumswellington.org.nz/wellingtons-unsightly-and-smelly-past/| archive-date=14 April 2020 }}</ref>\nAfter some political deliberation, construction of a city wastewater network began in 1893. It cost \u00a3175,000 and was completed by 1899.\n\n====The interceptor====\nAs part of the early development of the wastewater network, a large pipe was constructed to take wastewater from Manners St through Mt Victoria and out to an ocean outfall at Moa Point on the south coast.  This main trunk wastewater line was known as \"the interceptor\". In the 1930s the interceptor was extended from Manners St through to Pipitea St, as the city's population topped 100,000.\nAs suburbs spread further north to [[Johnsonville, New Zealand|Johnsonville]], another extension of the interceptor was made from [[Ngauranga Gorge]] and through [[Ngaio, New Zealand|Ngaio]] Gorge to connect at [[Thorndon, New Zealand|Thorndon]].\n<ref name=\u201dinterceptor\u201d>{{cite news| last= Campbell| first=Georgina |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12313567| title= Severe corrosion discovered in critical Wellington wastewater pipe| publisher= NZ Herald| date=4 March 2020|accessdate=14 April 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200414012313/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12313567| archive-date=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wastewater treatment====\nThere are four [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plants serving the Wellington urban area.\nTogether, they treat about 150 million litres of wastewater on a typical day, using biological and ultraviolet treatment processes. The treated water is discharged to the sea. The sludge resulting from filtration and treatment is de-watered (with this water further treated) and the solid content is sent to landfills.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.learnz.org.nz/water172/bg-standard-f/wastewater/| title= Wastewater | publisher= LEARNZ| accessdate=14 April 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200414020034/http://www.learnz.org.nz/water172/bg-standard-f/wastewater/|archive-date=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/wastewater/where-does-wastewater-go/| title= Where does wastewater go| publisher= Wellington Water| accessdate=14 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200414020137/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/your-water/wastewater/where-does-wastewater-go/|archive-date=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Moa Point====\nThe Moa Point treatment plant handles all the wastewater from most of Wellington city, other than Karori and some northern suburbs.

The pipelines are 9&nbsp;km long and are about 25 years old.  There are two in parallel allowing one to operate while maintenance can occur on the other pipe.  In this incident both pipes failed at the same time.  \n\nTo avoid discharging the sludge into the ocean, a fleet of sewage trucks was mobilized to carry about one million litres of sludge a day to the dewatering plant at Carey\u2019s Gully. Up to 150 round trips each day were required, with trucks sometimes operating around the clock to keep up with the volume. \n\nThe break in the pipelines was located 200&nbsp;m inside a sewage tunnel beneath Mt Albert, making repairs a significant challenge. The repair solution required the manufacture in Germany of a custom-made polyester woven liner.  This liner was winched from one end of each pipe to the other, and then expanded to essentially act as a new pipeline within the old one.  Specialists from the manufacturer flew to New Zealand to assist in the installation, but were required to spend 14 days in isolation because of the border restrictions imposed in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic]].\n<ref>{{cite news| last= Thomas | first= Rachel |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge| title= Broken Mt Albert sewer tunnel pipe: Costly effort to divert millions of litres of sludge| work= RNZ| date=24 January 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415014537/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell|first=Georgina|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739| title= Coronavirus: Major Wellington wastewater pipe repairs delayed| work= NZ Herald| date=21 March 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415035134/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739 | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088 | title= Six German experts will fix broken sludge pipeline next month | work= Scoop| date=5 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415021810/http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088| archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n====South Wairarapa====\nAlmost half a million litres of partially and fully treated wastewater was discharged into the [[Ruamahanga River]] near Martinborough in two incidents in January 2020, as a result of issues at a treatment plant.

The pipelines are in significantly worse condition than those in other large networks nationwide, and there has been a recent history of serious failures.  The water supply to the region is also at significant risk during a severe earthquake, although some projects are underway to improve resilience.\n\nWater supplies to the Wellington urban area meet the requirements of the Health Act and conform with drinking water standards.

There are two large storage lakes that can be used to supplement the supply during these periods.\n\n====Hutt River catchment====\nThe [[Hutt River (New Zealand)|Hutt river]] water supply catchment covers almost 9,000 hectares of bush-clad mountains and valleys at the southern edge of the [[Tararua Forest Park]] and adjoining the [[Kaitoke Regional Park]]. Rainwater from tributary streams flows into the Hutt River and is intercepted at a [[weir]] at [[Kaitoke]], north of [[Upper Hutt]].  The water is then strained to remove sticks, leaves and silt, and piped through tunnels to the [[Te Marua]] Water Treatment Plant. Up to 150 million litres of water per day may be diverted from the Hutt River, provided an adequate flow is maintained downstream of the weir. The Hutt water supply catchment provides about 40 percent of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\n====Macaskill storage lakes====\nThere are two large storage lakes at Te Marua \u2013 the Macaskill Lakes. These lakes are filled from the Hutt River intake when the water is clean and there is sufficient flow available. Stored water is pumped from the lakes into the treatment plant when there is not enough water in the river to meet public demand.  The storage lakes are also used to meet demand when the river is too dirty \u2013 after heavy rainfall \u2013 or when it is in flood and the intake is closed to prevent rocks and gravel from entering the intake pipes.\n\nThe Macaskill Lakes are 17.3 metres deep and have a combined usable capacity of approximately 3,350 million litres, or enough to meet average water use for around 23 days.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nBuilding the lakes was first proposed in 1975. The construction of the two lakes proved difficult because of weather and on-site conditions, resulting in cost increases and litigation.  There were also problems with leaks after completion, leading to further litigation.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= O'Neill |first= Andrea |title= Upper Hutt lakes leak water and money |url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |work= Stuff |location= |date= 30 June 2015|access-date= 7 April 2020 | archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412011422/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/69822534/upper-hutt-lakes-leak-water-and-money---150-years-of-news |archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Wainuiomata/Orongorongo rivers====\nThe Wainuiomata/Orongorongo water supply catchment area lies within the [[Remutaka Range]]s to the east of [[Wainuiomata]]. The collection area covers 7,600 hectares. Five low dams (weirs) with intake pipes provide water from the rivers to the Wainuiomata Water Treatment Plant. These catchment areas provide approximately 20% of the water used in the Wellington urban area each year.<ref name=\"Sources\"/>\n\n====Waiwhetu aquifer====\nThe Waiwhetu [[artesian aquifer]] is a zone of water-retaining sand, gravel and boulders beneath the Hutt Valley. Water from the Hutt River starts to flow underground around Taita Gorge. From Melling southwards, the water becomes naturally pressurised beneath a layer of hard clay. This pressurised zone, the Waiwhetu artesian aquifer, stretches as far south as the harbour. It is estimated to be up to 70 metres thick at its western edge against the Wellington fault line, and 20 metres thick at the eastern edge of the harbour. The pressure in the aquifer has resulted in several fresh water springs in the harbour floor.\n\nWater takes more than 12 months to pass through the aquifer to wells where it is extracted for distribution via the water network. Extraction is monitored and controlled to minimise the risk of [[saline intrusion]]. The Waiwhetu aquifer provides around 40 percent of the annual water supply.<ref name=\"Sources\" />\n\nThe Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life) in Buick Street, [[Petone]] provides untreated water from the aquifer free to the public. \n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/\n| title= Te Puna Wai Ora (Spring of Life)| publisher= Jackson Street Program| archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409022604/https://www.jacksonstreet.co.nz/listing/te-puna-wai-ora-spring-of-life/|archive-date=9 April 2020| accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/petone_water.pdf| title= Hutt City \u2013 Petone's Artesian Water |publisher= Hutt City Council |date=13 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513230407/http://www.huttvalleynz.com/upload/documents/Petone_water.pdf|archive-date= 5 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Water sources for remaining areas===\n\nThe water sources for the South Wairarapa District Council area are the [[Waiohine River|Waiohine]] catchment for Featherston, the Kuratawhiti Street bore for Greytown residents, and the Herricks bore field for users in Martinborough. \n<ref name=\"SWDC\">{{cite web| url=https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage#water| title= Water and sewerage| publisher= South Wairarapa District Council | accessdate=7 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200409085630/https://www.swdc.govt.nz/water-and-sewerage |archive-date=9 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supplies for the Kapiti Coast region are sourced from combination of bores and surface water from the [[Waikanae]] River.\n<ref name=\"Kapiti_water\">{{cite web| url=https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/| title= Water supply| publisher= Kapiti Coast District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091317/https://www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/services/a-z-council-services-and-facilities/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nWater supply for the Carterton district comes from the Kaipatangata Stream and two underground bores.\n<ref name=\"Carterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water | title= Water supply| publisher= Carterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091614/https://cdc.govt.nz/services/water/ |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMasterton's drinking water is sourced Waingawa River, about 10&nbsp;km west of Masterton.\n<ref name=\"Masterton_water\">{{cite web| url=https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/| title= Services \u2013 Water| publisher= Masterton District Council | accessdate=10 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200410091846/https://mstn.govt.nz/services/water-services/%7C |archive-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Water treatment===\n====Wellington urban area====\nThere are four [[Water purification|water treatment]] plants located in the Hutt Valley (Te Marua, Waterloo, Gear Island and Wainuiomata).

The base case studies show that in a major earthquake, the Wellington region would be likely to lose its water supplies for a period of between 3 and 6 months, with treated water potentially not available for up to 12 months.  A wide range of risk mitigation projects were identified and included in modelling to show the potential improvements in resilience.  The risk mitigation projects included works to reduce the risk posed to the bulk water supply that runs parallel to the line of the main Wellington fault.  The modelling of outages indicates that the outage time would reduce to between one and three months, if all the identified risk mitigations were implemented.\n<ref>{{cite web| url=https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf| title= Wellington Lifelines Project \u2013 Regional Resilience Report | publisher= Wellington Region Emergency Management Office| date= Oct 2019| accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200411040711/https://wremo.nz/assets/Uploads/Wellington-Lifelines-PBC-MAIN-Combined-20191009.pdf |archive-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe report called on its 16 member organisations to help deliver 25 key infrastructure projects across the region over the next two decades, at a cost of $5.3b.

This study estimated that for a magnitude 7.5 Richter scale earthquake, there would be about 30 breaks on the main trunk pipelines and 60 breaks on the smaller branch lines. There could be as many as 8,000 breaks in the Wellington City local supply network. Bulk water supply and treatment facilities are also expected to suffer damage requiring repair. Wellington Water and Greater Wellington Regional Council estimated that it would take around 60\u201070 days to restore bulk water supply to parts of the Wellington metropolitan area.It could take several years to fully repair damage to the local water distribution network resulting from a severe earthquake, as much of the network may have to be rebuilt.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215\n|title= Prince of Wales \u2013 Omaroro Reservoir \u2013 Town Belt Easement Request \u2013 Includes Appendix A|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 1 June 2017|website= |publisher= Wellington Water |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412204753/https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/dmsdocument/215|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, an independent panel recommended that Wellington City Council confirm the designation of the easement for the reservoir.\n<ref>{{cite web |url= https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir\n|title= Green light for Om\u0101roro/Prince of Wales Park reservoir|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 14 May 2018|website= |publisher= Wellington City Council |access-date= 12 April 2020|quote= |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412212844/https://wellington.govt.nz/your-council/news/2018/05/prince-of-wales-park-reservoir|archive-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe reservoir provides a significant increase in water storage for the city, and forms part of the city's resilience strategy to help ensure that fresh water is available to residents after a natural disaster or major network failure.\n\nPreparatory earthworks for the project commenced in February 2019.\n<ref>{{cite news |last= Hunt|first=Tom |date= 5 February 2019|title=  Reservoir earthworks marks beginning of Wellington's Mt Cook becoming a 'building-site suburb'|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|work= Stuff|location= |access-date=12 April 2020 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200412010647/https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/110374164/reservoir-earthworks-marks-beginning-of-wellingtons-mt-cook-becoming-a-buildingsite-suburb|archive-date=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stormwater==\n\n===Pipeline age and condition===\nThe 2018/19 National Performance Review published by Water New Zealand compares the average stormwater pipeline age and condition across networks.

The pipelines are 9&nbsp;km long and are about 25 years old.  There are two in parallel allowing one to operate while maintenance can occur on the other pipe.  In this incident both pipes failed at the same time.  \n\nTo avoid discharging the sludge into the ocean, a fleet of sewage trucks was mobilized to carry about one million litres of sludge a day to the dewatering plant at Carey\u2019s Gully. Up to 150 round trips each day were required, with trucks sometimes operating around the clock to keep up with the volume. \n\nThe break in the pipelines was located 200&nbsp;m inside a sewage tunnel beneath Mt Albert, making repairs a significant challenge. The repair solution required the manufacture in Germany of a custom-made polyester woven liner.  This liner was winched from one end of each pipe to the other, and then expanded to essentially act as a new pipeline within the old one.  Specialists from the manufacturer flew to New Zealand to assist in the installation, but were required to spend 14 days in isolation because of the border restrictions imposed in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand|COVID-19 pandemic]].\n<ref>{{cite news| last= Thomas | first= Rachel |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge| title= Broken Mt Albert sewer tunnel pipe: Costly effort to divert millions of litres of sludge| work= RNZ| date=24 January 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415014537/https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/408078/broken-mt-albert-sewer-tunnel-pipe-costly-effort-to-divert-millions-of-litres-of-sludge | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news |last=Campbell|first=Georgina|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739| title= Coronavirus: Major Wellington wastewater pipe repairs delayed| work= NZ Herald| date=21 March 2020 |accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415035134/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12318739 | archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088 | title= Six German experts will fix broken sludge pipeline next month | work= Scoop| date=5 April 2020|accessdate=15 April 2020 | archive-url= http://web.archive.org/web/20200415021810/http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=127088| archive-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n====South Wairarapa====\nAlmost half a million litres of partially and fully treated wastewater was discharged into the [[Ruamahanga River]] near Martinborough in two incidents in January 2020, as a result of issues at a treatment plant.

Thus his grave is lost.\n\n==Compositions==\n[[File:Morley It was a lover and his lass performed by D W Solomons.ogg|thumb|Recorded performance of \"It was a lover and his lass\"]]\nThomas Morley's compositions include (in alphabetical order):\n{{clear}}\n<div style=\"{{column-count|3}}\">\n* [[April is in my mistress' face]]\n* Arise, get up my deere\n* Cease mine eyes\n* Come, lovers, follow me\n* Come, Sorrow, come\n* Crewell you pull away to soone\n* Christes crosse\n* Do you not know?\n* Fair in a morn\n* Fantasia for keyboard, [[Fitzwilliam Virginal Book]] CXXIV\n* Fantasie: Il Doloroso\n* Fantasie: Il Grillo\n* Fantasie: Il Lamento\n* Fantasie: La Caccia\n* Fantasie: La Rondinella\n* Fantasie: La Sampogna\n* Fantasie: La Sirena\n* Fantasie: La Tortorella\n* Fire Fire My Heart\n* Flora wilt thou torment mee\n* Fyre and Lightning\n* Goe yee my canzonets\n* Good Morrow, Fair Ladies of the May\n* Harke Alleluia!\n* Hould out my hart\n* I goe before my darling\n* I saw my Lady weeping\n* I should for griefe and anguish\n* In nets of golden wyers\n* It was a lover and his lass\n* Joy, joy doth so arise\n* Joyne hands\n* La Caccia \"The Chase\"\n* La Girandola\n* Ladie, those eies\n* Lady if I through griefe\n* Leave now mine eyes\n* Lo hear another love\n* Love learns by laughing\n* Miraculous loves wounding\n* Mistress mine\n* [[My bonny lass she smileth]]\n* Nolo mortem peccatoris\n* [[Now is the month of maying]]\n* O Mistresse mine\n* O thou that art so cruell\n* A painted tale\n* Say deere, will you not have me?\n* See, see, my own sweet jewel\n* Shepard's Rejoice\n* Sing we and chant it\n* Sleep, slumb'ring eyes\n* Sweet nymph\n* Thirsis and Milla\n* Those dainty daffadillies\n* Though Philomela lost her love [[Oxford Book of English Madrigals]]\n* 'Tis the time of Yuletide Glee\n* Good morrow, Fayre Ladies of the May\n* Well Hall\n* What is it that this dark night\n* What ayles my darling?\n* When loe by break of morning\n* Where art thou wanton?\n* Will you buy a fine dog?<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=326dAst_Lj8]</ref>\n* With my love my life was nestled\n</div>\n=== Sacred music ===\n* The First Service\n* How long wilt thou forget me?\n* The Burial Service\n* De profundis clamavi\n* Eheu sustulerunt domine\n* Domine, non est exultarem cor meum\n* Domine, dominus noster\n* O amica mea\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Triumphs of Oriana]] edited by Morley, published in 1601.\n\n== References and further reading ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Gustave Reese]], ''Music in the Renaissance''.

On the day they were going to elope, Erik abducts her during a performance of ''[[Faust]]'' at the opera house. Raoul then, along with the mysterious man known only as [[The Persian]], goes down into the cellars of the Opera in an attempt to rescue Christine.  He and the Persian endure near-drowning and torture in a mirrored, super-heated chamber before Erik eventually relents due to Christine's willingness to sacrifice her happiness for Raoul's life.  Raoul nearly commits suicide under torture, and, when Christine's marriage promise to Erik saves them, has to be put to bed by Erik because of a poison that has left him \"limp as a rag.\"\n\nIn Gaston Leroux's novel, ''The Phantom of the Opera'', Raoul is described as having a 'small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes, and a complexion like a girl's and an air of \"just having left the women's apron-strings.\"'\nHis elder brother and former guardian, Comte Philippe de Chagny, is a man of the world who indulges in dalliances with the Opera's ballerinas and is exasperated by his brother's attachment to \"the little baggage\" Christine.

With the introduction of Vostro, the Dimension line was discontinued, and the Inspiron line changed to include all computers for the home market; regardless of form factor. One marked difference between the Inspiron line and the Vostro line is that the Vostro line is cheaper but comes with shorter technical availability.\n\n== Temporary discontinuation ==\n\nIn July 2013, Dell announced that they would stop manufacturing all Dell Vostro systems. Select models were made available on various Dell outlet channels for a limited time. The discontinuation of Vostro models was reportedly because of changing technology and lesser demand in the corporate world.

In 2013, the line was discontinued on some Dell websites but continued to be offered in other markets, such as [[Malaysia]].\n\nPrior to Vostro, Dell's home and small business computers were sold under the same lines: Dimension for home and small business desktops, and Inspiron for home and small business portables. With the introduction of Vostro, the Dimension line was discontinued, and the Inspiron line changed to include all computers for the home market; regardless of form factor. One marked difference between the Inspiron line and the Vostro line is that the Vostro line is cheaper but comes with shorter technical availability.\n\n== Temporary discontinuation ==\n\nIn July 2013, Dell announced that they would stop manufacturing all Dell Vostro systems. Select models were made available on various Dell outlet channels for a limited time. The discontinuation of Vostro models was reportedly because of changing technology and lesser demand in the corporate world. Subsequently, the Vostro was resurrected onto the market in early 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/vostro-3900-mini-tower/pd|title=Vostro 3900 \u2014 Reliable and Expandable Desktop {{!}} Dell United States|website=www.dell.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\n== Current laptops line ==\n\nThe current lineup of Vostro laptops includes Vostro 3000 series that was released on March 9, 2010, Vostro 14 5000 series that was released on October 13, 2015 and Vostro 15 5000 series released on January 20, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://technave.com/gadget/Dell-Malaysia-announces-XPS-Inspiron-and-Vostro-with-6th-Generation-Intel-Core-and-Windows-10-5787.html|title=Dell Malaysia announces XPS, Inspiron and Vostro with 6th Generation Intel Core and Windows 10 {{!}} TechNave|website=TechNave|access-date=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\nPlease note, that this list may be incomplete and some of the models that are currently being offered in some markets may be missing.\n\n=== Vostro 13 ===\n\n==== Vostro 13 (5370) ====\n\n=== Vostro 14 ===\nThe Vostro 14 5000 is a laptop line with a 14-inch display.\n\n==== Vostro 14 5000 (5459) ====\nThe Vostro 14 5000 is a laptop with a 14-inch display aimed at small business.
