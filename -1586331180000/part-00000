{"title_page": "Professional wrestling match types", "text_new": "{{short description|Various types of matches used in wrestling}}\nMany '''types of wrestling matches''', sometimes called \"concept\" or \"[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]] matches\" in the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms|jargon of the business]], are performed in [[professional wrestling]]. Some of them occur relatively frequently while others are developed so as to advance an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] and such match types are used rarely. Because of [[History of professional wrestling|professional wrestling's long history]] over decades, many things have been recycled (many match types often being variations of previous match types). These match types can be organized into several loose groups.\n\n== Singles matches{{anchor|Variations of singles matches|Singles match}} ==\nThe singles match is the most basic of all professional wrestling matches, which involves only two competitors competing for one [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Fall|fall]]. Victory is obtained by [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]], [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]], [[Professional wrestling#Knockout|knockout]], [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] or [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].\n\n== Team matches ==\n{{main|Professional wrestling tag team match types}}\nMatches are often contested between two (or more) teams, most often consisting of two members each.\n\n=== Tag team match ===\nOn most occasions, one member of the team competes in the ring with one or more of his or her teammates standing behind the ropes. Wrestlers switch positions by \"tagging\" one another, usually similar to a [[high five]] and, as a result, these teams are referred to as [[tag team]]s. This can create tension during the match as an injured wrestler in the middle of the ring attempts to reach his or her teammates, often with the heel team preventing them from doing so. In typical tag team matches, standard wrestling rules apply with a match ending by pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification.\n\nPromotions usually have established tag teams that most often compete in team matches rather than singles matches, though teams will often break up to pursue a singles career, usually via a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]]. Teams often consist of real-life friends or relatives. On other occasions, teams are booked together by promoters based on their face or heel alignment in order to increase the amount of wrestlers on the card or to advance multiple storylines at once.\n\nPromotions usually have a tag team championship for a team of two wrestlers, and on rare occasion allies of the reigning tag team will be allowed to defend the title in the place of one of the reigning wrestlers under the [[The Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|Freebird rule]]. Though common in Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'', at one point, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) had a championship for [[WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship|teams of three]].\n\nWWE also can have three (triple threat) or four (fatal four-way) tag teams going against each other.<ref>{{Citation|last=WWE|title=Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins vs Sheamus & Cesaro vs Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson: Raw, Sept. 18, 2017|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKiZWR7QN8|accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Tornado tag team match ===\nMatches in which the entire team competes at once is often referred to as a tornado tag match, specifically in WWE. Matches can be held under standard rules or as a specialty match, such as a steel cage match or a [[ladder match]]. (If it is a title match and one team DQs the titles will not change unless one of the members of that team has been eliminated then the titles will change hands)\n\n=== Elimination tag team match ===\nTag team matches are occasionally held under elimination rules; that is, the losing wrestler is eliminated from the match, but his/her team is allowed to continue with their remaining members until all members of one team is eliminated.\n\nOne famous example of this match is the [[Survivor Series]] match held in WWE at their annual Survivor Series pay-per-view. Teams of four or five, though on some occasions as many as seven, compete under elimination rules. All other standard rules apply, and team members may tag in and out in any order. While some teams are already established [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]], others may need to recruit members for their team.\n\nIn ''lucha libre'' promotions, a ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' is a similar type of match between teams of up to eight wrestlers who enter in a predetermined order.\n\n== Winner takes all match ==\nA winner takes all match is a match in which both wrestlers (or teams if a tag team match) are champions going into the match, and the winner receives the championship of the loser, thus \"taking all\".<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/titlehistory/united-states-championship U.S. Championship - WWE.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2008/matches/7793948 |title=Summerslam 2008 Winner Take All Match - WWE.com |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106013126/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2008/matches/7793948 |archive-date=2015-11-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis is different than a championship unification match, where one championship is absorbed into the other and retired/deactivated.  In a Winner Take All scenario, both titles are still active and defended as separate entities.\n\n== Empty arena match ==\nAn empty arena match is a [[hardcore match]] between two or more wrestlers that takes place in an arena devoid of fans. The only people present are the competitors, [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]], commentators, and cameramen. The match is broadcast, or videotaped and played later. An example of this is the WWF championship match between [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] that took place in [[Tucson, Arizona]], at the [[Tucson Convention Center]], which aired as part of a special [[Halftime Heat]] edition of ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'' aired [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|counterprogramming the Super Bowl]] halftime show of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] in 1999.

Usually, the \"opposing\" lumberjacks (that is, face lumberjacks if the wrestler is a heel, and vice versa) swarm the wrestlers if they leave the ring and force them back in it. Occasional interference from the lumberjacks is not uncommon, or is an all-out brawl on the outside involving most of the lumberjacks. Early lumberjack matches even featured the lumberjacks wearing stereotypical [[lumberjack]] clothing in keeping with the lumberjack theme, though this is generally no longer done. A common theme is for the lumberjacks to consist entirely of heel wrestlers to stack the odds against the face competitor.\n\nVariations of this match include the \"Canadian\" lumberjack match, in which the lumberjacks are equipped with [[Belt (clothing)|leather straps]], the \"extreme\" lumberjack match, competed under [[Hardcore wrestling|extreme]] rules, and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]]'s \"fan's revenge\" lumberjack match, during which fans equipped with straps act as lumberjacks and are encouraged to whip wrestlers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/tnaimpact/060907.html|title=TNA iMPACT! results \u2013 September 7, 2006|date=2006-09-07|accessdate=2007-06-22|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=Jim Cornette said he would pick out 10, 12 or 18 TNA fans to act as Lumbjacks with a leather strap. ...

Such a match can also be known as a street fight. \n\nNo-disqualification matches may be used in feuds in which a challenger may have won matches against the champion, but did not claim the championship because the champion was disqualified (championships usually only change hands via pinfall or submission).\n\nUnless stipulated, a no-disqualification match can end in a countout. Those that cannot are no-disqualification, no-countout matches.\n\nAnother variant of a no disqualification match is a non-sanctioned match or unsanctioned match, also called a lights out match. In this variation, there are no rules (with the exception of the pinfall or submission) and the match is not officially recognized by the promotion (such as in [[All Elite Wrestling]], where the match does not count towards a wrestler's win-loss record). In kayfabe, the match is sometimes used when a wrestler is \"injured\" (at the hands of another wrestler) and wants revenge but can't be \"medically cleared\"; thus he agrees to a non-sanctioned match where \"the promotion is not held liable\" for any injuries.\n\n=== Taipei Deathmatch ===\nIn a [[Taipei]] deathmatch the wrestlers' fists are taped and dipped into glue and in broken and crushed glass, allowing shards to stick to their fists. Win by pinfall, submission or escape.<ref name=\"DMs\" /><ref name=taip>{{cite book|title=[[Hardcore History|Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW]]|author=Scott E.

Made popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s by small American wrestling leagues, as well as overseas Japanese promotions during the 1990s.\n\n== Submission match ==\nA submission match is typically a match in which pinfalls, count-outs and disqualifications are not legal and the match could only end by making an opponent tap out to a submission hold. A very famous variation of this match is an [[\"I quit\" match]] in which a wrestler has to beat their opponent and force them to say \"I quit\"..\n\n== Stipulation-based variations ==\nAs professional wrestling seeks to also tell a story, some matches are made solely for the purposes of advancing the plot. This typically involves the loser of a match being penalized in some way.\n\n=== Scaffold match{{anchor|Elevation X|Elevation X match}} ===\nIn a Scaffold match whoever falls off the scaffold is declared the loser. A variation named \"elevation X\", uses a scaffold in the shape of the letter ''X''.\n\n=== Last Chance match ===\nA last chance match, also called a \"do or die\" match, is a [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]] match in which the challenger, if he does not win the title, is banned from challenging for it again as long as that reigning champion holds it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/vengeance07.html|title=Vengeance 2007 results|accessdate=2007-07-14|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705145432/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/vengeance07.html|archive-date=2007-07-05|url-status=live}}</ref> Rarely, the loser may even be barred from challenging for that title for as long as they remain employed at the company. (Examples of this are [[Slammiversary XI]], when [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] was defeated by defending champion [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Bully Ray]] in a no holds barred variant of this match and was barred from challenging for the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] again no matter who held it, [[AEW Full Gear]],  where [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]] was defeated by defending champion [[Chris Jericho]] and is thereby barred  from challenging for the [[AEW World Championship]] ever again, and the debut episode of [[NWA Power]], where [[Tim Storm]] was barred from challenging for the [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship]] ever again as a result of losing to [[Nick Aldis]]).\n\n=== Loser Leaves Town match ===\n\"Loser leaves town\" is a generic term for any match in which the loser has to leave the current [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] or sub-division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/11/10/1301232.html|title=Jeff Black: Goderich's hometown hero|accessdate=2008-03-05|publisher=[[Canoe.ca|SLAM!

A similar variation of this match is the kiss my ass match, which the loser has to kiss the winner's [[buttocks|bare buttocks]] and was prominently held during WWE's Attitude Era.\n\n=== ''Luchas de apuestas'' ===\n''Luchas de apuestas'' (literally \"gambling fights\") are matches in which both wrestlers wager something specific (the [[Lucha libre#Masks|mask]] or hair) on the outcome. The loser of the match then loses the item, being forced to take off their mask or be [[head shaving|shaved bald]].

Among notable wrestlers who have lost such matches, [[Gorgeous George]], [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Molly Holly]], and [[CM Punk]] were all heels when on the losing end of hair vs. hair matches.\n\nWhile most wrestlers (especially female wrestlers) end up growing their hair back out, in some cases the wrestler may tend to keep a [[Head shaving|shaved head]] as part of their look. For instance, Angle's [[kayfabe]] explanation was that he could not regrow it despite using [[Minoxidil|Rogaine]], [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]], and even [[fertilizer]]. In reality, he was already [[Androgenic alopecia|going bald naturally]], with many jokes about his receding hair line having been made on TV long before his head was shaved; his wife, [[Karen Jarrett|Karen]], had wanted Angle to shave his head.

Two holiday themed variants also include specially themed weapons for the day in question.\n\n==== Trick or Street Fight ====\nA Trick or Street fight is a Halloween-themed match, named after the Halloween tradition \"trick or treating\", involving Halloween-themed weapons including pumpkins, buckets of candy, bowls full of water and apples, skeletons, witches' brooms, gravestones, candy cane themed kendo sticks, plus common wrestling weapons such as tables and chairs.\n\n==== Miracle on 34th Street Fight ====\nA Miracle on a 34th Street Fight is a Christmas-themed match, named after the movie ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', involving Christmas-themed weapons including fire extinguishers, pumpkin pies, presents, Christmas trees, Christmas wreaths, candy cane themed kendo sticks, bowling balls, and teddy bears, plus common wrestling weapons such as tables and chairs.\n\n=== Parking Lot Brawl ===\nTwo types of matches take place in parking lots, the parking lot brawl<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/nitro/1996.html|title=Year-by-year Nitro results (1996)|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=April 29, 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629234554/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/nitro/1996.html|archive-date=2007-06-29|url-status=live}}</ref> and the iron circle match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20060303.shtml|title=Fully Loaded 1999 results|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online Onslaught|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514062518/http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20060303.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-14}}</ref> They are essentially the same thing, two wrestlers fighting in a parking lot, the major difference being the iron circle match takes place in the middle of a multitude of cars parked in a circle with their headlights on, while the parking lot brawl tends to be in a sparser location.

First one to pinfall or submission is the winner.\n\n== Weapon-based variations ==\nThrough the use of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|foreign objects]], the matches generally take the name of the weapon being used (\"[[Shinai|Singapore cane]] match\", \"[[Chair]]s match\"). In the following list of weapon-based matches additional rules have supplanted or replaced the standard rules.\n\n=== Crazy 8 match ===\nThe Crazy 8 match, used mostly in the defunct Pro Wrestling Unplugged promotion, involves placing a championship belt at the top of a scaffold with the first wrestler to retrieve it being declared the winner.

The most common way of winning is by simply escaping the cage, either over the top of the cage wall and having both feet touch the arena floor, or by escaping through the cage door with both feet touching the arena floor. The other occasional ways to win a steel cage match are by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]], by submission, though these are less common stipulations in the modern era, an even less likely stipulation is that weapons can be thrown into the ring by the wrestlers' managers.\n\nIt is possible to have one wrestler attempting to escape over the top of the cage wall while another tries to escape through the cage door.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDREFBcDJ8 |title=Cage Match: Kurt Angle vs. Bobby Roode (January 23, 2014) |access-date=2016-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316182656/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDREFBcDJ8 |archive-date=2016-03-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> In [[Mexico]], steel cage matches are won by just climbing to the top of the cage wall. In [[Impact Wrestling]]'s past, the matches were often called \"six sides of steel\" as the cage surrounded their six-sided ring. In [[All Elite Wrestling]], steel cage matches are won by pinfall or submission.\n\n=== Chamber match ===\nIn TNA, this match was between two wrestlers (or up to 6) fighting inside a chamber.  Wrestlers who were not involved in the match surrounded the chamber. About 5 minutes into the match, the outside wrestlers throw weapons into the chamber. This match only ends when one wrestler knocks out his opponent.\n\n=== Scramble cage match ===\nThe match, exclusively in [[Ring of Honor|Ring of Honor wrestling]] (ROH), in which the ring is surrounded by a steel cage with four wooden platforms at the corners of the cage to make the \"high risk\" wrestling moves. All participants are allowed to be inside and outside the cage at any time.\n\n=== Chamber of Extreme match ===\nThe cage-based match, came from [[Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling|Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling]] (ECCW), in which the 8-feet-high steel cage which surrounds the ringside area with the top wrapped in barbed wire and \"extreme\" weapons scattered around the ring and ringside area.

As opposed to a conventional [[steel cage]], the cell fencing continues across the top, hence the name 'cell'. Unlike a standard cage match, there is no escape clause (and it has been fairly common for Hell in a Cell matches to spill out of the cell and even onto the ceiling of the cage), the match can only be won via pinfall or submission. The pinfall or submission can happen anywhere and anything not nailed to the floor may be used as a weapon. The cell may be used as a weapon. This type of match outside of the WWE is considered a cage match since most promotions do not consider escaping from the ring as a victory.\n\nBecause of the \"literally anything goes\" rule, this match developed an infamous reputation in its early years. Many wrestlers were legitimately injured during these matches ([[The Undertaker vs. Mankind|most notably]] [[Mick Foley]]), and the unbelievable bumps taken during these matches are talked about even to this day.  In [[kayfabe]], it is regarded as the most dangerous match in the entire promotion. [[Jim Ross]] has referred to the cell itself as \"a demonic structure\" that is \"custom built for injury.\" There have been 40 Hell in a Cell matches to date, with [[The Undertaker]] competing in 14 (with his last at [[WrestleMania 32]]), more than any other WWE performer. The first match was between The Undertaker and [[Shawn Michaels]] in 1997. The [[Hell in a Cell (2019)]] PPV ended in controversy when [[Seth Rollins]] faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. Seth beat up Bray and when he hit Bray with a sledgehammer with Bray under a ladder the referee had no choice but to end the match disregarding the fact that the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.\n\n=== Electrified cage match ===\nThe ring is surrounded by an electrified steel cage.

Due to the potentially graphic or dangerous nature of this type of match, it is very rarely seen in North America. In fact, there have only been five to this date in the WWE, all of which have involved [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].\n\nThe first inferno match took place in 1987 at the Juan Pachin Vicens coliseum in Ponce, Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXDBKJNCEvA|title=WWC: Invader #1 vs. El Vikingo - Fire Match|first=|last=ClassicsWWC|date=30 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> The first WWF Inferno Match was between Kane and The Undertaker at the 1998 [[Unforgiven (1998)|Unforgiven]] pay-per-view.

While the ring is surrounded by flames just like in a standard Inferno match, the match is decided by pinfall or submission and not by burning your opponent.

Each door may only be opened once and is only allowed to remain open for sixty seconds, after which it is [[padlock]]ed. Should all four doors end up locked before the wrestlers escape, they are forced to climb out over the top, where the bamboo is fashioned into spikes. Between the two cages are sometimes placed two tables, on which are [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapons]] (both \"medieval\" and \"bamboo\" variations of standard wrestling weapons) There are also extended straps at the corners of the cage which can be used to choke the opponent. Once a wrestler has escaped the first cage, he must climb over and out of the second cage, with the first wrestler having both of their feet touch the arena floor is the winner of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/punjabiprison1|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches: Punjabi Prison match|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=WWE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329093548/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/punjabiprison1|archive-date=2008-03-29|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightnetwork.com/law/july-19-review-a-smackdown-with-wai-ting-alex-greenfield|title=Review-A-Smackdown with Wai-Ting & Alex Greenfield|accessdate=2017-07-19|publisher=LAW Radio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719220804/http://fightnetwork.com/law/july-19-review-a-smackdown-with-wai-ting-alex-greenfield/|archive-date=2017-07-19|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe match was revived in 2017, but as part of a series of changes relating to safety after the [[Chris Benoit murder suicide|Chris Benoit incident in 2007]] WWE eliminated the spikes on the bamboo and the straps used to choke opponents.\n\n=== Thundercage ===\n[[File:Domo de la Muerte.jpg|thumb|AAA's ''Domo de la Muerte'']]\n[[World Championship Wrestling]]'s Thundercage, based on the film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', is a large domed structure of steel bars engulfing the ring. Although it does not have a top, the sides curve in to prevent escape.\n\nMexico's [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] promotion tweaked the concept with the ''Domo de la Muerte'' (\"Dome of Death\"), which uses a similar cage but only allows victory by escaping through a hole at the top center. This variation is also used in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], where it was called the TerrorDome, or more recently the Steel Asylum. In AAA it is typically used for multi-man \"luchas de apuestas\" (bet matches), with the last man standing in the cage losing his mask or hair.\n\nThe Thunderdome is a variation on the Thundercage, with the area near the top of the cage electrified. The only way for a wrestler to win the Thunderdome match is to have their opponents' \"terminator\" (usually a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] who stands outside of the ring) throw in the towel to stop the match. In another variation of this match, each pinned competitor in the match is handcuffed to the cage.<ref name=mf133>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.133)</ref> The last man left is given a key to unlock his teammates to attack the other team, who are still handcuffed.<ref name=mf133/>\n\n=== Triple cage match ===\nA triple cage match involves three cages stacked on top of each other, with each cage decreasing in size from the bottom up.\n\nTwo variations exist. In one, similar to a [[ladder match]], competitors begin in the ring inside the lowest cage and must make their way to the roof of the third cage where an object is suspended, with the winner being the first competitor to obtain the object and exit the cage.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Slamboree 2000|episodelink=Slamboree#2000|series=WCW|serieslink=World Championship Wrestling|airdate=2000-05-07}}</ref> The other, dubbed the Tower of Doom match, had two teams of five make their way down from the uppermost cage to the bottom, with victory achieved when all five members of a team escaped a door there. The cages were cut off from each other, with doors controlled from outside by referees, who only opened them for two-minute intervals.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The 1998 Great American Bash|episodelink=The Great American Bash (1988)|series=NWA|serieslink=National Wrestling Alliance|airdate=1988-07-10}}</ref>\n\nNo Limits Wrestling on YouTube recreated this match in stop motion animation form. Check it out.\n\n=== WarGames ===\n{{main|WarGames match}}\nSometimes suffixed with the tagline \"The Match Beyond\", the WarGames match features two rings surrounded by an enclosed steel cage (perhaps with a roof) with two teams (or sometimes three) facing one another. In [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], this was known as an Ultimate Jeopardy match.\n\n=== Dixieland match ===\nA Dixieland match (named for TNA President [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]], who \"invented\" the match) is a hybrid steel cage/ladder match. The wrestlers start the match in the ring enclosed in a steel cage. To win the match, a wrestler must first climb out of the cage, then go up the entrance ramp where a championship belt is hung from the ceiling, and finally climb a ladder to retrieve the belt. The first match of this type occurred during the ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]: Final Resolution'' taping on December 3, 2013, as [[Nick Aldis|Magnus]] defeated [[Jeff Hardy]] to become [[TNA World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/305818/Impact-Wrestling-Taping-Results-(SPOILERS).htm|title=Impact Wrestling Taping Results (SPOILERS)|access-date=2013-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324020806/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/305818/Impact-Wrestling-Taping-Results-(SPOILERS).htm|archive-date=2014-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Lethal Lockdown ===\n{{main|Lethal Lockdown match}}\nSimilar to the WarGames match utilized in WCW, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'s Lethal Lockdown consists of a single ring enclosed by a steel cage with two teams facing off with each other. The staggered entry system is identical, but weapons are permitted and are even provided. When all competitors have entered the ring, a roof is lowered onto the top of the cage, with various weapons hanging from it. Victory can be attained by pinfall or submission. This match has become a staple of TNA's [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]] pay-per-view event, but has also made appearances at other TNA pay-per-views.\n\n=== Xscape match ===\nThe Xscape match was featured annually at the [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]] all-steel-cage [[pay-per-view]] in April. This variation of the Lockdown Match has 4\u20138 competitors and is a two-stage process. The first stage is a standard pin/submission elimination contest, with eliminated wrestlers leaving the cage through the door until there are only two wrestlers left. The last two competitors then face off; the only way to win at this stage is to climb out of the cage all the way to the floor.\n\n=== Asylum match ===\nThe Asylum match is the name given to two different types of matches, both involving cages.\n\nThe first Asylum match type was a match created by [[Scott Steiner]] in WCW, held within a small chain link cage in the shape of a circle placed in the middle of the ring. Victory occurred only by submission.\n\nOn May 16, 2016, a second type of Asylum match was introduced and scheduled between [[Dean Ambrose]] and [[Chris Jericho]] at [[Extreme Rules (2016)|Extreme Rules]], a variation to the steel cage match where weapons are suspended above the cage and escaping the cage is not a means of victory, leaving only pinfall or submission.\n\nOn August 10, 2019, a third type of Asylum match was introduced after [[Adam Cole]] and [[Johnny Gargano]] tied one to one after a normal match and a no holds barred match at [[NXT TakeOver: Toronto (2019)]] where weapons are connected to the steel cage and barbed wire on the top.\n\n===Chamber of Horrors match===\nThis stipulation was used in [[WCW]]. This is a match between two teams of four men. In the middle of the cage there's a smaller cage with an electric chair connected to a lever. The way to win this match is to put the opponent in the chair and switch the lever on, so as, in kayfabe, the person is electrocuted.\n\n== Container-based variations ==\nSome matches have a container stationed in or near the ring, with the object of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler in it. Many of these matches take the name of the container, such as Ambulance match and the Casket match. A similar type of match aims to rest opposing wrestlers somehow, and the match often takes the name of the restraining device - for example, the Stretcher.\n\nCommon containers used for these matches are [[coffin|caskets]] (connected to [[The Undertaker]]'s Deadman persona, either using a typical coffin or a double-deep, double-wide casket, sometimes specially designed for specific opponents The Undertaker takes on), [[body bag]]s, [[ambulance]]s, [[dumpster]]s, [[hearse]]s (known as a \"Last Ride match\", also connected to The Undertaker gimmick), and [[stretcher]]s.\n\n=== Ambulance match ===\nAn Ambulance match is fought under hardcore rules; the only way to win is for one wrestler to force their opponent into the back of an ambulance and close the door.\n\n=== Buried Alive match ===\nA [[Premature burial|Buried Alive]] match is a [[No Holds Barred match]] in which the object is for one wrestler to throw his opponent into a grave dug out of a large mound of soil placed outside the ring. Once in the grave, the wrestler must bury his opponent in soil to the referee's discretion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/buriedalivematch|title=Specialty Matches: Buried Alive Match|accessdate=2010-10-17|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325073927/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/buriedalivematch|archive-date=2008-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref> Equipment ranging from [[shovel]]s and [[wheelbarrow]]s to [[bulldozer]]s are often made available to completely bury the opponent.  All buried alive matches thus far have had [[The Undertaker]] as a competitor.\n\nA version of the match known as a \"Boneyard match\" was filmed for [[WrestleMania 36]], between The Undertaker and [[AJ Styles]]. The match was presented as a cinematic segment, taking place in a [[cemetery]]-like setting near an abandoned warehouse, rather than in a traditional ring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/wwe-triple-h-wrestlemania-coronavirus-impact/|title=WWE's Triple H Explains What It's Like to Film WrestleMania Without the Fans|date=April 2, 2020|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-recap-grades-major-title-change-epic-undertaker-match-card-2020-highlights/live/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results, recap, grades: Major title change, epic Undertaker match, card, 2020 highlights|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Casket match ===\n[[File:Chokeslam on....jpg|thumb|[[The Undertaker]] in a casket match against [[CM Punk]]]]\nThe casket match (originally known as the coffin match) has a casket near the ring, with the object of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler in it.<ref>Foley, Mick.

However, with 16 casket matches played, only 11 of them has the Undertaker won. \nIn addition to WWE, the casket match has recently been adopted for use in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] and [[Lucha Underground]], with Lucha Underground denominating it as the Grave Consequences (subsequently Graver Consequences) match.\n\n=== Dumpster match ===\nA dumpster match is a hardcore match which is won by forcing your opponent into a [[dumpster]]. The first one was at WrestleMania XIV, pitting [[The New Age Outlaws]] against [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Terry Funk|Chainsaw Charlie]].\n\n=== Last Ride match ===\nA Last Ride match is a hardcore match in which the victory condition is for one wrestler to force their opponent into the back of a hearse, close the door, and drive it out of the arena. The first match of this type occurred at [[No Mercy (2004)|No Mercy]] when [[The Undertaker]] challenged [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] for the [[WWE Championship]], although a match was held previously with similar stipulations.\n\n=== Stretcher match ===\n[[File:Stretcher match.jpg|thumb|A stretcher at ringside prior to a stretcher match]]\nIn the stretcher match, one wrestler must incapacitate their opponent to such an extent that they are able to get them onto a stretcher and roll them to the finish line; usually past a line at the top of the entrance ramp. It cannot end in a pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification. The first match of this type was different as a wrestler lost if after being pushed out of the ring, four medics were able to load him on a \"carry\" stretcher, pick him up all the way, and start walking out with him.\n\n== Multi-competitor match variations ==\nOn some occasions, a match may be held between more than two individual wrestlers or teams.\n\n=== Basic non-elimination matches ===\nThe most common example of a non-elimination match is the three-way match (known as a triple-threat match in WWE and a triangle match in WCW among other promotions), in which three wrestlers compete under standard rules with the first competitor to achieve a pinfall or submission being declared the winner. One distinction from a singles match is that these matches usually exclude disqualifications or count-outs. In many promotions, there are typically no distinctions between the two terms. Variations are the four-way match (known as a fatal four-way in WWE), the five-way match or the six-way match, involving four, five, or six wrestlers, respectively.<ref>{{citation|publisher=WWE|title=Jordan vs. Elias vs. Dallas vs. Axel vs. The Hardy Boyz - Six-Pack Challenge, Raw, Sept. 19, 2017|date=September 18, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfBTiRfAzo|accessdate=September 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919223030/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfBTiRfAzo|archive-date=2017-09-19|url-status=live}}</ref> American independent promotion USA Xtreme Wrestling (USA Pro Wrestling) hosted a match involving 8\u201312 competitors known as the 8 Ball Challenge. These types of matches can be used in certain situations to take a title off a wrestler without weakening him in the process.\n\nOn some occasions, multi-competitor matches are contested under similar rules as a [[tag team]] match. Two competitors start the match in the ring while the other wrestler(s) wait outside the ring for a tag from another wrestler, often achieved by touching an unsuspecting competitor in the ring. Variations of this include a Four Corners Survival or Six-Man Mayhem match in [[Ring of Honor]]. Competitors are permitted to leave their position and attack wrestlers outside of the ring, such as when one or both wrestlers have been thrown over the top rope.\n\n=== Championship Scramble ===\n[[WWE]] features a match called the Championship Scramble in which none of the [[List of WWE personnel|wrestlers]] are eliminated. Two wrestlers start the match and every five minutes another wrestler enters until all five participants are present. After the last wrestler enters, there is a predetermined time limit. Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall or submission, he becomes the interim champion. Such reigns are not recorded as title reigns. The winner is the wrestler who scores the last pinfall or submission before the time limit expires. The [[Unforgiven (2008)|Unforgiven]] pay-per view of 2008 is arguably the most prominent showcase of this match type, as all three world titles were contested under a Championship Scramble match.\n\n=== Basic elimination matches ===\nMatches involving a larger number of competitors are typically elimination matches. These matches may begin with all of the competitors in the ring at the same time, or may have a staggered start, with wrestlers entering at timed intervals. The standard match rules apply as wrestlers may leave their position and attack other wrestlers outside the ring, with a twist that should the wrestler be pinned or forced to submit, he is eliminated from the match. A common elimination match type was popularized in ECW and known as the ''Three way Dance,'' with the name lending itself to a 1995 Supercard.\n\n=== Battle royal ===\n{{main|Battle royal (professional wrestling)}}\nA multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left. Typical battle royals begin with 20 or so participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor (this is sometimes referred to as the \"Shawn Michaels rule\", due to the 1995 Royal Rumble, in which he was thrown over the top rope, hung on to the top rope and only had one foot land on the floor). A variation known as the \"Reverse battle royal\" existed in TNA.\n\n=== Gauntlet match ===\nA Gauntlet match, also referred to as a Turmoil match, is a quick series of one-fall one-on-one matches. Two wrestlers begin the match and are replaced whenever one is eliminated (by pinfall or submission). After a predetermined number of wrestlers have competed in the match, the last person standing is named the winner. A Gauntlet match may also be played out in multiple \"parts\" as part of a storyline (in which a face wrestler must face a series of a heel wrestler's underlings before facing the heel himself, for instance) \u2013 this was common in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in the early 1990s. A participant involved in a Gauntlet match may be said to be \"running the gauntlet\" (in most cases this designation being reserved for those who are involved for most of the match).\n\nIt could also be a one-on-three/four handicap match. Unlike tag matches, the three/four man team will challenge the person handicapped individually until he is knocked out, at which time the match is over.\n\nAs a tag team match, the Gauntlet match sees two tag teams begin the match and are replaced whenever one team is eliminated. This version is sometimes referred to as \"Tag team turmoil match\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BCk2nuPOxU |title=Tag Team Turmoil - WWE Raw Slam of the Week 1/12/2014 |access-date=2014-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310205305/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BCk2nuPOxU |archive-date=2016-03-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe most famous variation of the Gauntlet match is WWE's [[Royal Rumble]], a match that combines the concepts of a battle royal and the gauntlet match. In the match, a number of wrestlers, whom enter at different timed intervals, aim to eliminate their competitors by tossing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The winner of the match is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated.\n\n=== Series variations{{anchor|Two out of three falls match|Best two out of three falls match|2 out of 3 falls match}} ===\nSometimes, a match is considered as a series of smaller matches, which may take place concurrently, consecutively, or even in different shows. The most common form of a series match is extending the one-fall concept to a series of falls, the most common being the best two out of three (known as a two out of three falls match). These types of series matches are often booked to the final match to emphasize the equality of the wrestlers involved, however, longer series may be shortened due to storyline or other factors. Series matches may involve the same match throughout, or may use different matches for some or all of the series. A series match may or may not involve the same wrestlers throughout (such as when a main competitor is forced to use a substitute in the event of an injury partway through).\n\n=== Beat the Clock challenge match ===\nA Beat the Clock challenge match is a match in which wrestlers must defeat their opponent before the clock runs out. In doing so, the victorious wrestler usually gets some type of reward in return, such as inclusion in a title match, for instance. In a variation on the November 20, 2013 episode of [[WWE NXT (TV Series)|NXT]], two wrestlers completed a match, with the match duration being used as the marker for two other wrestlers to complete their match.\n\n=== Elimination Chase ===\nThe Elimination Chase, first used in WWE's version of [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2007, is a series of multi-competitor, one fall matches, with the loser of the fall being eliminated from future matches until one competitor remains.<ref name=\"Elimination Chase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/09182007/articles/bigchase|title=The chase is on|first=Craig|last=Tello|accessdate=2007-10-03|publisher=WWE|quote=Ultimately, the [...] ECW General Manager mandated a three-week competition between all four Superstars that would [...] determine who would face champion CM Punk [...].

Some of them occur relatively frequently while others are developed so as to advance an [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] and such match types are used rarely. Because of [[History of professional wrestling|professional wrestling's long history]] over decades, many things have been recycled (many match types often being variations of previous match types). These match types can be organized into several loose groups.\n\n== Singles matches{{anchor|Variations of singles matches|Singles match}} ==\nThe singles match is the most basic of all professional wrestling matches, which involves only two competitors competing for one [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Fall|fall]]. Victory is obtained by [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]], [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]], [[Professional wrestling#Knockout|knockout]], [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] or [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]].\n\n== Team matches ==\n{{main|Professional wrestling tag team match types}}\nMatches are often contested between two (or more) teams, most often consisting of two members each.\n\n=== Tag team match ===\nOn most occasions, one member of the team competes in the ring with one or more of his or her teammates standing behind the ropes. Wrestlers switch positions by \"tagging\" one another, usually similar to a [[high five]] and, as a result, these teams are referred to as [[tag team]]s. This can create tension during the match as an injured wrestler in the middle of the ring attempts to reach his or her teammates, often with the heel team preventing them from doing so. In typical tag team matches, standard wrestling rules apply with a match ending by pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification.\n\nPromotions usually have established tag teams that most often compete in team matches rather than singles matches, though teams will often break up to pursue a singles career, usually via a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]]. Teams often consist of real-life friends or relatives. On other occasions, teams are booked together by promoters based on their face or heel alignment in order to increase the amount of wrestlers on the card or to advance multiple storylines at once.\n\nPromotions usually have a tag team championship for a team of two wrestlers, and on rare occasion allies of the reigning tag team will be allowed to defend the title in the place of one of the reigning wrestlers under the [[The Fabulous Freebirds#Freebird Rule|Freebird rule]]. Though common in Mexican ''[[lucha libre]]'', at one point, [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) had a championship for [[WCW World Six-Man Tag Team Championship|teams of three]].\n\nWWE also can have three (triple threat) or four (fatal four-way) tag teams going against each other.<ref>{{Citation|last=WWE|title=Dean Ambrose & Seth Rollins vs Sheamus & Cesaro vs Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson: Raw, Sept. 18, 2017|date=2017-09-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICKiZWR7QN8|accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Tornado tag team match ===\nMatches in which the entire team competes at once is often referred to as a tornado tag match, specifically in WWE. Matches can be held under standard rules or as a specialty match, such as a steel cage match or a [[ladder match]]. (If it is a title match and one team DQs the titles will not change unless one of the members of that team has been eliminated then the titles will change hands)\n\n=== Elimination tag team match ===\nTag team matches are occasionally held under elimination rules; that is, the losing wrestler is eliminated from the match, but his/her team is allowed to continue with their remaining members until all members of one team is eliminated.\n\nOne famous example of this match is the [[Survivor Series]] match held in WWE at their annual Survivor Series pay-per-view. Teams of four or five, though on some occasions as many as seven, compete under elimination rules. All other standard rules apply, and team members may tag in and out in any order. While some teams are already established [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stables]], others may need to recruit members for their team.\n\nIn ''lucha libre'' promotions, a ''[[torneo cibernetico]]'' is a similar type of match between teams of up to eight wrestlers who enter in a predetermined order.\n\n== Winner takes all match ==\nA winner takes all match is a match in which both wrestlers (or teams if a tag team match) are champions going into the match, and the winner receives the championship of the loser, thus \"taking all\".<ref>[http://www.wwe.com/titlehistory/united-states-championship U.S. Championship - WWE.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2008/matches/7793948 |title=Summerslam 2008 Winner Take All Match - WWE.com |access-date=2015-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106013126/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/2008/matches/7793948 |archive-date=2015-11-06 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThis is different than a championship unification match, where one championship is absorbed into the other and retired/deactivated.  In a Winner Take All scenario, both titles are still active and defended as separate entities.\n\n== Empty arena match ==\nAn empty arena match is a [[hardcore match]] between two or more wrestlers that takes place in an arena devoid of fans. The only people present are the competitors, [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]], commentators, and cameramen. The match is broadcast, or videotaped and played later. An example of this is the WWF championship match between [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] that took place in [[Tucson, Arizona]], at the [[Tucson Convention Center]], which aired as part of a special [[Halftime Heat]] edition of ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'' aired [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|counterprogramming the Super Bowl]] halftime show of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] in 1999.

As the match may take place in various parts of the arena,<ref>Mick Foley, ''Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks'', p. 193.</ref> the \"falls count anywhere\" provision is almost always accompanied with a \"no-disqualification\" stipulation to make the match a hardcore match, so as to allow wrestlers the convenience to use [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|any objects]] they may find wherever they wrestle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/roh/070304.html|title=Ring of Honor: Fifth Year Festival: Finale|accessdate=2008-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220170308/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/roh/070304.html|archive-date=2008-02-20|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA variation of the rules states that once a pinfall takes place, the [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned wrestler]] would lose the match if they are unable to return to the ring within a specific amount of time \u2014 usually a referee's count of 10 or 30.

Most often this simply means there are [[#no holds barred match|no-disqualifications]], which itself [[#no-countout match|eliminates countouts]], sometimes allowing decisions to take place anywhere. Other common euphemisms for hardcore matches are \"street fight\" (which suggests wrestlers are to dress in normal street clothes), \"[[Extreme Championship Wrestling|extreme]] rules\" match, \"[[Combat Zone Wrestling|ultraviolent]] rules\" match (hardcore rules matches exclusively in [[CZW]] that usual involve ladders, tables, steel folding chairs, thumbtacks, barbed wire, weed whackers, light tubes, and fire), HardKore X-Treme match (A version of the hardcore match except weapons include flaming tables, flaming chairs, razor wire, sheets of glass and weapons wrapped in barbed wire), no holds barred match, and the \"good housekeeping\" match (which emphasized the use of kitchen implements as [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapons]]).\n\nSome promotions, such as [[Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling]], the [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]], [[International Wrestling Syndicate]], [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], [[Big Japan Pro Wrestling]], and [[Combat Zone Wrestling]], have specialized in hardcore matches, with \"standard\" non-hardcore matches being the exception.

Other variations are the razor wire steel cage match, a similar concept to that of the barbed wire cage match, however the barbed wire is replaced by razor wire and is wrapped around the top, corners, and walls of the cage, and barbed wire razor wire steel cage match is the same as the barbed wire cage match, however the top, corners, and walls of the cage are covered with barbed wire, then also further covered with razor wire.<ref name=\"DMs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/deathmatches.html|title=Death Match Dictionary|accessdate=2008-04-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423073218/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/deathmatches.html|archivedate=2008-04-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Clockwork Orange House of Fun match ===\nThe Clockwork Orange House of Fun match, known as \"Raven's House of Fun\" or simply \"House of Fun\", was created by professional wrestler [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] ([[shoot (professional wrestling)|legitimately]], as Raven pitched the idea himself to TNA's creative team).

This match type gained popularity in the now defunct [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]]. Designated a \"Believers' Backlash\" match in [[Lucha Underground]].\n\n=== First Blood match ===\nIn a first blood match is a no-disqualification match in which the first wrestler to bleed loses the match. Depending on the nuance of the stipulation, this might include bleeding noses.

Such a match can also be known as a street fight. \n\nNo-disqualification matches may be used in feuds in which a challenger may have won matches against the champion, but did not claim the championship because the champion was disqualified (championships usually only change hands via pinfall or submission).\n\nUnless stipulated, a no-disqualification match can end in a countout. Those that cannot are no-disqualification, no-countout matches.\n\nAnother variant of a no disqualification match is a non-sanctioned match or unsanctioned match, also called a lights out match. In this variation, there are no rules (with the exception of the pinfall or submission) and the match is not officially recognized by the promotion (such as in [[All Elite Wrestling]], where the match does not count towards a wrestler's win-loss record). In kayfabe, the match is sometimes used when a wrestler is \"injured\" (at the hands of another wrestler) and wants revenge but can't be \"medically cleared\"; thus he agrees to a non-sanctioned match where \"the promotion is not held liable\" for any injuries.\n\n=== Taipei Deathmatch ===\nIn a [[Taipei]] deathmatch the wrestlers' fists are taped and dipped into glue and in broken and crushed glass, allowing shards to stick to their fists.

Made popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s by small American wrestling leagues, as well as overseas Japanese promotions during the 1990s.\n\n== Submission match ==\nA submission match is typically a match in which pinfalls, count-outs and disqualifications are not legal and the match could only end by making an opponent tap out to a submission hold. A very famous variation of this match is an [[\"I quit\" match]] in which a wrestler has to beat their opponent and force them to say \"I quit\"..\n\n== Stipulation-based variations ==\nAs professional wrestling seeks to also tell a story, some matches are made solely for the purposes of advancing the plot. This typically involves the loser of a match being penalized in some way.\n\n=== Scaffold match{{anchor|Elevation X|Elevation X match}} ===\nIn a Scaffold match whoever falls off the scaffold is declared the loser. A variation named \"elevation X\", uses a scaffold in the shape of the letter ''X''.\n\n=== Last Chance match ===\nA last chance match, also called a \"do or die\" match, is a [[Professional wrestling championship|championship]] match in which the challenger, if he does not win the title, is banned from challenging for it again as long as that reigning champion holds it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/vengeance07.html|title=Vengeance 2007 results|accessdate=2007-07-14|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705145432/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/vengeance07.html|archive-date=2007-07-05|url-status=live}}</ref> Rarely, the loser may even be barred from challenging for that title for as long as they remain employed at the company.

Such matches included [[Bret Hart]] vs. [[Jerry Lawler]] during the ''[[King of the Ring (1995)|1995 King of the Ring]]'' and Lawler vs. [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] during the ''[[Over the Limit (2011)|2011 Over the Limit]]'' pay-per-view. A similar variation of this match is the kiss my ass match, which the loser has to kiss the winner's [[buttocks|bare buttocks]] and was prominently held during WWE's Attitude Era.\n\n=== ''Luchas de apuestas'' ===\n''Luchas de apuestas'' (literally \"gambling fights\") are matches in which both wrestlers wager something specific (the [[Lucha libre#Masks|mask]] or hair) on the outcome. The loser of the match then loses the item, being forced to take off their mask or be [[head shaving|shaved bald]].

Among notable wrestlers who have lost such matches, [[Gorgeous George]], [[Adrian Adonis]], [[Jeff Jarrett]], [[Kurt Angle]], [[Molly Holly]], and [[CM Punk]] were all heels when on the losing end of hair vs. hair matches.\n\nWhile most wrestlers (especially female wrestlers) end up growing their hair back out, in some cases the wrestler may tend to keep a [[Head shaving|shaved head]] as part of their look. For instance, Angle's [[kayfabe]] explanation was that he could not regrow it despite using [[Minoxidil|Rogaine]], [[Hair conditioner|hair tonic]], and even [[fertilizer]]. In reality, he was already [[Androgenic alopecia|going bald naturally]], with many jokes about his receding hair line having been made on TV long before his head was shaved; his wife, [[Karen Jarrett|Karen]], had wanted Angle to shave his head.

The match must be won by pinfall or submission, and there are no countouts and no disqualifications.\n\n=== Boiler Room Brawl ===\nA boiler room brawl starts in a [[Mechanical room|boiler room]], with the winner being the first wrestler to successfully get out. [[Mick Foley]] participated in all of the [[WWE|WWF]]-run boiler room brawls under his persona ''Mankind'', because this persona dwelled in boiler rooms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/bolierroombrawl|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches > Boiler Room Brawl|accessdate=2007-07-01|publisher=WWE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327084754/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/bolierroombrawl|archive-date=2008-03-27|url-status=live}}</ref> [[World Championship Wrestling]] used a match with similar rules, naming their match and its location the Block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1999122m.htm|title=Monday Nitro results \u2013 December 13, 1999|date=1999-12-13|accessdate=2007-07-04|publisher=DDT Digest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234628/http://www.ddtdigest.com/updates/1999122m.htm|archive-date=2007-09-27|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Street Fight===\nA street fight is a match without disqualifications, in which falls count anywhere, and weapons are legal. Sometimes street fights have the name of the host arena's city in the name, such as \"Chicago Street Fight\" or \"New York Street Fight\". Two holiday themed variants also include specially themed weapons for the day in question.\n\n==== Trick or Street Fight ====\nA Trick or Street fight is a Halloween-themed match, named after the Halloween tradition \"trick or treating\", involving Halloween-themed weapons including pumpkins, buckets of candy, bowls full of water and apples, skeletons, witches' brooms, gravestones, candy cane themed kendo sticks, plus common wrestling weapons such as tables and chairs.\n\n==== Miracle on 34th Street Fight ====\nA Miracle on a 34th Street Fight is a Christmas-themed match, named after the movie ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'', involving Christmas-themed weapons including fire extinguishers, pumpkin pies, presents, Christmas trees, Christmas wreaths, candy cane themed kendo sticks, bowling balls, and teddy bears, plus common wrestling weapons such as tables and chairs.\n\n=== Parking Lot Brawl ===\nTwo types of matches take place in parking lots, the parking lot brawl<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/nitro/1996.html|title=Year-by-year Nitro results (1996)|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|quote=April 29, 1996|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629234554/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/nitro/1996.html|archive-date=2007-06-29|url-status=live}}</ref> and the iron circle match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20060303.shtml|title=Fully Loaded 1999 results|accessdate=2007-07-20|publisher=Online Onslaught|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514062518/http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/ooldtyme/20060303.shtml|archivedate=2008-05-14}}</ref> They are essentially the same thing, two wrestlers fighting in a parking lot, the major difference being the iron circle match takes place in the middle of a multitude of cars parked in a circle with their headlights on, while the parking lot brawl tends to be in a sparser location. Both wrestlers are allowed to use everything around them as weapons, including the cars. First one to pinfall or submission is the winner.\n\n== Weapon-based variations ==\nThrough the use of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|foreign objects]], the matches generally take the name of the weapon being used (\"[[Shinai|Singapore cane]] match\", \"[[Chair]]s match\"). In the following list of weapon-based matches additional rules have supplanted or replaced the standard rules.\n\n=== Crazy 8 match ===\nThe Crazy 8 match, used mostly in the defunct Pro Wrestling Unplugged promotion, involves placing a championship belt at the top of a scaffold with the first wrestler to retrieve it being declared the winner. Placed in and around the ring for the wrestlers to utilize during the match are one side of a [[#Steel cages|steel cage]], two trampolines, and four rope swings.<ref>{{cite video|people=Pro Wrestling Unplugged|date=2007-06-16|title=Crazy 8 2007|medium=DVD|publisher=Alternative Media Productions}}</ref>\n\n=== Ladder match ===\n{{main|Ladder match}}\nA ladder match is a match in which a specific object (usually a title belt or a contract) is placed above the ring\u2014out of the reach of the competitors\u2014with the winner being the first person to climb a [[ladder]] and retrieve it.

Since 2009, WWE has held a pay-per-view in December named [[WWE TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs|TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs]], which features this match as its marquee matches. The match has two variations. One is competed as a ladder match, which the person/people must retrieve an object suspended above the ring. The other is a traditional style match won by pinfall or submission. In TNA's \"Full Metal Mayhem\" variation, steel chains are also permitted along with tables, ladders, and chairs.\n\n=== Pillow fight ===\nA pillow fight is a match held for which [[pillow]]s and a bed are placed in the ring.<ref name=play/> The pillows may be used as weapons, but other than that, standard wrestling rules apply.

Often, the ring will be lined with many kendo sticks for the wrestlers to use.

By definition the strap\u2014and anything tied to it \u2014 are considered legal and in play weapons.

The most common way of winning is by simply escaping the cage, either over the top of the cage wall and having both feet touch the arena floor, or by escaping through the cage door with both feet touching the arena floor. The other occasional ways to win a steel cage match are by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]], by submission, though these are less common stipulations in the modern era, an even less likely stipulation is that weapons can be thrown into the ring by the wrestlers' managers.\n\nIt is possible to have one wrestler attempting to escape over the top of the cage wall while another tries to escape through the cage door.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDREFBcDJ8 |title=Cage Match: Kurt Angle vs. Bobby Roode (January 23, 2014) |access-date=2016-10-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316182656/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDREFBcDJ8 |archive-date=2016-03-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> In [[Mexico]], steel cage matches are won by just climbing to the top of the cage wall. In [[Impact Wrestling]]'s past, the matches were often called \"six sides of steel\" as the cage surrounded their six-sided ring. In [[All Elite Wrestling]], steel cage matches are won by pinfall or submission.\n\n=== Chamber match ===\nIn TNA, this match was between two wrestlers (or up to 6) fighting inside a chamber.  Wrestlers who were not involved in the match surrounded the chamber. About 5 minutes into the match, the outside wrestlers throw weapons into the chamber. This match only ends when one wrestler knocks out his opponent.\n\n=== Scramble cage match ===\nThe match, exclusively in [[Ring of Honor|Ring of Honor wrestling]] (ROH), in which the ring is surrounded by a steel cage with four wooden platforms at the corners of the cage to make the \"high risk\" wrestling moves. All participants are allowed to be inside and outside the cage at any time.\n\n=== Chamber of Extreme match ===\nThe cage-based match, came from [[Elite Canadian Championship Wrestling|Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling]] (ECCW), in which the 8-feet-high steel cage which surrounds the ringside area with the top wrapped in barbed wire and \"extreme\" weapons scattered around the ring and ringside area. Disqualifications, count-outs and rope-breaks do not apply. The winner shall be decided by pinfall, submission or being unable to stand up at 10-count.\n\n=== Doomsday Cage match ===\nAlso called a Tower of Doom, the Doomsday Cage is a three-story cage \u2013 the middle one split into two rooms \u2013 all of which house wrestlers. The object of the match is for a team of wrestlers to fight their way from the top cage to the bottom, where pinfalls and submissions come into play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/march/1996.htm|title=WCW Uncensored 1996|accessdate=2008-05-13|publisher=PWWEW|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617202954/http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wcw/march/1996.htm|archive-date=2008-06-17|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|date=1996-03-24|title=[[Uncensored (1996)|WCW Uncensored 1996]]|medium=pay-per-view|publisher=[[World Championship Wrestling]]|location=Tupelo, Mississippi}}</ref> In the later days of WCW, it was referred to as a Triple Decker Cage match, a reference to the match type being used in the finale of the film ''[[Ready to Rumble]]''.\n\n=== Hell in a Cell ===\n{{main|Hell in a Cell}}\nA specific kind of enclosure match run by [[WWE]] inside a 4-sided [[cuboid]] made from open-weave steel mesh [[Chain-link fencing]], which extends beyond the ring apron, leaving a gap between the edge of the ring and the cell wall. As opposed to a conventional [[steel cage]], the cell fencing continues across the top, hence the name 'cell'. Unlike a standard cage match, there is no escape clause (and it has been fairly common for Hell in a Cell matches to spill out of the cell and even onto the ceiling of the cage), the match can only be won via pinfall or submission. The pinfall or submission can happen anywhere and anything not nailed to the floor may be used as a weapon. The cell may be used as a weapon. This type of match outside of the WWE is considered a cage match since most promotions do not consider escaping from the ring as a victory.\n\nBecause of the \"literally anything goes\" rule, this match developed an infamous reputation in its early years. Many wrestlers were legitimately injured during these matches ([[The Undertaker vs. Mankind|most notably]] [[Mick Foley]]), and the unbelievable bumps taken during these matches are talked about even to this day.  In [[kayfabe]], it is regarded as the most dangerous match in the entire promotion. [[Jim Ross]] has referred to the cell itself as \"a demonic structure\" that is \"custom built for injury.\" There have been 40 Hell in a Cell matches to date, with [[The Undertaker]] competing in 14 (with his last at [[WrestleMania 32]]), more than any other WWE performer. The first match was between The Undertaker and [[Shawn Michaels]] in 1997. The [[Hell in a Cell (2019)]] PPV ended in controversy when [[Seth Rollins]] faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. Seth beat up Bray and when he hit Bray with a sledgehammer with Bray under a ladder the referee had no choice but to end the match disregarding the fact that the only way to win is by pinfall or submission.\n\n=== Electrified cage match ===\nThe ring is surrounded by an electrified steel cage. The cage can be used as a weapon. The only way to win is by pinfall or submission.\n\n=== Elimination Chamber / No Escape===\n{{main|Elimination Chamber}}\n[[File:Elimination chamber nyr06.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The Elimination Chamber structure]]\nThe Elimination Chamber (also called No Escape in Germany because of WWE avoiding a potential [[brand blunder]] over references of [[gas chamber]]s in [[The Holocaust]] ), which was created by [[Triple H]] and introduced by Eric Bischoff for WWE in 2002, is a steel cage that surrounds the [[wrestling ring|ring]] entirely, including creating a grated floor area on the apron. Inside the cage, at each [[turnbuckle]], is a clear pod in which competitors in the match wait to join the match. As the name implies, wrestlers are eliminated one-by-one via [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Submission (combat sports)|submission]] until only one remains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches: Elimination Chamber|accessdate=2007-07-26|publisher=WWE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319081016/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/eliminationchamber|archive-date=2008-03-19|url-status=live}}</ref> An Extreme Elimination Chamber took place at the 2006 [[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]] pay-per-view, each waiting wrestler was given a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapon]].

The only way to win is to set your opponent on fire. Inferno matches usually end on the outside of the ring; this way, paramedics can assist the unfortunate loser of the match. Due to the potentially graphic or dangerous nature of this type of match, it is very rarely seen in North America. In fact, there have only been five to this date in the WWE, all of which have involved [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].\n\nThe first inferno match took place in 1987 at the Juan Pachin Vicens coliseum in Ponce, Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXDBKJNCEvA|title=WWC: Invader #1 vs. El Vikingo - Fire Match|first=|last=ClassicsWWC|date=30 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> The first WWF Inferno Match was between Kane and The Undertaker at the 1998 [[Unforgiven (1998)|Unforgiven]] pay-per-view. Kane had been thrown out of the ring and The Undertaker had no way of attacking him. The match ended in The Undertaker's victory.\n\nA variation of the Inferno match, dubbed a Ring of Fire match, took place at [[SummerSlam (2013)|SummerSlam]] in 2013, when Kane faced [[Bray Wyatt]]. While the ring is surrounded by flames just like in a standard Inferno match, the match is decided by pinfall or submission and not by burning your opponent. WCW also attempted an Inferno match, known as the Human Torch match, at [[The Great American Bash (2000)|The Great American Bash]] in 2000 between Sting and Vampiro.\n\n=== Punjabi Prison match ===\n[[File:Punjabi Prison No Mercy 07.jpg|thumb|The Punjabi Prison at [[No Mercy (2007)|No Mercy]] in 2007]]\nThe Punjabi Prison match, named after the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] state that [[The Great Khali]] (the match's founder) is billed from, consists of two large steel-reinforced [[bamboo]] cages. The first is four sided and stands 16 feet (4.8 m) tall, while the second has eight sides and stands 20 feet (6 m) and surrounds the first.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia238\">{{cite book|title=[[WWE Encyclopedia]]|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/238 238]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}</ref>\n\nThe inner cage has a four-foot (1.2 m) by four foot door on each of its sides, with a [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] standing by to open them at a wrestler's request. Each door may only be opened once and is only allowed to remain open for sixty seconds, after which it is [[padlock]]ed. Should all four doors end up locked before the wrestlers escape, they are forced to climb out over the top, where the bamboo is fashioned into spikes. Between the two cages are sometimes placed two tables, on which are [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Foreign object|weapons]] (both \"medieval\" and \"bamboo\" variations of standard wrestling weapons) There are also extended straps at the corners of the cage which can be used to choke the opponent. Once a wrestler has escaped the first cage, he must climb over and out of the second cage, with the first wrestler having both of their feet touch the arena floor is the winner of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/punjabiprison1|title=Inside WWE > Specialty Matches: Punjabi Prison match|accessdate=2007-08-03|publisher=WWE|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329093548/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/punjabiprison1|archive-date=2008-03-29|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fightnetwork.com/law/july-19-review-a-smackdown-with-wai-ting-alex-greenfield|title=Review-A-Smackdown with Wai-Ting & Alex Greenfield|accessdate=2017-07-19|publisher=LAW Radio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719220804/http://fightnetwork.com/law/july-19-review-a-smackdown-with-wai-ting-alex-greenfield/|archive-date=2017-07-19|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe match was revived in 2017, but as part of a series of changes relating to safety after the [[Chris Benoit murder suicide|Chris Benoit incident in 2007]] WWE eliminated the spikes on the bamboo and the straps used to choke opponents.\n\n=== Thundercage ===\n[[File:Domo de la Muerte.jpg|thumb|AAA's ''Domo de la Muerte'']]\n[[World Championship Wrestling]]'s Thundercage, based on the film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', is a large domed structure of steel bars engulfing the ring. Although it does not have a top, the sides curve in to prevent escape.\n\nMexico's [[Lucha Libre AAA World Wide|AAA]] promotion tweaked the concept with the ''Domo de la Muerte'' (\"Dome of Death\"), which uses a similar cage but only allows victory by escaping through a hole at the top center. This variation is also used in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]], where it was called the TerrorDome, or more recently the Steel Asylum. In AAA it is typically used for multi-man \"luchas de apuestas\" (bet matches), with the last man standing in the cage losing his mask or hair.\n\nThe Thunderdome is a variation on the Thundercage, with the area near the top of the cage electrified. The only way for a wrestler to win the Thunderdome match is to have their opponents' \"terminator\" (usually a [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] who stands outside of the ring) throw in the towel to stop the match. In another variation of this match, each pinned competitor in the match is handcuffed to the cage.<ref name=mf133>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.133)</ref> The last man left is given a key to unlock his teammates to attack the other team, who are still handcuffed.<ref name=mf133/>\n\n=== Triple cage match ===\nA triple cage match involves three cages stacked on top of each other, with each cage decreasing in size from the bottom up.\n\nTwo variations exist. In one, similar to a [[ladder match]], competitors begin in the ring inside the lowest cage and must make their way to the roof of the third cage where an object is suspended, with the winner being the first competitor to obtain the object and exit the cage.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Slamboree 2000|episodelink=Slamboree#2000|series=WCW|serieslink=World Championship Wrestling|airdate=2000-05-07}}</ref> The other, dubbed the Tower of Doom match, had two teams of five make their way down from the uppermost cage to the bottom, with victory achieved when all five members of a team escaped a door there. The cages were cut off from each other, with doors controlled from outside by referees, who only opened them for two-minute intervals.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The 1998 Great American Bash|episodelink=The Great American Bash (1988)|series=NWA|serieslink=National Wrestling Alliance|airdate=1988-07-10}}</ref>\n\nNo Limits Wrestling on YouTube recreated this match in stop motion animation form. Check it out.\n\n=== WarGames ===\n{{main|WarGames match}}\nSometimes suffixed with the tagline \"The Match Beyond\", the WarGames match features two rings surrounded by an enclosed steel cage (perhaps with a roof) with two teams (or sometimes three) facing one another. In [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]], this was known as an Ultimate Jeopardy match.\n\n=== Dixieland match ===\nA Dixieland match (named for TNA President [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]], who \"invented\" the match) is a hybrid steel cage/ladder match. The wrestlers start the match in the ring enclosed in a steel cage. To win the match, a wrestler must first climb out of the cage, then go up the entrance ramp where a championship belt is hung from the ceiling, and finally climb a ladder to retrieve the belt. The first match of this type occurred during the ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]: Final Resolution'' taping on December 3, 2013, as [[Nick Aldis|Magnus]] defeated [[Jeff Hardy]] to become [[TNA World Heavyweight Champion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/305818/Impact-Wrestling-Taping-Results-(SPOILERS).htm|title=Impact Wrestling Taping Results (SPOILERS)|access-date=2013-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324020806/http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/news/305818/Impact-Wrestling-Taping-Results-(SPOILERS).htm|archive-date=2014-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Lethal Lockdown ===\n{{main|Lethal Lockdown match}}\nSimilar to the WarGames match utilized in WCW, [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'s Lethal Lockdown consists of a single ring enclosed by a steel cage with two teams facing off with each other. The staggered entry system is identical, but weapons are permitted and are even provided. When all competitors have entered the ring, a roof is lowered onto the top of the cage, with various weapons hanging from it. Victory can be attained by pinfall or submission. This match has become a staple of TNA's [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]] pay-per-view event, but has also made appearances at other TNA pay-per-views.\n\n=== Xscape match ===\nThe Xscape match was featured annually at the [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]] all-steel-cage [[pay-per-view]] in April. This variation of the Lockdown Match has 4\u20138 competitors and is a two-stage process. The first stage is a standard pin/submission elimination contest, with eliminated wrestlers leaving the cage through the door until there are only two wrestlers left. The last two competitors then face off; the only way to win at this stage is to climb out of the cage all the way to the floor.\n\n=== Asylum match ===\nThe Asylum match is the name given to two different types of matches, both involving cages.\n\nThe first Asylum match type was a match created by [[Scott Steiner]] in WCW, held within a small chain link cage in the shape of a circle placed in the middle of the ring. Victory occurred only by submission.\n\nOn May 16, 2016, a second type of Asylum match was introduced and scheduled between [[Dean Ambrose]] and [[Chris Jericho]] at [[Extreme Rules (2016)|Extreme Rules]], a variation to the steel cage match where weapons are suspended above the cage and escaping the cage is not a means of victory, leaving only pinfall or submission.\n\nOn August 10, 2019, a third type of Asylum match was introduced after [[Adam Cole]] and [[Johnny Gargano]] tied one to one after a normal match and a no holds barred match at [[NXT Takeover:Toronto (2019)]] where weapons are connected to the steel cage and barbed wire on the top.\n\n===Chamber of Horrors match===\nThis stipulation was used in [[WCW]]. This is a match between two teams of four men. In the middle of the cage there's a smaller cage with an electric chair connected to a lever. The way to win this match is to put the opponent in the chair and switch the lever on, so as, in kayfabe, the person is electrocuted.\n\n== Container-based variations ==\nSome matches have a container stationed in or near the ring, with the object of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler in it. Many of these matches take the name of the container, such as Ambulance match and the Casket match. A similar type of match aims to rest opposing wrestlers somehow, and the match often takes the name of the restraining device - for example, the Stretcher.\n\nCommon containers used for these matches are [[coffin|caskets]] (connected to [[The Undertaker]]'s Deadman persona, either using a typical coffin or a double-deep, double-wide casket, sometimes specially designed for specific opponents The Undertaker takes on), [[body bag]]s, [[ambulance]]s, [[dumpster]]s, [[hearse]]s (known as a \"Last Ride match\", also connected to The Undertaker gimmick), and [[stretcher]]s.\n\n=== Ambulance match ===\nAn Ambulance match is fought under hardcore rules; the only way to win is for one wrestler to force their opponent into the back of an ambulance and close the door.\n\n=== Buried Alive match ===\nA [[Premature burial|Buried Alive]] match is a [[No Holds Barred match]] in which the object is for one wrestler to throw his opponent into a grave dug out of a large mound of soil placed outside the ring. Once in the grave, the wrestler must bury his opponent in soil to the referee's discretion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/buriedalivematch|title=Specialty Matches: Buried Alive Match|accessdate=2010-10-17|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325073927/http://www.wwe.com/inside/specialtymatches/buriedalivematch|archive-date=2008-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref> Equipment ranging from [[shovel]]s and [[wheelbarrow]]s to [[bulldozer]]s are often made available to completely bury the opponent.  All buried alive matches thus far have had [[The Undertaker]] as a competitor.\n\nA version of the match known as a \"Boneyard match\" was filmed for [[WrestleMania 36]], between The Undertaker and [[AJ Styles]]. The match was presented as a cinematic segment, taking place in a [[cemetery]]-like setting near an abandoned warehouse, rather than in a traditional ring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/wwe-triple-h-wrestlemania-coronavirus-impact/|title=WWE's Triple H Explains What It's Like to Film WrestleMania Without the Fans|date=April 2, 2020|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/wwe/news/wwe-wrestlemania-36-results-recap-grades-major-title-change-epic-undertaker-match-card-2020-highlights/live/|title=WWE WrestleMania 36 results, recap, grades: Major title change, epic Undertaker match, card, 2020 highlights|website=CBSSports.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== Casket match ===\n[[File:Chokeslam on....jpg|thumb|[[The Undertaker]] in a casket match against [[CM Punk]]]]\nThe casket match (originally known as the coffin match) has a casket near the ring, with the object of the match being to trap the opposing wrestler in it.<ref>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p. 194)</ref> The casket match began its life as a one-off coffin match in the 1970s fought between [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Ivan Koloff]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdown.org/blog.cfm/3162-user/2009/9/15/The-History-of-The-Casket-Match|title=The History of The Casket Match|access-date=2012-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613015437/http://www.fourdown.org/blog.cfm/3162-user/2009/9/15/The-History-of-The-Casket-Match|archive-date=2013-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/casket-match/|title=Casket Match|access-date=2012-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223085828/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/information/casket-match/|archive-date=2011-12-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myvideo.de/watch/4116115/Dusty_Rhodes_gegen_Ivan_Koloff_erstes_Casket_Match|title=Dusty Rhodes gegen Ivan Koloff erstes Casket Match}}</ref> The coffin match was revived by [[The Undertaker]] and first appeared at the [[Survivor Series (1992)|Survivor Series]] as the coffin match against [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]]. However, with 16 casket matches played, only 11 of them has the Undertaker won. \nIn addition to WWE, the casket match has recently been adopted for use in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] and [[Lucha Underground]], with Lucha Underground denominating it as the Grave Consequences (subsequently Graver Consequences) match.\n\n=== Dumpster match ===\nA dumpster match is a hardcore match which is won by forcing your opponent into a [[dumpster]]. The first one was at WrestleMania XIV, pitting [[The New Age Outlaws]] against [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]] and [[Terry Funk|Chainsaw Charlie]].\n\n=== Last Ride match ===\nA Last Ride match is a hardcore match in which the victory condition is for one wrestler to force their opponent into the back of a hearse, close the door, and drive it out of the arena. The first match of this type occurred at [[No Mercy (2004)|No Mercy]] when [[The Undertaker]] challenged [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] for the [[WWE Championship]], although a match was held previously with similar stipulations.\n\n=== Stretcher match ===\n[[File:Stretcher match.jpg|thumb|A stretcher at ringside prior to a stretcher match]]\nIn the stretcher match, one wrestler must incapacitate their opponent to such an extent that they are able to get them onto a stretcher and roll them to the finish line; usually past a line at the top of the entrance ramp. It cannot end in a pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification. The first match of this type was different as a wrestler lost if after being pushed out of the ring, four medics were able to load him on a \"carry\" stretcher, pick him up all the way, and start walking out with him.\n\n== Multi-competitor match variations ==\nOn some occasions, a match may be held between more than two individual wrestlers or teams.\n\n=== Basic non-elimination matches ===\nThe most common example of a non-elimination match is the three-way match (known as a triple-threat match in WWE and a triangle match in WCW among other promotions), in which three wrestlers compete under standard rules with the first competitor to achieve a pinfall or submission being declared the winner. One distinction from a singles match is that these matches usually exclude disqualifications or count-outs. In many promotions, there are typically no distinctions between the two terms. Variations are the four-way match (known as a fatal four-way in WWE), the five-way match or the six-way match, involving four, five, or six wrestlers, respectively.<ref>{{citation|publisher=WWE|title=Jordan vs. Elias vs. Dallas vs. Axel vs. The Hardy Boyz - Six-Pack Challenge, Raw, Sept. 19, 2017|date=September 18, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfBTiRfAzo|accessdate=September 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919223030/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSfBTiRfAzo|archive-date=2017-09-19|url-status=live}}</ref> American independent promotion USA Xtreme Wrestling (USA Pro Wrestling) hosted a match involving 8\u201312 competitors known as the 8 Ball Challenge. These types of matches can be used in certain situations to take a title off a wrestler without weakening him in the process.\n\nOn some occasions, multi-competitor matches are contested under similar rules as a [[tag team]] match. Two competitors start the match in the ring while the other wrestler(s) wait outside the ring for a tag from another wrestler, often achieved by touching an unsuspecting competitor in the ring. Variations of this include a Four Corners Survival or Six-Man Mayhem match in [[Ring of Honor]]. Competitors are permitted to leave their position and attack wrestlers outside of the ring, such as when one or both wrestlers have been thrown over the top rope.\n\n=== Championship Scramble ===\n[[WWE]] features a match called the Championship Scramble in which none of the [[List of WWE personnel|wrestlers]] are eliminated. Two wrestlers start the match and every five minutes another wrestler enters until all five participants are present. After the last wrestler enters, there is a predetermined time limit. Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall or submission, he becomes the interim champion. Such reigns are not recorded as title reigns. The winner is the wrestler who scores the last pinfall or submission before the time limit expires. The [[Unforgiven (2008)|Unforgiven]] pay-per view of 2008 is arguably the most prominent showcase of this match type, as all three world titles were contested under a Championship Scramble match.\n\n=== Basic elimination matches ===\nMatches involving a larger number of competitors are typically elimination matches. These matches may begin with all of the competitors in the ring at the same time, or may have a staggered start, with wrestlers entering at timed intervals. The standard match rules apply as wrestlers may leave their position and attack other wrestlers outside the ring, with a twist that should the wrestler be pinned or forced to submit, he is eliminated from the match. A common elimination match type was popularized in ECW and known as the ''Three way Dance,'' with the name lending itself to a 1995 Supercard.\n\n=== Battle royal ===\n{{main|Battle royal (professional wrestling)}}\nA multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left. Typical battle royals begin with 20 or so participants in the ring, who are then eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor (this is sometimes referred to as the \"Shawn Michaels rule\", due to the 1995 Royal Rumble, in which he was thrown over the top rope, hung on to the top rope and only had one foot land on the floor). A variation known as the \"Reverse battle royal\" existed in TNA.\n\n=== Gauntlet match ===\nA Gauntlet match, also referred to as a Turmoil match, is a quick series of one-fall one-on-one matches. Two wrestlers begin the match and are replaced whenever one is eliminated (by pinfall or submission). After a predetermined number of wrestlers have competed in the match, the last person standing is named the winner. A Gauntlet match may also be played out in multiple \"parts\" as part of a storyline (in which a face wrestler must face a series of a heel wrestler's underlings before facing the heel himself, for instance) \u2013 this was common in [[World Championship Wrestling]] in the early 1990s. A participant involved in a Gauntlet match may be said to be \"running the gauntlet\" (in most cases this designation being reserved for those who are involved for most of the match).\n\nIt could also be a one-on-three/four handicap match. Unlike tag matches, the three/four man team will challenge the person handicapped individually until he is knocked out, at which time the match is over.\n\nAs a tag team match, the Gauntlet match sees two tag teams begin the match and are replaced whenever one team is eliminated. This version is sometimes referred to as \"Tag team turmoil match\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BCk2nuPOxU |title=Tag Team Turmoil - WWE Raw Slam of the Week 1/12/2014 |access-date=2014-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310205305/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BCk2nuPOxU |archive-date=2016-03-10 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe most famous variation of the Gauntlet match is WWE's [[Royal Rumble]], a match that combines the concepts of a battle royal and the gauntlet match. In the match, a number of wrestlers, whom enter at different timed intervals, aim to eliminate their competitors by tossing them over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. The winner of the match is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated.\n\n=== Series variations{{anchor|Two out of three falls match|Best two out of three falls match|2 out of 3 falls match}} ===\nSometimes, a match is considered as a series of smaller matches, which may take place concurrently, consecutively, or even in different shows. The most common form of a series match is extending the one-fall concept to a series of falls, the most common being the best two out of three (known as a two out of three falls match). These types of series matches are often booked to the final match to emphasize the equality of the wrestlers involved, however, longer series may be shortened due to storyline or other factors. Series matches may involve the same match throughout, or may use different matches for some or all of the series. A series match may or may not involve the same wrestlers throughout (such as when a main competitor is forced to use a substitute in the event of an injury partway through).\n\n=== Beat the Clock challenge match ===\nA Beat the Clock challenge match is a match in which wrestlers must defeat their opponent before the clock runs out. In doing so, the victorious wrestler usually gets some type of reward in return, such as inclusion in a title match, for instance. In a variation on the November 20, 2013 episode of [[WWE NXT (TV Series)|NXT]], two wrestlers completed a match, with the match duration being used as the marker for two other wrestlers to complete their match.\n\n=== Elimination Chase ===\nThe Elimination Chase, first used in WWE's version of [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2007, is a series of multi-competitor, one fall matches, with the loser of the fall being eliminated from future matches until one competitor remains.<ref name=\"Elimination Chase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/09182007/articles/bigchase|title=The chase is on|first=Craig|last=Tello|accessdate=2007-10-03|publisher=WWE|quote=Ultimately, the [...] ECW General Manager mandated a three-week competition between all four Superstars that would [...] determine who would face champion CM Punk [...].

The album is the biggest-selling studio album of Ross's career, selling nine million copies worldwide and spawning three international hit singles, including the US and international number-one single \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\".\n\n==Conception==\nFollowing the US success of her 1979 album ''[[The Boss (Diana Ross album)|The Boss]]'', Ross wanted a fresher, more modern sound. Having heard [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s work in the famous Manhattan disco club, Studio 54, Ross approached him about creating a new album of material for her that stated where she felt she was in her life and career at the period.\n\nOn an episode of [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]]'s ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]'', Nile Rodgers said that the majority of the songs were crafted after direct conversations with Ross. She had reportedly said to Rodgers and Bernard Edwards that she wanted to turn her career \u201cupside down\u201d and wanted to \u201chave fun again.\u201d As a result, Rodgers and Edwards wrote the songs \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\" and \"Have Fun (Again)\". After running into several drag queens in a club dressed as Ross, Rodgers wrote \"[[I'm Coming Out]]\". Only \"[[My Old Piano]]\" came from their normal songwriting processes.\n\nInitially, Ross was not pleased with the album's results. Following a preview of the record to be released in the aftermath of the [[Disco#1979\u201381: Backlash and decline|anti-disco backlash]], [[Frankie Crocker]], an influential New York City disc jockey warned Ross that releasing the album in its original state would even lead to the end of her career. Ross remixed the entire album, assisted by Motown engineer Russ Terrana, removing extended instrumental passages and speeding up the tracks' tempos. Ross's lead vocals were also re-recorded and remixed so that they were front and center and not overshadowed by the music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soultrain.com/2015/05/04/classic-soul-album-spotlight-diana-ross-diana/|title=Soul Train Licensing Info|website=soultrain.com}}</ref>\n\nThe remixing of the master tapes was performed without the knowledge or approval of Rodgers and Edwards. When they were presented with the \"official\" version of ''diana'', the producers publicly objected and, at one point, even considered removing their names from the album's list of credits. Motown and Ross persisted and the version released was Terrana's more commercial mix of the album.\n\nRodgers and Edwards were contracted by Motown to produce a follow-up album, but, as Ross left the label, it was never created. Rodgers and Edwards sued Motown, unsuccessfully claiming that they were owed monies for creating and recording the original version of the album. In 1989, Rodgers and Ross collaborated on ''[[Workin' Overtime]]'' (No. 3 US R&B), released upon Ross's return to Motown. Edwards produced the 1984 single, \"Telephone\" (No. 13 US R&B), from Ross' ''[[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]]'' album, released on the RCA label. Rodgers played guitar on the new wave song, \"It's Your Move\", from the same album.\n \nThe iconic cover art was photographed by famed photographer [[Francesco Scavullo]].\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r16918 |tab=review |label=''diana'' > review |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev2score = A-<ref name=\"christgau\">{{Cite web | last = Christgau | first = Robert | title = ''diana'' > review | publisher = [[Robert Christgau]] | accessdate = 2016-04-18 | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1023}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/n716 703]|quote=diana ross the rolling stone album guide.|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|first1=Nathan|last1=Brackett|first2=Christian David|last2=Hoard|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Smash Hits]]''\n| rev4score = 5/10<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hillier|first=Bev|title=Albums|journal=[[Smash Hits]]|issue=June 26 \u2013 July 9, 1980|page=31}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Robert Christgau]], writing for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', gave the album an A- rating.

This was unheard of, especially for a label like Motown. However, by its 4th week leading into summer, the album was already nearing the top 10. \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\" eventually was chosen by the label and radio programmers. \"Upside Down\" made a rare vaulted move in its third week from number 49 to number 10. By the middle of summer 1980, Ross chalked up her fifth number one single.\n\nThe album spent 17 weeks at the top of ''Billboard''{{'}}s R&B/Dance chart. Reaching number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and number one on the ''Billboard'' Soul Albums Chart for 8 consecutive weeks, as well as yielding two top 10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including the number-one single \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\", the album would sell over one million copies in the United States and be certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In the UK it went Gold and spun off three successful singles; \"Upside Down\" (No. 2), \"My Old Piano\" (No. 5) and \"I'm Coming Out\" (No. 13). A fourth single, \"Tenderness\", was also released in certain territories, reaching the top 40 in the Netherlands, and was later included on several greatest hits compilations. Despite its massive dance and dance radio success, none of the singles from ''Diana'' were remixed for promotional and/or commercial use while the album was current.\n\n\"[[I'm Coming Out]]\" has since become an anthem for the LGBT movement.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nSome thirty years after its release, ''Diana'' remains Ross's best-selling studio album to date having sold a total of over 10 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.elsewhere.co.nz/absoluteelsewhere/4663/diana-ross-coming-out-in-80-from-soul-pop-princess-to-chic-dancefloor-diva/ |title=DIANA ROSS, COMING OUT IN '80: From soul-pop princess to Chic dancefloor diva |last=Reid |first=Graham |date=March 2, 2012 |publisher=Elsewhere |access-date=February 3, 2019 |quote=To date the album has sold more than 10 million copies.}}</ref>\n\n''Diana'' was one of four albums written and produced by Edwards and Rodgers in 1980, the other three being  [[Sister Sledge]]'s ''[[Love Somebody Today]]'', [[Sheila and B.

The first album for the label was 1981's self-produced ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (album)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'', which went platinum and spawned two Top 10 hits in the US.

The album is the biggest-selling studio album of Ross's career, selling nine million copies worldwide and spawning three international hit singles, including the US and International number 1 hit \"Upside Down\".\n\n==Conception==\nFollowing the US success of her 1979 album ''[[The Boss (Diana Ross album)|The Boss]]'', Ross wanted a fresher, more modern sound. Having heard [[Nile Rodgers]] of [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s work in the famous Manhattan disco club, Studio 54, Ross approached him about creating a new album of material for her that stated where she felt she was in her life and career at the period.\n\nOn an episode of [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]]'s ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]'', Nile Rodgers said that the majority of the songs were crafted after direct conversations with Ross. She had reportedly said to Rodgers and Bernard Edwards that she wanted to turn her career \u201cupside down\u201d and wanted to \u201chave fun again.\u201d As a result, Rodgers and Edwards wrote the songs \"[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\" and \"Have Fun (Again)\". After running into several drag queens in a club dressed as Ross, Rodgers wrote \"[[I'm Coming Out]]\". Only \"[[My Old Piano]]\" came from their normal songwriting processes.\n\nInitially, Ross was not pleased with the album's results. Following a preview of the record to be released in the aftermath of the [[Disco#1979\u201381: Backlash and decline|anti-disco backlash]], [[Frankie Crocker]], an influential New York City disc jockey warned Ross that releasing the album in its original state would even lead to the end of her career. Ross remixed the entire album, assisted by Motown engineer Russ Terrana, removing extended instrumental passages and speeding up the tracks' tempos. Ross's lead vocals were also re-recorded and remixed so that they were front and center and not overshadowed by the music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soultrain.com/2015/05/04/classic-soul-album-spotlight-diana-ross-diana/|title=Soul Train Licensing Info|website=soultrain.com}}</ref>\n\nThe remixing of the master tapes was performed without the knowledge or approval of Rodgers and Edwards. When they were presented with the \"official\" version of ''diana'', the producers publicly objected and, at one point, even considered removing their names from the album's list of credits. Motown and Ross persisted and the version released was Terrana's more commercial mix of the album.\n\nRodgers and Edwards were contracted by Motown to produce a follow-up album, but, as Ross left the label, it was never created. Rodgers and Edwards sued Motown, unsuccessfully claiming that they were owed monies for creating and recording the original version of the album. In 1989, Rodgers and Ross collaborated on ''[[Workin' Overtime]]'' (No. 3 US R&B), released upon Ross's return to Motown. Edwards produced the 1984 single, \"Telephone\" (No. 13 US R&B), from Ross' ''[[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]]'' album, released on the RCA label. Rodgers played guitar on the new wave song, \"It's Your Move\", from the same album.\n \nThe iconic cover art was photographed by famed photographer [[Francesco Scavullo]].\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r16918 |tab=review |label=''diana'' > review |first=William |last=Ruhlmann |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev2score = A-<ref name=\"christgau\">{{Cite web | last = Christgau | first = Robert | title = ''diana'' > review | publisher = [[Robert Christgau]] | accessdate = 2016-04-18 | url = http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_album.php?id=1023}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev3score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/n716 703]|quote=diana ross the rolling stone album guide.|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|first1=Nathan|last1=Brackett|first2=Christian David|last2=Hoard|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Smash Hits]]''\n| rev4score = 5/10<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hillier|first=Bev|title=Albums|journal=[[Smash Hits]]|issue=June 26 \u2013 July 9, 1980|page=31}}</ref>\n}}\n[[Robert Christgau]], writing for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', gave the album an A- rating.

''Diana'' was remastered and released as a double CD in 2003 containing the original Chic Mixes and the Motown final mixes, unremixed versions, together with a selection of other Motown dance tracks from the same period.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Bernard Edwards]] and [[Nile Rodgers]].<ref name=\"liner notes\">{{cite AV media notes |title=Diana |type=liner notes |others=[[Diana Ross]]|publisher=[[Motown Records]] |year=1980}}</ref>\n===Original release===\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side A\n| total_length    =\n\n| title1          = [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\n| length1         = 4:05\n\n| title2          = Tenderness\n| length2         = 3:52\n\n| title3          = Friend to Friend\n| length3         = 3:19\n\n| title4          = [[I'm Coming Out]]\n| length4         = 5:24\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = Side B\n| total_length    =\n\n| title1          = Have Fun (Again)\n| length1         = 5:57\n\n| title2          = [[My Old Piano]]\n| length2         = 3:55\n\n| title3          = Now That You're Gone\n| length3         = 3:59\n\n| title4          = Give Up\n| length4         = 3:45\n}}\n\n===2001 (UK) / 2003 (US) deluxe edition===\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = CD 1 \n| total_length    =\n| collapsed       = yes\n\n| title1          = [[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]\n| length1         = 4:05\n\n| title2          = Tenderness\n| length2         = 3:52\n\n| title3          = Friend to Friend\n| length3         = 3:19\n\n| title4          = [[I'm Coming Out]]\n| length4         = 5:24\n\n| title5          = Have Fun (Again)\n| length5         = 5:57\n\n| title6          = [[My Old Piano]]\n| length6         = 3:55\n\n| title7          = Now That You're Gone\n| length7         = 3:59\n\n| title8          = Give Up\n| length8         = 3:45\n\n| title9          = Upside Down\n| note9           = Original Chic Mix\n| length9         = 4:17\n\n| title10         = Tenderness\n| note10          = Original Chic Mix\n| length10        = 5:10\n\n| title11         = Friend to Friend\n| note11          = Original Chic Mix\n| length11        = 3:20\n\n| title12         = I'm Coming Out\n| note12          = Original Chic Mix\n| length12        = 6:01\n\n| title13         = Have Fun (Again)\n| note13          = Original Chic Mix\n| length13        = 7:09\n\n| title14         = My Old Piano\n| note14          = Original Chic Mix\n| length14        = 4:52\n\n| title15         = Now That You're Gone\n| note15          = Original Chic Mix\n| length15        = 3:40\n\n| title16         = Give Up\n| note16          = Original Chic Mix\n| length16        = 3:59\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline        = CD 2\n| total_length    =\n| collapsed       = yes\n\n| title1          = [[Love Hangover]]\n| note1           = Extended Alternate Mix\n| length1         = 10:25\n\n| title2          = Your Love Is So Good for Me\n| note2           = 12-Inch Version\n| length2         = 6:36\n\n| title3          = Top of the World\n| length3         = 3:09\n\n| title4          = Lovin', Livin' and Givin'\n| note4           = ''Ross'' Album Remix\n| length4         = 5:12\n\n| title5          = What You Gave Me\n| note5           = 12-Inch Version\n| length5         = 6:08\n\n| title6          = You Were the One\n| length6         = 4:04\n\n| title7          = The Diana Ross & the Supremes Medley of Hits\n| note7           = 12-inch Mix\n| length7         = 9:59\n\n| title8          = No One Gets the Prize\"/\"The Boss\n| note8           = 12-Inch Re-Edit\n| length8         = 9:41\n\n| title9          = I Ain't Been Licked\n| note9           = 12-inch Mix\n| length9         = 5:18\n\n| title10         = Fire Don't Burn\n| length10        = 3:26\n\n| title11         = We Can Never Light That Old Flame Again\n| note11          = Alternate Mix\n| length11        = 4:38\n\n| title12         = You Build Me Up to Tear Me Down\n| length12        = 5:42\n\n| title13         = Sweet Summertime Livin'\n| length13        = 4:25\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n===Musicians===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* Diana Ross \u2013 lead vocals\n* Alfa Anderson \u2013 background vocals\n* [[Fonzi Thornton]] \u2013 background vocals\n* Luci Martin \u2013 background vocals\n* Michelle Cobbs \u2013 background vocals\n* [[Bernard Edwards]] \u2013 bass guitar\n* [[Nile Rodgers]] \u2013 guitar\n* [[Tony Thompson (drummer)|Tony Thompson]] \u2013 drums\n* Andy Barrett (Schwartz) \u2013 piano<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1drv.ms/1CsbRMU|title=Microsoft OneDrive - Access files anywhere.

Many religions, both [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and [[monotheism|monotheistic]], have [[deity|deities]] associated with the sky.\n\nThe day lit sky deities are typically distinct from the night time sky deities. [[Stith Thompson]]'s ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature'' reflects this by separating the category of \"Sky-god\" (A210) from that of \"Star-god\" (A250). In mythology, night time gods are usually known as night deities and gods of stars simply as star gods. Both of these categories are included here since they relate to the sky. Luminary deities are included as well since the sun and moon are located in the sky. Some religions may also have a deity or personification of the day, distinct from the god of the day lit sky, to complement the deity or personification of the night.\n\nDay time gods and night time gods are frequently deities of an \"[[Upper World (Greek)|upper world\"]] or \"celestial world\" opposed to the \"[[Underworld|netherworld]]\" and earth ruled by other gods (underworld and earth gods are collectively known as chthonic deities). For example, sky gods [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] rule the celestial realm in ancient Greece while the chthonic realm is ruled by [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]]. The tripartite division of the world into sky/heaven/upper, earth/middle, and under/nether/lower seems to be a universal feature of all human religions. Sea gods may be included with chthonic deities or form a separate, third category. Water, both fresh and salt, is often associated with the earth/underworld, giving rise to an alternate tripartite division of sky, land, and sea, where sea seemingly takes the place of the underworld.\n\nAny masculine sky god is often also [[king of the gods]], taking the position of [[patriarch]] within a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Such king gods are collectively categorized as \"[[sky father]]\" deities, with a polarity between sky and earth often being expressed by pairing a \"sky father\" god with an \"[[earth mother]]\" goddess (pairings of a sky ''mother'' with an earth ''father'' are less frequent). A main sky goddess is often the queen of the gods and may be an air/sky goddess in her own right, though she usually has other functions as well with \"sky\" not being her main. In antiquity, several sky goddesses in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Near East were called [[Queen of Heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]. Neopagans often apply it with impunity to sky goddesses from other regions who were never associated with the term historically. \n\nGods may rule the sky as a pair (for example, [[ancient Semitic religion|ancient Semitic]] supreme god [[El (deity)|El]] and the fertility goddess [[Asherah]] whom he was most likely paired with).<ref>El was identified with the obscure deity [[Yahweh]] in early Hebrew religion, ultimately giving rise to [[God in Judaism|Hebrew monotheism]] by the 7th century BCE; according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] it was 7th-century Judean king [[Josiah]] who removed the statue of Asherah from the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem.

Many religions, both [[polytheism|polytheistic]] and [[monotheism|monotheistic]], have [[deity|deities]] associated with the sky.\n\nThe day lit sky deities are typically distinct from the night time sky deities. [[Stith Thompson]]'s ''Motif-Index of Folk-Literature'' reflects this by separating the category of \"Sky-god\" (A210) from that of \"Star-god\" (A250). In mythology, night time gods are usually known as night deities and gods of stars simply as star gods. Both of these categories are included here since they relate to the sky. Luminary deities are included as well since the sun and moon are located in the sky. Some religions may also have a deity or personification of the day, distinct from the god of the day lit sky, to complement the deity or personification of the night.\n\nDay time gods and night time gods are frequently deities of an \"[[Upper World (Greek)|upper world\"]] or \"celestial world\" opposed to the \"[[Underworld|netherworld]]\" and earth ruled by other gods (underworld and earth gods are collectively known as chthonic deities). For example, sky gods [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]] rule the celestial realm in ancient Greece while the chthonic realm is ruled by [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]]. The tripartite division of the world into sky/heaven/upper, earth/middle, and under/nether/lower seems to be a universal feature of all human religions. Sea gods may be included with chthonic deities or form a separate, third category. Water, both fresh and salt, is often associated with the earth/underworld, giving rise to an alternate tripartite division of sky, land, and sea, where sea seemingly takes the place of the underworld.\n\nAny masculine sky god is often also [[king of the gods]], taking the position of [[patriarch]] within a [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. Such king gods are collectively categorized as \"[[sky father]]\" deities, with a polarity between sky and earth often being expressed by pairing a \"sky father\" god with an \"[[earth mother]]\" goddess (pairings of a sky ''mother'' with an earth ''father'' are less frequent). A main sky goddess is often the queen of the gods and may be an air/sky goddess in her own right, though she usually has other functions as well with \"sky\" not being her main. In antiquity, several sky goddesses in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Near East were called [[Queen of Heaven (antiquity)|Queen of Heaven]]. Neopagans often apply it with impunity to sky goddesses from other regions who were never associated with the term historically. \n\nGods may rule the sky as a pair (for example, [[ancient Semitic religion|ancient Semitic]] supreme god [[El (deity)|El]] and the fertility goddess [[Asherah]] whom he was most likely paired with).<ref>El was identified with the obscure deity [[Yahweh]] in early Hebrew religion, ultimately giving rise to [[God in Judaism|Hebrew monotheism]] by the 7th century BCE; according to the [[Hebrew Bible]] it was 7th-century Judean king [[Josiah]] who removed the statue of Asherah from the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem. See also ''[[The Hebrew Goddess]]''.</ref> The following is a list of sky deities in various polytheistic traditions arranged mostly by language family, which is typically a better indicator of relatedness than geography.\n\n==[[Indo-European languages]]==\n===Proto-Indo-European===\n*[[Dyeus]], the chief [[sky father]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion]]\n*[[Hausos]], dawn goddess and daughter of Dyeus\n* Menot, moon god\n* Seul, sun goddess\n\n===Albanian===\n*[[Perendi]], god of the light, sky and heaven\n*[[Zojz (deity)|Zojz]], god of the sky and lightning\n\n===Baltic===\n* [[Au\u0161taras]], the god of the northeast wind\n*[[Dievas|Dievs]], the god of the day-lit sky and the chief god in [[Latvian mythology]]\n* [[Vejopatis]], the god of the wind who guards the divine realm of [[Latvian mythology|Dausos]]\n\n===Celtic===\n* [[Latobius]], sky and mountain god equated with the Greek gods Zeus and Ares\n* [[Nuada]], god of the sky, wind, and war\n* [[Sulis]], goddess of the hot springs at Bath; probably originally the pan-Celtic sun goddess\n\n===Germanic===\n*[[Dagr]], personification of day\n*[[Eostre]], spring and fertility goddess; originally the Germanic dawn goddess \n*[[M\u00e1ni|M\u0113n\u00f4]], the moon\n*[[N\u00f3tt]], personification of night\n*[[S\u00f3l (sun)|S\u014dwil\u014d]], the sun\n*[[Teiwaz]], early Germanic sky god, also the god of law, justice, and the [[thing (assembly)]]\n\n===Greek===\n* [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], primeval god of the upper air\n* [[Astraeus]], dusk god\n* [[Eos]], dawn goddess\n* [[Helios]], personification of the sun\n* [[Hemera]], primordial goddess of day\n* [[Hera]], goddess of the air, marriage, women, women's fertility, childbirth, heirs, kings, and empires\n* [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], goddess of the rainbow and messenger of Hera\n* [[Nephele]], cloud nymph in Hera's likeness\n* [[Nyx]], primordial goddess of night\n* [[Selene]], personification of the moon\n* [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], primeval god of the sky\n* [[Zeus]], king of the gods, ruler of [[Mount Olympus]], god of the sky, weather, law, order, and civilization\n\n===Hindu===\n* [[Aditi]], celestial mother of the gods\n* [[Chandra]], god of the moon\n* [[Dyaus Pita]], sky father\n* [[Indra]], king of the gods, associated with weather\n* [[Ratri]], goddess of night\n* [[Saranyu]], goddess of clouds\n* [[Surya]], god of the sun\n* [[Ushas]], goddess of dawn\n\n===Iranian===\n\n*[[Asman|Asm\u0101n]], god of sky\n*[[Mah|M\u0101h]], god of the moon\n*[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]], sky father, the Great God\n*[[Tishtrya|T\u012b\u0161tar]], god of Sirius star and Rainfall.\n*[[Hvare-khshaeta|Xwarx\u0161\u0113d]], god of the sun\n*[[Usha (goddess)|U\u0161a]], goddess of dawn\n\n===Roman===\n*[[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]], dawn goddess\n* [[Caelus]], personification of the sky, equivalent to the Greek [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]\n* [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], goddess of the sky, queen of the gods, and Jupiter's wife, equivalent to the Greek [[Hera]]\n* [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], king of heaven and god of the sky and weather, equivalent to the Greek [[Zeus]]\n* [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], moon goddess\n* Nox, Roman version of Nyx, night goddess and mother of Discordia\n* [[Sol (mythology)|Sol]], sun god\n* [[Summanus]], god of nocturnal thunder/lightning\n\n===Slavic===\n* [[Stribog]], god of the winds, sky, and air\n* [[Triglav (mythology)|Triglav]], a triple god whose three heads represent sky, earth, and underworld\n\n===Thracian and Phrygian===\n* [[Sabazios]], sky father\n\n==[[Afro-Asiatic]]==\n===Ancient Egyptian===\n* [[Amun]], god of creation and the wind\n* [[Anhur]], originally a foreign war god who became associated with the air god, Shu\n* [[Hathor]], originally a sky goddess\n* [[Horus]], god of the sun, sky, kings, and war\n* [[Khonsu]], moon god\n* [[Mehet-Weret]], goddess of the sky\n* [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], goddess of the sky\n* [[Ra]], god of the sun\n* [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]], god of the air\n* [[Thoth]], originally a moon god, later became a writing/knowledge god and the scribe of the other gods\n\n===Berber===\n* [[Acham\u00e1n]], [[Guanches|Guanche]] creator and sky god\n* [[Achuhucanac]], Guanche rain god, associated with the sky god Acham\u00e1n\n\n===Semitic===\n{{further information|Ancient Semitic religion}}\n* [[Asherah]], sky goddess and consort of El; after the rise of Yahweh, she may have become Yahweh's consort before being demonized and the Israelite religion going monotheistic \n* [[Baalshamin]], \"Lord of the Heavens\" (c.f.

Developed in 1871, the first professionally designed cemetery in the city accepted its first burial in 1872. Its location at Washington Avenue overlooking [[Buffalo Bayou]] served as an entertainment attraction in the 1880s. The design was based on principles for garden cemeteries, breaking the pattern of the typical gridiron layouts of most Houston cemeteries. Many influential people lay to rest at Glenwood, making it the \"[[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks]] of the dead.\" As of 2018, Glenwood includes the annexed property of the adjacent Washington Cemetery, creating a total area of 84 acres with 18 acres still undeveloped.\n\nNotable burials at Glenwood include former residents of the Republic of Texas, some who were re-interred from condemned cemeteries from downtown Houston. Charlotte Allen and William Robinson Baker were early arrivals to Houston, and also long time residents. Baker was one of several interments of former mayors of Houston. The last president of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones, has a family plot. Former governors of Texas and a former governor of Mississippi lie at rest at the cemetery, as do some high-ranking federal officials. Scions of the oil business include two co-founders of Sharp-Hughes Tools, as well as founders and early investors of Texaco and Humble Oil. The founding president of Rice University, the school's chief architect, and the institute's first trustee are found at Glenwood.\n\n==History==\nGlenwood Cemetery developed on two tracts of land on the north side of Buffalo Bayou, and west of [[Downtown Houston]]. Part of this land conveyed from the country estate of Archibald Wynns, a Houston lawyer and Congressman for the [[Republic of Texas]]. This tract was later the location of a brickyard, then the property of [[William Harrison King]], who served as [[mayor of Houston]]. Glenwood Cemetery purchased the property and some adjacent land in the Hollingsworth Survey in 1870. Alfred Whitaker gained a charter to incorporate the Houston Cemetery Company. He owned his own landscaping company and used his expertise to clear out lots, lay out and grade right of ways, and otherwise beautify the landscape. Glenwood hosted its first burial on June 19, 1872. Many remains were reinterred at Glenwood after the condemnations of St. Vincent's and the Episcopal cemeteries.<ref>Aulbach (2012), pp. 193{{endash}}195</ref> Glenwood obtained its state charter as the Houston Cemetery Company, starting as for-profit institution, the first state charter for a cemetery. About 25 years later, the Houston Cemetery Company changed its status to non-profit.<ref>Turner and Wilson (2010), p. 46.</ref>\n\nBy 1874, Glenwood was a recreational destination. A mule-drawn street railway operated on [[Washington Avenue (Houston)|Washington Road]], conveying people to Glenwood for weekend and holiday visits. Upgrades and expansions to the street railways were both a response to demand for travel to the cemetery and a cause of it. Glenwood remained popular for about twenty years. A group led by W. D. Cleveland criticized the conditions of lots and roads in 1896 and asked for a receivership to manage Glenwood. Two court decisions resulted in a transfer of management to William Christian. Glenwood underwent reorganization in 1904, and more recently was reorganized as the non-profit Glenwood Cemetery, Incorporated in 1969. A separate organization, the Glenwood Cemetery Historic Preservation Foundation, started overseeing historic preservation of the property in 1999. The same year Glenwood acquired the adjacent Washington Cemetery, expanding its land area by 118 acres.<ref>Aulbach (2012), pp. 196{{endash}}198.</ref>\n\nKeith Rosen, a [[Houston]] area history professor quoted in the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', said that the cemetery is the \"[[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks]] of the dead.\"<ref name=\"Davis\">Davis, Rod. \"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&p_theme=saec&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FCBCB6042BB9F95&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Houston's really good idea Bus tour celebrates communities that forged a city.]\" ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''.

Parts of the property afford views of the downtown Houston skyline, of Memorial Drive, and of Allen Parkway. The grounds are shaded by numerous hardwoods, and the bluffs are cut by deep ravines leading to the bayou. The grounds have formal landscaping, and a diversity of statues and monuments.<ref>Turner and Wilson (2010), p. xvii.</ref> The property covers 84 acres, with 18 acres still undeveloped as of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glenwoodcemetery.org/|access-date=October 31, 2018|title=Welcome to Glenwood Cemetery}}</ref>\n\nAccording to architectural historian, Stephen Fox, many of Houston's earlier cemeteries featured a gridiron arrangement of grave sites, following a pattern of urban cemeteries.

Developed in 1871, the first professionally designed cemetery in the city accepted its first burial in 1872. Its location at Washington Avenue overlooking [[Buffalo Bayou]] served as an entertainment attraction in the 1880s. The design was based on principles for garden cemeteries, breaking the pattern of the typical gridiron layouts of most Houston cemeteries. Many influential people lay to rest at Glenwood, making it the \"[[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks]] of the dead.\" As of 2018, Glenwood includes the annexed property of the adjacent Washington Cemetery, creating a total area of 84 acres with 18 acres still undeveloped.\n\nNotable burials at Glenwood include former residents of the Republic of Texas, some who were re-interred from condemned cemeteries from downtown Houston. Charlotte Allen and William Robinson Baker were early arrivals to Houston, and also long time residents. Baker was one of several interments of former mayors of Houston. The last president of the Republic of Texas, Anson Jones, has a family plot. Former governors of Texas and a former governor of Mississippi lie at rest at the cemetery, as do some high-ranking federal officials. Scions of the oil business include two co-founders of Sharp-Hughes Tools, as well as founders and early investors of Texaco and Humble Oil. The founding president of Rice University, the school's chief architect, and the institute's first trustee are found at Glenwood.\n\n==History==\nGlenwood Cemetery developed on two tracts of land on the north side of Buffalo Bayou, and west of [[Downtown Houston]]. Part of this land conveyed from the country estate of Archibald Wynns, a Houston lawyer and Congressman for the [[Republic of Texas]]. This tract was later the location of a brickyard, then the property of [[William Harrison King]], who served as [[mayor of Houston]]. Glenwood Cemetery purchased the property and some adjacent land in the Hollingsworth Survey in 1870. Alfred Whitaker gained a charter to incorporate the Houston Cemetery Company. He owned his own landscaping company and used his expertise to clear out lots, lay out and grade right of ways, and otherwise beautify the landscape. Glenwood hosted its first burial on June 19, 1872. Many remains were reinterred at Glenwood after the condemnations of St. Vincent's and the Episcopal cemeteries.<ref>Aulbach (2012), pp. 193{{endash}}195</ref> Glenwood obtained its state charter as the Houston Cemetery Company, starting as for-profit institution, the first state charter for a cemetery. About 25 years later, the Houston Cemetery Company changed its status to non-profit.<ref>Turner and Wilson (2010), p. 46.</ref>\n\nBy 1874, Glenwood was a recreational destination. A mule-drawn street railway operated on [[Washington Avenue (Houston)|Washington Road]], conveying people to Glenwood for weekend and holiday visits. Upgrades and expansions to the street railways were both a response to demand for travel to the cemetery and a cause of it. Glenwood remained popular for about twenty years. A group led by W. D. Cleveland criticized the conditions of lots and roads in 1896 and asked for a receivership to manage Glenwood. Two court decisions resulted in a transfer of management to William Christian. Glenwood underwent reorganization in 1904, and more recently was reorganized as the non-profit Glenwood Cemetery, Incorporated in 1969. A separate organization, the Glenwood Cemetery Historic Preservation Foundation, started overseeing historic preservation of the property in 1999. The same year Glenwood acquired the adjacent Washington Cemetery, expanding its land area by 118 acres.<ref>Aulbach (2012), pp. 196{{endash}}198.</ref>\n\nKeith Rosen, a [[Houston]] area history professor quoted in the ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]'', said that the cemetery is the \"[[River Oaks, Houston|River Oaks]] of the dead.\"<ref name=\"Davis\">Davis, Rod. \"[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SAEC&p_theme=saec&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0FCBCB6042BB9F95&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM Houston's really good idea Bus tour celebrates communities that forged a city.]\" ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''.
