===\nOn 2-3 November, al-Hashimi's caliphacy was criticized as illegitimate by the al-Wafa\u2019 Media Agency, an online media outlet previously aligned with ISIL before turning against it in March 2019. It was argued that \"the Prophet decreed obedience to leaders who exist and who are known \u2026 not obedience to a nonentity or an unknown\". Further, it was argued that the council which elected al-Hashimi did not qualify as a legitimate since it lacked 3 qualifications for the caliph\u2019s electors: justice, knowledge, and wisdom - which the council lacked, since it had sent Baghdadi to Idlib, which had earlier deemed by them a \"land of unbelief\", when he \"would have been much safer hiding in the desert\". Further disqualifying the council was the fact that the council had \"shed innocent Muslim blood and embraced extremism in the practice of excommunication\" ([[takfir]]). As a final note, the al-Wafa\u2019 Media Agency stated that nothing was left for a would-be caliph to preside over - \u201cYou do not recognize that God has destroyed your state on account of your oppression.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|title=Caliph Incognito: The Ridicule of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi|last=Succession|first=Caliph Abu Unknown:|last2=says|first2=Legitimacy in the Islamic State-War on the Rocks|website=www.jihadica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102184946/http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|archive-date=2020-01-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, al-Hashimi received pledges of allegiance from ISIL's [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Sinai Province|Sinai province]] (2 Nov), Bangladeshi affiliates (2 Nov), [[Islamic State in Somalia|Somali province]] (3 Nov), Pakistani province (4 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province|Yemen province]] (4 Nov), Hauran province (5 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province|Khorasan Province]] (5 Nov), [[ISIL insurgency in Tunisia|Tunisia province]] (6 Nov), [[Boko Haram|West Africa province]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Homs]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - al-Khayr (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Raqqa]] (7 Nov), [[Abu Sayyaf|East Asia Province]] (7 Nov), [[Islamic State's Central Africa Province|Central Africa Province]] (7 Nov), West Asia Province (8 Nov), West Africa Province - Mali and Burkina Faso (9 Nov), [[Al-Barakah (ISIL administrative district)|Levant Province - al-Barakah]] (9 Nov), Levant Province - Halab (12 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Baghdad]] (14 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|Libya Province]] (15 Nov), Iraq Province - Dijlah (16 Nov), Iraq Province - Diyala (17 Nov), Iraq Province - Salah al-Din (18 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Kirkuk]] (19 Nov), East Asia Province - Indonesia (22 Nov), Azerbaijani affiliates (29 Nov),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|title=The Islamic State's Bayat Campaign|website=jihadology.net|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221213303/https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|archive-date=2019-12-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2020 from ISIL's Malian affiliates (31 Jan).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2020/01/jihadists-in-central-mali-pledge-allegiance-to-new-islamic-state-leader.php |title= Jihadists in central Mali pledge allegiance to new Islamic State leader |author= Caleb weiss |work=Long War Journal |date=31 January 2020 |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> These pledges of allegiance appeared to be intended to illustrate the legitimacy and unanimous acceptance of al-Hashimi, to counter criticism that he was unknown and illegitimate.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nFollowing an attack on the [[Tajikistan\u2013Uzbekistan border]] that killed 17 people on 7 November, the attackers declared allegiance to al-Hashimi prior to the attack, according to journalist [[Rukmini Callimachi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/1192877066116587520|title=1.

2019. It was argued that \"the Prophet decreed obedience to leaders who exist and who are known \u2026 not obedience to a nonentity or an unknown\". Further, it was argued that the council which elected al-Hashimi did not qualify as a legitimate since it lacked 3 qualifications for the caliph\u2019s electors: justice, knowledge, and wisdom - which the council lacked, since it had sent Baghdadi to Idlib, which had earlier deemed by them a \"land of unbelief\", when he \"would have been much safer hiding in the desert\". Further disqualifying the council was the fact that the council had \"shed innocent Muslim blood and embraced extremism in the practice of excommunication\" ([[takfir]]). As a final note, the al-Wafa\u2019 Media Agency stated that nothing was left for a would-be caliph to preside over - \u201cYou do not recognize that God has destroyed your state on account of your oppression.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|title=Caliph Incognito: The Ridicule of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi|last=Succession|first=Caliph Abu Unknown:|last2=says|first2=Legitimacy in the Islamic State-War on the Rocks|website=www.jihadica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102184946/http://www.jihadica.com/caliph-incognito/|archive-date=2020-01-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, al-Hashimi received pledges of allegiance from ISIL's [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Sinai Province|Sinai province]] (2 Nov), Bangladeshi affiliates (2 Nov), [[Islamic State in Somalia|Somali province]] (3 Nov), Pakistani province (4 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Yemen Province|Yemen province]] (4 Nov), Hauran province (5 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \u2013 Khorasan Province|Khorasan Province]] (5 Nov), [[ISIL insurgency in Tunisia|Tunisia province]] (6 Nov), [[Boko Haram|West Africa province]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Homs]] (7 Nov), Levant Province - al-Khayr (7 Nov), Levant Province - [[Raqqa]] (7 Nov), [[Abu Sayyaf|East Asia Province]] (7 Nov), [[Islamic State's Central Africa Province|Central Africa Province]] (7 Nov), West Asia Province (8 Nov), West Africa Province - Mali and Burkina Faso (9 Nov), [[Al-Barakah (ISIL administrative district)|Levant Province - al-Barakah]] (9 Nov), Levant Province - Halab (12 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Baghdad]] (14 Nov), [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|Libya Province]] (15 Nov), Iraq Province - Dijlah (16 Nov), Iraq Province - Diyala (17 Nov), Iraq Province - Salah al-Din (18 Nov), Iraq Province - [[Kirkuk]] (19 Nov), East Asia Province - Indonesia (22 Nov), Azerbaijani affiliates (29 Nov),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|title=The Islamic State's Bayat Campaign|website=jihadology.net|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221213303/https://jihadology.net/2019/11/03/the-islamic-states-bayat-campaign/|archive-date=2019-12-21|url-status=live}}</ref> and in 2020 from ISIL's Malian affiliates (31 Jan).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2020/01/jihadists-in-central-mali-pledge-allegiance-to-new-islamic-state-leader.php |title= Jihadists in central Mali pledge allegiance to new Islamic State leader |author= Caleb weiss |work=Long War Journal |date=31 January 2020 |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> These pledges of allegiance appeared to be intended to illustrate the legitimacy and unanimous acceptance of al-Hashimi, to counter criticism that he was unknown and illegitimate.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nFollowing an attack on the [[Tajikistan\u2013Uzbekistan border]] that killed 17 people on 7 November, the attackers declared allegiance to al-Hashimi prior to the attack, according to journalist [[Rukmini Callimachi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/rcallimachi/status/1192877066116587520|title=1.

He is of Japanese descent, has black hair with red streaks at the end, and has [[Heterochromia iridum|heterochromia]]; his left eye is green and his right eye is violet. He is confident, cheerful, impulsive and gets bored easily. He is skilled at picking any kind of mechanical or electronic lock. The sole exceptions are the shackles on his neck, wrists and ankles which were placed on him mysteriously when he was asleep by a guard with a scar on the back of his neck. His father was inmate number 610 at the Nanba prison and known as the shame of the Nanba prison. He hates the guard who placed the shackles on him, and longs to find him and have them removed. He states that he has to be in Nanba as he has been to all other prisons. His name just means 'fifteen'.\n;{{nihongo|Uno|\u30a6\u30ce}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tetsuya Kakihara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Alejandro Saab}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1311. He is of British descent, has a long braid, wears a hat, loves women and gambling, and often has a pair of cards on hand. He has a great intuition and is able to make bets on what outcome will occur using his observational skills, luck and intuition. He is kind and outgoing (to the point of being silly) but can be blunt. He is often the one who keeps the others in line when Hajime isn't around, and Nico jokes that he's starting to act like he's their mother. He's also very loyal to Jyugo, whom he claims saved his life and gave him his freedom back. After Jyugo is beaten within an inch of his life by Hajime, he holds a deep anger against Hajime, stating he could never come to like prison guards. He broke out of his previous prisons because he had dates to attend.\n;{{nihongo|Rock|\u30ed\u30c3\u30af|Rokku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Airu Shiozaki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|Jarrod Greene}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate number 1369. He is American, has a mohawk, wears long feather earrings, and is the physically largest of his fellow cell mates. He loves fighting and eating and is incredibly strong, with only some of the supervisors being stronger. He can be short tempered and impulsive, but cares for his friends, and mostly remains peaceful and happy. He met Jyugo when the other inmate saved him from starving to death in the first prison he was sent to. He escaped other prisons because the food was terrible, but likes the cooking at Nanba.\n;{{nihongo|Nico|\u30cb\u30b3|Niko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daiki Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Justin Briner]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:Inmate 1325. An American effeminate short male with green hair and bandages on the right side of his body, predominantly on the right side of his face. He has a chain ball shackled to his right leg. He grew up in the slums, where he was a drug mule, and has escaped multiple prisons primarily because they tried to ''inject'' his medicine into him. He is calm at Nanba as the medicine is taken orally and is flavored. Drugs have an unusual effect on him and rather than incapacitate him, they have alternate side effects. He rarely takes anything seriously and is rather childish and happy go lucky. He is a huge anime fan. In the second season, it's revealed why he is so ill and dependent on medication. As a child, a drug gang used him to test their products, which made him develop several unknown illnesses. After being arrested, the doctors at the first prison he was sent to performed painful, invasive medical experiments on him under the guise of trying to help him get better, which only made him more ill. After spending years locked in the prison infirmary, he eventually sunk into a deep depression and wished that he could die, until Jyugo freed him and helped him develop an interest in life again. In episode 21, it's revealed that he has a violent split personality that will emerge if his health problems are not kept under control with his medications, but he is unaware of its existence.\n\n===Nanba Prison guards===\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4e00|Sugoroku Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:The supervisor of Nanba prison Building 13.

In season 2, it's revealed that he has an older brother, Enki, who was the former supervisor of building 5; Enki was very popular among both the other guards and the prisoners, however, he secretly tortured and abused the inmates in his care, eventually murdering one of them and going on a rampage when his colleagues tried to arrest him. Samon still struggles to comprehend how his brother could do the things he did, and is often taunted by the other guards, who accuse him of being a traitor like his brother was.

He has multiple piercings on his left ear and wears a golden choker. He is usually seen with a serious expression. When he was younger, he was usually seen training. He was strong enough to break a boulder in two with a single strike, mediate underwater and even studied diligently. He also was often seen with Samon by his side. According to Liang and Upa, Enki used to be in charge of a prison in China where he cruelly beat up inmates to become stronger. Upa was nearly killed by his abuse and Liang was terrified at the thought that he would be next but Enki was transferred to Nanba Prison. Formerly the supervising officer of Building 5, he was well-respected and admired by the many fellow guards and even inmates throughout Nanba Prison. He was also considered indispensable to Building 5 and Nanba Prison. However, according to Liang and Upa, Enki had continued to cruelly beat up inmates in Nanba Prison which causes inmates to fear Enki. Enki had built an underground prison beneath Building 5, and has a secret archive room which has data on certain dangerous criminals, later discovered by Jyugo, that Enki was aware that Jyugo was part of a human experiment. After betraying his co-workers and killing an inmate, later revealed to be Elf, he was apprehended and arrested by his co-workers. He now resides in the underground prison of Building 5. Some time ago, Enki faced someone with blades similar to Jyugo. The mysterious person managed to injure Enki's left arm and Enki called him a monster. Since then, Enki was searching for him with the intent to kill him, as he believes the man is too dangerous to let live. During the second season, he is released by Inori and Houzuki Sanzou,and the three join forces with Ruka Gojou; another former guard who was arrested, and an incarcerated mob boss named Hachiman, who have all allied themselves with Enki. The five proceed to carry out a plan to capture all of the inmates and supervisors, although it's unknown exactly what Enki's unltimate goal is. While trying to capture the inmates, he sees Jyugo and plans to kill him, as he believes that he is the man with the blades who attacked him.\n;{{nihongo|H\u014dzuki Sanz\u014d|\u4e09\u8535 \u6cd5\u6708|Sanz\u014d H\u014dzuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fuyuka Ooura]] (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Hitoshi Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4ec1\u5fd7|Sugoroku Hitoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Eishin Fudemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Howard Wang (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Hajime's cute blonde crossdressing brother who befriends Jyugo.

He was supposed to be an assassin for the boss, but he believed that killing was a sin, and instead used a drug created by Qi to knock his targets out while making them appear to be dead. Eventually he was found out by the boss, who rounded up all the people Liang had spared and forced him to watch them be killed before being brutally tortured himself. When the organization was shut down by the police, he was arrested and sent to jail in China. After a short period there, he was transferred to Nanba. He was severely depressed and disillusioned with martial arts by this time, as his years in the mob had damaged his ideals and left him thinking that he could never be a good person after what he had done. Eventually, he was able to rediscover his passion after Samon Gokuu took him in and began training him. He considers Samon to be his mentor and wants to become stronger so that he can be useful to the guard, who he credits with giving him the will to continue living.\n;{{nihongo|Upa|\u30a6\u30d1}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Aaron Dismuke]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Upa is a powerful qigong master and has a talismen attached to his head to restrict his chi usage. He was kidnapped by the crime syndicate Liang used to work for when he was a child because as the most prodigious member of a powerful clan, his internal organs were worth a great deal of money on the black market. He stayed and worked for the group willingly, as they had promised to return his organs if he proved useful to them. However, it's revealed in season 2 that the organs he received were not his own, but Qi's, who had had his organs transplanted to Upa after he began dying due to his body shutting down. After he was arrested, he was sent to a prison in China, where he unfortunately became a victim of Enki Gokuu's cruel abuse. However, during this time, he also met Samon Gokuu after the guard was able to put him back in contact with his family, who had been told by the mob boss that he had died. He highly respects Samon because even though the guard claimed that he was just doing his job, he was the first person to show him any sort of kindness or respect in years. His aim is to finish serving out his sentence and attempt to begin a new, better life alongside Liang and Qi.\n;{{nihongo|Qi|\u30c1\u30a3\u30fc|Ch\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Genki Okawa]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Gabe Kunda<ref name=\"simuldub\" />}}\n: A prisoner famous for his skill at making drugs and poisons. He resides in cell block five with Liang and Upa. He is rather lazy, and can usually be seen relaxing or sleeping in the background, to the point that Liang and Upa often call him \"lazy trash\". He was forced into working for the same people who had took Liang and Upa to save his own life. He initially was unconcerned about the mob's immoral actives, as he was focused on self preservation, but came to hate them after witnessing the boss abusing Liang and Upa. Unbeknownst to Upa, he even gave him some of his own internal organs to save the young boy's life. Eventually, he discovered that his products were being modified to maim and kill the people who used them and, following his arrest, swore that he would never manufacture drugs or poisons again, as he had come to believe that his talents could only hurt other people. During this time, he also lost his ability to trust others. When he was transferred to Nanba prison, however, he eventually was able to take up his trade again after being encouraged by Samon Gokuu. He came to respect Samon for his honesty and kindness, and hopes that he will be able to repay the guard before he is released.\n;{{nihongo|Trois|\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef|Trowa}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Adachi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Elijah Muller<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n;{{nihongo|Honey|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc|Han\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takao Mitsutomi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Ruka Goj\u014d|\u4e94\u6d44 \u6d41\u6cb3|Goj\u014d Ruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naozumi Takahashi]]}} (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n: Ruka is a former guard, but is now inmate at Nanba Prison Building 5.\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Elf|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5|Erufu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Austin Tindle]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:A mysterious character who framed Musashi for a series of arson crimes.\n;Man with the Scar\n:{{voiced by|[[Masanori Ikeda]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:An unknown figure, who is responsible for Jyugo's irremovable shackles, and Musashi's pyrokinesis.

He is confident, cheerful, impulsive and gets bored easily. He is skilled at picking any kind of mechanical or electronic lock. The sole exceptions are the shackles on his neck, wrists and ankles which were placed on him mysteriously when he was asleep by a guard with a scar on the back of his neck. His father was inmate number 610 at the Nanba prison and known as the shame of the Nanba prison. He hates the guard who placed the shackles on him, and longs to find him and have them removed.

He has a great intuition and is able to make bets on what outcome will occur using his observational skills, luck and intuition. He is kind and outgoing (to the point of being silly) but can be blunt. He is often the one who keeps the others in line when Hajime isn't around, and Nico jokes that he's starting to act like he's their mother. He's also very loyal to Jyugo, whom he claims saved his life and gave him his freedom back. After Jyugo is beaten within an inch of his life by Hajime, he holds a deep anger against Hajime, stating he could never come to like prison guards.

He loves fighting and eating and is incredibly strong, with only some of the supervisors being stronger. He can be short tempered and impulsive, but cares for his friends, and mostly remains peaceful and happy. He met Jyugo when the other inmate saved him from starving to death in the first prison he was sent to.

An American effeminate short male with green hair and bandages on the right side of his body, predominantly on the right side of his face. He has a chain ball shackled to his right leg. He grew up in the slums, where he was a drug mule, and has escaped multiple prisons primarily because they tried to ''inject'' his medicine into him. He is calm at Nanba as the medicine is taken orally and is flavored. Drugs have an unusual effect on him and rather than incapacitate him, they have alternate side effects. He rarely takes anything seriously and is rather childish and happy go lucky. He is a huge anime fan. In the second season, it's revealed why he is so ill and dependent on medication. As a child, a drug gang used him to test their products, which made him develop several unknown illnesses. After being arrested, the doctors at the first prison he was sent to performed painful, invasive medical experiments on him under the guise of trying to help him get better, which only made him more ill. After spending years locked in the prison infirmary, he eventually sunk into a deep depression and wished that he could die, until Jyugo freed him and helped him develop an interest in life again. In episode 21, it's revealed that he has a violent split personality that will emerge if his health problems are not kept under control with his medications, but he is unaware of its existence.\n\n===Nanba Prison guards===\n;{{nihongo|Hajime Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4e00|Sugoroku Hajime}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomokazu Seki]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]}}<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>\n:The supervisor of Nanba prison Building 13.

Despite this, it's eventually revealed that he actually cares for the prisoners in his building quite a great deal, as he helped Upa reconnect with his family after he was arrested in China, and later took Liang under his wing when the inmate was first transferred to Nanba. In season 2, it's revealed that he has an older brother, Enki, who was the former supervisor of building 5; Enki was very popular among both the other guards and the prisoners, however, he secretly tortured and abused the inmates in his care, eventually murdering one of them and going on a rampage when his colleagues tried to arrest him. Samon still struggles to comprehend how his brother could do the things he did, and is often taunted by the other guards, who accuse him of being a traitor like his brother was. He becomes irritated when compared to his older brother and when Hajime is mentioned as he sees Hajime, who was able to capture Enki while Samon himself hesitated, as a painful reminder of how strong he feels he needs to be.\n;{{nihongo|Yamato Godai|\u4e94\u4ee3 \u5927\u548c|Godai Yamato}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Shunsuke Takeuchi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA2\"/>}} (Japanese); Marcus Stimac (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:The deputy supervisor of building 13 at Nanba prison.

He says that he's working with Enki because he wants to see Samon dead, due to how the other guard was chosen as the new building 5 supervisor over him; he considers Samon to be weak and cowardly in comparison to his older brother, and detests having to take orders from him.\n;{{nihongo|Enki Gok\u016b|\u609f\u7a7a \u733f\u9b3c|Gok\u016b Enki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takaya Kuroda]] (Japanese); [[Chris Sabat]] (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/blog/2017/01/03/official-winter-2017-simuldub-lineup/|title=Official Winter 2017 SimulDub Lineup - Funimation - Blog!|author=|date=3 January 2017|website=funimation.com|accessdate=6 June 2017}}</ref>}}\n:He has long white and red hair, with a long ponytail which acts like a tail. He has multiple piercings on his left ear and wears a golden choker. He is usually seen with a serious expression. When he was younger, he was usually seen training. He was strong enough to break a boulder in two with a single strike, mediate underwater and even studied diligently. He also was often seen with Samon by his side. According to Liang and Upa, Enki used to be in charge of a prison in China where he cruelly beat up inmates to become stronger. Upa was nearly killed by his abuse and Liang was terrified at the thought that he would be next but Enki was transferred to Nanba Prison. Formerly the supervising officer of Building 5, he was well-respected and admired by the many fellow guards and even inmates throughout Nanba Prison. He was also considered indispensable to Building 5 and Nanba Prison. However, according to Liang and Upa, Enki had continued to cruelly beat up inmates in Nanba Prison which causes inmates to fear Enki. Enki had built an underground prison beneath Building 5, and has a secret archive room which has data on certain dangerous criminals, later discovered by Jyugo, that Enki was aware that Jyugo was part of a human experiment. After betraying his co-workers and killing an inmate, later revealed to be Elf, he was apprehended and arrested by his co-workers. He now resides in the underground prison of Building 5. Some time ago, Enki faced someone with blades similar to Jyugo. The mysterious person managed to injure Enki's left arm and Enki called him a monster. Since then, Enki was searching for him with the intent to kill him, as he believes the man is too dangerous to let live. During the second season, he is released by Inori and Houzuki Sanzou,and the three join forces with Ruka Gojou; another former guard who was arrested, and an incarcerated mob boss named Hachiman, who have all allied themselves with Enki. The five proceed to carry out a plan to capture all of the inmates and supervisors, although it's unknown exactly what Enki's unltimate goal is. While trying to capture the inmates, he sees Jyugo and plans to kill him, as he believes that he is the man with the blades who attacked him.\n;{{nihongo|H\u014dzuki Sanz\u014d|\u4e09\u8535 \u6cd5\u6708|Sanz\u014d H\u014dzuki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Fuyuka Ooura]] (Japanese); Matt Shipman (English)}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Hitoshi Sugoroku|\u53cc\u516d \u4ec1\u5fd7|Sugoroku Hitoshi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Eishin Fudemura]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Howard Wang (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Hajime's cute blonde crossdressing brother who befriends Jyugo.

He was found by a movie director, who wanted a real shinobi to cast in her film. She tricked the child into believing that she was his long lost mother, come to take him back, and raised him to be an actor and shinobi. When he discovered the truth he tried to head back to his home village, but got lost and ended up getting arrested for trespassing.

He was born with a rare disease that keeps his body temperature much higher than normal and allows him to manifest flames.  He would learn to live and adapt with the disease.  However, when he went to college in [[Germany]], his condition went out of control.  Fellow student Elf took advantage of the situation by framing him for numerous arson crimes in order to make it acceptable for him as a convicted criminal to be used as a test subject.  In an act of rebellion, he burned the lab, but his power was suppressed by the scientist with the scar on his neck, which led to him being sent to Nanba where he finally found someone who believed his story in Kenshiro.  He has since been determined to get revenge against that scientist.\n;{{nihongo|Liang|\u30ea\u30e3\u30f3|Ryan}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yuuki Fujiwara]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Blake Shepard]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Inmate number 0502(block five, number 2), a master martial-artist who can usually be found training. He willingly joined the mob as a young boy to save the life of his teacher, who he witnessed nearly being murdered by the mob for refusing their demands. He was supposed to be an assassin for the boss, but he believed that killing was a sin, and instead used a drug created by Qi to knock his targets out while making them appear to be dead. Eventually he was found out by the boss, who rounded up all the people Liang had spared and forced him to watch them be killed before being brutally tortured himself. When the organization was shut down by the police, he was arrested and sent to jail in China. After a short period there, he was transferred to Nanba. He was severely depressed and disillusioned with martial arts by this time, as his years in the mob had damaged his ideals and left him thinking that he could never be a good person after what he had done. Eventually, he was able to rediscover his passion after Samon Gokuu took him in and began training him. He considers Samon to be his mentor and wants to become stronger so that he can be useful to the guard, who he credits with giving him the will to continue living.\n;{{nihongo|Upa|\u30a6\u30d1}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016b Kobayashi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); [[Aaron Dismuke]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:Upa is a powerful qigong master and has a talismen attached to his head to restrict his chi usage.

He stayed and worked for the group willingly, as they had promised to return his organs if he proved useful to them. However, it's revealed in season 2 that the organs he received were not his own, but Qi's, who had had his organs transplanted to Upa after he began dying due to his body shutting down. After he was arrested, he was sent to a prison in China, where he unfortunately became a victim of Enki Gokuu's cruel abuse. However, during this time, he also met Samon Gokuu after the guard was able to put him back in contact with his family, who had been told by the mob boss that he had died. He highly respects Samon because even though the guard claimed that he was just doing his job, he was the first person to show him any sort of kindness or respect in years. His aim is to finish serving out his sentence and attempt to begin a new, better life alongside Liang and Qi.\n;{{nihongo|Qi|\u30c1\u30a3\u30fc|Ch\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Genki Okawa]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Gabe Kunda<ref name=\"simuldub\" />}}\n: A prisoner famous for his skill at making drugs and poisons. He resides in cell block five with Liang and Upa. He is rather lazy, and can usually be seen relaxing or sleeping in the background, to the point that Liang and Upa often call him \"lazy trash\". He was forced into working for the same people who had took Liang and Upa to save his own life. He initially was unconcerned about the mob's immoral actives, as he was focused on self preservation, but came to hate them after witnessing the boss abusing Liang and Upa. Unbeknownst to Upa, he even gave him some of his own internal organs to save the young boy's life. Eventually, he discovered that his products were being modified to maim and kill the people who used them and, following his arrest, swore that he would never manufacture drugs or poisons again, as he had come to believe that his talents could only hurt other people. During this time, he also lost his ability to trust others. When he was transferred to Nanba prison, however, he eventually was able to take up his trade again after being encouraged by Samon Gokuu. He came to respect Samon for his honesty and kindness, and hopes that he will be able to repay the guard before he is released.\n;{{nihongo|Trois|\u30c8\u30ed\u30ef|Trowa}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bto Adachi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>|Elijah Muller<ref name=\"simuldub\"/>}}\n;{{nihongo|Honey|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc|Han\u012b}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takao Mitsutomi]]<ref name=\"AnimeVA3\"/>}} (Japanese); Kyle Igneczi (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n;{{nihongo|Ruka Goj\u014d|\u4e94\u6d44 \u6d41\u6cb3|Goj\u014d Ruka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Naozumi Takahashi]]}} (Japanese); Stephen Fu (English)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n: Ruka is a former guard, but is now inmate at Nanba Prison Building 5.\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Elf|\u30a8\u30eb\u30d5|Erufu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Austin Tindle]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:A mysterious character who framed Musashi for a series of arson crimes.\n;Man with the Scar\n:{{voiced by|[[Masanori Ikeda]]}}<ref name=\"AnimeVA4\"/> (Japanese); [[Phil Parsons (voice actor)|Phil Parsons]] (English)<ref name=\"funimation.com\"/>\n:An unknown figure, who is responsible for Jyugo's irremovable shackles, and Musashi's pyrokinesis.

It has 44 [[National Paralympic Committee]]s of the Asian continent as members. It organizes the [[Asian Para Games]] and is affiliated to the [[International Paralympic Committee]].\n\n==History==\nThe Asian Paralympic Committee was formed on 30 October 2002 in Busan, South Korea as the Asian Paralympic Council, following a motion presented by NPC Malaysia at the 1999 IPC General Assembly. It consisted originally of three sub-regions which are East Asia, South Asia and South-East Asia. In 2004, in order to align with the structure followed by the International Olympic Committee, the International Paralympic Committee decided that the Central Asia and West Asia sub-regions fall under the Council\u2019s responsibility. The organisation was only known by its present name by 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianparalympic.org/history |title=APC History |access-date=2016-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190413083135/http://www.asianparalympic.org/history |archive-date=2019-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n===APC Presidents===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!No. !!
