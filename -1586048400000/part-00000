The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include the original [[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]] trilogy, ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie and the [[Kill Bill]] films.

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include the original [[Rambo (franchise)|Rambo]] trilogy, ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie and the [[Kill Bill]] films. In those days, it was known as Le Studio Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

The ratio of the circumference to the radius varies near the Euclidean value. The smaller the scale, the greater the deviations from the [[Euclidean geometry]]. Let us estimate the order of the wavelength of zero gravitational oscillations, at which the geometry becomes completely unlike the Euclidean geometry. The degree of deviation <math>\\zeta</math> of geometry from Euclidean geometry  in the gravitational field is determined by the ratio of the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi</math> and the square of the speed of light <math>c</math>: <math>\\zeta=\\varphi/c^2</math>. When <math>\\zeta\\ll 1</math>, the geometry is close to Euclidean geometry; for <math>\\zeta\\sim 1</math>, all similarities disappear. The energy of the oscillation of scale <math>l</math> is equal to <math>E=\\hbar\\nu\\sim \\hbar c/l</math> (where <math>c/l</math> is the order of the oscillation frequency). The [[gravitational potential]] created by the mass <math>m</math>, at this length is <math>\\varphi=Gm/l</math>, where <math>G</math> is the [[Gravitational constant|constant of universal gravitation]]. Instead of <math>m</math>, we must substitute a mass, which, according to [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|Einstein's formula]], corresponds to the energy <math>E</math> (where <math>m=E/c^2</math>). We get <math>\\varphi=GE/l\\,c^2=G\\hbar/l^2c</math>. Dividing this expression by <math>c^2</math>, we obtain the value of the deviation <math>\\zeta=G\\hbar/c^3l^2=\\ell^2_P/l^2</math>.

The ratio of the circumference to the radius varies near the Euclidean value. The smaller the scale, the greater the deviations from the [[Euclidean geometry]]. Let us estimate the order of the wavelength of zero gravitational oscillations, at which the geometry becomes completely unlike the Euclidean geometry. The degree of deviation <math>\\zeta</math> of geometry from Euclidean geometry  in the gravitational field is determined by the ratio of the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi</math> and the square of the speed of light <math>c</math>: <math>\\zeta=\\varphi/c^2</math>. When <math>\\zeta\\ll 1</math>, the geometry is close to Euclidean geometry; for <math>\\zeta\\sim 1</math>, all similarities disappear. The energy of the oscillation of scale <math>l</math> is equal to <math>E=\\hbar\\nu\\sim \\hbar c/l</math> (where <math>c/l</math> is the order of the oscillation frequency). The [[gravitational potential]] created by the mass <math>m</math>, at this length is <math>\\varphi=Gm/l</math>, where <math>G</math> is the [[Gravitational constant|constant of universal gravitation]]. Instead of <math>m</math>, we must substitute a mass, which, according to [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|Einstein's formula]], corresponds to the energy <math>E</math> (where <math>m=E/c^2</math>). We get <math>\\varphi=GE/l\\,c^2=G\\hbar/l^2c</math>. Dividing this expression by <math>c^2</math>, we obtain the value of the deviation <math>\\zeta=G\\hbar/c^3l^2=\\ell^2_P/l^2</math>. Equating <math>\\zeta=1</math>, we find the length at which the Euclidean geometry is completely distorted.

He sang in church, and soon he began to appear in children's opera roles in [[Busseto]], a nearby town. After he left school at age 11 he began working in a Parma cheese factory. His father worked there too, and Carlo often got into trouble for singing.\n\nAt the age of 16, he began his vocal studies as a [[baritone]] at Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma with Maestro [[Ettore Campogalliani]].<ref>Stefan Zucker, [http://www.belcantosociety.org/pages/bergonzicart.html \"Bergonzi Talks with Zucker and The Public\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211130557/http://www.belcantosociety.org/pages/bergonzicart.html |date=February 11, 2010 }}, October 12, 1985, on belcantosociety.org.

However, while on his way, he drank unboiled water and contracted [[typhoid fever]], from which he recovered within a year.<ref name=TELEG/> After the war he returned to the Arrigo Boito Conservatory in Parma, weighing just over 36 kilograms (80 pounds).<ref name=NYT/>\n\n===Operatic career===\nIn a 1985 interview with ''Opera Fanatic'''s [[Stefan Zucker]], Bergonzi cited 1948 as the year of his professional debut, as a [[baritone]].<ref>\"Opera Fanatic\" on WKCR. October 12, 1985</ref> He sang the role of Figaro in [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', which he performed with a former prisoners' association which he joined after the war. It has been noted that the fee of 2,000 lire paid for his professional debut was insufficient to cover his meals and travel.<ref name=TELEG/>\n\nOther baritone roles which he undertook included those of Metifio in ''[[L'arlesiana]]'', Doctor Malatesta in ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', Belcore in ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', Enrico Ashton in ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' , Ghirlino in ''Le astuzie di Bertoldo'', Silvio in ''[[Pagliacci]]'', David in ''[[L'amico Fritz]]'', Alfio in ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'', Albert in ''[[Werther]]'', Marcello in ''[[La boh\u00e8me]]'', Sonora in ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'', Sharpless in ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', Lescaut in ''[[Manon Lescaut (Puccini)|Manon Lescaut]]'', Laerte in ''[[Mignon]]'',  the title role in ''[[Rigoletto]]'', and Georgio Germont in ''[[La traviata]]''.\n\nHowever, he realized that the tenor repertoire was more suited to his voice, and after retraining, he made his debut as a tenor in the title role of ''[[Andrea Ch\u00e9nier]]'' at the [[Teatro Petruzzelli]] in [[Bari]] in 1951.<ref name=SADIE>Rosenthal 1998, in Sadie, p. 421</ref> That same year, Bergonzi sang at the [[Coliseum]] in Rome in a 50th anniversary concert of Verdi's death<ref>\n[https://www.nytimes.com/1951/10/08/archives/coliseum-echoes-to-music-by-verdi-5000-romans-first-audience-since.html \"COLISEUM ECHOES TO MUSIC BY VERDI; 5,000 Romans, First Audience Since Ancient Times, Hails Memorial to Composer], ''The New York Times'', October 7, 1951.

Inspired by Feynman's concepts, [[K. Eric Drexler]] used the term \"nanotechnology\" in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]'', which proposed the idea of a nanoscale \"assembler\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded [[The Foresight Institute]] (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.\n\nThe emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. Since the popularity spike in the 1980s, most of nanotechnology has involved investigation of several approaches to making mechanical devices out of a small number of atoms.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002 1193\">{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1193|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era.

The positions of the individual atoms composing the surface are visible.]]\n\n{{main|Nanomaterials}}\n\nSeveral phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] effects, as well as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects, for example the \"[[quantum]] size effect\" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called [[quantum realm]]. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics. ''Mechanical'' properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with [[biomaterial]]s.\n\nMaterials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical [[catalyst]] at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lubick N | year = 2008 | title = Silver socks have cloudy lining | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 42 | issue = 11| page = 3910 | pmid=18589943 | doi = 10.1021/es0871199 | last2 = Betts | first2 = Kellyn|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.3910L }}</ref>\n\n===Simple to complex: a molecular perspective===\n{{Main|Molecular self-assembly}}\n\nModern [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]] has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as [[drug|pharmaceuticals]] or commercial [[polymer]]s. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into [[supramolecular assembly|supramolecular assemblies]] consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.\n\nThese approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or [[supramolecular chemistry]] to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a [[Top-down and bottom-up#Nanotechnology|bottom-up]] approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to [[Noncovalent bonding|non-covalent]] [[intermolecular force]]s. The Watson\u2013Crick [[base pair|basepairing]] rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an [[enzyme]] being targeted to a single [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], or the specific [[protein folding|folding of the protein]] itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.\n\nSuch bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in [[biology]], most notably Watson\u2013Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.\n\n===Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view===\n{{Main|Molecular nanotechnology}}\n\nMolecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the [[molecular assembler]], a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of [[mechanosynthesis]]. Manufacturing in the context of [[productive nanosystems]] is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.\n\nWhen the term \"nanotechnology\" was independently coined and popularized by [[Eric Drexler]] (who at the time was unaware of an [[History of nanotechnology|earlier usage]] by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on [[molecular machine]] systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, [[stochastic]]ally optimised [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]] can be produced.\n\nIt is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using [[biomimetic]] principles. However, Drexler and other researchers<ref>Phoenix, Chris (March 2005) [http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm Nanotechnology: Developing Molecular Manufacturing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901071028/http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm |date=2005-09-01 }}. crnano.org</ref> have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html|title=Some papers by K.

Although conceptually similar to the scanning [[confocal microscope]] developed by [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1961 and the [[scanning acoustic microscope]] (SAM) developed by [[Calvin Quate]] and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.\n\nThe tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). [[Feature-oriented scanning]] methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.<ref name=\"feature2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lapshin, R.

Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.\n\nAnother group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of [[Ion track technology (track etching)|nanotubes]] and [[Ion track technology (track replication)|nanowires]], those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.<ref name=\"pmid26295171\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kafshgari | first1 = MH | last2 = Voelcker | first2 = NH | last3 = Harding | first3 = FJ | year = 2015 | title = Applications of zero-valent silicon nanostructures in biomedicine | journal = Nanomedicine (Lond) | volume = 10 | issue = 16| pages = 2553\u201371 | doi = 10.2217/nnm.15.91 | pmid = 26295171 }}</ref>\n\nThe top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques.<ref name=\"feature2004\"/><ref name=\"fospm2011\"/> At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.\n\nIn contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, [[self-assembly]] and positional assembly. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is [[molecular beam epitaxy]] or MBE. Researchers at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of [[spintronics]].\n\nHowever, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive [[Transfersome]] vesicles, are under development and already approved for human use in some countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajan|first=Reshmy|last2=Jose|first2=Shoma|last3=Mukund|first3=V.

Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine [[Catalysis|catalyst]] in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water.<ref>[[Catalytic converter#Diesel engines|''Catalytic Converter'']] at Wikipedia.org</ref> Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts.<ref>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm ''How Catalytic Converters Work''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210142147/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm |date=2014-12-10 }} at howstuffworks.com</ref> Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst\u2014in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes\u2014and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.<ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines ''Nanotechnology to provide cleaner diesel engines''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214133618/http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines |date=2014-12-14 }}.

Inspired by Feynman's concepts, [[K. Eric Drexler]] used the term \"nanotechnology\" in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]'', which proposed the idea of a nanoscale \"assembler\" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded [[The Foresight Institute]] (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.\n\nThe emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework for nanotechnology, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional wide-scale attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. Since the popularity spike in the 1980s, most of nanotechnology has involved investigation of several approaches to making mechanical devices out of a small number of atoms.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002 1193\">{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1193|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in modern era.

This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.\n\nOne [[nanometer]] (nm) is one billionth, or 10<sup>\u22129</sup>, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon [[bond length]]s, or the spacing between these [[atom]]s in a [[molecule]], are in the range {{nowrap|0.12\u20130.15 nm}}, and a [[DNA]] double-helix has a diameter around 2&nbsp;nm. On the other hand, the smallest [[cell (biology)|cellular]] life-forms, the bacteria of the genus ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', are around 200&nbsp;nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range {{nowrap|1 to 100 nm}} following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm [[kinetic diameter]]) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which  phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device.<ref>{{cite book |first=Fritz |last=Allhoff |first2=Patrick |last2=Lin |first3=Daniel |last3=Moore |title=What is nanotechnology and why does it matter?: from science to ethics |pages=3\u20135 |location= |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-7545-6 }}</ref> These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of [[microtechnology]].<ref>{{cite book |first=S.

The positions of the individual atoms composing the surface are visible.]]\n\n{{main|Nanomaterials}}\n\nSeveral phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] effects, as well as [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects, for example the \"[[quantum]] size effect\" where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to micro dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically at distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called [[quantum realm]]. Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred to nanoionics. ''Mechanical'' properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with [[biomaterial]]s.\n\nMaterials reduced to the nanoscale can show different properties compared to what they exhibit on a macroscale, enabling unique applications. For instance, opaque substances can become transparent (copper); stable materials can turn combustible (aluminium); insoluble materials may become soluble (gold). A material such as gold, which is chemically inert at normal scales, can serve as a potent chemical [[catalyst]] at nanoscales. Much of the fascination with nanotechnology stems from these quantum and surface phenomena that matter exhibits at the nanoscale.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lubick N | year = 2008 | title = Silver socks have cloudy lining | url = | journal = Environ Sci Technol | volume = 42 | issue = 11| page = 3910 | pmid=18589943 | doi = 10.1021/es0871199 | last2 = Betts | first2 = Kellyn|bibcode = 2008EnST...42.3910L }}</ref>\n\n===Simple to complex: a molecular perspective===\n{{Main|Molecular self-assembly}}\n\nModern [[chemical synthesis|synthetic chemistry]] has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any structure. These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as [[drug|pharmaceuticals]] or commercial [[polymer]]s. This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble these single molecules into [[supramolecular assembly|supramolecular assemblies]] consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.\n\nThese approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or [[supramolecular chemistry]] to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a [[Top-down and bottom-up#Nanotechnology|bottom-up]] approach. The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to [[Noncovalent bonding|non-covalent]] [[intermolecular force]]s. The Watson\u2013Crick [[base pair|basepairing]] rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an [[enzyme]] being targeted to a single [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]], or the specific [[protein folding|folding of the protein]] itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.\n\nSuch bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in [[biology]], most notably Watson\u2013Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions. The challenge for nanotechnology is whether these principles can be used to engineer new constructs in addition to natural ones.\n\n===Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view===\n{{Main|Molecular nanotechnology}}\n\nMolecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, describes engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale. Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with the [[molecular assembler]], a machine that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of [[mechanosynthesis]]. Manufacturing in the context of [[productive nanosystems]] is not related to, and should be clearly distinguished from, the conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.\n\nWhen the term \"nanotechnology\" was independently coined and popularized by [[Eric Drexler]] (who at the time was unaware of an [[History of nanotechnology|earlier usage]] by Norio Taniguchi) it referred to a future manufacturing technology based on [[molecular machine]] systems. The premise was that molecular scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: by the countless examples found in biology, it is known that sophisticated, [[stochastic]]ally optimised [[Molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]] can be produced.\n\nIt is hoped that developments in nanotechnology will make possible their construction by some other means, perhaps using [[biomimetic]] principles. However, Drexler and other researchers<ref>Phoenix, Chris (March 2005) [http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm Nanotechnology: Developing Molecular Manufacturing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901071028/http://www.crnano.org/developing.htm |date=2005-09-01 }}. crnano.org</ref> have proposed that advanced nanotechnology, although perhaps initially implemented by biomimetic means, ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/PNAS.html|title=Some papers by K.

Because of the discrete (i.e. atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage is seen as the basis of another industrial revolution. [[Mihail Roco]], one of the architects of the USA's National Nanotechnology Initiative, has proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex [[nanomachine]]s and ultimately to productive nanosystems.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf |title=International Perspective on Government Nanotechnology Funding in 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131175645/http://nsf.gov/crssprgm/nano/reports/mcr_05-0526_intpersp_nano.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 }}</ref>\n*[[Programmable matter]] seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of [[information science]] and [[materials science]].\n*Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words [[picotechnology]] and [[femtotechnology]] have been coined in analogy to it, although these are only used rarely and informally.\n\n===Dimensionality in nanomaterials===\nNanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D [[nanomaterials]]. The dimensionality play a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including [[:wikt:physical|physical]], [[chemical]] and [[biological]] characteristics. With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed. This indicate that smaller dimensional [[nanomaterials]] have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials.

A [[laser]] beam reflects off the backside of the cantilever into a set of [[photodetector]]s, allowing the deflection to be measured and assembled into an image of the surface.]]\n\nThere are several important modern developments. The [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM) and the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of [[scanning probe microscopy]]. Although conceptually similar to the scanning [[confocal microscope]] developed by [[Marvin Minsky]] in 1961 and the [[scanning acoustic microscope]] (SAM) developed by [[Calvin Quate]] and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.\n\nThe tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (a process called positional assembly). [[Feature-oriented scanning]] methodology may be a promising way to implement these nanomanipulations in automatic mode.<ref name=\"feature2004\">{{cite journal|author=Lapshin, R.

Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.\n\nAnother group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of [[Ion track technology (track etching)|nanotubes]] and [[Ion track technology (track replication)|nanowires]], those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating nanotechnology and which were results of nanotechnology research.<ref name=\"pmid26295171\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kafshgari | first1 = MH | last2 = Voelcker | first2 = NH | last3 = Harding | first3 = FJ | year = 2015 | title = Applications of zero-valent silicon nanostructures in biomedicine | journal = Nanomedicine (Lond) | volume = 10 | issue = 16| pages = 2553\u201371 | doi = 10.2217/nnm.15.91 | pmid = 26295171 }}</ref>\n\nThe top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques.<ref name=\"feature2004\"/><ref name=\"fospm2011\"/> At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.\n\nIn contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, [[self-assembly]] and positional assembly. [[Dual polarisation interferometry]] is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another variation of the bottom-up approach is [[molecular beam epitaxy]] or MBE. Researchers at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of [[spintronics]].\n\nHowever, new therapeutic products, based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the ultradeformable, stress-sensitive [[Transfersome]] vesicles, are under development and already approved for human use in some countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajan|first=Reshmy|last2=Jose|first2=Shoma|last3=Mukund|first3=V.

Platinum is currently used as the diesel engine [[Catalysis|catalyst]] in these engines. The catalyst is what cleans the exhaust fume particles. First a reduction catalyst is employed to take nitrogen atoms from NOx molecules in order to free oxygen. Next the oxidation catalyst oxidizes the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide and water.<ref>[[Catalytic converter#Diesel engines|''Catalytic Converter'']] at Wikipedia.org</ref> Platinum is used in both the reduction and the oxidation catalysts.<ref>[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm ''How Catalytic Converters Work''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210142147/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/catalytic-converter2.htm |date=2014-12-10 }} at howstuffworks.com</ref> Using platinum though, is inefficient in that it is expensive and unsustainable. Danish company InnovationsFonden invested DKK 15 million in a search for new catalyst substitutes using nanotechnology. The goal of the project, launched in the autumn of 2014, is to maximize surface area and minimize the amount of material required. Objects tend to minimize their surface energy; two drops of water, for example, will join to form one drop and decrease surface area. If the catalyst's surface area that is exposed to the exhaust fumes is maximized, efficiency of the catalyst is maximized. The team working on this project aims to create nanoparticles that will not merge. Every time the surface is optimized, material is saved. Thus, creating these nanoparticles will increase the effectiveness of the resulting diesel engine catalyst\u2014in turn leading to cleaner exhaust fumes\u2014and will decrease cost. If successful, the team hopes to reduce platinum use by 25%.<ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines ''Nanotechnology to provide cleaner diesel engines''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214133618/http://www.rdmag.com/news/2014/09/nanotechnology-provide-cleaner-diesel-engines |date=2014-12-14 }}.

Morgan''' (June 1, 1825 \u2013 September 4, 1864) was a  [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]] in the [[American Civil War]].  Morgan never used his middle name of Hunt during the war \u2014 it is a post war appellation.\n\nIn April 1862, he raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, fought at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], and then launched a costly raid in Kentucky, which encouraged [[Braxton Bragg]]'s invasion of that state. He also attacked the supply-lines of General [[William Rosecrans]]. In July 1863, he set out on a 1,000-mile raid into Indiana and Ohio, taking hundreds of prisoners. But after most of his men had been intercepted by Union gunboats, Morgan surrendered at Salineville, Ohio, the northernmost point ever reached by uniformed Confederates. The legendary \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\", which had been carried out against orders, gained no tactical advantage for the Confederacy, while the loss of his regiment proved a serious setback.\n\nMorgan escaped from his Union prison but his credibility was low, and he was restricted to minor operations. He was killed at [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], in September 1864. Morgan was the brother-in-law of Confederate general [[A. P. Hill]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nJohn H. Morgan was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], the eldest of ten children of Calvin and Henrietta (Hunt) Morgan. He was an uncle of geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and a maternal grandson of [[John Wesley Hunt]], an early founder of [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and one of the first [[millionaire]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. He was also the brother-in-law of [[A. P. Hill]] and of [[Basil W. Duke]].<ref name=Eicher397>Eicher, p. 397.</ref> He was said to be a direct descendant of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and hero [[Daniel Morgan]].,<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h407.html United States History: Morgan's Raiders]<br />His father claimed to be a descendant of the Revolutionary War hero, Daniel Morgan</ref><ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Brig-Gen-John-Hunt-Morgan-CSA/6000000011154199199 GENi: Brig. General John Hunt Morgan (CSA)]. It is said that he was a lineal descendant of Daniel Morgan, of Revolutionary fame.</ref> whose own great grand-uncle was perhaps history's most successful [[privateer]], [[Henry Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Gen-Daniel-Morgan-Continental-Army/5384988704340025855 GENi: Gen. Daniel Morgan (Continental Army)]. Daniel Morgan is related to the famous Welsh privateer and pirate, Henry Morgan. Henry was Daniel's great-great-grandfather Edward Morgan's nephew.</ref>\n\nJohn Wesley Hunt, Morgan's grandfather, was a leading landowner and businessman in Kentucky and was the first millionaire west of the Allegheny Mountains. \"His business empire included interest in banking, horse breeding, agriculture and hemp manufacturing. Among his business associates were Henry Clay and John Jacob Astor.\" \n\nMorgan's paternal grandparents were Luther and Anna (Cameron) Morgan. Luther Morgan had settled in Huntsville, but a downturn in the cotton economy forced him to mortgage his holdings. His father, Calvin Morgan, lost his Huntsville home in 1831 when he was unable to pay the property taxes following the failure of his [[pharmacy]]. The family then moved to Lexington, where he would manage one of his father-in-law's sprawling farms.\n\nMorgan grew up on the farm outside of Lexington and attended [[Transylvania College]] for two years, but was suspended in 1844 for [[duel]]ing with a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity brother]]. In 1846, Morgan became a [[Freemason]], at Daviess Lodge #22, [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref>Smith, Dwight L. ''Goodly Heritage'' ([[Grand Lodge of Indiana]], 1968) pg.124</ref> Morgan desired a military career, but the small size of the US military severely limited opportunities for officer's commissions.\n\nIn 1846 Morgan enlisted with his brother Calvin and uncle Alexander in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a cavalry [[private (rank)|private]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He was elected second lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant before arriving in Mexico, where he saw combat in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. On his return to Kentucky, he became a [[hemp]] manufacturer and in 1848, he married Rebecca Gratz Bruce, the 18-year-old sister of one of his business partners. Morgan also hired out his slaves and occasionally sold them. After the death of John Wesley Hunt in 1849, his fortunes greatly improved as his mother, Henrietta, began financing his business ventures.\n\nIn 1853, his wife delivered a stillborn son. She contracted [[thrombophlebitis|septic thrombophlebitis]], popularly known as \"milk leg\", an infection of a blood clot in a vein, which eventually led to an amputation. They became increasingly emotionally distant from one another. Known as a gambler and womanizer, Morgan was also known for his generosity. He had at least one slave son, Sidney Morgan, by a slave woman, and was the biological grandfather of African American inventor [[Garrett Morgan]] (1877-1963).<ref>Evans, Harold. ''Who Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine''. Little Brown, 2004.</ref>\n\nMorgan remained interested in the military. He raised a [[militia]] artillery company in 1852, but it was disbanded by the state legislature two years later. In 1857, with the rise of sectional tensions, Morgan raised an independent [[infantry]] company known as the \"Lexington Rifles,\" and spent much of his free time drilling his men.\n\n==Civil War service==\n[[File:Morgan Lexington statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Former location of [[John Hunt Morgan Memorial]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]]]\nLike most Kentuckians, Morgan did not initially support secession. Immediately after Lincoln's election in November 1860, he wrote to his brother, Thomas Hunt Morgan, then a student at [[Kenyon College]] in northern Ohio, \"Our State will not I hope secede I have no doubt but Lincoln will make a good President, at least we ought to give him a fair trial & then if he commits some [[overt act]] all the South will be a unit.\" By the following spring, Tom Morgan (who also had opposed Kentucky's secession) had transferred home to the Kentucky Military Institute and there began to support the Confederacy. Just before the Fourth of July, by way of a steamer from Louisville, he quietly left for Camp Boone, just across the Tennessee border, to enlist in the Kentucky State Guard. John stayed at home in Lexington to tend to his troubled business and his ailing wife. Becky Morgan finally died on July 21, 1861.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=96705438 Find-a-Grave: Rebecca Gratz Bruce], accessed July 2017.</ref>\n\nIn September, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Morgan and his militia company went to Tennessee and joined the [[Confederate States Army]]. Morgan soon raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment and became its [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on April 4, 1862.<ref name=Eicher397/>\n\nMorgan and his cavalrymen fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, and he soon became a symbol to [[secession]]ists in their hopes for obtaining Kentucky for the Confederacy. A Louisiana writer, Robert D. Patrick, compared Morgan to [[Francis Marion]] and wrote that \"a few thousands of such men as his would regain us Kentucky and Tennessee.\"\n\nIn his first Kentucky raid, Morgan left [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on July 4, 1862, with almost 900 men and in three weeks swept through Kentucky, deep in the rear of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army. He reported the capture of 1,200 Federal soldiers, whom he paroled, acquired several hundred horses, and destroyed massive quantities of supplies.<ref>[[North & South - The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society]], Volume 11, Number 1, Page 70, [http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf  \"We will have to whip these fellows sure enough\" - John Hunt Morgan], accessed April 16, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714195019/http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf |date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> He unnerved Kentucky's [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military government, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] received so many frantic appeals for help that he complained that \"they are having a stampede in Kentucky.\" Historian [[Kenneth W. Noe]] wrote that Morgan's feat \"in many ways surpassed [[J. E. B. Stuart]]'s celebrated 'Ride around [[George B.

Morgan]]\n\nHoping to divert Union troops and resources in conjunction with the twin Confederate operations of [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in the summer of 1863, Morgan set off on the campaign that would become known as \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\". Morgan crossed the Ohio River, and raided across southern Indiana and Ohio. At Corydon, Indiana, the raiders met 450 local Home Guard in [[Battle of Corydon|a battle]] that resulted in eleven Confederates killed and five Home Guard killed.\n\nIn July, at Versailles, IN, while soldiers raided nearby militia and looted county and city treasuries, the jewels of the local masonic lodge were stolen. When Morgan, a [[Freemason]], learned of the theft he recovered the jewels and returned them to the lodge the following day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=John|title=Masonic Facts and Trivia|url=http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|work=Education|publisher=clearwater127.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203203717/http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|archivedate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter several more skirmishes, during which he captured and paroled thousands of Union soldiers{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, Morgan's raid almost ended on July 19, 1863, at [[Battle of Buffington Island|Buffington Island]], [[Ohio]], when approximately 700 of his men were captured while trying to cross the [[Ohio River]] into [[West Virginia]]. Intercepted by Union gunboats, over 300 of his men succeeded in crossing. Most of Morgan's men captured that day spent the rest of the war in the infamous [[Camp Douglas (Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] [[Prisoner of War]] camp in [[Chicago]], which had a very high death rate. On July 26, near [[Salineville, Ohio]], Morgan and his exhausted, hungry and saddlesore soldiers were [[John H. Morgan Surrender Site|finally forced to surrender]]. It was the farthest north that any uniformed Confederate troops would penetrate during the war.<ref name=Dupuy525>Dupuy, p. 525.</ref>\n\nOn November 27, Morgan and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron. Morgan and three of his officers, shortly after midnight, boarded a train from the nearby Columbus train station and arrived in Cincinnati that morning. Morgan and Hines jumped from the train before reaching the depot, and escaped into Kentucky by hiring a skiff to take them across the Ohio River. Through the assistance of sympathizers, they eventually made it to safety in the South. Coincidentally, the same day Morgan escaped, his wife gave birth to a daughter, who died shortly afterwards before Morgan returned home.\n\nThough Morgan's Raid was breathlessly followed by the Northern and Southern press and caused the Union leadership considerable concern, it is now regarded as little more than a showy but ultimately futile sidelight to the war. Furthermore, it was done in direct violation of his orders from General [[Braxton Bragg]] not to cross the river. Despite the raiders' best efforts, Union forces had amassed nearly 110,000 militia in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio; dozens of [[United States Navy]] [[gunboat]]s along the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]; and strong Federal cavalry forces, which doomed the raid from the beginning. The cost of the raid to the Federals was extensive, with claims for compensation still being filed against the U.S. government well into the early 20th century. However, the Confederacy's loss of Morgan's light cavalry far outweighed the benefits.\n\n===Late career and death===\nAfter his return from Ohio, Morgan returned to active duty. However, the men he was assigned were in no way comparable to those he had lost. Morgan once again began raiding into Kentucky. However his men lacked discipline, and he was unwilling or unable to control them, leading to open pillaging along with high casualties. The raids of this season were in risky defiance of a strategic situation in the border states that had changed radically from the year before. Union military occupation of this region, long denied to major Confederate armies, had progressed to the point that even highly mobile raiders could no longer count on easily evading them. Northern public outrage at Morgan's raid across the Ohio River may well have contributed to this state of affairs.\n\nHis \"Last Kentucky Raid\" was carried out in June 1864, the high-water mark of which was the [[Battle of Cynthiana|Second Battle of Cynthiana]]. After winning a minor victory on June 11 against an inferior infantry unit in the engagement known as the Battle of Keller's Bridge on the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], near [[Cynthiana, Kentucky]], Morgan decided to take a chance the following day on another contest against superior Union mounted forces that were known to be approaching. The result was a disaster for the Confederates, resulting in the destruction of Morgan's force as a cohesive unit, only a small fraction of whom escaped with their lives and liberty as fugitives, including the General and some of his officers.\n\nAfter the flashy but unauthorized 1863 Ohio raid, Morgan was never again trusted by General Bragg. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1864, Morgan was placed in command of the Trans-Allegheny Department, embracing at the time the Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia. Yet around this time some Confederate authorities were quietly investigating Morgan for charges of criminal banditry,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} likely leading to his removal from command. He began to organize a raid aimed at Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nOn September 4, 1864, he was surprised by a Union raid on [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. While attempting to retreat, he was shot in the back and killed by Union cavalrymen.\n\nMorgan was buried in [[Lexington Cemetery]]. The burial was shortly before the birth of his second child, another daughter.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:John Hunt Morgan Grave.jpg|thumb|200px|Morgan's Grave, in [[Lexington Cemetery]]]]\n* Hart County High School, in [[Munfordville, Kentucky]], the site of the Battle for the Bridge, named their mascot the Raiders, in honor of Morgan's men.

Morgan''' (June 1, 1825 \u2013 September 4, 1864) was a  [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]] in the [[American Civil War]].  Morgan never used his middle name of Hunt during the war \u2014 it is a post war appellation.\n\nIn April 1862, he raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, fought at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], and then launched a costly raid in Kentucky, which encouraged [[Braxton Bragg]]'s invasion of that state. He also attacked the supply-lines of General [[William Rosecrans]]. In July 1863, he set out on a 1,000-mile raid into Indiana and Ohio, taking hundreds of prisoners. But after most of his men had been intercepted by Union gunboats, Morgan surrendered at Salineville, Ohio, the northernmost point ever reached by uniformed Confederates. The legendary \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\", which had been carried out against orders, gained no tactical advantage for the Confederacy, while the loss of his regiment proved a serious setback.\n\nMorgan escaped from his Union prison but his credibility was low, and he was restricted to minor operations. He was killed at [[Greeneville, Tennessee]], in September 1864. Morgan was the brother-in-law of Confederate general [[A. P. Hill]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nJohn H. Morgan was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], the eldest of ten children of Calvin and Henrietta (Hunt) Morgan. He was an uncle of geneticist [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]] and a maternal grandson of [[John Wesley Hunt]], an early founder of [[Lexington, Kentucky]], and one of the first [[millionaire]]s west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. He was also the brother-in-law of [[A. P. Hill]] and of [[Basil W. Duke]].<ref name=Eicher397>Eicher, p. 397.</ref> He was said to be a direct descendant of [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] general and hero [[Daniel Morgan]].,<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h407.html United States History: Morgan's Raiders]<br />His father claimed to be a descendant of the Revolutionary War hero, Daniel Morgan</ref><ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Brig-Gen-John-Hunt-Morgan-CSA/6000000011154199199 GENi: Brig. General John Hunt Morgan (CSA)]. It is said that he was a lineal descendant of Daniel Morgan, of Revolutionary fame.</ref> whose own great grand-uncle was perhaps history's most successful [[privateer]], [[Henry Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.geni.com/people/Gen-Daniel-Morgan-Continental-Army/5384988704340025855 GENi: Gen. Daniel Morgan (Continental Army)]. Daniel Morgan is related to the famous Welsh privateer and pirate, Henry Morgan. Henry was Daniel's great-great-grandfather Edward Morgan's nephew.</ref>\n\nJohn Wesley Hunt, Morgan's grandfather, was a leading landowner and businessman in Kentucky and was the first millionaire west of the Allegheny Mountains. \"His business empire included interest in banking, horse breeding, agriculture and hemp manufacturing. Among his business associates were Henry Clay and John Jacob Astor.\" \n\nMorgan's paternal grandparents were Luther and Anna (Cameron) Morgan. Luther Morgan had settled in Huntsville, but a downturn in the cotton economy forced him to mortgage his holdings. His father, Calvin Morgan, lost his Huntsville home in 1831 when he was unable to pay the property taxes following the failure of his [[pharmacy]]. The family then moved to Lexington, where he would manage one of his father-in-law's sprawling farms.\n\nMorgan grew up on the farm outside of Lexington and attended [[Transylvania College]] for two years, but was suspended in 1844 for [[duel]]ing with a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity brother]]. In 1846, Morgan became a [[Freemason]], at Daviess Lodge #22, [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref>Smith, Dwight L. ''Goodly Heritage'' ([[Grand Lodge of Indiana]], 1968) pg.124</ref> Morgan desired a military career, but the small size of the US military severely limited opportunities for officer's commissions.\n\nIn 1846 Morgan enlisted with his brother Calvin and uncle Alexander in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a cavalry [[private (rank)|private]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. He was elected second lieutenant and was promoted to first lieutenant before arriving in Mexico, where he saw combat in the [[Battle of Buena Vista]]. On his return to Kentucky, he became a [[hemp]] manufacturer and in 1848, he married Rebecca Gratz Bruce, the 18-year-old sister of one of his business partners. Morgan also hired out his slaves and occasionally sold them. After the death of John Wesley Hunt in 1849, his fortunes greatly improved as his mother, Henrietta, began financing his business ventures.\n\nIn 1853, his wife delivered a stillborn son. She contracted [[thrombophlebitis|septic thrombophlebitis]], popularly known as \"milk leg\", an infection of a blood clot in a vein, which eventually led to an amputation. They became increasingly emotionally distant from one another. Known as a gambler and womanizer, Morgan was also known for his generosity. He had at least one slave son, Sidney Morgan, by a slave woman, and was the biological grandfather of African American inventor [[Garrett Morgan]] (1877-1963).<ref>Evans, Harold. ''Who Made America: From the Steam Engine to the Search Engine''. Little Brown, 2004.</ref>\n\nMorgan remained interested in the military. He raised a [[militia]] artillery company in 1852, but it was disbanded by the state legislature two years later. In 1857, with the rise of sectional tensions, Morgan raised an independent [[infantry]] company known as the \"Lexington Rifles,\" and spent much of his free time drilling his men.\n\n==Civil War service==\n[[File:Morgan Lexington statue.jpg|thumb|300px|Former location of [[John Hunt Morgan Memorial]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]]]\nLike most Kentuckians, Morgan did not initially support secession. Immediately after Lincoln's election in November 1860, he wrote to his brother, Thomas Hunt Morgan, then a student at [[Kenyon College]] in northern Ohio, \"Our State will not I hope secede I have no doubt but Lincoln will make a good President, at least we ought to give him a fair trial & then if he commits some [[overt act]] all the South will be a unit.\" By the following spring, Tom Morgan (who also had opposed Kentucky's secession) had transferred home to the Kentucky Military Institute and there began to support the Confederacy. Just before the Fourth of July, by way of a steamer from Louisville, he quietly left for Camp Boone, just across the Tennessee border, to enlist in the Kentucky State Guard. John stayed at home in Lexington to tend to his troubled business and his ailing wife. Becky Morgan finally died on July 21, 1861.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=96705438 Find-a-Grave: Rebecca Gratz Bruce], accessed July 2017.</ref>\n\nIn September, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Morgan and his militia company went to Tennessee and joined the [[Confederate States Army]]. Morgan soon raised the 2nd Kentucky Cavalry Regiment and became its [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on April 4, 1862.<ref name=Eicher397/>\n\nMorgan and his cavalrymen fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in April 1862, and he soon became a symbol to [[secession]]ists in their hopes for obtaining Kentucky for the Confederacy. A Louisiana writer, Robert D. Patrick, compared Morgan to [[Francis Marion]] and wrote that \"a few thousands of such men as his would regain us Kentucky and Tennessee.\"\n\nIn his first Kentucky raid, Morgan left [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] on July 4, 1862, with almost 900 men and in three weeks swept through Kentucky, deep in the rear of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Don Carlos Buell]]'s army. He reported the capture of 1,200 Federal soldiers, whom he paroled, acquired several hundred horses, and destroyed massive quantities of supplies.<ref>[[North & South - The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society]], Volume 11, Number 1, Page 70, [http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf  \"We will have to whip these fellows sure enough\" - John Hunt Morgan], accessed April 16, 2010. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714195019/http://www.northandsouthmagazine.com/images/volume11/ind11-1.pdf |date=July 14, 2011 }}</ref> He unnerved Kentucky's [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] military government, and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] received so many frantic appeals for help that he complained that \"they are having a stampede in Kentucky.\" Historian [[Kenneth W.

Morgan]]\n\nHoping to divert Union troops and resources in conjunction with the twin Confederate operations of [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]] in the summer of 1863, Morgan set off on the campaign that would become known as \"[[Morgan's Raid]]\". Morgan crossed the Ohio River, and raided across southern Indiana and Ohio. At Corydon, Indiana, the raiders met 450 local Home Guard in [[Battle of Corydon|a battle]] that resulted in eleven Confederates killed and five Home Guard killed.\n\nIn July, at Versailles, IN, while soldiers raided nearby militia and looted county and city treasuries, the jewels of the local masonic lodge were stolen. When Morgan, a [[Freemason]], learned of the theft he recovered the jewels and returned them to the lodge the following day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=John|title=Masonic Facts and Trivia|url=http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|work=Education|publisher=clearwater127.com|accessdate=29 July 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203203717/http://www.clearwater127.com/education.htm|archivedate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter several more skirmishes, during which he captured and paroled thousands of Union soldiers{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}, Morgan's raid almost ended on July 19, 1863, at [[Battle of Buffington Island|Buffington Island]], [[Ohio]], when approximately 700 of his men were captured while trying to cross the [[Ohio River]] into [[West Virginia]]. Intercepted by Union gunboats, over 300 of his men succeeded in crossing. Most of Morgan's men captured that day spent the rest of the war in the infamous [[Camp Douglas (Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] [[Prisoner of War]] camp in [[Chicago]], which had a very high death rate. On July 26, near [[Salineville, Ohio]], Morgan and his exhausted, hungry and saddlesore soldiers were [[John H. Morgan Surrender Site|finally forced to surrender]]. It was the farthest north that any uniformed Confederate troops would penetrate during the war.<ref name=Dupuy525>Dupuy, p. 525.</ref>\n\nOn November 27, Morgan and six of his officers, most notably [[Thomas Hines]], escaped from their cells in the [[Ohio Penitentiary]] by digging a tunnel from Hines' cell into the inner yard and then ascending a wall with a rope made from bunk coverlets and a bent poker iron. Morgan and three of his officers, shortly after midnight, boarded a train from the nearby Columbus train station and arrived in Cincinnati that morning. Morgan and Hines jumped from the train before reaching the depot, and escaped into Kentucky by hiring a skiff to take them across the Ohio River. Through the assistance of sympathizers, they eventually made it to safety in the South. Coincidentally, the same day Morgan escaped, his wife gave birth to a daughter, who died shortly afterwards before Morgan returned home.\n\nThough Morgan's Raid was breathlessly followed by the Northern and Southern press and caused the Union leadership considerable concern, it is now regarded as little more than a showy but ultimately futile sidelight to the war. Furthermore, it was done in direct violation of his orders from General [[Braxton Bragg]] not to cross the river. Despite the raiders' best efforts, Union forces had amassed nearly 110,000 militia in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio; dozens of [[United States Navy]] [[gunboat]]s along the [[Ohio River|Ohio]]; and strong Federal cavalry forces, which doomed the raid from the beginning. The cost of the raid to the Federals was extensive, with claims for compensation still being filed against the U.S. government well into the early 20th century. However, the Confederacy's loss of Morgan's light cavalry far outweighed the benefits.\n\n===Late career and death===\nAfter his return from Ohio, Morgan returned to active duty. However, the men he was assigned were in no way comparable to those he had lost. Morgan once again began raiding into Kentucky. However his men lacked discipline, and he was unwilling or unable to control them, leading to open pillaging along with high casualties. The raids of this season were in risky defiance of a strategic situation in the border states that had changed radically from the year before. Union military occupation of this region, long denied to major Confederate armies, had progressed to the point that even highly mobile raiders could no longer count on easily evading them. Northern public outrage at Morgan's raid across the Ohio River may well have contributed to this state of affairs.\n\nHis \"Last Kentucky Raid\" was carried out in June 1864, the high-water mark of which was the [[Battle of Cynthiana|Second Battle of Cynthiana]]. After winning a minor victory on June 11 against an inferior infantry unit in the engagement known as the Battle of Keller's Bridge on the [[Licking River (Kentucky)|Licking River]], near [[Cynthiana, Kentucky]], Morgan decided to take a chance the following day on another contest against superior Union mounted forces that were known to be approaching. The result was a disaster for the Confederates, resulting in the destruction of Morgan's force as a cohesive unit, only a small fraction of whom escaped with their lives and liberty as fugitives, including the General and some of his officers.\n\nAfter the flashy but unauthorized 1863 Ohio raid, Morgan was never again trusted by General Bragg. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1864, Morgan was placed in command of the Trans-Allegheny Department, embracing at the time the Confederate forces in eastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia. Yet around this time some Confederate authorities were quietly investigating Morgan for charges of criminal banditry,{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} likely leading to his removal from command. He began to organize a raid aimed at Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nOn September 4, 1864, he was surprised by a Union raid on [[Greeneville, Tennessee]]. While attempting to retreat, he was shot in the back and killed by Union cavalrymen.\n\nMorgan was buried in [[Lexington Cemetery]]. The burial was shortly before the birth of his second child, another daughter.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:John Hunt Morgan Grave.jpg|thumb|200px|Morgan's Grave, in [[Lexington Cemetery]]]]\n* Hart County High School, in [[Munfordville, Kentucky]], the site of the Battle for the Bridge, named their mascot the Raiders, in honor of Morgan's men.
