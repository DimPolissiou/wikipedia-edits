Both clubs remained independent with the reports amounting to nothing.  \n\nMoturoa won the Taranaki Premier League in 1999, scoring 86 goals and conceding only 15 goals with just one match ending in defeat. \n\nIn 2000 the club was promoted to the Central Federation Premier League, having its final season to date at this level in 2003.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n\n==Taranaki Premier League Squad 2019==\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no= 1|pos=GK|nat=New Zealand         |name=Zane Coleman|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= |pos=  |nat=|name=|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 3|pos=  |nat=New Zealand         |name= Ethan Webber|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 4|pos=  |nat=New Zealand         |name= Corbin Richardson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 5|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Liam Scott|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 6|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Nathan Morath|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 7|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Jaden Taylor|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 8|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Troy Jury|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= 9|pos=   |nat=New Zealand         |name= Hayden Murray|other=Captain}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|pos=     |nat=New Zealand|name= |other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=11 |pos=     |nat=New Zealand|name= Tyler Paterson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|pos=  |nat=New Zealand        |name= Ash Reader-Nokes|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Scott Manson|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Jacob Crawford|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Zayed Rabbaney|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Sam Sutton|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Sam Westlake|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|pos=|nat=New Zealand        |name= Nicholas Parthemore|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Dean Wilson|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Kayi Erol-Watt|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|pos=|nat=New Zealand|name= Kobi Hislop|other=Squad Player}}\n{{Fs end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Moturoa AFC players|Moturoa AFC players]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Association football clubs in New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Sport in New Plymouth]]\n", "name_user": "BG Onuku", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moturoa_AFC"}

Guastini directing the segment titled ''To Catch a Demon''. The feature film consists of four segments ''To Catch A Demon'', ''The Hunters & The Hunted'', ''Cam Girls'' and ''Amanda's Revenge'' with a short opening sequence titled ''Wrap Around''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is presented as an [[anthology]] of short horror films, built into a [[frame narrative]] which acts as its own short horror film. Each short film is linked together with the concept of [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]].\n\n===''Wrap Around''===\nSam and Marie find blood and a mess in their small theatrical playhouse, and blame their friend.\n\n===''To Catch a Demon''===\n*Directed by Vincent J. Guastini\nDr. Martin Callahan and his graduate student Nicole believe that [[night terror]]s are a result of the [[time dilation]] humans experience during [[REM sleep]], which allows \"transdimensional entities\", or what some people call [[demon]]s,  to become visible. They attempt to perform an experiment to catch these entities with their hired cameraman Jason filming using a special high-speed camera. Their first attempt catches fleeting images of an entity.\n\nDuring their second attempt, the same entity attacks Martin and sticks tentacles down his throat, using him to communicate to Nicole and Jason. Nicole and Jason lose consciousness as they attempt to flee. After regaining consciousness, they see Martin unharmed. Martin informs them they are trapped in a different time dilation due to the experiment, and that the area may have different flows of time, keeping them trapped there in a time dilation where the outside world seems frozen and they are invisible to others, just like the entities usually are. Martin thinks he can reverse the time dilation. Just as he is about to do so, Jason attempts to grab his high-speed camera and things go from bad to worse.\n\n===''The Hunters & the Hunted''===\nDavid and Karen move into a new home and almost immediately begin to hear mysterious sounds coming from the roof and from around the house. They decide to record the events. After David is attacked by an unseen force, leaving visible marks on his back, they call in paranormal investigators. The investigators arrive and the lead investigator seems overly concerned with her on-camera appearance. The team sets up equipment and recorders and conducts an investigation. They leave the house and let the cameras run overnight. As they get ready for bed, Karen, and then David, are attacked by an unseen force. The investigators review the recordings from the previous night and see a haunting image of a menacing girl. A seance is performed and mayhem ensues.\n\n===''Cam Girls''===\nCaitlin, a cam girl in a lesbian relationship, video chats with her friend telling him about unexplained blackouts after going out with her girlfriend Sindy. Caitlin says she did things she could not explain; things she would never do sober. Her friend advises her to drink less and everything should be fine. Sindy returns home and the two prepare for a special cam session where one member from a group chat will receive a free private show. Sindy asks Caitlin if she can convince her selection to cut himself, just a little bit. Sindy selects Gerry, a mild mannered overweight man. Sindy walks off screen and Caitlin begins flirting with Gerry. She asks him to give her a video tour of his house. As he gives Caitlin the tour a dark figure can be seen lurking in the background. Caitlin requests that Gerry cut his hand, which he does. Things intensify as flashes of evil are seen and the relationship between Caitlin and Gerry grows increasingly intense.\n\n===''Amanda's Revenge''===\nAmanda talks directly to the camera about being abducted and kidnapped for four months and states her intention of exacting revenge on her captors. Four month earlier, during a party, Amanda's friend Josh tells Ryan, Amanda's childhood best friend, that he saw two men carry an unconscious Amanda into a room. Ryan and Josh break into the room, subdue the molesters, and due to quick action appear to have prevented a rape from occurring. However, the next morning Amanda walks out in a trance suggesting she was violated in unimaginable ways. Suddenly the entire house quakes and Amanda sleepwalks back to her room, only to awaken with no memory of the incident. Even stranger, Ryan and Josh realize that there was no reported earthquake and everything seems fine outside.\n\nA month later Amanda calls her friends over to watch her sleep at night. Something is wrong with Amanda and she's getting worse. However, instead of staying awake, everyone mysteriously passes out and the camera shuts down. Amanda confides in Ryan, who is her childhood best friend, that something unexplainable has been happening in her life. She reveals telekinetic abilities to Ryan. However, Ryan believes it to be a trick. Amanda tells him to not worry about it, 'they' are not as smart as 'they' think they are.\n\nTwo months later, Amanda is living in a cabin miles from nowhere with no electricity. However, she has recorded a video of her abductors and she shows it to Ryan. She asks Ryan to come to the cabin to help her. Ryan agrees and Amanda sets a trap to exact her revenge.\n\n==Cast==\n* David Roy Banks as Sam\n* Sara Castro as Marie\n* David Rountree as Martin Callahan\n* [[Cortney Palm]] as Nicole\n* Matt Magnusson as Jason\n* Shawn Lockie as Karen\n* Stephen Zimpel as David\n* Jo Galloway as Susan\n* Clint Keepin as Cameron\n* Jonthan Biver as Geoff\n* Brittany Fisheli as Ashen\n* [[Emilia Zoryan]] as Caitlin\n* Anna Rose Moore as Sindy\n* Aral Gibble as Gerry\n* [[Brittany Underwood]] as Amanda Courtney\n* Jake O'Connor as Ryan\n* [[David Hull (actor)|David Hull]] as Josh\n\n== Release ==\nThe film premiered on April 22, 2016 at The Phoenix Film Festival and was released March 17, 2017 in the United States.

The city, whose population is estimated at almost 120,000 (2015), forms an urban district of its own ({{lang-de|Stadtkreis}}) and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau (district)|Alb-Donau district]]. Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former [[free imperial city]] ({{lang-de|freie Reichsstadt}}). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]]. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world ({{convert|161.53|m|abbr=on|2|disp=or}}), the Gothic minster ([[Ulm Minster]], German: Ulmer M\u00fcnster), and as the birthplace of [[Albert Einstein]]. It is also a popular meme nation in the [[Europa Universalis IV|EU4]] community do to it's position as an OPM in the middle of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This makes expansion severally limited by its surroundings. \n\n<br />\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ulm Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone.jpg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ulm Munster|M\u00fcnster]] towards Hirschstra\u00dfe.]]\nUlm lies at the point where the rivers [[Blau (Danube)|Blau]] and [[Iller]] join the [[Danube]], at an altitude of {{convert|479|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the left bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, G\u00f6gglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the right bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Neu-Ulm]] in the state of [[Bavaria]], smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).\n\nExcept for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over {{convert|620|m|2|abbr=off|lk=out}}, some of them part of the [[Swabian Alb]]. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the [[Alps]], which are approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.\n\nThe city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine [[Foreland basin]], where the basin reaches the [[Swabian Alb]]. The [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen (\"Erminger Turritellenplatte\") is a famous palaeontological site of [[Burdigalian]] age.\n\n== Neighboring communes ==\n[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_190v191r_1.jpg|thumb|Ulm in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.]]\nOn the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town [[Neu-Ulm]]. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighboring communes of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg are the following: [[Illerkirchberg]], [[Staig]], [[H\u00fcttisheim]], [[Erbach an der Donau|Erbach (Donau)]], [[Blaubeuren]], [[Blaustein]], [[Dornstadt]], [[Beimerstetten]] and [[Langenau]] as well as the eastern neighboring community [[Elchingen]].\n\n== Town subdivisions ==\nThe&nbsp;city&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into 18 districts ({{lang-de|[[:de:Stadtteile|Stadtteile]]}}): Ulm-Mitte, B\u00f6fingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, G\u00f6gglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen, Oststadt, S\u00f6flingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.\n\nNine districts that were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s (Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, G\u00f6gglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen und Unterweiler). They have own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Free Imperial City of Ulm}}\n[[File:Braun Ulm UBHD.jpg|thumb|Ulm in 1572 by [[Georg Braun|Frans Hogenberg]]]]\nThe oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early [[Neolithic]] period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King [[Louis the German]] signed a document in the King's palace of \"Hulma\" in the [[Duchy of Swabia]].<ref name=\"500px\">{{cite web|title=ulm-by-michael-vogt|url=http://500px.com/photo/9821081/ulm-by-michael-vogt|work=500px.com|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}</ref> The city was declared an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] ({{lang-de|Reichsstadt}}) by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich Barbarossa]] in 1181.\n\nAt&nbsp;first,&nbsp;Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a ''K\u00f6nigspfalz'', a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds ({{lang-de|Gro\u00dfer Schw\u00f6rbrief}}), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ([[Ulm Minster]], 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality [[textiles]]. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for [[painting|painter]]s and [[sculpture|sculptors]] like [[Hans Multscher]] and [[J\u00f6rg Syrlin the Elder]]. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the [[New World]] (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), the city began to decline gradually. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1714), it was alternately invaded several times by [[France|French]] and [[Bavaria]]n soldiers.\n\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to [[Napoleon]].]]\nIn the wars following the [[French Revolution]], the city was alternately occupied by French and [[Austria]]n forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into [[Bavaria]]. During the campaign of 1805, [[Napoleon]] managed to trap the invading Austrian army of [[Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and forced it to surrender in the [[Battle of Ulm]]. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as [[Neu-Ulm]] (New Ulm).\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the city was [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|designated a fortress]] of the [[German Confederation]] with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of [[industrialisation]] in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844\u201391) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, a [[concentration camp]] primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The [[Jews]] of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their [[synagogue]] was torn down during [[Kristallnacht]] in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War <small>II</small> (45 were sent to Theresienstadt on Aug. 22, 1942), only four returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ulm|title=Ulm|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.\n\nThe sole RAF [[strategic bombing during World War II]] against Ulm occurred on December 17, 1944, against the two large [[Transportation Plan|lorry factories]] of [[Meillerwagen|Magirus]]-Deutz and [[Karl K\u00e4ssbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|K\u00e4ssbohrer]], as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |title=RAF History - Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nMost of the city was rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but some of the historic landmark buildings have been restored. Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstra\u00dfe part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, [[Ulm University]] was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Nokia]] and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a [[twin cities|twin city]] of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of [[Neu-Ulm]], and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]] and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.\n\n{{wide image|Ulm360.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Ulm}}\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n!

The city, whose population is estimated at almost 120,000 (2015), forms an urban district of its own ({{lang-de|Stadtkreis}}) and is the administrative seat of the [[Alb-Donau (district)|Alb-Donau district]]. Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former [[free imperial city]] ({{lang-de|freie Reichsstadt}}). Today, it is an economic centre due to its varied industries, and it is the seat of the [[University of Ulm]]. Internationally, Ulm is primarily known for having the church with the tallest steeple in the world ({{convert|161.53|m|abbr=on|2|disp=or}}), the Gothic minster ([[Ulm Minster]], German: Ulmer M\u00fcnster), and as the birthplace of [[Albert Einstein]]. It is also a popular meme nation in the eu4 community do to it's position as an OPM in the middle of the Holy Roman Empire. This makes expansion severally limited by its surroundings. \n\n<br />\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ulm Fu\u00dfg\u00e4ngerzone.jpg|thumb|left|View from the [[Ulm Munster|M\u00fcnster]] towards Hirschstra\u00dfe.]]\nUlm lies at the point where the rivers [[Blau (Danube)|Blau]] and [[Iller]] join the [[Danube]], at an altitude of {{convert|479|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Most parts of the city, including the old town, are situated on the left bank of the Danube; only the districts of Wiblingen, G\u00f6gglingen, Donaustetten and Unterweiler lie on the right bank. Across from the old town, on the other side of the river, lies the [[twin cities|twin city]] of [[Neu-Ulm]] in the state of [[Bavaria]], smaller than Ulm and, until 1810, a part of it (population c. 50,000).\n\nExcept for the Danube in the south, the city is surrounded by forests and hills which rise to altitudes of over {{convert|620|m|2|abbr=off|lk=out}}, some of them part of the [[Swabian Alb]]. South of the Danube, plains and hills finally end in the northern edge of the [[Alps]], which are approximately {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} from Ulm and are visible from the city on clear days.\n\nThe city of Ulm is situated in the northern part of the North Alpine [[Foreland basin]], where the basin reaches the [[Swabian Alb]]. The [[Turritellenplatte]] of Ermingen (\"Erminger Turritellenplatte\") is a famous palaeontological site of [[Burdigalian]] age.\n\n== Neighboring communes ==\n[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_f_190v191r_1.jpg|thumb|Ulm in the 1493 ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]''.]]\nOn the right (south-eastern) side of Danube and Iller there is the Bavarian district town [[Neu-Ulm]]. On the left (north-western) side Ulm is almost completely surrounded by the Alb-Danube district. The neighboring communes of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg are the following: [[Illerkirchberg]], [[Staig]], [[H\u00fcttisheim]], [[Erbach an der Donau|Erbach (Donau)]], [[Blaubeuren]], [[Blaustein]], [[Dornstadt]], [[Beimerstetten]] and [[Langenau]] as well as the eastern neighboring community [[Elchingen]].\n\n== Town subdivisions ==\nThe&nbsp;city&nbsp;is&nbsp;divided into 18 districts ({{lang-de|[[:de:Stadtteile|Stadtteile]]}}): Ulm-Mitte, B\u00f6fingen, Donaustetten, Donautal, Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, Eselsberg, G\u00f6gglingen, Grimmelfingen, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen, Oststadt, S\u00f6flingen (with Harthausen), Unterweiler, Weststadt, and Wiblingen.\n\nNine districts that were integrated during the latest municipality reform in the 1970s (Eggingen, Einsingen, Ermingen, G\u00f6gglingen-Donaustetten, Jungingen, Lehr, M\u00e4hringen und Unterweiler). They have own local councils which acquire an important consulting position to the whole city council concerning issues that are related to the prevailing districts. But at the end, final decisions can only be made by the city council of the entire city of Ulm.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Free Imperial City of Ulm}}\n[[File:Braun Ulm UBHD.jpg|thumb|Ulm in 1572 by [[Georg Braun|Frans Hogenberg]]]]\nThe oldest traceable settlement of the Ulm area began in the early [[Neolithic]] period, around 5000 BC. Settlements of this time have been identified at the villages of Eggingen and Lehr, today districts of the city. In the city area of Ulm proper, the oldest find dates from the late Neolithic period. The earliest written mention of Ulm is dated 22 July 854 AD, when King [[Louis the German]] signed a document in the King's palace of \"Hulma\" in the [[Duchy of Swabia]].<ref name=\"500px\">{{cite web|title=ulm-by-michael-vogt|url=http://500px.com/photo/9821081/ulm-by-michael-vogt|work=500px.com|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}</ref> The city was declared an [[Imperial Free City|Imperial City]] ({{lang-de|Reichsstadt}}) by [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Friedrich Barbarossa]] in 1181.\n\nAt&nbsp;first,&nbsp;Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a ''K\u00f6nigspfalz'', a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds ({{lang-de|Gro\u00dfer Schw\u00f6rbrief}}), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church ([[Ulm Minster]], 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens. Ulm blossomed during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly due to the export of high-quality [[textiles]]. The city was situated at the crossroads of important trade routes extending to Italy. These centuries, during which many important buildings were erected, also represented the zenith of art in Ulm, especially for [[painting|painter]]s and [[sculpture|sculptors]] like [[Hans Multscher]] and [[J\u00f6rg Syrlin the Elder]]. During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Ulm became Protestant (1530). With the establishment of new trade routes following the discovery of the [[New World]] (16th century) and the outbreak and consequences of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), the city began to decline gradually. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701-1714), it was alternately invaded several times by [[France|French]] and [[Bavaria]]n soldiers.\n\n[[File:Charles Th\u00e9venin - Reddition de la ville d'Ulm.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Ulm. General Mack and 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered to [[Napoleon]].]]\nIn the wars following the [[French Revolution]], the city was alternately occupied by French and [[Austria]]n forces, with the former ones destroying the city fortifications. In 1803, it lost the status of Imperial City and was absorbed into [[Bavaria]]. During the campaign of 1805, [[Napoleon]] managed to trap the invading Austrian army of [[Karl Freiherr Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and forced it to surrender in the [[Battle of Ulm]]. In 1810, Ulm was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]] and lost its districts on the other bank of the Danube, which came to be known as [[Neu-Ulm]] (New Ulm).\n\nIn the mid-19th century, the city was [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|designated a fortress]] of the [[German Confederation]] with huge military construction works directed primarily against the threat of a French invasion. The city became an important centre of [[industrialisation]] in southern Germany in the second half of the 19th century, its built-up area now being extended beyond the medieval walls. The construction of the huge minster, which had been interrupted in the 16th century for economic reasons, was resumed and eventually finished (1844\u201391) in a wave of German national enthusiasm for the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935, a [[concentration camp]] primarily for political opponents of the regime was established on the Kuhberg, one of the hills surrounding Ulm. The [[Jews]] of Ulm, around 500 people, were first discriminated against and later persecuted; their [[synagogue]] was torn down during [[Kristallnacht]] in November 1938. Of 116 Jews deported from Ulm during World War <small>II</small> (45 were sent to Theresienstadt on Aug. 22, 1942), only four returned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ulm|title=Ulm|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> Approximately 25 Jews were living in Ulm in 1968.\n\nThe sole RAF [[strategic bombing during World War II]] against Ulm occurred on December 17, 1944, against the two large [[Transportation Plan|lorry factories]] of [[Meillerwagen|Magirus]]-Deutz and [[Karl K\u00e4ssbohrer Fahrzeugwerke|K\u00e4ssbohrer]], as well as other industries, barracks, and depots in Ulm. The Gallwitz Barracks and several military hospitals were among 14 Wehrmacht establishments destroyed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |title=RAF History - Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |publisher=Raf.mod.uk |accessdate=2009-05-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/dec44.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 }}</ref> The raid killed 707 Ulm inhabitants and left 25,000 homeless and after all the bombings, over 80% of the medieval city centre lay in ruins.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nMost of the city was rebuilt in the plain and simple style of the 1950s and 1960s, but some of the historic landmark buildings have been restored. Due to its almost complete destruction in 1944, the Hirschstra\u00dfe part of the city primarily consists of modern architecture. Ulm experienced substantial growth in the decades following World War II, with the establishment of large new housing projects and new industrial zones. In 1967, [[Ulm University]] was founded, which proved to be of great importance for the development of the city. Particularly since the 1980s, the transition from classical industry towards the high-tech sector has accelerated, with, for example, the establishment of research centres of companies like [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Nokia]] and a number of small applied research institutes near the university campus. The city today is still growing, forming a [[twin cities|twin city]] of 170,000 inhabitants together with its neighbouring Bavarian city of [[Neu-Ulm]], and seems to benefit from its central position between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Munich]] and thus between the cultural and economic hubs of southern Germany.\n\n{{wide image|Ulm360.jpg|1000px|Panorama of Ulm}}\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:center;\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Significant minority groups'''\n|-\n!

The establishment of the [[University of Ulm]] in 1967, which focuses on [[biomedicine]], the sciences, and engineering, helped support a transition to high-tech industry, especially after the crisis of classical industries in the 1980s. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nCompanies with headquarters in Ulm include:\n* [[Britax]] (Child safety products)\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Ebner & Spiegel|de}} (book printing)\n* [[Gardena AG]] (gardening tools)\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|H.

The affected reactors were adjacent to one another and accident management was made much more difficult because of the number of simultaneous hazards concentrated in a small area. Failure of emergency power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air [[spent fuel pool]]s. Plant workers were put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with [[nuclear meltdown|core meltdowns]] at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units.\n\nAutomated cooling systems were installed within 3 months from the accident. A fabric cover was built to protect the buildings from storms and heavy rainfall. New detectors were installed at the plant to track emissions of [[xenon]] gas. Filters were installed to reduce contaminants from escaping the area of the plant into the area or atmosphere. Cement has been laid near to the seabed to control contaminants from accidentally entering the ocean.\n\nMichio Aoyama, a scientist at Fukushima University's Institute of Environmental Radioactivity, estimated that the meltdowns and explosions released 18,000 [[terabecquerel]] (TBq) of caesium 137, mostly into the Pacific Ocean. He also estimated that two years after the accident, the stricken plant was still releasing 30 [[gigabecquerel]] (30 GBq, or approximately 0.8 [[curie (unit)|curie]]) of caesium 137 and the same amount of strontium 90 into the ocean daily.<ref>{{cite news |title=With a Plant's Tainted Water Still Flowing, No End to Environmental Fears|author=Martin Fackler and Hiroko Tabuchi |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/world/asia/with-a-plants-tainted-water-still-flowing-no-end-to-environmental-fears.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 24, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> In September 2013, it was reported that the level of strontium-90 detected in a drainage ditch located near a water storage tank from which around 300 tons of water was found to have leaked was believed to have exceeded the threshold set by the government.<ref name=\"mainichi.jp\">The Mainichi Shimbun (13 September 2013) [http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130913p2g00m0dm041000c.html Toxic water has leaked into Pacific Ocean: TEPCO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915205527/http://mainichi.jp/english/english/newsselect/news/20130913p2g00m0dm041000c.html |date=2013-09-15 }}</ref> Efforts to control the flow of contaminated water have included trying to isolate the plant behind a 30-meter-deep, 1.5-kilometer-long \"ice wall\" of frozen soil, which has had limited success.<ref>{{cite news |title=Japan's $320 Million Gamble at Fukushima: An Underground Ice Wall|author=Martin Fackler|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/science/fukushima-daiichi-nuclear-plant-cleanup-ice-wall.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 29, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[nuclear decommissioning|Decommissioning]] the plant is estimated to cost tens of billions of dollars and last 30\u201340 years.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/01/fukushima-radiation-levels-higher-japan Fukushima radiation levels 18 times higher than previously thought] [[The Guardian]] 1 September 2013</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Doubts over ice wall to keep Fukushima safe from damaged nuclear reactors |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/13/doubts-giant-ice-wall-fukushima-nuclear-reactors |work=The Guardian |date=13 July 2014 |accessdate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> \nWhile radioactive particles were found to have contaminated rice harvested near Fukushima City in the autumn of 2011,<ref>{{cite news |title=Fukushima Rice Banned by Japan|author=Justin McCurry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/fukushima-rice-banned-by-japan|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 18, 2011|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}</ref> fears of contamination in the soil have receded as government measures to protect the food supply have appeared to be successful.

Two workers suffered skin burns from radiation, but no serious injuries or fatalities have been documented to have been caused by radiation at Fukushima Dai-ichi.\n\n===Unskilled workforce===\nThe disaster in Fukushima has revealed the practice of Japanese nuclear power plants systematically using unskilled laborers with short contracts. These people are paid per day, and are hired per day from questionable agencies and firms. From data provided by NISA, it was concluded that 80 percent of all of the workforce hired in commercial nuclear power plants is done using temporary contracts, In Fukushima this number was even higher, at 89 percent. This had been practiced for decades. Unemployed people gathered in parks in the morning, and were picked up to be taken to the nuclear power plants. They would get a contract for a few months to do unskilled and the most dangerous labor.

The shelters were constructed by [[Toshiba Corporation]] and the [[Kajima Corporation]] at a place some 2 kilometers west of the damaged reactors, just outside the plant compound, but quite near to the reactors 1 to 4. The shelters were built after the shelters at the plant compound became overcrowded. At 7 October 2011 radiation levels in the Toshiba building were between 2 and 16 [[sievert|microsieverts]] per hour, in the Kajima dorm it was 2 to 8.5 microsieverts per hour. The Industrial Safety and Health Law on the prevention of health damage through ionizing radiation had set the limit for accumulated radiation dosage in radiation management zones at 1.3 millisieverts over three months, so the maximum level is 2.6 microsieverts/hour. In both dorms the radiation levels were higher. These doses are, however, well below the level to affect human health. According to the law, the \"business operator\" is responsible for \"managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination\", Toshiba and Kajima said that TEPCO was responsible. But a TEPCO official made the comment: \"From the perspective of protecting workers from radiation, the business operators (that constructed the shelters) are managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination\" in this way suggesting that Toshiba and Kajima had to take the care for the zone management.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (31 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html Workers in shelters just outside gates of nuclear complex miss out on allowance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031184800/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html |date=October 31, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Preventing hydrogen explosions==\nOn 26 September 2011, after the discovery of hydrogen in a pipe leading to the containment vessel of reactor no.1, NISA instructed TEPCO to check whether hydrogen was building up in reactor no. 2 and 3 as well.

TEPCO decided in the first week of October to use the \"Sally\" decontamination system built by Toshiba Corporation and keep the Kurion/Areva system as backup.\n\nOn 27 September after three months operation some 4,700 drums with radioactive waste had piled up at the plant. The Kurion and Sally systems both utilized [[zeolite]]s to concentrate cesium. After the zeolite was saturated, the vessels with the zeolite were turned into nuclear waste. By now, 210 Kurion-made vessels with a total of 307 cubic meters, each vessel measuring 0.9 meters in diameter and 2.3 meters in height had accumulated at the plant. The Areva-filters used sand to absorb radioactive materials and chemicals were used to reactivate the filters. In this way, 581 cubic meters of highly contaminated sludge were produced.\n\nAccording to Professor Akio Koyama of the Kyoto University Research Reactor Institute, the density of high-level decontaminated water was believed to contain 10 gigabecquerel per liter, but if this is condensed to polluted sludge and zeolites, this density could increase 10,000 fold.

Within 10 years, a start should be made with the retrieval of the melted fuel within the reactors. First, the containment vessels of reactors 1, 2 and 3 should be repaired, then all should be filled with water to prevent radiation releases. Decommissioning would take more than 30 years, because the pressure vessels of the reactor vessels are damaged also.

In Fukushima, however, with three meltdowns at one site, the damage was much more extensive. It could take 30 years or more to remove the nuclear fuel, dismantle the reactors, and remove all the buildings.\nResearch institutions all over the world were asked to participate in the construction of a research site to examine the removal of fuel and other nuclear wastes.

The shelters were built after the shelters at the plant compound became overcrowded. At 7 October 2011 radiation levels in the Toshiba building were between 2 and 16 [[sievert|microsieverts]] per hour, in the Kajima dorm it was 2 to 8.5 microsieverts per hour. The Industrial Safety and Health Law on the prevention of health damage through ionizing radiation had set the limit for accumulated radiation dosage in radiation management zones at 1.3 millisieverts over three months, so the maximum level is 2.6 microsieverts/hour. In both dorms the radiation levels were higher. These doses are, however, well below the level to affect human health. According to the law, the \"business operator\" is responsible for \"managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination\", Toshiba and Kajima said that TEPCO was responsible. But a TEPCO official made the comment: \"From the perspective of protecting workers from radiation, the business operators (that constructed the shelters) are managing radiation dosage and the prevention of contamination\" in this way suggesting that Toshiba and Kajima had to take the care for the zone management.<ref>The Mainichi Daily News (31 October 2011) [http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html Workers in shelters just outside gates of nuclear complex miss out on allowance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031184800/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111031p2a00m0na009000c.html |date=October 31, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Preventing hydrogen explosions==\nOn 26 September 2011, after the discovery of hydrogen in a pipe leading to the containment vessel of reactor no.1, NISA instructed TEPCO to check whether hydrogen was building up in reactor no. 2 and 3 as well.

They assumed that the radioactivity had escaped early in the beginning of the disaster in 2011, but NRA experts{{who|date=February 2017}} had serious doubts about their assumption. According to them, other sources could not be excluded. Numerous pipes were running everywhere on the reactor grounds to cool the reactors and decontaminate the water used, and leaks could be anywhere. TEPCO's solution resulted in redirection of the groundwater flows, which could have spread the radioactive contamination further. Besides that, TEPCO had plans for pumping groundwater.{{elucidate|date=February 2017}} At that time the turbine buildings of units 2 and 3 contained 5000 and 6000 cubic meters of radioactive water. With wells in contact with the turbine buildings, this could spread the radioactivity into the ground.

TEPCO decided in the first week of October to use the \"Sally\" decontamination system built by Toshiba Corporation and keep the Kurion/Areva system as backup.\n\nOn 27 September after three months operation some 4,700 drums with radioactive waste had piled up at the plant. The Kurion and Sally systems both utilized [[zeolite]]s to concentrate cesium. After the zeolite was saturated, the vessels with the zeolite were turned into nuclear waste. By now, 210 Kurion-made vessels with a total of 307 cubic meters, each vessel measuring 0.9 meters in diameter and 2.3 meters in height had accumulated at the plant. The Areva-filters used sand to absorb radioactive materials and chemicals were used to reactivate the filters.

Because of the proximity of the reactors, Plant Director Masao Yoshida \"was put in the position of trying to cope simultaneously with core meltdowns at three reactors and exposed fuel pools at three units\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/early/2012/02/29/0096340212440359.full.pdf+html |title=Fukushima in review: A complex disaster, a disastrous response |author=Yoichi Funabashi and Kay Kitazawa |date=March 1, 2012 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tritiated water]]\n* [[Human decontamination]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{cite book | title=\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u9707\u707d\u306e\u8a18\u9332 - \u539f\u5b50\u529b\u4e8b\u6545\u3068\u8a08\u753b\u505c\u96fb - | editor=\u96fb\u6c17\u65b0\u805e | publisher=(\u793e)\u65e5\u672c\u96fb\u6c17\u5354\u4f1a\u65b0\u805e\u90e8 | year=2011 | ref=record(2011) }}\n; Management of contaminated water\n* {{citation | author=The Committee on countermeasures for contaminated water treatment | title=Preventative and Multilayered Measures for Contaminated Water Treatment at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Company - Through completeness of comprehensive risk management - | year=2013 | url=http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/pdf/131210report_E.pdf | ref=CCWT(2013) }}\n* {{citation | author=Tritiated Water Task Force | title=Tritiated Water Task Force Report | year=2016 | url=http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/pdf/20160915_01a.pdf | ref=HTOreport(2016) }}\n* {{citation | author=METI | title=Important Stories on Decommissioning-Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, now and in the future | url=http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/pdf/20160527_01.pdf | year=2016 | ref=brochure(2016) }}\n* {{citation | series=NUREG | title=Answers to Frequently Asked Questions About Cleanup Activities at Three Mile Island, Unit 2 | url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/6861449 | year=1984 | ref=TMI_QA(1984) | doi=10.2172/6861449 }}\n* {{cite book | author=\u7a7a\u672c \u8aa0\u559c | title=\u6c5a\u67d3\u6c34\u3068\u306e\u95d8\u3044 \u2212\u798f\u5cf6\u7b2c\u4e00\u539f\u767a\u30fb\u5371\u6a5f\u306e\u6df1\u5c64\u2212 | publisher=\u7b51\u6469\u66f8\u623f | series=\u3061\u304f\u307e\u65b0\u66f8 | year=2014 | ref=Soramoto(2014) }}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131013061217/http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/96_abe/decisions/2013/osensui_e.html PM Information on contaminated water leakage at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station], Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet\n* [http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/incidents/index.html MOFA Information on contaminated water leakage at TEPCO\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]\n* [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/press/corp-com/release/index-e.html TEPCO News Releases], [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]]\n* [http://www.nsr.go.jp/english/ NRA, Japan], [[Nuclear Regulation Authority]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130810033718/http://www.nsr.go.jp/archive/nisa/english/index.html NISA], [[Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency]], former organization\n* [http://fukushima-diary.com/ Fukushima Diary] News site of a concerned Japanese man in Europe\n* [http://www.tepco.co.jp/en/decommision/index-e.html Decommissioning plan of Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station]\n* [http://www.meti.go.jp/english/earthquake/nuclear/decommissioning/index.html Mid-and-Long-Term Roadmap towards the Decommissioning of TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Units 1-4]\n\n{{Nuclear power in Japan}}\n\n[[Category:Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]]\n[[Category:Ecological restoration]]\n[[Category:Fukushima Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Radioactively contaminated areas]]\n", "name_user": "Michelle.niebur", "label": "safe", "comment": "added update and citation to estimate of total clean up costs", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_disaster_cleanup"}
