They attended [[Holy Mass|Mass]] daily, prayed the [[Rosary]] nightly, and abstained from meat three days a week in honor of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]].<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/> Although Francesco's parents and grandparents were illiterate, they narrated Bible stories to their children.\n\nAccording to the diary of Father Agostino da San Marco (who was later his spiritual director in [[San Marco in Lamis]]) the young Francesco was afflicted with a number of illnesses. At six he suffered from severe [[gastroenteritis]]. At ten he caught [[typhoid fever]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:KOS O PIO.jpg|thumb|left|The conventual cell of Padre Pio]]\nAs a youth, Francesco reported that he had experienced heavenly [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasies]].<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> In 1897, after he had completed three years at the public school, Francesco was said to have been drawn to the life of a friar after listening to a young [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] who was in the countryside seeking donations. When Francesco expressed his desire to his parents, they made a trip to [[Morcone]], a community {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of Pietrelcina, to find out if their son was eligible to enter the Order.

He underwent private tutoring and passed the stipulated academic requirements. On 6 January 1903, at the age of 15, he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Capuchin friars at Morcone.

He vomited frequently and could digest only milk and cheese. Religious devotees point to this time that inexplicable phenomena allegedly began to occur. During prayers for example, Pio appeared to others to be in a stupor, as if he were absent. One of Pio's fellow friars later claimed to have seen him in [[religious ecstasy|\necstasy]], and allegedly [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] above the ground.<ref>Renzo Allegri, ''I miracoli di Padre Pio'' p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn June 1905, Pio's health worsened to such an extent that his superiors decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return home. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, On 27 January 1907, he still made his solemn [[Profession (religious)|profession]].\n\nIn 1910, Pio was subsequently [[ordination|ordained]] a priest by [[Archbishop]] Paolo Schinosi at the Cathedral of [[Benevento]]. Four days later, he offered his first Mass at the parish church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady of the Angels]]. His health being precarious, he was permitted to remain with his family until 1916 while still retaining the Capuchin habit.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20020616_padre-pio_en.html \"Padre Pio da Pietrelcina\", Vatican News Service]</ref>\n\nOn 4 September 1916, however, Pio was ordered to return to his community life. He moved to an agricultural community, [[Our Lady of Grace]] Capuchin [[Monastery|Friary]], located in the Gargano Mountains in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the [[Province of Foggia]]. At that time the community numbered seven friars. He went on to remain at San Giovanni Rotondo until his death in 1968, except for a period of military service. In the priesthood, Padre Pio was known to perform a number of successful conversions to Catholicism.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3ApWCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT128&lpg=PT128&dq=padre+pio+mason+confession#v=onepage&q=%20mason%20&f=false | title=Padre Pio: The Stigmatist| isbn=9781618902634| last1=Charles Mortimer Carty| first1=Rev.

His advice on the practical application of theology he often summed up in his now famous quote, \"Pray, Hope and Don\u2019t Worry\". He directed Christians to recognize God in all things and to desire above all things to do the will of God.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\nMany people who heard of him traveled to [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Pio's mother died at the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Pio had his elderly father Grazio live with him. His brother Michele also moved in. Pio's father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|author =Ylva-Kristina Sj\u00f6blom|title=Padre Pio|publisher=Catholica|pages=10, 85}}</ref>\n\n===First World War and aftermath===\n\nWhen [[World War I]] started, four friars from this community were selected for military service in the Italian army. At that time, Padre Pio was a teacher at the seminary and a spiritual director. When one more friar was called into service, Pio was put in charge of the community. On 15 November 1915, he was drafted and on December 6, assigned to the 10th Medical Corps in [[Naples]]. Due to poor health, he was continually discharged and recalled until on 16 March 1918, he was declared unfit for service and discharged completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/chronology.asp|title=Chronology|website=Padre Pio Devotions}}</ref>\n\nPeople who had started rebuilding their lives after the war began to see in Padre Pio a symbol of hope.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> Those close to him attest that he began to manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, [[bilocation]], levitation, [[prophecy]], [[miracle]]s, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Padre Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only communion wafers without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of [[Glossolalia|tongues]], the gift of conversions, and pleasant-smelling wounds.<ref name = \"garabandal\">{{Cite web |last=Pelletier |first=Joseph A |title=Padre Pio, Mary, and the Rosary |website=Garabandal |url=http://www.garabandal.us/padre-pio-mary-and-the-rosary-rev-joseph-pelletier-aa |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>\n\nPadre Pio increasingly became well known among the wider populace.

In his report, Bishop Rossi wrote that Padre Pio \u201cheld his head high and was serene, his look lively and sweet, his words gleamed with kindness and sincerity.\u201d\n\nThe task that began on June 14 of that year lasted for eight days, during which Bishop Rossi observed Padre Pio in detail. He wrote that he was very gentle with his brothers, beloved by his superiors for being a \u201cgreat example and not a gossiper.\u201d\u00a0 He spent 10-12 hours a day in the confessional and he celebrated the Mass with \u201cextraordinary devotion.\u201d\n\n=== Amico Bignami, medical examination from 1919 ===\nThe pathologist Amico Bignami conducted a medical examination of Father Pio's wounds in 1919 and concluded that it was a skin necrosis that was hindered from healing by chemicals such as iodine tincture.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (ref. 2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age. P. 39.</ref>\n\n=== Giorgio Festa, medical examinations 1919 and 1920 ===\nFesta was a physician and examined Pio in 1919 and 1920.

He came to the conclusion that Francesco Forgione was a man of \"restricted field of knowledge, low psychic energy, monotonous ideas, little volition.\" <ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age. P. 59.</ref> Gemelli critically judged Pio: \"The case is one of suggestion unconsciously planted by Father Benedetto in the weak mind of Padre Pio, producing those characteristic manifestations of [[psittacism]] that are intrinsic to the hysteric mind.\"<ref>\" \"Sergio Luzzatto (2011) Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age. P. 59.</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Holy Office, Gemelli re-examined Father Pio in 1925, writing a report in April 1926. This time he let Pio show him the wounds. Gemelli saw as its cause the use of a corrosive substance. Pio had attached himself to these wounds. The Jesuit Festa had previously tried to question Gemelli's comments on stigmata in general.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 140.</ref> Gemelli responded to this criticism in his report and resorted to responding to his knowledge of self-inflicted wounds. He therefore clarified his statements about the nature of Pio's wounds: \"Anyone with experience in forensic medicine, and above all in variety by sores and wounds that self-destructive soldiers were presented during the war, can have no doubt that these were wounds of erosion caused by the use of a caustic substance. The base of the sore and its shape are in every way similar to the sores observed in soldiers who procured them with chemical means.\"<ref>In: Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 140.</ref>\n\nOnce again, Gemelli judged Father Pio's mental abilities as limited: \"He [Pio] is the ideal partner with whom former Minister Provincial Father Benedetto is able to create an incubus-succubus pair ... He is a good priest: calm, quiet, meek, more because of the mental deficiency than out of virtue. A poor soul, able to repeat a few stereotypical religious phrases, a poor, sick man who has learned his lesson from his master, Father Benedetto.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 141.</ref> Gemelli wrote in 1940 and later several times to the Holy Office on what he considers to be unjustified claims to the sanctity of Father Pio.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in Secular Age, p. 259.</ref>\n\n=== Raffaele Rossi, First Apostolic Visitation of 1921 ===\nThe Bishop of Volterra, [[Raffaele Carlo Rossi|Raffaele Rossi]], [[Discalced Carmelite|Carmelite]], was formally commissioned on June 11, 1921 by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] to make a canonical inquiry concerning Father Pio. Rossi began his [[Canonical visitation|Apostolic Visitation]] on June 14 in San Giovanni Rotondo with the interrogation of witnesses, two [[diocesan priests]] and seven [[friars]]. After eight days of investigation, he finally completed a benevolent report, which he sent to the Holy Office on October 4, 1921, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. The extensive and detailed report essentially stated the following: Father Pio, of whom Rossi had a favorable impression, was a good religious and the San Giovanni Rotondo convent was a good community. Whatever is extraordinary about what Father Pio does that can not be explained, but certainly not by the intervention of the devil, or by deception or dizziness. Public exuberance has declined sharply.<ref>Francesco Castelli, '' Padre Pio Under Investigation - The secret Vatican files '', Ignatius Press, 2011, p. 20, p. 28, p. 67</ref><ref>https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/details_of_first_investigation_into_padre_pios_stigmata_revealed</ref> During the interviews with the witnesses, which Rossi undertook a total of three times, he let himself be shown the stigmata of the then 34-year-old Father Pio.

In another journal note, John XXIII wrote that he wanted to take action. In fact, he ordered another Apostolic Visitation.<ref name=\"Sergio Luzzatto 2011 p. 271\"/>\n\n=== Carlo Maccari, Second Apostolic Visitation of 1960 ===\nFather Carlo Maccari was Secretary-General of the Diocese of Rome and met Pio nine times altogether.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 272.</ref> Pio was very suspicious of Maccari, who wrote in his diary: \"Reticence, narrowness of mind, lies - these are the weapons he uses to evade my questions ... Overall impression: pitiful.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 273.</ref> Maccari demanded Father Pio's omission to practice kisses after the confession for the lay sisters. In his report, Maccari noted that Pio had inadequate religious education. He works a lot for a man of his age. He is not an ascetic and has many connections to the outside world. In general, there is too much mixing of the \"sacred\" and the \"all too human\".<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 274.</ref> Maccari noted in his report by name, which woman stated at what time to have been the lover of Pio - without clearly assessing whether all these statements were true.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 274.</ref> Maccari focused on assessing the fanaticism of Pio's social environment, describing it as \"religious conceptions that oscillate between superstition and magic.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 275.</ref> Maccari called Pio's supporters \"a vast and dangerous organization.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 276.</ref> Pio never had his own supporters advised to moderation.

The brothers of Santa Maria delle Grazie should gradually be relocated, a new abbot should come from outside the region. No one should be allowed to confess to Pio more than once a month. The hospital was to be given new statutory statutes to sever the responsibilities of the medical and spiritual \"healing\" capuchins.<ref name=\"Sergio Luzzatto 2011 p. 277\"/>\nFollowing Maccari's Apostolic Visitation, John XXIII noted in his diary that he sees Father Pio as a \"straw idol\" (''idolo di stoppa'').<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 278.</ref>\n\n[[File:KOS San Giovanni Rotondo.jpg|thumb|The Hospital that was built on Padre Pio's initiative in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]], [[Italy]].

In the middle of the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, about the size of a penny, accompanied by acute pain in the middle of the red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlready in a letter dated March 21, 1912, to his spiritual companion and confessor, Father Agostino, Father Pio wrote of his devotion to the mystical body of Christ and the intuition that he, Pio, one day himself would bear the stigmata of Christ. Luzzatto points out that in this letter Father Pio uses unrecognized passages from a book by the stigmatized mystic [[Gemma Galgani]]. Later Pio denied knowing or owning the cited book.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011):  Padre Pio: ''Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age'', p. 19.</ref>\n\nHis close friend Padre Agostino wrote in 1915, asking specific questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Pio replied that he had been favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). Although he had been granted the stigmata, he had been so terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since he considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, while hearing confessions, Pio claimed to have had a reappearance of the physical occurrence of the stigmata.  The phenomenon was reported to have continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} He reported to Agostino that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/> Though Pio said he would have preferred to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news had begun to spread. Pio often wore red mittens or black coverings on his hands and feet as he was embarrassed by the marks.<ref name=\"time2\"/> However, no visible scarring was present at the time of Pio's death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-05-12|url=http://www.padrepio.com/his-life| title =Padre Pio's Cell| website =Padre Pio Foundation| accessdate = 2006-05-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Padre-Pio-young.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio showing the [[stigmata]] (detail from a photo from August 19, 1919) <ref>Complete illustration of the photograph by [[Urte Krass]]: ''Kontrollierter Gesichtsverlust.

[...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation<ref name=\"cantius\">{{Cite web| title = First class relic of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina at St. John Cantius Church| url = http://www.cantius.org/go/organizations/relic_of_st_padre_pio_of_pietrelcina| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.<ref>Fortin, Fr.

Days passed and between 5 and 7 August, Padre Pio had a vision in which Christ appeared and pierced his side.<ref name = \"gerhold\"/><ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\nAs a result, Padre Pio claimed to have received a physical wound in his side. This occurrence is considered as a [[transverberation]] or \"piercing of the heart\", indicating the union of love with God within Christian mysticism. \n[[File:3rd class relic PIO.jpg|thumb|Many books about Padre Pio included a [[Relic|third-class relic]] (cloth) on a prayer card.

One of his Capuchin brothers said this of his state during that period:\n\n<blockquote>During this time his entire appearance looked altered as if he had died. He was constantly weeping and sighing, saying that God had forsaken him.<ref name = \"gerhold\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn a letter from Padre Pio to Padre Benedetto, dated 21 August 1918, Padre Pio writes of his experiences during the transverberation:\n\n<blockquote>While I was hearing the boys\u2019 confessions on the evening of the 5th [August] I was suddenly terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind\u2019s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.<ref name=\"cantius\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, accounts state that the pains of the transverberation had ceased and Pio was in \"profound peace.\"<ref name = \"gerhold\"/> On that day, as he was engaged in prayer in the choir loft in the Church of Our Lady of Grace, he received another celestial vision which led to [[religious ecstasy]]. When the ecstasy ended, Pio claimed to have received the visible stigmata, the five wounds of Christ. This time, the stigmata were permanent. They stayed visible for the next fifty years of his life.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\n===Prophecy===\n\nIn 1947, Father Karol J\u00f3zef Wojty\u0142a (later [[Pope John Paul II]]) visited Padre Pio, who heard his confession.

Due to the large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, Padre Pio's superior decided the Solemn Mass must proceed. Padre Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and fragile. His voice was weak and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].\n\nEarly in the morning of 23 September 1968, Pio made his last [[Sacrament of Reconciliation|confession]] and renewed his Franciscan vows.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> As was customary, he had his [[rosary]] in his hands, though he did not have the strength to say the [[Hail Mary]]s aloud.

The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990 Pio was declared a [[Servant of God]], the first step in the process of canonization. The investigation, however, did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on his previous 'excommunication' or on the allegations that his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio's stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] debated how Padre Pio had lived his life, and in 1997 Pope John Paul II declared him [[venerable]]. A discussion of the effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio's [[intercession]]. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed. A media offensive by the Capuchins was able to realise a broad acceptation of the contested saint in society.<ref>Peter Jan Margry, 'Il \"marketing\" di Padre Pio.

They attended [[Holy Mass|Mass]] daily, prayed the [[Rosary]] nightly, and abstained from meat three days a week in honor of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]].<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/> Although Francesco's parents and grandparents were illiterate, they narrated Bible stories to their children.\n\nAccording to the diary of Father Agostino da San Marco (who was later his spiritual director in [[San Marco in Lamis]]) the young Francesco was afflicted with a number of illnesses. At six he suffered from severe [[gastroenteritis]]. At ten he caught [[typhoid fever]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:KOS O PIO.jpg|thumb|left|The conventual cell of Padre Pio]]\nAs a youth, Francesco reported that he had experienced heavenly [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]s and [[Religious ecstasy|ecstasies]].<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> In 1897, after he had completed three years at the public school, Francesco was said to have been drawn to the life of a friar after listening to a young [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] who was in the countryside seeking donations. When Francesco expressed his desire to his parents, they made a trip to [[Morcone]], a community {{convert|13|mi|km}} north of Pietrelcina, to find out if their son was eligible to enter the Order. The friars there informed them that they were interested in accepting Francesco into their community, but he needed to be better educated.<ref name=\"ewtn1\"/>\n\nFrancesco's father went to the [[United States]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1147|title=Saints|publisher=The American Catholic|accessdate=}}</ref> in search of work to pay for private tutoring for his son, to meet the academic requirements to enter the Capuchin Order.<ref name=\"Ruffin\"/> It was in this period that Francesco received the [[sacrament]] of [[Confirmation]] on 27 September 1899. He underwent private tutoring and passed the stipulated academic requirements. On 6 January 1903, at the age of 15, he entered the [[novitiate]] of the Capuchin friars at Morcone.

He vomited frequently and could digest only milk and cheese. Religious devotees point to this time that inexplicable phenomena allegedly began to occur. During prayers for example, Pio appeared to others to be in a stupor, as if he were absent. One of Pio's fellow friars later claimed to have seen him in [[religious ecstasy|\necstasy]], and allegedly [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] above the ground.<ref>Renzo Allegri, ''I miracoli di Padre Pio'' p. 21.</ref>\n\nIn June 1905, Pio's health worsened to such an extent that his superiors decided to send him to a mountain convent, in the hope that the change of air would do him good. This had little impact, however, and doctors advised that he return home. Even there his health failed to improve. Despite this, On 27 January 1907, he still made his solemn [[Profession (religious)|profession]].\n\nIn 1910, Pio was subsequently [[ordination|ordained]] a priest by [[Archbishop]] Paolo Schinosi at the Cathedral of [[Benevento]]. Four days later, he offered his first Mass at the parish church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady of the Angels]]. His health being precarious, he was permitted to remain with his family until 1916 while still retaining the Capuchin habit.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20020616_padre-pio_en.html \"Padre Pio da Pietrelcina\", Vatican News Service]</ref>\n\nOn 4 September 1916, however, Pio was ordered to return to his community life. He moved to an agricultural community, [[Our Lady of Grace]] Capuchin [[Monastery|Friary]], located in the Gargano Mountains in [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] in the [[Province of Foggia]]. At that time the community numbered seven friars. He went on to remain at San Giovanni Rotondo until his death in 1968, except for a period of military service. In the priesthood, Padre Pio was known to perform a number of successful conversions to Catholicism.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=3ApWCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT128&lpg=PT128&dq=padre+pio+mason+confession#v=onepage&q=%20mason%20&f=false | title=Padre Pio: The Stigmatist| isbn=9781618902634| last1=Charles Mortimer Carty| first1=Rev.

His advice on the practical application of theology he often summed up in his now famous quote, \"Pray, Hope and Don\u2019t Worry\". He directed Christians to recognize God in all things and to desire above all things to do the will of God.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/>\n\nMany people who heard of him traveled to [[San Giovanni Rotondo]] to meet him and confess to him, ask for help, or have their curiosity satisfied. Pio's mother died at the village around the convent in 1928. Later, in 1938, Pio had his elderly father Grazio live with him. His brother Michele also moved in. Pio's father lived in a little house outside the convent, until his death in 1946.<ref>{{cite book|author =Ylva-Kristina Sj\u00f6blom|title=Padre Pio|publisher=Catholica|pages=10, 85}}</ref>\n\n===First World War and aftermath===\n\nWhen [[World War I]] started, four friars from this community were selected for military service in the Italian army. At that time, Padre Pio was a teacher at the seminary and a spiritual director. When one more friar was called into service, Pio was put in charge of the community. On 15 November 1915, he was drafted and on December 6, assigned to the 10th Medical Corps in [[Naples]]. Due to poor health, he was continually discharged and recalled until on 16 March 1918, he was declared unfit for service and discharged completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.padrepiodevotions.org/chronology.asp|title=Chronology|website=Padre Pio Devotions}}</ref>\n\nPeople who had started rebuilding their lives after the war began to see in Padre Pio a symbol of hope.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> Those close to him attest that he began to manifest several spiritual gifts, including the gifts of healing, [[bilocation]], levitation, [[prophecy]], [[miracle]]s, extraordinary abstinence from both sleep and nourishment (one account states that Padre Agostino recorded one instance in which Padre Pio was able to subsist for at least 20 days at Verafeno on only communion wafers without any other nourishment), the ability to read hearts, the gift of [[Glossolalia|tongues]], the gift of conversions, and pleasant-smelling wounds.<ref name = \"garabandal\">{{Cite web |last=Pelletier |first=Joseph A |title=Padre Pio, Mary, and the Rosary |website=Garabandal |url=http://www.garabandal.us/padre-pio-mary-and-the-rosary-rev-joseph-pelletier-aa |accessdate=2008-01-19}}</ref>\n\nPadre Pio increasingly became well known among the wider populace.

He came to the conclusion that Francesco Forgione was a man of \"restricted field of knowledge, low psychic energy, monotonous ideas, little volition.\" <ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age.

P. 59.</ref>\n\nOn behalf of the Holy Office, Gemelli re-examined Father Pio in 1925, writing a report in April 1926. This time he let Pio show him the wounds. Gemelli saw as its cause the use of a corrosive substance. Pio had attached himself to these wounds. The Jesuit Festa had previously tried to question Gemelli's comments on stigmata in general.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 140.</ref> Gemelli responded to this criticism in his report and resorted to responding to his knowledge of self-inflicted wounds. He therefore clarified his statements about the nature of Pio's wounds: \"Anyone with experience in forensic medicine, and above all in variety by sores and wounds that self-destructive soldiers were presented during the war, can have no doubt that these were wounds of erosion caused by the use of a caustic substance.

Rossi began his [[Canonical visitation|Apostolic Visitation]] on June 14 in San Giovanni Rotondo with the interrogation of witnesses, two [[diocesan priests]] and seven [[friars]]. After eight days of investigation, he finally completed a benevolent report, which he sent to the Holy Office on October 4, 1921, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. The extensive and detailed report essentially stated the following: Father Pio, of whom Rossi had a favorable impression, was a good religious and the San Giovanni Rotondo convent was a good community. Whatever is extraordinary about what Father Pio does that can not be explained, but certainly not by the intervention of the devil, or by deception or dizziness.

Overall impression: pitiful.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 273.</ref> Maccari demanded Father Pio's omission to practice kisses after the confession for the lay sisters. In his report, Maccari noted that Pio had inadequate religious education. He works a lot for a man of his age. He is not an ascetic and has many connections to the outside world. In general, there is too much mixing of the \"sacred\" and the \"all too human\".<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 274.</ref> Maccari noted in his report by name, which woman stated at what time to have been the lover of Pio - without clearly assessing whether all these statements were true.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 274.</ref> Maccari focused on assessing the fanaticism of Pio's social environment, describing it as \"religious conceptions that oscillate between superstition and magic.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age, p. 275.</ref> Maccari called Pio's supporters \"a vast and dangerous organization.\"<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011): Padre Pio: Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age , p. 276.</ref> Pio never had his own supporters advised to moderation.

The brothers of Santa Maria delle Grazie should gradually be relocated, a new abbot should come from outside the region. No one should be allowed to confess to Pio more than once a month.

The Vatican was initially skeptical.\n\n===Stigmata===\nBased on Pio's correspondence, even early in his priesthood he experienced less obvious indications of the visible [[stigmata]]: bodily marks, pain, and bleeding in locations supposedly corresponding to the [[crucifixion]] wounds of [[Jesus Christ]].<ref name=\"stigmata\">{{cite book|last = McGregor, O.C.S.O| first = Augustine| author2 = Fr.

In the middle of the palms of my hands a red mark appeared, about the size of a penny, accompanied by acute pain in the middle of the red marks. The pain was more pronounced in the middle of the left hand, so much so that I can still feel it. Also under my feet I can feel some pain.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/></blockquote>\n\nAlready in a letter dated March 21, 1912, to his spiritual companion and confessor, Father Agostino, Father Pio wrote of his devotion to the mystical body of Christ and the intuition that he, Pio, one day himself would bear the stigmata of Christ. Luzzatto points out that in this letter Father Pio uses unrecognized passages from a book by the stigmatized mystic [[Gemma Galgani]]. Later Pio denied knowing or owning the cited book.<ref>Sergio Luzzatto (2011):  Padre Pio: ''Miracles and Politics in a Secular Age'', p. 19.</ref>\n\nHis close friend Padre Agostino wrote in 1915, asking specific questions, such as when he first experienced visions, whether he had been granted the stigmata, and whether he felt the pains of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]], namely the crowning of thorns and the scourging. Pio replied that he had been favoured with visions since his novitiate period (1903 to 1904). Although he had been granted the stigmata, he had been so terrified by the phenomenon he begged the Lord to withdraw them. He wrote that he did not wish the pain to be removed, only the visible wounds, since he considered them to be an indescribable and almost unbearable humiliation.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, while hearing confessions, Pio claimed to have had a reappearance of the physical occurrence of the stigmata.  The phenomenon was reported to have continued for fifty years, until the end of his life. The blood flowing from the stigmata purportedly smelled of perfume or flowers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} He reported to Agostino that the pain remained and was more acute on specific days and under certain circumstances. He also said that he was suffering the pain of the crown of thorns and the scourging. He did not define the frequency of these occurrences but said that he had been suffering from them at least once weekly for some years.<ref name=\"stigmata\"/> Though Pio said he would have preferred to suffer in secret, by early 1919, news had begun to spread. Pio often wore red mittens or black coverings on his hands and feet as he was embarrassed by the marks.<ref name=\"time2\"/> However, no visible scarring was present at the time of Pio's death.<ref>{{cite web|date=2006-05-12|url=http://www.padrepio.com/his-life| title =Padre Pio's Cell| website =Padre Pio Foundation| accessdate = 2006-05-12}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Padre-Pio-young.jpg|thumb|left|Padre Pio showing the [[stigmata]] (detail from a photo from August 19, 1919) <ref>Complete illustration of the photograph by [[Urte Krass]]: ''Kontrollierter Gesichtsverlust.

[...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation<ref name=\"cantius\">{{Cite web| title = First class relic of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina at St. John Cantius Church| url = http://www.cantius.org/go/organizations/relic_of_st_padre_pio_of_pietrelcina| accessdate = 2008-01-19| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.<ref>Fortin, Fr.

He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.<ref name=\"cantius\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn 20 September 1918, accounts state that the pains of the transverberation had ceased and Pio was in \"profound peace.\"<ref name = \"gerhold\"/> On that day, as he was engaged in prayer in the choir loft in the Church of Our Lady of Grace, he received another celestial vision which led to [[religious ecstasy]].

On 21 September 1968, the day after the 50th anniversary of his receiving the stigmata, Padre Pio felt great fatigue.<ref name=\"PioProfile\"/>  The next day, on September 22, 1968, he was supposed to offer a [[Solemn Mass]], but feeling weak, he asked his superior if he might say a [[Low Mass]] instead, as he had done daily for years. Due to the large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, Padre Pio's superior decided the Solemn Mass must proceed. Padre Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and fragile. His voice was weak and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].\n\nEarly in the morning of 23 September 1968, Pio made his last [[Sacrament of Reconciliation|confession]] and renewed his Franciscan vows.<ref name=\"ewtn2\"/> As was customary, he had his [[rosary]] in his hands, though he did not have the strength to say the [[Hail Mary]]s aloud. Till the end, he repeated the words \"Ges\u00f9, Maria\" (Jesus, Mary). At around 2:30&nbsp;a.m., he said, \"I see two mothers\" (taken to mean his mother and Mary).<ref name=\"PioProfile\"/>  At 2:30&nbsp;a.m. he died in his cell in San Giovanni Rotondo.

The investigation continued for seven years. In 1990 Pio was declared a [[Servant of God]], the first step in the process of canonization. The investigation, however, did not lead to any public factual clearance by the Church on his previous 'excommunication' or on the allegations that his stigmata were not of a supernatural kind. Moreover, Pio's stigmata were remarkably left out of the obligatory investigations for the canonization process, in order to avoid obstacles prohibiting a successful closure.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] debated how Padre Pio had lived his life, and in 1997 Pope John Paul II declared him [[venerable]]. A discussion of the effects of his life on others followed. Cases were studied such as a reported cure of an Italian woman, Consiglia de Martino, associated with Padre Pio's [[intercession]]. In 1999, on the advice of the Congregation, John Paul II declared Padre Pio blessed. A media offensive by the Capuchins was able to realise a broad acceptation of the contested saint in society.<ref>Peter Jan Margry, 'Il \"marketing\" di Padre Pio.
