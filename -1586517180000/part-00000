A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Smith was a member of the [[Florida Senate]] from [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] from 2001 until 2006. Smith ran for the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of Florida]] in the [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2006|2006 election]] but lost to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Congressman Jim Davis]]. In 2010, Smith was the Democratic nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Florida]] as the running mate of [[Alex Sink]] in her [[Florida gubernatorial election, 2010|campaign for Governor of Florida]]. From November 2010 through January 2013 Smith served as chairman of the [[Florida Democratic Party]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/01/08/2007216/smith-tapped-as-chairman-for-florida.html Miami Herald: Rod Smith tapped as chairman for Florida Democrats]</ref> In 2016, Smith again ran for a seat in the Florida Senate but was ultimately defeated by [[Keith Perry (politician)|Keith Perry]], a Republican and former state representative. \n\n==Early life and education==\nSmith was born on November 15, 1949, in [[Southwest City, Missouri|Southwest City]], [[Missouri]], just across the state line from his family's home in [[Oklahoma]]. Before he reached the age of two, Smith's family moved to Florida, where they grew [[eggplant]] and [[Bell pepper|green peppers]]. Smith attended public schools. He attended the [[University of Tulsa]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1971. While at the University of Tulsa, he was a member of the Sigma Nu Fraternity. He then attended the [[University of Florida]] [[Levin College of Law|College of Law]] graduating with a [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] in 1975.\n\n==Legal and political career==\nFollowing his admission to [[The Florida Bar]], Smith worked for the Florida Public Employees Relations Commission for two years, representing the state in cases relating to [[labor law]]. After two years in [[Tallahassee]], Smith returned to [[Alachua County, Florida|Alachua County]] and spent the next 15 years in private practice. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' later wrote that, since that time, Smith has \"crisscrossed Florida, representing an array of [[Trade union|labor unions]]&ndash;[[police officer]]s and [[firefighter]]s, [[Electrician|electrical workers]], [[carpenter]]s, [[Painter and decorator|painters]] and pipe fitters. He argued on behalf of large vegetable farmers and dairies and nurserymen. He won settlements against the likes of [[DuPont]] and, occasionally, represented criminal defendants...He established himself as a skillful litigator.\"{{ref|Privatepractice}}\n\nIn 1992, Smith was recruited by a group of county sheriffs to seek the office of State Attorney for the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida. Smith defeated incumbent Len Register that same year and, during his first term, successfully prosecuted [[serial killer]] [[Danny Rolling]], the \"Gainesville Ripper.\"<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  Re-elected in 1996, Smith created the circuit's first special prosecutions unit, which dealt with crimes against women and children, and created an [[environmental crime]] unit. He was succeeded by Bill Cervone to be State Attorney.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nIn 2000, Smith was elected to the [[Florida Senate]] as a Democrat. He represented the 14th Senate district, which included nine counties in northern Florida, centered around Gainesville and Ocala. While in the Senate, Smith served as chair of the Agriculture Committee, as vice chair of the Criminal Justice and Justice Appropriations Committees, and as a member of the Communications and Public Utilities, Environmental Preservation, Rules and Calendar, and Ways and Means Committees, as well as the Legislative Budget Commission.\n\nDuring his term in the Florida Senate, Smith was noted for his work on issues related to criminal justice. He strengthened the state's child abuse laws, fought discrimination in housing and worked to protect the privacy of crime victims. He also improved the state's crime prevention and homeland security initiatives. Smith \"sponsored, and passed, legislation to prevent mentally retarded persons from being executed.\"{{ref|Sentinel}} In 2006, he led the coalition that defeated Governor Jeb Bush's plan to weaken Florida's voter-approved [[Kendrick Meek#Class Size Amendment|class size amendment]] and create a [[school voucher|school voucher program]].\n\nSmith is a partner with the [[law firm]] of [http://www.avera.com Avera & Smith] and also serves as an [[Professor|adjunct professor]] at the University of Florida's Levin College of Law where he teaches [[constitutional law]] and [[trial practice]] and supervises the prosecution clinic. He has also taught at [[Santa Fe Community College]].\n\nThe ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' summed up Smith's biography in this way, \"He comes from a line of struggling farmers and saw [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] as a way out. While in law school at the University of Florida, he juggled going to class with helping to run the family's cattle operation. He won respect from unions as a labor lawyer, got elected state attorney and went on to leadership posts in the Florida Senate.\" {{ref|Beth}}\n\n==2006 election==\nIn January 2005, Smith announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2006 election. Smith ran against Tampa [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. A statewide poll by the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]], released on August 28, 2006, showed Smith eight points down against Davis. A poll from earlier in the year showed Davis ahead 25 to 9 percent.{{ref|Commercepoll}} Conversely, a July 27 Quinnipiac University poll showed Smith trailing Davis by 28%. However, this poll also revealed that 33% of Democrats were still undecided.\n\nLate in May 2006, U.S. Representatives [[Kendrick Meek]] and [[Allen Boyd]] broke with their fellow Florida Democratic House members to endorse Smith.{{ref|MeekBoyd}} Smith has also been endorsed by former Florida [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] and former state Sen. Tom Rossin, the 2002 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor; state Sen. Dave Aronberg of [[Greenacres, Florida|Greenacres]]; the Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer; and county Commissioner Addie Greene, among others.{{ref|Endorsements}}. The co-chair of his campaign was former governor [[Wayne Mixson]].\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Rod Smith with Reps Meek and Boyd.jpg|thumb|right|360px|U.S. Congressmen Allen Boyd and Kendrick Meek endorsing Rod Smith]] -->\nIn August 2006, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' endorsed Smith, stating that his opponent, \"Davis has a solid record as an ethical, thoughtful state legislator and congressman who understands the challenges facing Florida. Smith combines the same grasp of those challenges with a more dynamic leadership style and a clearer, fresher record of building mainstream coalitions that can successfully carry the day on tough issues. That is what it will take for a Democrat to win in November and successfully govern in Tallahassee.\" {{ref|St.Pete}}\n\nAt the same time, the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, saying, \"Rep. Davis would return to Tallahassee with good intentions. Sen. Smith would take office knowing how to get good things done.\" {{ref|Post}} In addition, the ''Lakeland Ledger'' endorsed Smith stating, \"We believe Smith can appeal to a broader segment of the electorate -- that he can muster greater support in the Republican-leaning northern part of the state while still generating strong support in the urban areas of Central and South Florida.\" {{ref|Ledger}}\n\nLater in the month, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' endorsed the Senator, noting that between Smith and Davis, \"Smith's record is the more impressive of the two, and his familiarity with the Legislature and state government gives him the edge over Davis. Smith could literally win the November election and hit the ground running.\" {{ref|Sentinel}}\n\n''[[The Gainesville Sun]]'' also endorsed Smith saying, \"Rod Smith is a superb orator, a skilled negotiator and ...a razor-sharp intellectual and a constitutional scholar who immerses himself in minutia of public policy making .... We think Rod Smith is the Democrat in this race who has the political capital to undo some of the damage that's been done to public education these past eight years, find the right balance between environmental protection and economic growth, protect Florida's fragile water resources and get a handle on the state's runaway health care costs without restricting access to quality care.\" {{ref|Gainesville}}\n\nOn August 27, the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, noting his record of bipartisanship and stating, \"In 2006, the Democratic Party has its best chance since the days of the late [[Lawton Chiles]] to recapture the governor's office.\" {{ref|Herald}}\n\nSmith was criticized by media outlets for his allegedly-passive attitude toward Florida's sugar lobby and their attacks on his primary opponent. In August 2006, the Miami Herald wrote: \"Sen. Smith has been the beneficiary of a million-dollar anti-Davis ad campaign by U.S. Sugar Inc. Senator Smith vows to remain independent. But it could prove difficult to keep a respectable distance from special interests if he becomes beholden to them for outsized political contributions.\" The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which had endorsed Smith, added further criticism. \"What we find most disturbing is the response by state Sen. Rod Smith. Smith, who railed against smear tactics by third-party groups during his state senate campaigns, has consistently failed to rebuke Florida's Working Families (a notable front for Big Sugar interests) for the ads and, when asked, only repeats some of the allegations against Davis. Smith should denounce them.\"\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Rod Smith lost his bid for the Democratic nomination to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. Davis subsequently lost the election to then Republican [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==2010 Election==\n\nOn August 17, 2010, Rod Smith was announced as the running mate for [[Alex Sink]] on the Democratic ticket for the [[2010 Florida gubernatorial election|race to succeed Crist]], who chose to run for [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|election to the U.S. Senate]] rather than for re-election as governor.{{ref|Sink}} On November 2, the Sink/Smith ticket lost to the Republican Scott/Carroll ticket by a 1% margin.\n\n== 2016 Election ==\nWhen the Florida Supreme Court ordered the drawing of new state senate districts in December 2015, District 8, a newly formed district comprising Alachua County, Putnam County, and the northern half of Marion County opened up. On March 1, 2016, Smith announced<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/203200-rod-smith-makes-state-senate-run-official-with-courthouse-announcement-in-gainesville|title=Rod Smith makes state Senate run official with courthouse announcement in Gainesville - Florida Politics|date=2016-03-01|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en-US}}</ref> his campaign for the seat against the then third-term Republican state representative Keith Perry. On November 8th, Smith lost to Perry with 47.4% of the vote, a 5.2% margin.\n\n==Florida Democratic Party==\n\nIn November 2010 Smith was elected chairman of the [[Florida Democratic Party]] (FDP), succeeding [[Karen Thurman]] who resigned on November 12, 2010, following the midterm elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/rod-smith-expected-to-succeed-karen-thurman-as-state-democratic-party-boss/1133920|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013144622/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/legislature/rod-smith-expected-to-succeed-karen-thurman-as-state-democratic-party-boss/1133920|url-status=dead|title=Resigned as chair of FDP|archivedate=October 13, 2012}}</ref>  Smith's term expired in January 2013 when he was succeeded by [[Allison Tant]].<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/01/26/3202707/allison-tant-wins-race-for-florida.html] The Miami Herald &mdash; Allison Tant wins Race for Florida Democratic chair\", Retrieved 2013-06-30</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*Florida Police Chiefs Association's Legislative Achievement Award (2002)&ndash;for efforts to improve public safety and fight crime\n*Voices of Children Foundation's MVP Leadership Award (2004)&ndash;for efforts on behalf of abused, abandoned and neglected children.\n*[[Florida AFL-CIO]] \"Legislator of the Year\"&ndash;efforts on behalf of organized labor\n\nSmith was also named the \"most effective Democrat in the Florida Senate\" by the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' in 2003.\n\n== Beliefs ==\nSenator Smith is generally regarded as a political moderate and has traditionally taken stances more conservative than the average Democrat. For example, he has received an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA).<sup>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=WFL51166&type=category&category=Gun%2BIssues&go.x=18&go.y=2]</sup> Still, during the first televised debate of the 2006 Democratic primary, Smith stated that he had \"no problem with a carefully defined assault weapons ban. We want to make sure we don't have weapons in the hands of people who aren't supposed to have them and we have tough laws to prevent that.\" {{ref|guns}} Smith has stated that he supports, and is a principal architect of, legislation requiring [[minors and abortion|parental notification for minors seeking an abortion]] but would \"leave an exception for the health and life of the mother.\" <sup>[http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/6297.article]</sup> Smith describes himself as [[pro-choice]] and his official website promised to, \"veto any legislation that would allow the government more influence over a woman's personal and private decisions regarding her own body.\"<sup>[http://rodsmith2006.com/pages/on_the_issues/#womens]</sup>\n\nOver the course of the 2006 gubernatorial primary, both Smith and his Democratic primary opponent took many positions not generally associated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The latter (Davis) voted for the Iraq War and \"also voted to ban flag-burning.\"  <sup>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/state/15308254.htm]</sup> Both men agreed on [[capital punishment]] and both agreed on having only, as Davis put it, \"some restrictions on assault weapons.\"<sup>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/sfl-felxdemrail24xaug24,0,6347003.story?coll=sfla-news-florida]</sup>\n\n==Personal life==\nSmith and his wife, DeeDee, live on their farm in Alachua County.

He has also taught at [[Santa Fe Community College]].\n\nThe ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' summed up Smith's biography in this way, \"He comes from a line of struggling farmers and saw [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] as a way out. While in law school at the University of Florida, he juggled going to class with helping to run the family's cattle operation. He won respect from unions as a labor lawyer, got elected state attorney and went on to leadership posts in the Florida Senate.\" {{ref|Beth}}\n\n==2006 election==\nIn January 2005, Smith announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor in the 2006 election. Smith ran against Tampa [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. A statewide poll by the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]], released on August 28, 2006, showed Smith eight points down against Davis. A poll from earlier in the year showed Davis ahead 25 to 9 percent.{{ref|Commercepoll}} Conversely, a July 27 Quinnipiac University poll showed Smith trailing Davis by 28%. However, this poll also revealed that 33% of Democrats were still undecided.\n\nLate in May 2006, U.S. Representatives [[Kendrick Meek]] and [[Allen Boyd]] broke with their fellow Florida Democratic House members to endorse Smith.{{ref|MeekBoyd}} Smith has also been endorsed by former Florida [[Attorney General]] [[Bob Butterworth]] and former state Sen. Tom Rossin, the 2002 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor; state Sen. Dave Aronberg of [[Greenacres, Florida|Greenacres]]; the Palm Beach County State Attorney, Barry Krischer; and county Commissioner Addie Greene, among others.{{ref|Endorsements}}. The co-chair of his campaign was former governor [[Wayne Mixson]].\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Rod Smith with Reps Meek and Boyd.jpg|thumb|right|360px|U.S. Congressmen Allen Boyd and Kendrick Meek endorsing Rod Smith]] -->\nIn August 2006, the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' endorsed Smith, stating that his opponent, \"Davis has a solid record as an ethical, thoughtful state legislator and congressman who understands the challenges facing Florida. Smith combines the same grasp of those challenges with a more dynamic leadership style and a clearer, fresher record of building mainstream coalitions that can successfully carry the day on tough issues. That is what it will take for a Democrat to win in November and successfully govern in Tallahassee.\" {{ref|St.Pete}}\n\nAt the same time, the ''[[Palm Beach Post]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, saying, \"Rep. Davis would return to Tallahassee with good intentions. Sen. Smith would take office knowing how to get good things done.\" {{ref|Post}} In addition, the ''Lakeland Ledger'' endorsed Smith stating, \"We believe Smith can appeal to a broader segment of the electorate -- that he can muster greater support in the Republican-leaning northern part of the state while still generating strong support in the urban areas of Central and South Florida.\" {{ref|Ledger}}\n\nLater in the month, the ''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]'' endorsed the Senator, noting that between Smith and Davis, \"Smith's record is the more impressive of the two, and his familiarity with the Legislature and state government gives him the edge over Davis. Smith could literally win the November election and hit the ground running.\" {{ref|Sentinel}}\n\n''[[The Gainesville Sun]]'' also endorsed Smith saying, \"Rod Smith is a superb orator, a skilled negotiator and ...a razor-sharp intellectual and a constitutional scholar who immerses himself in minutia of public policy making .... We think Rod Smith is the Democrat in this race who has the political capital to undo some of the damage that's been done to public education these past eight years, find the right balance between environmental protection and economic growth, protect Florida's fragile water resources and get a handle on the state's runaway health care costs without restricting access to quality care.\" {{ref|Gainesville}}\n\nOn August 27, the ''[[The Miami Herald|Miami Herald]]'' endorsed Senator Smith, noting his record of bipartisanship and stating, \"In 2006, the Democratic Party has its best chance since the days of the late [[Lawton Chiles]] to recapture the governor's office.\" {{ref|Herald}}\n\nSmith was criticized by media outlets for his allegedly-passive attitude toward Florida's sugar lobby and their attacks on his primary opponent. In August 2006, the Miami Herald wrote: \"Sen. Smith has been the beneficiary of a million-dollar anti-Davis ad campaign by U.S. Sugar Inc. Senator Smith vows to remain independent. But it could prove difficult to keep a respectable distance from special interests if he becomes beholden to them for outsized political contributions.\" The Daytona Beach News-Journal, which had endorsed Smith, added further criticism. \"What we find most disturbing is the response by state Sen. Rod Smith. Smith, who railed against smear tactics by third-party groups during his state senate campaigns, has consistently failed to rebuke Florida's Working Families (a notable front for Big Sugar interests) for the ads and, when asked, only repeats some of the allegations against Davis. Smith should denounce them.\"\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Rod Smith lost his bid for the Democratic nomination to [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]]. Davis subsequently lost the election to then Republican [[Charlie Crist]].\n\n==2010 Election==\n\nOn August 17, 2010, Rod Smith was announced as the running mate for [[Alex Sink]] on the Democratic ticket for the [[2010 Florida gubernatorial election|race to succeed Crist]], who chose to run for [[United States Senate election in Florida, 2010|election to the U.S. Senate]] rather than for re-election as governor.{{ref|Sink}} On November 2, the Sink/Smith ticket lost to the Republican Scott/Carroll ticket by a 1% margin.\n\n== 2016 Election ==\nWhen the Florida Supreme Court ordered the drawing of new state senate districts in December 2015, District 8, a newly formed district comprising Alachua County, Putnam County, and the northern half of Marion County opened up. On March 1, 2016, Smith announced<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://floridapolitics.com/archives/203200-rod-smith-makes-state-senate-run-official-with-courthouse-announcement-in-gainesville|title=Rod Smith makes state Senate run official with courthouse announcement in Gainesville - Florida Politics|date=2016-03-01|work=Florida Politics|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en-US}}</ref> his campaign for the seat against the then third-term Republican state representative Keith Perry.

For example, he has received an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA).<sup>[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=WFL51166&type=category&category=Gun%2BIssues&go.x=18&go.y=2]</sup> Still, during the first televised debate of the 2006 Democratic primary, Smith stated that he had \"no problem with a carefully defined assault weapons ban. We want to make sure we don't have weapons in the hands of people who aren't supposed to have them and we have tough laws to prevent that.\" {{ref|guns}} Smith has stated that he supports, and is a principal architect of, legislation requiring [[minors and abortion|parental notification for minors seeking an abortion]] but would \"leave an exception for the health and life of the mother.\" <sup>[http://www.floridabaptistwitness.com/6297.article]</sup> Smith describes himself as [[pro-choice]] and his official website promised to, \"veto any legislation that would allow the government more influence over a woman's personal and private decisions regarding her own body.\"<sup>[http://rodsmith2006.com/pages/on_the_issues/#womens]</sup>\n\nOver the course of the 2006 gubernatorial primary, both Smith and his Democratic primary opponent took many positions not generally associated with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The latter (Davis) voted for the Iraq War and \"also voted to ban flag-burning.\"  <sup>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/state/15308254.htm]</sup> Both men agreed on [[capital punishment]] and both agreed on having only, as Davis put it, \"some restrictions on assault weapons.\"<sup>[http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/florida/sfl-felxdemrail24xaug24,0,6347003.story?coll=sfla-news-florida]</sup>\n\n==Personal life==\nSmith and his wife, DeeDee, live on their farm in Alachua County.

The design, No. 14 \"A Cottage in the Rhine style\" featured in ''Cottage Residences'' (1852), also inspired the [[William G. LeDuc House|William G.

On the Boyd farm above the creek, a later occupant, the Walsh family, erected a [[Walsh-Havemeyer House|Greek Revival house]].   \n\nDue to its privacy yet proximity to [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], the area aroused great interest. Christie began to parcel off lots, two of which Joel T. Headley purchased for approximately $2,600 in 1850. <ref name=\":0\">Hannah Borgeson, \"'A Cottage in the Rhine Style'\u201d: A Downing and Vaux Residential Design in New Windsor, New York,\" Master's Thesis (City College of the City University of New York, 2003). </ref> The picturesque setting, which included the river and [[Hudson Highlands|Highlands]], matched his vision for a residence. This concluded his property search between New York City and [[Upstate New York|upstate]], which he admired for its natural beauty, himself a native of [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]].   \n\n=== Construction ===\nA probable reader of Downing's work, most notably ''The Architecture of Country Houses'' (1850), Headley decided to approach the [[architectural firm]], Downing & Vaux, with designs in mind. He wished to preserve the semi-rural atmosphere and heritage of the land, while still being able to boast an impressive residence. <ref name=\":0\" /> Aside from accommodations to host guests, the Headleys also intended to raise a family in the house. With additional costs for construction, the house and property totaled to about $8,000, though Headley could have afforded more with his book royalties. <ref name=\":0\" />   \n\nThe Headleys decided to sell the house in 1870, possibly because maintaining the entire property proved toilsome. They shortly after moved into a [[Terraced house|row house]], 172 South Street in Newburgh, with more accessible conveniences. <ref name=\":0\" /> In 1877, the family moved to 277 Grand Street, where Headley died of [[paralysis]] <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFFTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=George+Harney+Newburgh+ny&source=bl&ots=TgHtW1UtD9&sig=ACfU3U3rb4K6VV_qCfsseePK3VwcKXDrFg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdwLraktDoAhULlXIEHTthBYkQ6AEwBHoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=George%20Harney%20Newburgh%20ny&f=false|title=The World Almanac and Encyclopedia|date=1898|publisher=Press Publishing Company (The New York World)|language=en}}</ref> at age 84 in 1897. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS18970122.2.10|title=The Cornell Daily Sun 22 January 1897 \u2014 The Cornell Daily Sun|website=cdsun.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> \n\n==== Musgrave Country Seat ====\nHarriet Pardee Musgrave took ownership of the house in 1870, likely purchased by her father in her name. Harriet and her husband, Stephen B. Musgrave, supervised subsequent renovations and had a child that same year. <ref name=\":0\" /> [[George Edward Harney|George E. Harney]], architect of the renovations, did business in Newburgh, replicating the original tastes of Downing & Vaux in his work. In 1873, he contributed revisions to the new edition of Downing's ''Cottage Residences''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Downing|first=Andrew Jackson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AseAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14&dq=cottage+residences+aj+downing+in+the+rhine+style&source=bl&ots=Xvq7TaAtFV&sig=ACfU3U1siXymyaZxtajPQB1unJ6kHnIgKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp76HBus_oAhXjj3IEHXS8ATUQ6AEwDnoECAsQLw#v=onepage&q=headley&f=false|title=Victorian Cottage Residences|date=1981-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-24078-7|language=en}}</ref> \n\nOne of Harney's most substantial additions, the [[porte-coch\u00e8re]], created a small solarium above the front entrance, jutting from the second floor. He continued made most of the interior changes on the second floor, removing a dressing room and attic stairs to extend the central hallway. <ref name=\":0\" /> It joined the main house with the principal \"kitchen wing\", allowing for more bed chambers, for servants in particular, and general space on the second floor. [[File:Headley House Grounds.png|left|thumb|355x355px|View of the Hudson, now obstructed by overgrowth and development along [[U.S. Route 9W|Route 9W]]]]\n\n=== 20th century and rediscovery ===\nOwnership shifted to John A. Corcoran in 1904 <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H4U3AQAAMAAJ&rdid=book-H4U3AQAAMAAJ&rdot=1|title=Country Life in America|date=1904|publisher=Doubleday, Page & Company|language=en}}</ref>, who commissioned New York architecture firm Rogers & Haniman to construct the current back wing. The firm's work included demolishing the wall between the original dining room and library to create a larger space. Following the Corcorans, a carpet distributor named O'Connor came to own the house, furnishing it according to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] tastes.  \n\nFor an unknown period, the house sat semi-abandoned, similar to the condition of other nearby mansions during this time. In 1942, Andrew Lucas purchased the house for his family, priced inexpensively. They remained there until 1985, but initially found living conditions difficult due to its small number of bedrooms and bathrooms.<ref name=\":0\" /> Artist [[Kenny Scharf]] owned the house during the late 1980s and early 1990s, using it as a [[studio]] and weekend residence. It was not until the late 1990s that Scott Henry, a subsequent owner, discovered the house had been a Downing and Vaux design. <ref name=\":0\" /> The latter 20th century brought a period of historic home renovations to Newburgh, sparking a renewed interest in the abundance of local work of Downing and Vaux.    \n\n<br />\n== Design and description ==\nWhen first tasked with designing the house, Downing and Vaux used a similar approach echoed by [[Frederick Clarke Withers]] in his 1858 design for the Calvary Presbyterian Church in Newburgh. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvarypresbychurch.org/the-building/|title=The Building \u2013 Calvary Presbyterian Church|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> The building would harmonize with its natural landscape, incorporating steep roof-lines and colors akin to the mountain scenery. <ref name=\":0\" /> Such a decision proved convenient, as Downing favored Rhenish-style architecture;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Rhenish+architecture|title=Definition of RHENISH ARCHITECTURE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> the Hudson would supplement the [[Rhine]]. \n[[File:Design XIV, Residence of Mr. Headley.png|thumb|290x290px|Frontispiece for the first edition of ''Cottage Residences,'' Downing's approved sketch of the house |alt=]]\n=== Exterior ===\nThe house is placed at an angle, facing the eastern sunrise, with its front entrance hidden from Quassaick Avenue. Visitors would be taken down the driveway via a technique known as \"the approach\", conveying the impression that the house was towards them. In this style of laying pathways, the house also appears to grow in magnitude and grandeur.  \n\nOf the house's initial appearance, Downing and Vaux wanted a spirited and irregular composition with simple details to appease Headley. The heavily pierced [[bargeboard]] and tower [[Cresting (architecture)|cresting]] (now removed) are indicative of the architect's delicacy, as the rest of the exterior initially appeared rather plain. Other ornamental features included [[Finial|finial-capped]] bargeboards on the [[Dormer|dormer windows]] and edges of [[Roofline|rooflines]]. Decorative brick once lined the edges of front windows, visible in the frontispiece sketch for the house. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe foundation consists of Hudson [[bluestone]], traditionally quarried in [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], but the remainder of the house is done in brick, overtime painted with several schemes. The architects despised plain white, and opted for a [[Deer|fawn]] color appropriate for the rural setting, translated by mixing [[ochre]] and sand shades, which mistakenly gave the impression of [[stucco]]. \n\nA chief Rhenish feature, the house's four-story [[Mansard roof|mansard]] tower, contains the slightly recessed front entrance. Downing included an explanation for the tower's relevance to the design in ''Cottage Residences.''   <blockquote>\"It is in this mental delight awakened by the contrast of symbols of repose and action, of beauty and power, in the lake that slumbers peacefully, and the hills that lift themselves boldly or grandly above it, that we find the explanation of part of the peculiar charm which belongs to those picturesque towers and 45 campaniles of the edifices and villas of the Rhine and Italian lakes. The same good effect will follow from the introduction of buildings composed upon similar principles, and placed on our picturesque river banks.\" <ref name=\":0\" />  </blockquote>Headley recollected a particular fondness for the Rhine, as he recalled his travels there, but remarked that the setting was \"inferior to the Hudson.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> During the writing of 1847's ''The Alps and the Rhine,'' Headley makes note of the [[Rhine Gorge]] and its \"ruined castles\u2014gaping towers\u2014dilapidated fortresses.\" <ref>{{Cite book|last=Headley|first=Joel Tyler|url=http://archive.org/details/alpsrhineserieso00head|title=The Alps and the Rhine : a series of sketches|date=1847|publisher=New York : Wiley and Putnam|others=University of Connecticut Libraries|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=117}}</ref> Such a description, which he believes is the region's most beautiful scenery, proved to be rather prophetic. The stand-in for the Rhine Gorge is the [[Hudson Highlands|gate of the Highlands]], with the presently ruinous [[Pollepel Island|Bannerman's Island Arsenal]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], and other river-bound country estates serving as the [[Newburgh Bay|bay's]] \"ancient\" structures. This attempt to replicate the atmosphere of a European setting can also be found in [[Alexander Jackson Davis]]'s [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], which drew later comparisons to the [[Temple of Poseidon, Sounion|Temple of Poseidon]]'s placement above the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. \n\n[[File:Design XIV, Principal Floor.png|left|thumb|Principal floor plan |235x235px]]\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nIt is through the tower's [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish-style]] entranceway that one enters the house, with a repeated larger one into the main hallway, suggesting a Vaux implementation as seen at [[Olana State Historic Site|Olana]].    \n\nThe first floor, larger than the others, stands at 12' and 1' thick. The second, or chamber floor, is 9 1/2' with 8\" thickness. <ref name=\":1\" />    \n\n[[File:Headley House Drawing Room.png|thumb|Original drawing room, decorated for Christmas and serving as the current dining room ]]\n\n==== Drawing Room ====\nThe original drawing room, located to the visitor's direct right, now serves as the house's dining room, due to its proximity to the current kitchen. It is characterized by tall recessed panel [[Panelling|wainscoting]] of three rows, each of a different height, nearly reaching the top of the three windows. The deep [[bay window]] at the furthest end also carries some paneling near the [[baseboard]], and aligns with the [[marble]] fireplace across the room. Above, the [[crown molding]] is emphasized through painted ceiling ornamentation, which includes the likeness of a [[seashell]]. \n\n==== '''Library''' '''and Dining Room''' ====\nAs the dividing wall of recessed bookcases between the library and dining room has been demolished, one large, substantial room serves as the house's current living room. Tiger oak or black walnut <ref name=\":0\" /> paneling dominates the space, as does the pressed plaster ceiling. The [[Art Nouveau]] fireplace, added later, also adopts the Moorish figure, with a mantle of four [[Pilaster|pilasters]].  \n\n=== Grounds ===\nHarney erected brick stables <ref name=\":0\" /> south of the house, dissimilar to the design Downing proposed decades earlier, which never came to fruition. In the 1883, a groundskeeper's cottage and gatehouse was added to the north end of the property <ref name=\":0\" />, near to a set of double-pillared gates placed as an entrance and exit from the drive onto Quassaick Avenue. \n\nDowning and Vaux do not explicitly mention a landscape design, and the property occupied a much smaller ground than Downing's own Highland Garden or his plans for [[Matthew Vassar]]'s [[Springside (Poughkeepsie, New York)|Springside]]. An estimation of the landscape design's scale and beauty comes from the Headley's sale of the house, priced unusually high, indicating the grounds played a part in the value. <ref name=\":0\" /> The deed of sale indicates multiples species of trees on the property, including [[chestnut]], [[oak]], [[Cedar wood|cedar]] and [[cherry]]. Today, the property hosts many more varieties of trees and plants <ref name=\":0\" />, with some thought to date to the 19th century.

On the Boyd farm above the creek, a later occupant, the Walsh family, erected a [[Walsh-Havemeyer House|Greek Revival house]].   \n\nDue to its privacy yet proximity to [[Newburgh, New York|Newburgh]], the area aroused great interest. Christie began to parcel off lots, two of which Joel T. Headley purchased for approximately $2,600 in 1850. <ref name=\":0\">Hannah Borgeson, \"'A Cottage in the Rhine Style'\u201d: A Downing and Vaux Residential Design in New Windsor, New York,\" Master's Thesis (City College of the City University of New York, 2003). </ref> The picturesque setting, which included the river and [[Hudson Highlands|Highlands]], matched his vision for a residence. This concluded his property search between New York City and [[Upstate New York|upstate]], which he admired for its natural beauty, himself a native of [[Delaware County, New York|Delaware County]].   \n\n=== Construction ===\nA probable reader of Downing's work, most notably ''The Architecture of Country Houses'' (1850), Headley decided to approach the [[architectural firm]], Downing & Vaux, with designs in mind. He wished to preserve the semi-rural atmosphere and heritage of the land, while still being able to boast an impressive residence. <ref name=\":0\" /> Aside from accommodations to host guests, the Headleys also intended to raise a family in the house. With additional costs for construction, the house and property totaled to about $8,000, though Headley could have afforded more with his book royalties. <ref name=\":0\" />   \n\nThe Headleys decided to sell the house in 1870, possibly because maintaining the entire property proved toilsome. They shortly after moved into a [[Terraced house|row house]], 172 South Street in Newburgh, with more accessible conveniences. <ref name=\":0\" /> In 1877, the family moved to 277 Grand Street, where Headley died of [[paralysis]] <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fFFTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=George+Harney+Newburgh+ny&source=bl&ots=TgHtW1UtD9&sig=ACfU3U3rb4K6VV_qCfsseePK3VwcKXDrFg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdwLraktDoAhULlXIEHTthBYkQ6AEwBHoECAoQMA#v=onepage&q=George%20Harney%20Newburgh%20ny&f=false|title=The World Almanac and Encyclopedia|date=1898|publisher=Press Publishing Company (The New York World)|language=en}}</ref> at age 84 in 1897. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&d=CDS18970122.2.10|title=The Cornell Daily Sun 22 January 1897 \u2014 The Cornell Daily Sun|website=cdsun.library.cornell.edu|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> \n\n==== Musgrave Country Seat ====\nHarriet Pardee Musgrave took ownership of the house in 1870, likely purchased by her father in her name.

Harney]], architect of the renovations, did business in Newburgh, replicating the original tastes of Downing & Vaux in his work. In 1873, he contributed revisions to the new edition of Downing's ''Cottage Residences''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Downing|first=Andrew Jackson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_AseAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14&dq=cottage+residences+aj+downing+in+the+rhine+style&source=bl&ots=Xvq7TaAtFV&sig=ACfU3U1siXymyaZxtajPQB1unJ6kHnIgKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjp76HBus_oAhXjj3IEHXS8ATUQ6AEwDnoECAsQLw#v=onepage&q=headley&f=false|title=Victorian Cottage Residences|date=1981-01-01|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-24078-7|language=en}}</ref> \n\nOne of Harney's most substantial additions, the [[porte-coch\u00e8re]], created a small solarium above the front entrance, jutting from the second floor. He continued made most of the interior changes on the second floor, removing a dressing room and attic stairs to extend the central hallway. <ref name=\":0\" /> It joined the main house with the principal \"kitchen wing\", allowing for more bed chambers, for servants in particular, and general space on the second floor. [[File:Headley House Grounds.png|left|thumb|355x355px|View of the Hudson, now obstructed by overgrowth and development along [[U.S. Route 9W|Route 9W]]]]\n\n=== 20th century and rediscovery ===\nOwnership shifted to John A.

The firm's work included demolishing the wall between the original dining room and library to create a larger space. Following the Corcorans, a carpet distributor named O'Connor came to own the house, furnishing it according to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] tastes.  \n\nFor an unknown period, the house sat semi-abandoned, similar to the condition of other nearby mansions during this time. In 1942, Andrew Lucas purchased the house for his family, priced inexpensively. They remained there until 1985, but initially found living conditions difficult due to its small number of bedrooms and bathrooms.<ref name=\":0\" /> Artist [[Kenny Scharf]] owned the house during the late 1980s and early 1990s, using it as a [[studio]] and weekend residence. It was not until the late 1990s that Scott Henry, a subsequent owner, discovered the house had been a Downing and Vaux design. <ref name=\":0\" /> The latter 20th century brought a period of historic home renovations to Newburgh, sparking a renewed interest in the abundance of local work of Downing and Vaux.    \n\n<br />\n== Design and description ==\nWhen first tasked with designing the house, Downing and Vaux used a similar approach echoed by [[Frederick Clarke Withers]] in his 1858 design for the Calvary Presbyterian Church in Newburgh. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calvarypresbychurch.org/the-building/|title=The Building \u2013 Calvary Presbyterian Church|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> The building would harmonize with its natural landscape, incorporating steep roof-lines and colors akin to the mountain scenery. <ref name=\":0\" /> Such a decision proved convenient, as Downing favored Rhenish-style architecture;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Rhenish+architecture|title=Definition of RHENISH ARCHITECTURE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> the Hudson would supplement the [[Rhine]]. \n[[File:Design XIV, Residence of Mr. Headley.png|thumb|290x290px|Frontispiece for the first edition of ''Cottage Residences,'' Downing's approved sketch of the house |alt=]]\n=== Exterior ===\nThe house is placed at an angle, facing the eastern sunrise, with its front entrance hidden from Quassaick Avenue. Visitors would be taken down the driveway via a technique known as \"the approach\", conveying the impression that the house was towards them. In this style of laying pathways, the house also appears to grow in magnitude and grandeur.  \n\nOf the house's initial appearance, Downing and Vaux wanted a spirited and irregular composition with simple details to appease Headley. The heavily pierced [[bargeboard]] and tower [[Cresting (architecture)|cresting]] (now removed) are indicative of the architect's delicacy, as the rest of the exterior initially appeared rather plain. Other ornamental features included [[Finial|finial-capped]] bargeboards on the [[Dormer|dormer windows]] and edges of [[Roofline|rooflines]]. Decorative brick once lined the edges of front windows, visible in the frontispiece sketch for the house. <ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe foundation consists of Hudson [[bluestone]], traditionally quarried in [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], but the remainder of the house is done in brick, overtime painted with several schemes. The architects despised plain white, and opted for a [[Deer|fawn]] color appropriate for the rural setting, translated by mixing [[ochre]] and sand shades, which mistakenly gave the impression of [[stucco]]. \n\nA chief Rhenish feature, the house's four-story [[Mansard roof|mansard]] tower, contains the slightly recessed front entrance. Downing included an explanation for the tower's relevance to the design in ''Cottage Residences.''   <blockquote>\"It is in this mental delight awakened by the contrast of symbols of repose and action, of beauty and power, in the lake that slumbers peacefully, and the hills that lift themselves boldly or grandly above it, that we find the explanation of part of the peculiar charm which belongs to those picturesque towers and 45 campaniles of the edifices and villas of the Rhine and Italian lakes. The same good effect will follow from the introduction of buildings composed upon similar principles, and placed on our picturesque river banks.\" <ref name=\":0\" />  </blockquote>Headley recollected a particular fondness for the Rhine, as he recalled his travels there, but remarked that the setting was \"inferior to the Hudson.\" <ref name=\":0\" /> During the writing of 1847's ''The Alps and the Rhine,'' Headley makes note of the [[Rhine Gorge]] and its \"ruined castles\u2014gaping towers\u2014dilapidated fortresses.\" <ref>{{Cite book|last=Headley|first=Joel Tyler|url=http://archive.org/details/alpsrhineserieso00head|title=The Alps and the Rhine : a series of sketches|date=1847|publisher=New York : Wiley and Putnam|others=University of Connecticut Libraries|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=117}}</ref> Such a description, which he believes is the region's most beautiful scenery, proved to be rather prophetic. The stand-in for the Rhine Gorge is the [[Hudson Highlands|gate of the Highlands]], with the presently ruinous [[Pollepel Island|Bannerman's Island Arsenal]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], and other river-bound country estates serving as the [[Newburgh Bay|bay's]] \"ancient\" structures. This attempt to replicate the atmosphere of a European setting can also be found in [[Alexander Jackson Davis]]'s [[Dutch Reformed Church (Newburgh, New York)|Dutch Reformed Church]], which drew later comparisons to the [[Temple of Poseidon, Sounion|Temple of Poseidon]]'s placement above the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. \n\n[[File:Design XIV, Principal Floor.png|left|thumb|Principal floor plan |235x235px]]\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nIt is through the tower's [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish-style]] entranceway that one enters the house, with a repeated larger one into the main hallway, suggesting a Vaux implementation as seen at [[Olana State Historic Site|Olana]].    \n\nThe first floor, larger than the others, stands at 12' and 1' thick. The second, or chamber floor, is 9 1/2' with 8\" thickness. <ref name=\":1\" />    \n\n[[File:Headley House Drawing Room.png|thumb|Original drawing room, decorated for Christmas and serving as the current dining room ]]\n\n==== Drawing Room ====\nThe original drawing room, located to the visitor's direct right, now serves as the house's dining room, due to its proximity to the current kitchen. It is characterized by tall recessed panel [[Panelling|wainscoting]] of three rows, each of a different height, nearly reaching the top of the three windows. The deep [[bay window]] at the furthest end also carries some paneling near the [[baseboard]], and aligns with the [[marble]] fireplace across the room. Above, the [[crown molding]] is emphasized through painted ceiling ornamentation, which includes the likeness of a [[seashell]]. \n\n==== '''Library''' '''and Dining Room''' ====\nAs the dividing wall of recessed bookcases between the library and dining room has been demolished, one large, substantial room serves as the house's current living room. Tiger oak or black walnut <ref name=\":0\" /> paneling dominates the space, as does the pressed plaster ceiling. The [[Art Nouveau]] fireplace, added later, also adopts the Moorish figure, with a mantle of four [[Pilaster|pilasters]].  \n\n=== Grounds ===\nHarney erected brick stables <ref name=\":0\" /> south of the house, dissimilar to the design Downing proposed decades earlier, which never came to fruition. In the 1883, a groundskeeper's cottage and gatehouse was added to the north end of the property <ref name=\":0\" />, near to a set of double-pillared gates placed as an entrance and exit from the drive onto Quassaick Avenue. \n\nDowning and Vaux do not explicitly mention a landscape design, and the property occupied a much smaller ground than Downing's own Highland Garden or his plans for [[Matthew Vassar]]'s [[Springside (Poughkeepsie, New York)|Springside]]. An estimation of the landscape design's scale and beauty comes from the Headley's sale of the house, priced unusually high, indicating the grounds played a part in the value. <ref name=\":0\" /> The deed of sale indicates multiples species of trees on the property, including [[chestnut]], [[oak]], [[cedar]] and [[cherry]]. Today, the property hosts many more varieties of trees and plants <ref name=\":0\" />, with some thought to date to the 19th century. Although the majority of New Windsor during this period was [[Agricultural land|farmland]], including the area above Headley House, the family did not maintain a barn. The fruit trees comprised a kitchen garden, only to be used for their benefit. <ref name=\":0\" /> Acreage decreased from almost 14 acres to below 5 acres overtime, as Route 9W developed in the 20th century and the neighboring property became a private [[Aerodrome|airfield]]. \n\nScott Henry uncovered a forgotten 300-foot grape arbor and the remains of a 40' x 60' porcelain swimming pool dated to 1903-1911. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn artificial pond of Downing's creation has since vanished <ref name=\":0\" />, linking it with a still existing, albeit dry stream that forms the north boundary.

He started his professional football career for [[Calcio Como|Como]], before moving to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]]. However, his first successes came when he moved to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], winning a [[Serie A]] ''[[List of Italian football champions|scudetto]]'' in 1983. Then he moved to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], with whom he won four [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cup]]s, one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] and another ''scudetto'' in 1991. In 1995, he signed for [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], where he acted as an experienced defender and won his only [[UEFA Champions League]] in 1996 at the age of 37. He played the final in Rome against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] which Juve won on penalties. He then moved on to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[S.S.D. Piacenza Calcio 1919|Piacenza]], for whom he continued to play regularly despite being 41 years of age. He eventually retired in 2000. Vierchowod played 562 Serie A matches, and is the [[Football records in Italy#Appearances|seventh-highest appearance holder of all time in Serie A]], behind only to [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Gianluigi Buffon]], [[Francesco Totti]], [[Javier Zanetti]], [[Gianluca Pagliuca]], and [[Dino Zoff]].<ref name=storiedicalcio/><ref name=\"tuttojuve\"/>\n\n==International career==\nVierchowod was capped 45 times with the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] between 1981 and 1993, scoring two goals. He made his international debut on 6 January 1981, at the age of 21, during a 1\u20131 friendly draw against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in Montevideo, in the 1981 \"Mundialito\" tournament. He was one of the players in the Italian squad, although he did not play, that won the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], under manager [[Enzo Bearzot]].

It continues to be one of the UK's most popular books, and is often used as a set [[English literature]] text for schoolchildren. The work depicts the hardships, pleasures and simplicity of rural life in the time of Lee's youth; readers continue to find the author's portrayal of his early life vivid and evocative. Lee said that the creation of the book took him two years, and that it was written three times. With the proceeds Lee was able to buy a cottage in Slad, the village of his childhood.\n\n==Poetry==\nLee's first love was always poetry, though he was only moderately successful as a poet. Lee's poems had appeared in the ''[[Gloucester Citizen]]'' and the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', and in October 1934 his poem 'Life' won a prize from, and publication in, the ''[[Sunday Referee]]'', a national paper.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/><ref>Lee, Laurie (1969) ''As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning'', London: Andre Deutsch, p. 40.</ref> Another poem was published in [[Cyril Connolly]]'s ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine in 1940 and his first volume of poems, ''The Sun My Monument,'' was launched in 1944. This was followed by ''The Bloom of Candles'' (1947) and ''My Many-coated Man'' (1955). Several poems written in the early 1940s reflect the atmosphere of the war, but also capture the beauty of the English countryside. The poem \"Twelfth Night\" from ''My Many-coated Man'' was set for unaccompanied mixed choir by American composer [[Samuel Barber]] in 1968.\n\n==Other works==\nOther works include ''A Rose for Winter,'' about a trip he made to [[Andalusia]] 15 years after the civil war; ''Two Women'' (1983), a story of Lee's courtship of and marriage to Kathy, daughter of Helen Garman; ''The Firstborn'' (1964), about the birth and childhood of their daughter Jessy (christened Jesse); and ''I Can't Stay Long'' (1975), a collection of occasional writing.\n\nLee also wrote travel books, essays, radio plays and short stories.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nLee received several awards, including the Atlantic Award {{Clarify|date=March 2010}} (1944), the [[Society of Authors]] travelling award (1951), the [[William Foyle|William Foyle Poetry Prize]] (1956) and the [[WH Smith Literary Award|W. H. Smith and Son Award]] (1960).\n\nIn ''As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning,'' Lee writes of his stay in [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]], a Spanish fishing village which he calls \"Castillo\". In 1988 the citizens of Almu\u00f1\u00e9car erected a statue in Lee's honour.<ref name=\"straits\"/>\n\nIn 1993, ''A Moment of War'' was chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the editors of [[the New York Times Book Review]].<ref name=straits/>\n\nLee provided a great deal of valuable support to the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] in their attempts to establish themselves in the 1970s, and he continued to do so until his death; his essay ''Understanding the Ruralists'' opened the Brotherhood's major 1993 retrospective book.

It continues to be one of the UK's most popular books, and is often used as a set [[English literature]] text for schoolchildren. The work depicts the hardships, pleasures and simplicity of rural life in the time of Lee's youth; readers continue to find the author's portrayal of his early life vivid and evocative. Lee said that the creation of the book took him two years, and that it was written three times. With the proceeds Lee was able to buy a cottage in Slad, the village of his childhood.\n\n==Poetry==\nLee's first love was always poetry, though he was only moderately successful as a poet. Lee's poems had appeared in the ''[[Gloucester Citizen]]'' and the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', and in October 1934 his poem 'Life' won a prize from, and publication in, the ''[[Sunday Referee]]'', a national paper.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/><ref>Lee, Laurie (1969) ''As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning'', London: Andre Deutsch, p. 40.</ref> Another poem was published in [[Cyril Connolly]]'s ''[[Horizon (magazine)|Horizon]]'' magazine in 1940 and his first volume of poems, ''The Sun My Monument,'' was launched in 1944. This was followed by ''The Bloom of Candles'' (1947) and ''My Many-coated Man'' (1955). Several poems written in the early 1940s reflect the atmosphere of the war, but also capture the beauty of the English countryside. The poem \"Twelfth Night\" from ''My Many-coated Man'' was set for unaccompanied mixed choir by American composer [[Samuel Barber]] in 1968.\n\n==Other works==\nOther works include ''A Rose for Winter,'' about a trip he made to [[Andalusia]] 15 years after the civil war; ''Two Women'' (1983), a story of Lee's courtship of and marriage to Kathy, daughter of Helen Garman; ''The Firstborn'' (1964), about the birth and childhood of their daughter Jessy (christened Jesse); and ''I Can't Stay Long'' (1975), a collection of occasional writing.\n\nLee also wrote travel books, essays, radio plays and short stories.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nLee received several awards, including the Atlantic Award {{Clarify|date=March 2010}} (1944), the [[Society of Authors]] travelling award (1951), the [[William Foyle|William Foyle Poetry Prize]] (1956) and the [[WH Smith Literary Award|W. H. Smith and Son Award]] (1960).\n\nIn ''As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning,'' Lee writes of his stay in [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]], a Spanish fishing village which he calls \"Castillo\". In 1988 the citizens of Almu\u00f1\u00e9car erected a statue in Lee's honour.<ref name=\"straits\"/>\n\nIn 1993, ''A Moment of War'' was chosen as a Notable Book of the Year by the editors of [[the New York Times Book Review]].<ref name=straits/>\n\nLee provided a great deal of valuable support to the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] in their attempts to establish themselves in the 1970s, and he continued to do so until his death; his essay ''Understanding the Ruralists'' opened the Brotherhood's major 1993 retrospective book. Indeed, it was Lee who is said to have given them the name \"Ruralists.\"<ref>Dunnett, Roderic.
