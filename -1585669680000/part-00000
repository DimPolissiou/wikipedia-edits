It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty.

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability. On 20 November, opinion turned sharply against Louis following the discovery of a [[Armoire de fer|secret cache of 726 documents]] consisting of Louis's personal communications with bankers and ministers.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|loc= in \"Armoir de Fer\" by Grendron, F.|p=42}} At his trial, he claimed not to recognize documents clearly signed by himself.<ref>Hardman, John (2016) The life of Louis XVI, p. ?</ref>\n\nWith the question of the king's fate now occupying public discourse, Robespierre delivered on 3 December a speech that would define the rhetoric and course of Louis's trial.{{sfn|Thompson|1988|pp=292\u2013300}} All the deputies from the Mountain were asked to attend. Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes.

On 6 May 1794 Robespierre announced to the Convention that in the name of the French people, the Committee of Public Safety had decided to recognize the [[existence of God]] and the [[immortality]] of the human soul. Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].

Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony.

He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].

Firstly, I do not know what a dictatorship of opinion is, above all in a society of free men... unless this describes nothing more than the natural compulsion of principles. This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality... Why don't you prosecute the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune]], the Legislative Assembly, the Sections of Paris, the Assemblies of the [[Cantons of France|Cantons]] and all who imitated us?

A commission was therefore established to examine the evidence against him while the Convention's Legislation Committee considered legal aspects of any future trial. Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment.

It establishes the structure and function of the state and is based on the principles of [[federalism]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]]. Indiana's [[constitution]] is subordinate only to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and [[United States Code|federal law]]. Prior to the enactment of Indiana's first state constitution and achievement of statehood in 1816, the [[Indiana Territory]] was governed by territorial law. The state's first constitution was created in 1816, after the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] had agreed to grant statehood to the former Indiana Territory. The present-day document, which went into effect on November 1, 1851, is the state's second constitution. It supersedes Indiana's 1816 constitution and has had numerous amendments since its initial adoption.\n\nIndiana's constitution is composed of a preamble, articles, and amendments. Among other provisions, it specifies a [[republican form of government]] (pursuant to Article IV, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution) consisting of three branches: executive (including administration), legislative, and judicial. The state constitution also includes a bill of rights, grants suffrage and regulates elections, provides for a state militia, state educational institutions, and sets limits on government indebtedness. The [[Indiana General Assembly]] may amend the  [[constitution]], subject to [[ratification]] by vote of the people, as specified in Article 16 of Indiana's 1851 constitution.\n\n==Constitution of 1816==\n===Authorization===\nIn 1811 the [[Indiana Territory]]'s House of Representatives adopted a memorial  to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] asking permission for its citizens \"to form a government and constitution and be admitted to the Union\",<ref name=\"BR413\">{{cite book | author=John D.

Some members of the territory's general assembly, as well as [[Thomas Posey]], governor of the Indiana Territory, objected to statehood at that time. They believed that the territory's limited size and scattered population would make a state government too costly to operate. However, after a census authorized in 1814 proved that its population had reached 63,897, exceeding the minimum population requirement of 60,000 as outlined in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, efforts to pass a request to consider statehood for Indiana were renewed.<ref name=Madison49>{{cite book | author=James H.

The request was presented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on December 28, 1815, and introduced in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on January 2, 1816. A House committee chaired by [[Jonathan Jennings]], Indiana's territorial representative, reported out a bill for an [[Enabling Act]], which provided for the election of delegates to a convention to consider statehood for Indiana. The bill passed in the U.S. House on March 30, 1816, and in the U.S. Senate on April 13. [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Madison]] signed the Enabling Act into law on April 19, 1816. If a majority of the delegates to Indiana's constitutional convention agreed, the delegates would proceed to create a state constitution.<ref name=IH-Beginning-4>\"Beginning the Road to Statehood\" in {{cite journal| author=Pamela J.

The major concerns were the loss of financial support from the federal government if it became a state and the fear of a tax increase to pay for the new state government. The minority group preferred to wait until later, when the population was even larger and the state's economy and political structure was more firmly established.<ref name=Madison49/> The majority of the territory's citizens viewed statehood as an opportunity for more self-government and wanted to proceed. The territory's pro-statehood faction preferred to elect their own state officials instead of having the federal government appoint individuals on their behalf, formulate state laws, discontinue the appointed territorial governor's absolute veto power, and allow its citizens to have greater participation in national politics, including voting powers in Congress.<ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 439.</ref>\n\nAt the time the delegates were gathering at Corydon in June 1816, [[Slavery in Indiana|slavery]] had become a major and divisive issue in the territory. The indenture law of 1805 had been repealed, but slavery continued to exist within Indiana.<ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 48.</ref> Two major factions emerged. An anti-slavery/pro-democracy group was led by Jonathan Jennings and his supporters. Former territorial governor and future U.S. president [[William Henry Harrison]]'s allies led the pro-slavery/less democratic group. Supporters of Indiana statehood (the pro-Jennings faction) favored democracy, election of state officials, and voting representation in Congress.<ref>Madison, pp. 49\u201350.</ref> Harrison's allies supported slavery within the territory and maintaining Indiana's territorial status with a federally-appointed governor.<ref>\"Why Statehood?\" ''The Indiana Historian'', p. 3.</ref> The anti-slavery faction preparing for statehood hoped to institute a constitutional ban on slavery.\n\n===Constitutional Convention===\n{{See also|List of delegates to the 1816 Indiana constitutional convention}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:indianaconstitutionelem.jpg|right|thumb|The Constitution Elm died in 1925.

Eleven delegates had served in the territorial legislature and more than half of the delegates had previous legal training.<ref>Barnhart and Riker, pp. 443, 447.</ref> Daniel Grass, the sole delegate from Warrick County, was excused on June 19 for the remainder of the convention due to ill health.<ref name=IH-9-14/>\n\nThe delegation's basic tasks included selection of presiding officers, adoption of a set of convention rules, meetings in committees and as a whole group to discuss proposed articles for the new constitution, and adoption of a final version of the document.<ref name=\"Barnhart and Riker, p. 448\"/> Although the members of the delegation did not all agree, a majority group, mostly associated with the anti-territorial governor and anti-slavery faction, emerged in favor of statehood. The opposing consisted mostly of Harrison's friends and supporters of the territorial legislature who opposed statehood.<ref name=Madison50/><ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 445.</ref>\n \nThe summer heat often caused the delegation to move outdoors and work beneath the shade of a giant elm tree that would later be memorialized as the Constitution Elm.

The new constitution became effective on June 29, 1816, the last day of the convention, when the delegates signed the document. It was not submitted to Indiana's voters for ratification.<ref name =ml4/>\n\n===Summary and features===\nIndiana's 1816 constitution, considered the most important document in the state's history, represented the more democratic views of the pro-statehood/anti-slavery faction. The document emerged from the constitutional convention as a statement of the \"values and beliefs\" of Indiana's pioneer era.<ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe state's first constitution is similar to that of the other state constitutions written around the same time.<ref>It has been estimated that the original content the Indiana delegates drafted for the constitution accounts for less than ten percent of the total document. The majority was modeled after the constitutions of older states, especially those of [[Constitution of Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Constitution of Ohio|Ohio]]. See McLachlan, p. 3.</ref> Because [[Ohio]] and [[Kentucky]] were the newest states closest to Indiana, the delegates to the Indiana constitutional convention referred to the constitutions of these two states, along with others such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Tennessee]], for ideas and concepts as well as specific text.<ref>Article IX was partially based on the New Hampshire constitution. See Barnhart and Riker, pp. 450\u201356.</ref> Content from the other state constitutions was chosen based on the Indiana delegates' preferences for their new state. Occasionally, original text was composed for specific articles or sections when the appropriate wording in other state constitutions was not sufficient. The delegates' selections resulted in Indiana's legislative branch being dominant over the executive and judicial branches of state government.<ref name=IH-Outline-13>\"An Outline of the Content and Sources of the 1816 Constitution,\" ''The Indiana Historian'', p. 13.</ref><ref name=BR-450-52>Barnhart and Riker, pp. 450\u201352.</ref>\n\nThe Indiana delegates organized a republican form of government and created a state constitution that outlined a basic framework for governmental functions. Instead of providing specific details on individual issues, the constitution's broadly-defined principles enabled the state government to function as a loosely bound unit.<ref name =ml2/> \"The People\" were explicitly noted as being the sovereigns of the state.<ref>McLauchlan, pp. 3, 4.</ref>\n\nThe preamble outlined Indiana's rights to join the Union \"on equal footing with the original states\" in accordance with the laws of the U.S. Constitution, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, and the Enabling Act.<ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 450.</ref> Article I, which contained a bill of rights for Indiana's citizens, conferred many of the same rights as the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]], including civil liberties and such basic freedoms as the freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and freedom of religion, among others. Article II called for the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state government.<ref name=IH-Outline-13/><ref name=BR-450-52/>\n\nArticles III, IV, and V outlined the powers of the state's legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. Its [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature divided powers between two chambers (the state's House of Representatives and its Senate), each one composed of elected members. The state legislature was set to meet annually. Elections would be held annually to elect representatives. State senators would serve three-year terms, with one-third of the senators being elected each year. The governor and lieutenant governor would be elected to serve a term of three years. Indiana's governor was limited to serving two consecutive terms. A [[Majority|simple majority]] vote in the legislature could override the governor's veto. Article IV also outlined the election of other state officials.<ref name=IH-Outline-13/><ref name=BR-450-52/> The judicial branch, as outlined in Article V, included the state's [[Indiana Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], circuit courts, and other inferior courts. The constitution allowed the state legislature to create and adjust state courts and judicial districts and the governor was given the authority to appoint judges to serve seven-year terms with input and confirmations from the state senate.<ref name =ml3>McLauchlan, p. 3.</ref>\n\nArticle VI granted voting rights to white males twenty-one years of age and older who were citizens of the United States had lived in Indiana for at least one year. Under Article VII all \"able-bodied\" white men between the ages of 18 to 45 were required to serve in the militia when called upon to do so. Non-whites (more specifically, blacks, mulattos, and Native Americans) were prohibited from serving in the militia. Conscientious objectors would be fined if they did not serve.<ref name=IH-Outline-13/><ref name=BR-453-55>Barnhart and Riker, pp. 453\u201355.</ref>\n\nThe constitution's first of slavery appears in Article VIII, Section 1, which expressly prohibited alteration or amendment of the state constitution from ever permitting the introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude into the state.<ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 457.</ref> As one of the state constitution's most important provisions, this section allowed constitutional amendments for any reason other than the introduction of slavery or involuntary servitude. The anti-slavery clause in Article VIII stated: \"But, as the holding any part of the human Creation in slavery, or involuntary servitude, can only originate in usurpation and tyranny, no alteration of this constitution shall ever take place so as to introduce slavery or involuntary servitude in this State, otherwise than for the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.\"<ref>{{cite web| title =Constitution of 1816: Article VIII | website = | publisher =Indiana Historical Bureau | date = | url =http://www.in.gov/history/2875.htm | accessdate =2016-08-02}}</ref><ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 458.</ref> Indiana's 1851 constitution contains similar content, but clarified the legal status of slaves and indentured servants when they came into the state.<ref>Constitution of 1851, Article I, Section 37: \"No indenture of any Negro or Mulatto, made and executed out of the bounds of the State, shall be valid with the State.\" See {{cite book | author=Charles Kettleborough | title=Constitution Making in Indiana: A Source Book of Constitutional Documents, with Historical Introduction and Critical Notes | publisher=Indiana Historical Commission | series=Indiana Historical Collections | volume =1 | edition = | year=1930 | location=Indianapolis | page=304 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1UUpAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Constitution+Making+in+Indiana#v=onepage&q=Constitution%20Making%20in%20Indiana&f=false | oclc=3654268}}</ref>\n\nArticle IX outlined plans for public education.

Some critics felt that decisions regarding these issues were the responsibility of the elected representatives to the state legislature.

Major concerns with the state's constitution related to the issue of slavery; limiting governmental powers and jurisdictions within the state; guaranteeing secrecy of ballots; continuing concerns over the amendment process for the constitution; reducing state legislation related to personal and local issues; granting more local power over school funding; suffrage for foreign-born residents; legislative terms and legislative sessions; the impeachment process for state officials; and governmental expenses and inefficiencies, among others.<ref>Dunn, v. 1, pp. 436\u201339.</ref><ref name=Hoosiers133-34>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 133\u201334.</ref> In addition, a financial crisis in the 1840s in Indiana due to overspending, a result of the [[Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act]], caused the state government to become insolvent. The state's financial situation and ongoing calls for constitutional changes to prevent another crisis increased interest in a constitutional mandate that prohibited the state from incurring debt.

In August 1849, a total of 81,500 voters favored and 57,418 opposed a constitutional convention. The clear majority cased the 1849\u201350 session of the Indiana General Assembly to pass legislation calling for the election in August 1850 of 150 delegates apportioned among the Indiana General Assembly's senatorial and representative districts and based on the number of voters within each district. The Whigs, the minority party in the state at that time, and some state officials, including Governor [[Paris C. Dunning]], urged bipartisan representation at the convention. However, Indiana voters elected convention delegates along party lines. The result (95 Democrats and 55 Whigs) was roughly a two-thirds to one-third split between the two parties.<ref>Carmony, pp. 406\u20137.</ref><ref name = McL9-10>McLauchlan, pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref>Of the 50 delegates elected from the senatorial districts, 33 were Democrats and 17 were Whigs.

Charles H. Test called the meeting to order and George Whitfield Carr, the delegate from [[Lawrence County, Indiana|Lawrence County]], was elected the convention's president. (Carr had been Speaker of the House in the two previous sessions of the Indiana General Assembly.) [[William Hayden English]] was elected to serve as the convention secretary, along with three assistant secretaries. Appointed officials included a sergeant-at-arms and a doorkeeper. Judge [[Isaac Blackford]] of the [[Indiana Supreme Court]] administered the oath of office. Convention delegates were appointed to twenty-two standing committees to review proposed items and considered 333 resolutions.<ref name =McL9-10/><ref>Carmony, pp. 408\u20139.</ref><ref name=Kettleborough221>Kettleborough, v. I, p. 221.</ref> \n\nPrior to the convention, the state's political parties (Democrats and Whigs) adopted a set of proposals that they want to incorporate into the constitution. Whigs wanted offices in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches at all levels of government to be publicly-elected offices; expansion of suffrage to all males over the age twenty-one, including blacks and foreign-born men; biannual sessions of the state legislature (as opposed to annual sessions); a ban on the state government from incurring public debt; minimum funding requirements for public  schools; requiring the state legislature to only enact laws that had a statewide effect, ending [[private act]]s; and a reduction in the number of public officials, among other proposals.

Because the House chamber in the statehouse was too small for the gathering, the state government rented the nearby [[Indianapolis Masonic Temple#Indianapolis Masonic Hall of 1850|Masonic Temple]]. The opening session in the Mason Temple convened on December 26, 1850. The convention, which cost $88,280.37, included 127 days of sessions before adjourning on February 10, 1851.<ref>Dunn, v. 1, pp. 442\u201343</ref> Prior to adjournment, the delegates mandated that the new constitution, if adopted by a majority of voters in the state, would go into effect on November 1, 1851.<ref>Carmony, p. 449.</ref> The revised state constitution included components of the 1816 state constitution and adopted proposals from the convention delegates, as well as ideas drawn from the constitutions of other states such as [[Illinois]] and [[Wisconsin]], which were used as references.<ref name=Kettleborough221/> The final version of the constitution was based on [[Jacksonian democracy]], which significantly expanded the democratic principles of individual rights, private enterprise, and legislative restrictions.<ref name=Carmony405/><ref name = ml11>McLauchlan, p. 11.</ref>\n\n===Adoption===\nThe constitution was submitted to the state's voters for their approval in the August 4, 1851, general election. Convention delegates mandated that voters consider Article 13 separately from the other sections of the constitution. Article 13 prohibited further immigration of African Americans into Indiana and encouraged their colonization outside the state. Voters could either approve or reject the remaining provisions of the new constitution as a whole. In the final tally, voters approved Article 13 with 113,828 votes in favor and 21,873 opposed, an 83.88 percent favorable approval rate. Only in Elkhart, LaGrange, Steuben, and Randolph counties did a majority of voters oppose the adoption of the article. Voters also approved the remaining sections of the constitution as a whole with 113,230 votes in favor and 27,638 opposed, an 80.38 percent favorable approval among voters. Ohio County was the only one where the majority of voters rejected the new constitution (315 voted in favor and 438 opposed).<ref>Carmony, pp. 447 and 450.</ref><ref>Dunn, v. 1, pp. 471 and 496.</ref>\n\nOn September 3, 1851, Governor [[Joseph A. Wright]] issued a proclamation certifying the favorable results for the new constitution, which went into effect on November 1, 1851. Elected officials in the state government were permitted to retain their seats until elections were held in October 1852, but had to take an oath to uphold the new constitution.<ref>Dunn, v. 1, p. 497.</ref><ref>Esarey, p. 460.</ref> Since its ratification, the state constitution of 1851 has been amended several times, but it remains the highest state law in Indiana.<ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 137\u201338.</ref>\n\n===Notable features and changes===\nThe new constitution did not radically change the state's existing government. Although it expanded the bill of rights included in the 1816 document, the new constitution retained other features such as the basic frame of a limited self-government for the state.<ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', pp. 134 and 137.</ref> The 1851 version, which was longer and more detailed than the 1816 constitution, combined \"Jacksonian Democracy with a vigorous emphasis on economic laissez faire,\" reflecting the state's financial crisis in the late 1830s and early 1840s.<ref>Carmony, pp. 451.</ref> The new constitution also continued to support strong local control of government, confirming Indiana voters' general distrust of state government.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/>\n\nThe constitution of 1851 placed several limitations on the Indiana General Assembly's activities. Biennial legislative sessions were limited to 61 consecutive days (40 consecutive days for special sessions). To prevent the state legislature from interfering in local affairs, the General Assembly was restricted to general legislation applicable to the entire state and limited local and special interest legislation. In addition, the state government was prohibited from going into debt.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref name=Carmony410-50/> The new constitution gave the state legislature discretion on enacting banking laws in the state,<ref name=Carmony439>Carmony, p. 439.</ref> but prohibited the state government \"from becoming a stockholder in any bank or corporation, or loaning its credit to any individual or corporation.\"<ref name=Carmony450>Carmony, p. 450.</ref> Because many Indiana voters objected to state-sponsored banks, the new constitution barred the charter of the [[Bank of Indiana]] from being extended with the state government as a stockholder and banned the creation of other state-funded banks.<ref>Dunn, v., pp. 446\u201368.</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Emma Lou Thornbrough  | title =Indiana in the Civil War Era 1850\u20131880| publisher =Indiana Historical Society  | series =The History of Indiana | volume =III | edition = | year =1995 | location =Indianapolis | pages =425\u201326 | url =  | isbn =0871950502}}</ref>  \n\nAmong the other important changes was the abandonment of the short [[ballot]], where voters cast their ballots for a party's entire state of candidates instead of voting for individual offices. The Whig minority supported adoption of these changes, hoping to break the Democratic hold on power.<ref name=Dunn447>Dunn, v. 1, p. 447.</ref> Several other changes to the constitution related to election concerns. Terms for elected office included a two-year term for representatives and four-year terms for the governor and state senators. The constitution of 1851 also called for the popular election of more state government positions such as the secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, prosecuting attorney, and judges, as well as other county and local officials such as clerk, auditor, treasurer, sheriff, and coroner. In most cases, these officeholders were limited to two consecutive terms.<ref name=Carmony450/><ref name=Esarey457>Esarey, p. 457.</ref> In addition, the Supreme Court of Indiana was made an elective body. The number of Indiana Supreme Court judges was increased from three to five and their terms were extended to six years. The state's lower courts system was reorganized as well. For example, circuit court judges and local justices were made elective offices.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/>   \n\nThe constitution of 1851 extended voting rights to foreign-born men who had immigrated to Indiana. To vote in Indiana under the previous constitution, foreign-born men had to become naturalized U.S. citizens, which required a five-year residency requirement. Under the new constitution, aliens were granted suffrage if foreign-born men had reached the age of 21, stated their intention to become a naturalized citizen, and had lived in the United States for a year and in Indiana for at least six months.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref>Dunn, v. 1, pp. 451-52.</ref>\n\nThe new constitution made a strong commitment to public school education, , especially elementary schools (common schools),<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref name=Carmony439/> by mandating a \"uniform system of common schools, equally open to all and free of tuition.\"<ref>Carmony, p. 451.</ref> The constitution also required the state government to adequately fund local elementary schools, while providing for boards of local residents to manage the funds and the schools. Constitutional changes also created a new elected office, the state superintendent of public instruction, and gave the state some authority in setting curriculum.<ref name=Dunn474-76>Dunn, v.1, pp. 474\u201376.</ref> During the convention, delegates also considered abolishing the \"State University\" and county seminaries. Although efforts to abolish the university were unsuccessful, Article 8, Section 2, of the new constitution authorized the sale of county seminaries with the proceeds to be used to help fund Indiana's public elementary schools. Article 8 did not specifically identify [[Indiana University]] or guarantee its financial support; however, the state legislature continued to provide funding to IU, despite some funding controversies in the early 1850s.<ref name=Dunn474-76/><ref>Thornbrough, ''Indiana in the Civil War'', pp. 506\u201307.</ref><ref>Kettleborough, pp. 281 and 346\u201349.</ref>\n\nBecause no divorce clause was included in the state constitution of 1816, the legislature assumed the authority to grant divorces, and continued to do so even after laws passed in 1818 granted the authority to circuit courts. Under the new constitution, the Indiana General Assembly was prohibited from making local and special laws. As a result, divorce proceedings, among other issues, were delegated to the courts and clerks.<ref>Dunn, v. 1, p. 436.</ref><ref>Esarey, p. 458.</ref> \n\nDespite the positive changes in state constitution, some articles continued racial and gender inequality by limiting full rights of state citizenship to white males.<ref name=Hoosiers135>Madison, ''Hoosiers'',  p. 135.</ref> Fearing a negative impact on the state from a rising population of free people of color and emancipated slaves who had been expelled from slave states, convention delegates adopted Article 13, section 1, to ban further immigration of blacks and mulattos into Indiana.<ref>The delegates adopted Article 13, section 1, by a vote of 91 to 40. See: Carmony, p. 442.</ref><ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', pp. 137 and 144.</ref> Revisions to the constitution also discouraged African Americans from settling permanently in the state. Some convention delegates openly advocated for the colonization of free people of color in Indiana to [[Republic of Liberia|Liberia]], which led to the adoption of Article 13, section 3. This particular section outlined a source of funding for those who chose to emigrate.<ref>Carmony, pp. 442 and 447.</ref> Although the Indiana Supreme Court's ruling in ''Smith v. Moody'' (1866), struck down Article 13, making it invalid,<ref>{{cite book | author= Emma Lou Thornbrough | title =The Negro in Indiana Before 1900: A Study of a Minority | publisher =Indiana University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1993 | location =Bloomington | pages =233 and 235 | url = | isbn =0253359899}}</ref><ref name=Shephard40-41>{{cite journal| author= Randall T.

Justices were again made appointed positions, a list of candidates was created by the [[Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission]], narrowed to three finalists and thus submitted to the governor who then chooses one.

Constitutions.jpg|frame|right|The 1816 (''superseded'') and 1851 Constitutions of the State of Indiana, located in the [[Indiana Statehouse]] Rotunda.]]\nThe '''Constitution of Indiana''' is the highest body of state law in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]]. It establishes the structure and function of the state and is based on the principles of [[federalism]] and [[Jacksonian democracy]]. Indiana's [[constitution]] is subordinate only to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and [[United States Code|federal law]]. Prior to the enactment of Indiana's first state constitution and achievement of statehood in 1816, the [[Indiana Territory]] was governed by territorial law. The state's first constitution was created in 1816, after the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] had agreed to grant statehood to the former Indiana Territory. The present-day document, which went into effect on November 1, 1851, is the state's second constitution. It supersedes Indiana's 1816 constitution and has had numerous amendments since its initial adoption.\n\nIndiana's constitution is composed of a preamble, articles, and amendments. Among other provisions, it specifies a [[republican form of government]] (pursuant to Article IV, Section 4, of the U.S. Constitution) consisting of three branches: executive (including administration), legislative, and judicial. The state constitution also includes a bill of rights, grants suffrage and regulates elections, provides for a state militia, state educational institutions, and sets limits on government indebtedness. The [[Indiana General Assembly]] may amend the  [[constitution]], subject to [[ratification]] by vote of the people, as specified in Article 16 of Indiana's 1851 constitution.\n\n==Constitution of 1816==\n===Authorization===\nIn 1811 the [[Indiana Territory]]'s House of Representatives adopted a memorial  to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] asking permission for its citizens \"to form a government and constitution and be admitted to the Union\",<ref name=\"BR413\">{{cite book | author=John D.

Some members of the territory's general assembly, as well as [[Thomas Posey]], governor of the Indiana Territory, objected to statehood at that time. They believed that the territory's limited size and scattered population would make a state government too costly to operate. However, after a census authorized in 1814 proved that its population had reached 63,897, exceeding the minimum population requirement of 60,000 as outlined in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787, efforts to pass a request to consider statehood for Indiana were renewed.<ref name=Madison49>{{cite book | author=James H.

The request was presented in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] on December 28, 1815, and introduced in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] on January 2, 1816. A House committee chaired by [[Jonathan Jennings]], Indiana's territorial representative, reported out a bill for an [[Enabling Act]], which provided for the election of delegates to a convention to consider statehood for Indiana. The bill passed in the U.S. House on March 30, 1816, and in the U.S. Senate on April 13. [[President of the United States|President]] [[James Madison]] signed the Enabling Act into law on April 19, 1816.

The major concerns were the loss of financial support from the federal government if it became a state and the fear of a tax increase to pay for the new state government. The minority group preferred to wait until later, when the population was even larger and the state's economy and political structure was more firmly established.<ref name=Madison49/> The majority of the territory's citizens viewed statehood as an opportunity for more self-government and wanted to proceed. The territory's pro-statehood faction preferred to elect their own state officials instead of having the federal government appoint individuals on their behalf, formulate state laws, discontinue the appointed territorial governor's absolute veto power, and allow its citizens to have greater participation in national politics, including voting powers in Congress.<ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 439.</ref>\n\nAt the time the delegates were gathering at Corydon in June 1816, [[Slavery in Indiana|slavery]] had become a major and divisive issue in the territory. The indenture law of 1805 had been repealed, but slavery continued to exist within Indiana.<ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 48.</ref> Two major factions emerged. An anti-slavery/pro-democracy group was led by Jonathan Jennings and his supporters. Former territorial governor and future U.S. president [[William Henry Harrison]]'s allies led the pro-slavery/less democratic group. Supporters of Indiana statehood (the pro-Jennings faction) favored democracy, election of state officials, and voting representation in Congress.<ref>Madison, pp. 49\u201350.</ref> Harrison's allies supported slavery within the territory and maintaining Indiana's territorial status with a federally-appointed governor.<ref>\"Why Statehood?\" ''The Indiana Historian'', p. 3.</ref> The anti-slavery faction preparing for statehood hoped to institute a constitutional ban on slavery.\n\n===Constitutional Convention===\n{{See also|List of delegates to the 1816 Indiana constitutional convention}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:indianaconstitutionelem.jpg|right|thumb|The Constitution Elm died in 1925.

The document emerged from the constitutional convention as a statement of the \"values and beliefs\" of Indiana's pioneer era.<ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe state's first constitution is similar to that of the other state constitutions written around the same time.<ref>It has been estimated that the original content the Indiana delegates drafted for the constitution accounts for less than ten percent of the total document. The majority was modeled after the constitutions of older states, especially those of [[Constitution of Kentucky|Kentucky]] and [[Constitution of Ohio|Ohio]]. See McLachlan, p. 3.</ref> Because [[Ohio]] and [[Kentucky]] were the newest states closest to Indiana, the delegates to the Indiana constitutional convention referred to the constitutions of these two states, along with others such as [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Tennessee]], for ideas and concepts as well as specific text.<ref>Article IX was partially based on the New Hampshire constitution. See Barnhart and Riker, pp. 450\u201356.</ref> Content from the other state constitutions was chosen based on the Indiana delegates' preferences for their new state. Occasionally, original text was composed for specific articles or sections when the appropriate wording in other state constitutions was not sufficient. The delegates' selections resulted in Indiana's legislative branch being dominant over the executive and judicial branches of state government.<ref name=IH-Outline-13>\"An Outline of the Content and Sources of the 1816 Constitution,\" ''The Indiana Historian'', p. 13.</ref><ref name=BR-450-52>Barnhart and Riker, pp. 450\u201352.</ref>\n\nThe Indiana delegates organized a republican form of government and created a state constitution that outlined a basic framework for governmental functions. Instead of providing specific details on individual issues, the constitution's broadly-defined principles enabled the state government to function as a loosely bound unit.<ref name =ml2/> \"The People\" were explicitly noted as being the sovereigns of the state.<ref>McLauchlan, pp. 3, 4.</ref>\n\nThe preamble outlined Indiana's rights to join the Union \"on equal footing with the original states\" in accordance with the laws of the U.S. Constitution, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, and the Enabling Act.<ref>Barnhart and Riker, p. 450.</ref> Article I, which contained a bill of rights for Indiana's citizens, conferred many of the same rights as the [[United States Bill of Rights|U.S. Bill of Rights]], including civil liberties and such basic freedoms as the freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, and freedom of religion, among others. Article II called for the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of state government.<ref name=IH-Outline-13/><ref name=BR-450-52/>\n\nArticles III, IV, and V outlined the powers of the state's legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. Its [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature divided powers between two chambers (the state's House of Representatives and its Senate), each one composed of elected members. The state legislature was set to meet annually. Elections would be held annually to elect representatives. State senators would serve three-year terms, with one-third of the senators being elected each year. The governor and lieutenant governor would be elected to serve a term of three years. Indiana's governor was limited to serving two consecutive terms. A [[Majority|simple majority]] vote in the legislature could override the governor's veto. Article IV also outlined the election of other state officials.<ref name=IH-Outline-13/><ref name=BR-450-52/> The judicial branch, as outlined in Article V, included the state's [[Indiana Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], circuit courts, and other inferior courts. The constitution allowed the state legislature to create and adjust state courts and judicial districts and the governor was given the authority to appoint judges to serve seven-year terms with input and confirmations from the state senate.<ref name =ml3>McLauchlan, p. 3.</ref>\n\nArticle VI granted voting rights to white males twenty-one years of age and older who were citizens of the United States had lived in Indiana for at least one year. Under Article VII all \"able-bodied\" white men between the ages of 18 to 45 were required to serve in the militia when called upon to do so. Non-whites (more specifically, blacks, mulattos, and Native Americans) were prohibited from serving in the militia.

Major concerns with the state's constitution related to the issue of slavery; limiting governmental powers and jurisdictions within the state; guaranteeing secrecy of ballots; continuing concerns over the amendment process for the constitution; reducing state legislation related to personal and local issues; granting more local power over school funding; suffrage for foreign-born residents; legislative terms and legislative sessions; the impeachment process for state officials; and governmental expenses and inefficiencies, among others.<ref>Dunn, v. 1, pp. 436\u201339.</ref><ref name=Hoosiers133-34>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', p. 133\u201334.</ref> In addition, a financial crisis in the 1840s in Indiana due to overspending, a result of the [[Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act]], caused the state government to become insolvent.

In August 1849, a total of 81,500 voters favored and 57,418 opposed a constitutional convention. The clear majority cased the 1849\u201350 session of the Indiana General Assembly to pass legislation calling for the election in August 1850 of 150 delegates apportioned among the Indiana General Assembly's senatorial and representative districts and based on the number of voters within each district. The Whigs, the minority party in the state at that time, and some state officials, including Governor [[Paris C. Dunning]], urged bipartisan representation at the convention. However, Indiana voters elected convention delegates along party lines.

Biennial legislative sessions were limited to 61 consecutive days (40 consecutive days for special sessions). To prevent the state legislature from interfering in local affairs, the General Assembly was restricted to general legislation applicable to the entire state and limited local and special interest legislation. In addition, the state government was prohibited from going into debt.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref name=Carmony410-50/> The new constitution gave the state legislature discretion on enacting banking laws in the state,<ref name=Carmony439>Carmony, p. 439.</ref> but prohibited the state government \"from becoming a stockholder in any bank or corporation, or loaning its credit to any individual or corporation.\"<ref name=Carmony450>Carmony, p. 450.</ref> Because many Indiana voters objected to state-sponsored banks, the new constitution barred the charter of the [[Bank of Indiana]] from being extended with the state government as a stockholder and banned the creation of other state-funded banks.<ref>Dunn, v., pp. 446\u201368.</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Emma Lou Thornbrough  | title =Indiana in the Civil War Era 1850\u20131880| publisher =Indiana Historical Society  | series =The History of Indiana | volume =III | edition = | year =1995 | location =Indianapolis | pages =425\u201326 | url =  | isbn =0871950502}}</ref>  \n\nAmong the other important changes was the abandonment of the short [[ballot]], where voters cast their ballots for a party's entire state of candidates instead of voting for individual offices. The Whig minority supported adoption of these changes, hoping to break the Democratic hold on power.<ref name=Dunn447>Dunn, v. 1, p. 447.</ref> Several other changes to the constitution related to election concerns. Terms for elected office included a two-year term for representatives and four-year terms for the governor and state senators. The constitution of 1851 also called for the popular election of more state government positions such as the secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, prosecuting attorney, and judges, as well as other county and local officials such as clerk, auditor, treasurer, sheriff, and coroner. In most cases, these officeholders were limited to two consecutive terms.<ref name=Carmony450/><ref name=Esarey457>Esarey, p. 457.</ref> In addition, the Supreme Court of Indiana was made an elective body. The number of Indiana Supreme Court judges was increased from three to five and their terms were extended to six years. The state's lower courts system was reorganized as well. For example, circuit court judges and local justices were made elective offices.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/>   \n\nThe constitution of 1851 extended voting rights to foreign-born men who had immigrated to Indiana. To vote in Indiana under the previous constitution, foreign-born men had to become naturalized U.S. citizens, which required a five-year residency requirement. Under the new constitution, aliens were granted suffrage if foreign-born men had reached the age of 21, stated their intention to become a naturalized citizen, and had lived in the United States for a year and in Indiana for at least six months.<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref>Dunn, v. 1, pp. 451-52.</ref>\n\nThe new constitution made a strong commitment to public school education, , especially elementary schools (common schools),<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref name=Carmony439/> by mandating a \"uniform system of common schools, equally open to all and free of tuition.\"<ref>Carmony, p. 451.</ref> The constitution also required the state government to adequately fund local elementary schools, while providing for boards of local residents to manage the funds and the schools. Constitutional changes also created a new elected office, the state superintendent of public instruction, and gave the state some authority in setting curriculum.<ref name=Dunn474-76>Dunn, v.1, pp. 474\u201376.</ref> During the convention, delegates also considered abolishing the \"State University\" and county seminaries. Although efforts to abolish the university were unsuccessful, Article 8, Section 2, of the new constitution authorized the sale of county seminaries with the proceeds to be used to help fund Indiana's public elementary schools. Article 8 did not specifically identify [[Indiana University]] or guarantee its financial support; however, the state legislature continued to provide funding to IU, despite some funding controversies in the early 1850s.<ref name=Dunn474-76/><ref>Thornbrough, ''Indiana in the Civil War'', pp. 506\u201307.</ref><ref>Kettleborough, pp. 281 and 346\u201349.</ref>\n\nBecause no divorce clause was included in the state constitution of 1816, the legislature assumed the authority to grant divorces, and continued to do so even after laws passed in 1818 granted the authority to circuit courts. Under the new constitution, the Indiana General Assembly was prohibited from making local and special laws. As a result, divorce proceedings, among other issues, were delegated to the courts and clerks.<ref>Dunn, v. 1, p. 436.</ref><ref>Esarey, p. 458.</ref> \n\nDespite the positive changes in state constitution, some articles continued racial and gender inequality by limiting full rights of state citizenship to white males.<ref name=Hoosiers135>Madison, ''Hoosiers'',  p. 135.</ref> Fearing a negative impact on the state from a rising population of free people of color and emancipated slaves who had been expelled from slave states, convention delegates adopted Article 13, section 1, to ban further immigration of blacks and mulattos into Indiana.<ref>The delegates adopted Article 13, section 1, by a vote of 91 to 40. See: Carmony, p. 442.</ref><ref>Madison, ''Hoosiers'', pp. 137 and 144.</ref> Revisions to the constitution also discouraged African Americans from settling permanently in the state. Some convention delegates openly advocated for the colonization of free people of color in Indiana to [[Republic of Liberia|Liberia]], which led to the adoption of Article 13, section 3. This particular section outlined a source of funding for those who chose to emigrate.<ref>Carmony, pp. 442 and 447.</ref> Although the Indiana Supreme Court's ruling in ''Smith v. Moody'' (1866), struck down Article 13, making it invalid,<ref>{{cite book | author= Emma Lou Thornbrough | title =The Negro in Indiana Before 1900: A Study of a Minority | publisher =Indiana University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1993 | location =Bloomington | pages =233 and 235 | url = | isbn =0253359899}}</ref><ref name=Shephard40-41>{{cite journal| author= Randall T.

The Supreme Court became overloaded with cases and an appellate court was created at the turn of the century. During the 1970s a series of amendments were enacted to make the court constitutional and to reform the method of electing Supreme Court Justices. Justices were again made appointed positions, a list of candidates was created by the [[Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission]], narrowed to three finalists and thus submitted to the governor who then chooses one. The Justice could then serve two years before being subjected to a retention election, if retained then the Justice could continue their term for up to ten years. All five of the justices must face a retention vote once every ten years on the ballot of that general election.\n\n====Extending legislative sessions====\nA constitution amendment passed in 1974 authorized the return to annual sessions of Indiana General Assembly; however, the governor was empowered to call special sessions of the state legislature if necessary.<ref>\"Article 4\" in the ''Indiana Constitution'' in {{cite book| title =The Declaration of Independence; The United States Constitution; The Indiana Constitution | publisher =Office of Indiana Attorney General | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2001 | location =Indianapolis | pages =41 | url =  | isbn =}}</ref> The long session, which occurred the year after an election, was left the same (61 days); however, the shorter legislative session in the following year was authorized to meet for a 30-day period.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} (The initial constitution of 1851 authorized biannual sessions of the General Assembly to meet for 61 consecutive days; special sessions were limited to 40 days.)<ref name=Hoosiers133-34/><ref name=Carmony410-50>Carmony, pp. 410, 416\u201318, and 450.</ref>\n\n==Constitutional decisions==\n{{See also|Supreme Court of Indiana#Landmark cases}} \n{{expand section|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Slavery and indentured servitude===\nThe unanimous Indiana Supreme Court decision in ''Lasselle v.

Although they had drawn respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore, Stallions owner [[Jim Speros]] knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|title=Once, the Stallions rode high|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-11-26/sports/0011260151_1_baltimore-stallions-grey-cup-stallions-won/2|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 26, 2000|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> They subsequently adopted the name and assumed the history of the team that previously played in the city, the [[Montreal Alouettes|Alouettes]], who had ceased operations in 1987. Like the Browns, the Alouettes (who incidentally were originally founded in 1946, the same year as the Browns) were formally recognized as having resumed operations after a hiatus although unlike the Browns, the decision to reactivate the Montreal franchise in such a manner that it was considered a continuation of the previous franchise had not been previously planned and was made retroactively at the time of their revival. Much of the Stallions' roster and most of the Stallions' other football personnel made the move to Montreal, although unlike Modell, Speros was not formally given the sort of successor rights to existing contracts that would have allowed him to transplant his football organization to Montreal in the same manner was done from Cleveland to Baltimore - this would have been problematic due to the CFL's requirement that the re-activated Alouettes adhere to roster limits on American players (then called \"imports\") that the defunct U.S. CFL teams had not been bound to. The ability of Speros to retain the core of his championship roster to the point that the transaction superficially appeared to be a \"move\" was the result of a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between Speros and the other CFL teams. CFL commissioner [[Larry Smith (Canadian politician)|Larry Smith]], an Alouettes alumnus who was keen to ensure the revived Montreal franchise was an immediate contender, had pressured the other CFL teams to agree not to aggressively pursue what were technically [[free agent]]s.\n\nFocus groups, a telephone survey, and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell's team. Starting with a list of over 100 possible names, the team's management reduced it to 17. From there, focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six, and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three, Marauders, Americans, and Ravens. Finally, a fan contest drawing 33,288 voters picked \"[[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]\", a name that alludes to the famous poem, \"[[The Raven]]\", by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who spent the latter part of his life in Baltimore, and is also buried there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baltimore Ravens History|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/baltimore-ravens/team-history/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> The team also adopted purple and black as their team colors, a stark contrast to the brown and orange colors of the Browns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naming Baltimore's Team: Ravens|url=http://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/history/naming-baltimores-team.html|publisher=Baltimore Ravens|accessdate=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708123713/http://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/history/naming-baltimores-team.html|archive-date=July 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The former Colts Marching Band, which remained in Baltimore after the Colts moved to Indianapolis, was subsequently renamed the [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Band History|url=http://www.baltimoreravens.com/ravenstown/marching-ravens/history.html|publisher=Baltimore Ravens|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> Along with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Washington Redskins]], the Ravens are one of only four NFL teams with an official [[marching band]].\n\nModell's move to Baltimore came amid an unprecedented flurry of similar threats \u2014 and actual moves \u2014<ref name=\"SIKing1\">{{cite news|last=King|first=Peter|title=Down...And Out: Citing his crushing debts, Art Modell is taking his Browns to Baltimore|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/11/13/208163/downand-out-citing-his-crushing-debts-art-modell-is-taking-his-browns-to-baltimore|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=November 13, 1995|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SICrothers1\">{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Tim|title=The Shakedown: Greedy owners are threatening to move their teams if demands for new stadiums, better lease deals, etc., aren't met|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/06/19/204044/the-shakedown-greedy-owners-are-threatening-to-move-their-teams-if-demands-for-new-stadiums-better-lease-deals-etc-arent-met|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=June 19, 1995|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> that fueled 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL.

In return, Modell was permitted to establish a new franchise, the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and was allowed to transfer the football organization under his control to the new franchise. The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an [[expansion team]] that began play in {{nfly|1996}}.

Although they had drawn respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore, Stallions owner [[Jim Speros]] knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Klingaman|first=Mike|title=Once, the Stallions rode high|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-11-26/sports/0011260151_1_baltimore-stallions-grey-cup-stallions-won/2|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|date=November 26, 2000|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> They subsequently adopted the name and assumed the history of the team that previously played in the city, the [[Montreal Alouettes|Alouettes]], who had ceased operations in 1987. Like the Browns, the Alouettes (who incidentally were originally founded in 1946, the same year as the Browns) were formally recognized as having resumed operations after a hiatus although unlike the Browns, the decision to reactivate the Montreal franchise in such a manner that it was considered a continuation of the previous franchise had not been previously planned and was made retroactively at the time of their revival. Much of the Stallions' roster and most of the Stallions' other football personnel made the move to Montreal, although unlike Modell, Speros was not formally given the sort of successor rights to existing contracts that would have allowed him to transplant his football organization to Montreal in the same manner was done from Cleveland to Baltimore - this would have been problematic due to the CFL's requirement that the re-activated Alouettes adhere to roster limits on American players (then called \"imports\") that the defunct U.S. CFL teams had not been bound to. The ability of Speros to retain the core of his championship roster to the point that the transaction superficially appeared to be a \"move\" was the result of a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between Speros and the other CFL teams. CFL commissioner [[Larry Smith (Canadian politician)|Larry Smith]], an Alouettes alumnus who was keen to ensure the revived Montreal franchise was an immediate contender, had pressured the other CFL teams to agree not to aggressively pursue what were technically [[free agent]]s.\n\nFocus groups, a telephone survey, and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell's team. Starting with a list of over 100 possible names, the team's management reduced it to 17. From there, focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six, and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three, Marauders, Americans, and Ravens. Finally, a fan contest drawing 33,288 voters picked \"[[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]\", a name that alludes to the famous poem, \"[[The Raven]]\", by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], who spent the latter part of his life in Baltimore, and is also buried there.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baltimore Ravens History|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/baltimore-ravens/team-history/|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> The team also adopted purple and black as their team colors, a stark contrast to the brown and orange colors of the Browns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naming Baltimore's Team: Ravens|url=http://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/history/naming-baltimores-team.html|publisher=Baltimore Ravens|accessdate=June 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708123713/http://www.baltimoreravens.com/team/history/naming-baltimores-team.html|archive-date=July 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The former Colts Marching Band, which remained in Baltimore after the Colts moved to Indianapolis, was subsequently renamed the [[Baltimore's Marching Ravens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Band History|url=http://www.baltimoreravens.com/ravenstown/marching-ravens/history.html|publisher=Baltimore Ravens|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref> Along with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Washington Redskins]], the Ravens are one of only four NFL teams with an official [[marching band]].\n\nModell's move to Baltimore came amid an unprecedented flurry of similar threats \u2014 and actual moves \u2014<ref name=\"SIKing1\">{{cite news|last=King|first=Peter|title=Down...And Out: Citing his crushing debts, Art Modell is taking his Browns to Baltimore|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/11/13/208163/downand-out-citing-his-crushing-debts-art-modell-is-taking-his-browns-to-baltimore|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=November 13, 1995|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SICrothers1\">{{cite news|last=Crothers|first=Tim|title=The Shakedown: Greedy owners are threatening to move their teams if demands for new stadiums, better lease deals, etc., aren't met|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/06/19/204044/the-shakedown-greedy-owners-are-threatening-to-move-their-teams-if-demands-for-new-stadiums-better-lease-deals-etc-arent-met|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=June 19, 1995|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> that fueled 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL.

On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49 percent of the Ravens to [[Steve Bisciotti]].<ref name=bisciotti1>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F89B8E00CF79536&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Bisciotti approved as co-owner of Ravens|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2011-03-12|date=2000-03-27}}</ref> In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51 percent for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 8, 2004, the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club.<ref name=bisciotti2>{{cite news|title=Bisciotti takes control of Ravens|url=http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/BAL/7242066|agency=Associated Press|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|date=April 8, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616162759/http://www.nfl.com/teams/story/BAL/7242066|archivedate=June 16, 2004|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Modell later retired and had relinquished control of the Ravens, he is still despised in Cleveland, not only for moving the Browns, but also for his firing of legendary head coach [[Paul Brown]] in 1963. Some considered the Browns' move and subsequent lawsuits costing Modell a spot in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], which is in [[Canton, Ohio]], 60 miles south of Cleveland and is both part of the Cleveland television market and part of the Browns' territorial rights.<ref name=LivingstonModell>{{cite news|last=Livingston|first=Bill|title=Upon further review, Art Modell's case for Canton gets weaker every year|url=http://www.cleveland.com/livingston/index.ssf/2010/12/upon_further_review_art_modell.html|newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=December 12, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Clayton|first=John|title=Modell was mostly a model owner|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8344634/nfl-modell-was-model-owner-many-ways|publisher=ESPN|date=September 6, 2012|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> Modell died in 2012, having never returned to Cleveland.<ref name=\"McFaddenNYTimes\" /> The Browns were the only home team that did not acknowledge, much less commemorate, Modell's death the following Sunday.

Also, it requires that the name, colors, [[World Series]] trophies, and history of the team remain in Minnesota if the Twins are ever moved out of state. The deal is similar to what Modell agreed to with the city of Cleveland during the move.\n\n===Major League Soccer===\n*In December 2005, the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] moved to [[Houston]] to become the [[Houston Dynamo]]. At the time, it was announced by the league that while players and staff would move with the team, the team name, colors, logo, and records (including two championship trophies) would stay in San Jose for when a new expansion team arrives.<ref>{{cite news|last=Halpin|first=Jason|title=Earthquakes set to move to Houston|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2010/01/22/earthquakes-set-move-houston|publisher=MLS Digital|date=December 15, 2005|accessdate=June 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=San Jose's MLS team moving to Houston|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/mls/quakes/2005-12-15-relocation-houston_x.htm|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=December 15, 2005|accessdate=2009-03-02}}</ref> In 2008, the Earthquakes returned under the ownership of [[Lew Wolff]].\n*The Browns move in 1996 had a direct effect on a proposed move of [[Columbus Crew SC]] to [[Austin, Texas]]; the Modell Law, which was implemented in 1996, prohibits sports teams that benefited from public facilities or financial assistance from moving to another city without a six-month notice and an attempt to sell the team to a local ownership group. A lawsuit was filed by Ohio Attorney General [[Mike DeWine]] and the [[Columbus, Ohio|city of Columbus]]. Rather ironically, Cleveland Browns owner [[Jimmy Haslam|Jimmy]] and [[Dee Haslam]], alongside with other investors, offered to buy the Columbus Crew in order to keep them in Columbus.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Statement from Dee and Jimmy Haslam on interest in Columbus Crew|url=https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/statement-from-dee-and-jimmy-haslam-on-interest-in-columbus-crew|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=ClevelandBrowns.com|date=October 12, 2018|accessdate=October 13, 2018}}</ref> The proposed sale would sell the operational rights of the Crew to the new buyers, while previous Crew owner [[Anthony Precourt]] would keep his equity stake in MLS, and would have ownership of a [[Austin FC|new franchise in Austin]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Wahl |first1=Grant |title=Columbus Crew Set to Avoid Austin Move After New Local Buyers Emerge |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/10/12/columbus-crew-saved-austin-move-precourt-haslam-mls |accessdate=3 December 2018 |publisher=Sports Illustrated |date=12 October 2018}}</ref> The sale of the Crew to Haslam's ownership group was announced as agreed to on December 28, 2018, and was completed in January 2019.

Upon arrival at Denver, the Nordiques' retired numbers were placed back into circulation.\n*In 2011, a team took the name of a city's previous team (as the Baltimore Stallions did when the Ravens forced their move to Montreal). That saga began in 1996, when the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972\u201396)|Winnipeg Jets]] left [[Manitoba]] for [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and become the [[Phoenix Coyotes]]. Thirteen years later, the [[Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy and sale|Coyotes went bankrupt]] and were taken over by the league. Winnipeg-based [[True North Sports & Entertainment]] offered to buy the team and return it to Winnipeg, where it presumably would have re-assumed the Jets' name and history. The NHL turned down that proposal \u2014 they were still looking for an owner to operate the franchise in Phoenix, whose municipal government had agreed to subsidize the team's financial losses \u2014 but said that moving the team back to Winnipeg was their preferred backup option. But when the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] came up for sale a year later, the league decided that there was no chance of finding an owner to operate a franchise in Georgia, so they arranged for True North to purchase the Atlanta franchise and move it to Winnipeg for the {{NHL Year|2011}} NHL season. The league decided to let True North and the [[Winnipeg Jets|new Jets]] use the identity of the old Winnipeg team, but not its history, which remained in Arizona with the Coyotes. The new Jets organization highlighted this change by quickly re-issuing the team's #9 jersey \u2014 retired by the old Jets in honor of superstar [[Bobby Hull]] \u2014 to forward [[Evander Kane]], who had worn the number in Atlanta.\n\n===National Basketball Association===\n*The [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|Seattle SuperSonics' move to Oklahoma City]] in 2008 included an agreement that the [[Seattle SuperSonics|SuperSonics]]' name, logo, colors, and history would all be left in [[Seattle]]. This also includes banners and trophies, which would be displayed in [[Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI)|a museum]] until a new franchise is brought to Seattle to be hung from the rafters of its arena.<ref>{{cite press release|title=THE PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL CLUB, LLC AND CITY OF SEATTLE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT|url=http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/CityAttorney/Reports/2008SonicsSettlementAgreement.pdf#page=3|publisher=City of Seattle, Washington|date=July 2, 2008|accessdate=June 3, 2016}}</ref> The original franchise, now the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], continue to keep the SuperSonics tie-ins, including records, championships, and retired numbers, until a new SuperSonics franchise is brought to Seattle. Both the Thunder and a potential new SuperSonics franchise would \"share\" the original SuperSonics history.\n*Similar to the Winnipeg Jets scenario in the NHL, the NBA first entered [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] in {{nbay|1988|start}} in the form of the [[Charlotte Hornets]]. That team remained in Charlotte until moving to [[New Orleans]] after the {{nbay|2001|app=season}}, retaining the Hornets name. The league returned to Charlotte for the {{nbay|2004|app=season}} with a new team, the Charlotte Bobcats. After the New Orleans franchise changed its name to the [[New Orleans Pelicans|Pelicans]] after the {{nbay|2012|app=season}}, the Bobcats announced that they would reclaim the \"Hornets\" name effective with the {{nbay|2014|app=season}}. When the name change from Bobcats to Hornets became official in May 2014, it was also announced that the Hornets, Pelicans, and the NBA had reached an agreement that all history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets would be transferred to the revived Hornets. As a result, the Hornets are now considered to have been established in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 (as the Bobcats, then again changing their name back to the Hornets in 2014), while the Pelicans are now considered a 2002 expansion team.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Charlotte Hornets Name Returns to Carolinas|url=http://www.nba.com/hornets/charlotte-hornets-name-returns-carolinas|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hornets.com|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Relocation of professional sports teams]]\n* [[Cleveland sports curse]]\n* [[Browns\u2013Ravens rivalry]]\n* [[History of the Cleveland Browns]]\n* [[History of the Baltimore Ravens]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|title=Cleveland Browns History|author=Henkel, Frank M.|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0-7385-3428-2|ref=CITEREFHenkel2005}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.latimes.com/sports/bal-modell121795,0,1763650,full.story Inside the Browns deal.] A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article on the Cleveland Browns' move.\n* {{YouTube|6J7Sc2Uaa0E|Cleveland Browns relocation}} on [[The NFL on NBC pregame show]].\n{{Cleveland Browns}}\n{{Baltimore Ravens}}\n{{NFL on NBC}}\n\n[[Category:National Football League controversies]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Browns]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Ravens]]\n[[Category:National Football League franchise relocations]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Rm pleonasm", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns_relocation_controversy"}
