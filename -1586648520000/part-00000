His personal life has been the subject of numerous studies. According to Turkish historian [[Kemal H. Karpat]], Atat\u00fcrk's recent bibliography included 7,010 different sources.<ref name=\"Karpat\">Karpat, \"The Personality of Atat\u00fcrk\", pp. 893\u201399.</ref> Atat\u00fcrk's personal life has its controversies, ranging from where he was born to his correct full name. The details of his marriage have always been a subject of debate. His religious beliefs were discussed in Turkish political life as recently as the [[Republic protests]] during the [[2007 Turkish presidential election|2007 presidential election]].\n\nMustafa Kemal's personality has been an important subject both for scholars and the general public.<ref name=\"Karpat\"/> Much of substantial personal information about him comes from memoirs by his associates, who were at times his rivals, and friends. Some credible information originates from [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy]], [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir]], [[Halide Edib Ad\u0131var]], [[Ali K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7|K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali]], [[Falih R\u0131fk\u0131 Atay]], [[Afet \u0130nan]], there is also secondary analysis by [[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Patrick Balfour, the 3rd Baron Kinross]], and, most recently, [[Vam\u0131k Volkan|Vam\u0131k D. Volkan]] and [[Norman Itzkowitz]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Name==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2015}}\nIn Turkish tradition, names have additional honorary or memorial values besides their grammatical identification function. It is possible to translate a name from Turkish to other languages, but care should be given as names' form varies from one language to another. Atat\u00fcrk had [[Mustafa]] as his [[name at birth]]. Mustafa ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649}} \u2013 ''Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101'', \"the chosen one\"), an [[epithet]] of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], was a common name at that time. Young Mustafa studied at Salonica Military School, the military junior high school in Salonica (now [[Thessaloniki]] in modern [[Greece]]), where his mathematics teacher Captain \u00dcsk\u00fcpl\u00fc Mustafa Sabri Bey gave him the additional name \"Kemal\" (\"perfection\") because of his student's academic excellence.<ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, Encyclopedia of the Age of Imperialism, 1800\u20131914, p. 393; {{ISBN|978-0-313-33404-7}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 1911, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of [[Binba\u015f\u0131]], an Ottoman military rank denoting the commander of \"a thousand soldiers,\" equivalent to the rank of Major in the modern Turkish army. Since, in Ottoman military ranks, \"[[Bey]]\" was a common title given to all ranks for Binba\u015f\u0131 and above, Mustafa Kemal Efendi, henceforth, was addressed as \"Mustafa Kemal Bey\". On 1 April 1916, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of [[Mirliva]], equivalent to [[Major General]] today. In Ottoman military ranks, [[Pasha]] was a common title given to all ranks at and above Mirliva, and he was from then on addressed as \"Mustafa Kemal Pasha\" ({{lang-tr|Pa\u015fa}}).\n\nKemal Pasha, disgusted by the capitulations and concessions made by the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] to the Allies, and by the occupation of [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (known as [[Istanbul]] in English since 1930) by the British, resigned from his post on 8 July 1919. He escaped from Istanbul by sea, passing through British [[Royal Navy]] patrols and landing on the [[Black Sea]] port city of [[Samsun]], to organize the resistance against the Allied Powers' occupation of Anatolia. After his resignation, the [[Sublime Porte]], the Ottoman imperial government, issued a warrant and later condemned him to death [[in absentia]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 19 September 1921, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Grand National Assembly]] presented him with the title of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Gazi]], which denotes, a combat or wounded veteran, with the religious connotation of defeating non-Islamic forces, and bestowed upon him the rank of [[Marshal]] for his achievements during the [[Turkish Independence War|War of Independence]]. Henceforth, he'd be addressed as \"Gazi Mustafa Kemal\".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 21 June 1934, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] recognized the need for registration and use of fixed hereditary surnames. The [[Surname Law]] was proposed and later put into force. On 24 November 1934, the Assembly enacted a special law to bestow on Mustafa Kemal the surname \"Atat\u00fcrk,\" which translates as \"Father of the Turks,\"<ref name=\"Ataturk\">Turkish Justice Department website, Article Ataturk</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/turkey-abstract.html Profile], smithsonianmag.com. Retrieved 28 March 2015.</ref> and established \"Atat\u00fcrk\" as a unique surname.<ref group=note>The law stated that the surname \"Atat\u00fcrk\" may be used only by Gazi Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. The surname \"Atat\u00fcrk\" can be divided in two parts, \"Ata\" and \"T\u00fcrk,\" whereby \"Ata\" means \"father\" or \"ancestor\", while ''T\u00fcrk'' denotes simply \"Turk,\" the \"[[Turkish people]].\" Thus, \"Atat\u00fcrk\" best translates to \"Father of Turkish People\". The current common practice in Turkey as well as abroad is to refer to him as Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.</ref>\n\n===List of names and titles===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header = Atat\u00fcrk's identity documents after the Surname Law\n | image1 = Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn 993 814 seri numaral\u0131 n\u00fcfus c\u00fczdan\u0131.jpg\n | alt1 = Atat\u00fcrk's identity document from 1934\n | caption1 = 1934.

The Ottoman Empire recognized the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]] and the [[Rumi calendar]]. The Hijri was an Islamic calendar, used to mark the religious holidays. It was lunar, with years of 354 or 355 days. The Rumi was a civil calendar, adopted in 1839. It was solar, based on the [[Julian Calendar]]. Both counted time from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], the migration of [[Muhammad]] to [[Medina]]. Between the two calendars significant differences in elapsed time were present. Various reforms were made to reconcile them but typically there was always a difference.\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's birth date was recorded in the public records of Turkish [[Thessaloniki|Selanik]] as [[Anno Hegirae]] 1296 with no sign whether this was based on the Rumi or on the Hijri calendar. In view of this confusion Atat\u00fcrk set his own birthday to coincide with the Turkish Independence Day, which he announced was 19 May 1919, the day of his arrival in [[Samsun]], in a speech given in 1927. His identification with Independence Day implied his selection of the civil calendar, in which AH 1296 lasts from 13 March 1880 to 12 March 1881. The latter dates are in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] just adopted for the Republic by Atat\u00fcrk for purposes of standardization (the Julian Calendar was rejected earlier). Atat\u00fcrk therefore listed his own birthday in all documents official and unofficial as 19 May 1881.<ref>{{cite book|page=106|first=Erik Jan|last=Z\u00fcrcher|author-link=Erik-Jan Z\u00fcrcher|title=The Unionist factor: the r\u00f4le of the Committee of Union and Progress in the Turkish National Movement, 1905\u20131926|year=1984|location=Leiden|publisher=E.J. Brill}}</ref>\n\nAtat\u00fcrk was told by his mother that he was born on a spring day, but his younger sister Makbule Atadan was told by others that he was born at night during a thunderstorm.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Faik Re\u015fit Unat]] received differing responses from Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m's neighbors at Salonika. Some claimed that he was born on a spring day, but others stated on a winter day during either January or February. A date that has gained some acceptance is 19 May, a date which originated with the historian [[Re\u015fit Saffet Atabinen]]. 19 May is the symbolic start of the Turkish Independence War, and Atabinen linked Atat\u00fcrk's birth day to the start of the Independence War \u2013 a gesture which Atat\u00fcrk appreciated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} There was even a plan to establish a \"Gazi\" day. Another story about this date is that a teacher asked Atat\u00fcrk his birth date, that he responded he did not know it, and that the teacher suggested 19 May. Then again, there are two ways to interpret this; the \"Gregorian 19 May 1881\" would imply Rumi 1 March 1297, which conflicts with the only recorded information, Rumi 1296. It is also possible to say \"Rumi 19 May 1296\", which implies a date in the Gregorian year 1880.\n\nSome sources ignore the day and month altogether, and print his birth date as Gregorian 1880/81. Other claims are:\n# [[Enver Behnan \u015eapolyo]] claimed that Atat\u00fcrk was born on Gregorian 23 December 1880.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n# [[\u015eevket S\u00fcreyya Aydemir]] claimed that he was born on Gregorian 4 January 1881.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n# [[Muhtar Kumral]], former head of the Mustafa Kemal Association, claimed that he was born on Gregorian 13 March 1881, and stated they used Makbule Atadan. A conversion from Gregorian to Rumi sets the day in Rumi to 1 March 1297. The validity of this claim is questionable, since the written record states Rumi 1296, not 1297.<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\"/>\n# [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]] claimed that Atat\u00fcrk was born between 10 May and 20 May. He stated that this information was shared with Atat\u00fcrk, and that Atat\u00fcrk responded \"Why not May 19.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe memoirs of the Soviet diplomat [[Simon Aralov]] mention a conversation between Aralov and Atat\u00fcrk, where Aralov says he was born in 1880, and Atat\u00fcrk responds \"just like me\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's last official [[identity document]] ({{lang-tr|n\u00fcfus c\u00fczdan\u0131}}) does not include the day and month, but the year 1881 is visible.<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\"/> It is exhibited in the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum, \u015ei\u015fli|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]] in [[\u015ei\u015fli]].<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ahmetakyol.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=224&Itemid=45|title=Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Do\u011fum Tarihi|language=Turkish|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> The Republic of Turkey announced 19 May 1881 officially to the public and diplomatically to other countries as his accepted birthday.<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\"/>\n\n==Nationality==\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] was not a [[national state]] and the records were not kept based on nationality, but on religion.

[[Russian history, 1855\u20131892|Russia was implementing reforms]]; Japan opened [[Foreign relations of Meiji Japan|its doors to the West]] during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Ottoman Empire was going through transformation. [[Ottoman military reform efforts]], like the contemporaneous [[Modernization of Japanese Military 1868\u20131931]], managed to develop a modern army. Racial, regional, ethnic and national stereotypes were part of discourse throughout the world. Ottoman people were not immune to these developments and there was a [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThe Ottoman State had been weakened by Turkish Islamism. Conservatism was strong both in government and society. Although the empire was transforming itself, the [[Hippocratic school of medicine]], [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] and geography, and other branches of [[medieval studies]] were still in force. Many of these studies had been first amended, then discarded in western Europe with the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Except for [[Military history of Europe|European military technology]], the penetration of European ideas and practices into Turkey was slow.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Preparatory school===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nAli R\u0131za Bey's desire was to send Atat\u00fcrk to the newly opened \u015eemsi Efendi School, which had a contemporary education program. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m wanted him to attend a traditional school. The traditional Muslim schools had programs based on mostly prayers and hymns. This caused arguments within the family. He first enrolled in a traditional religious school. He later switched to \u015eemsi Efendi School.\n\nIn 1888, Ali R\u0131za Efendi died at an age of 47. Atat\u00fcrk was 7 years old. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m was 31. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m and her two children lived with her brother H\u00fcseyin for a period. H\u00fcseyin was the manager of a farm outside Salonika. Mustafa worked on the farm.\n\nZ\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m married Rag\u0131p Bey. Rag\u0131p Bey was also a widower with four children. Atat\u00fcrk liked S\u00fcreyya. His other step brother was employed by [[Regie Company]]. Because he was not the senior male in the house after his mother's marriage, Atat\u00fcrk left the house and lived with a relative.\n\n===Military education===\n[[File:Ataturk, Ottoman War Academy, 1901.jpg|thumb|1901, student at [[Ottoman War Academy]].]]\n[[File:Monastir Military High School.jpg|thumb|[[Monastir Military High School]].]]\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal, 1905.png|thumb|Photo taken at the Andriomenos Photo Shop on the day of graduation from the War Academy.]]\nAtat\u00fcrk wanted to attend the military school. As a young boy, he admired the Western-style uniforms of the military officers. He enrolled to the military junior high school {{lang-tr|Sel\u00e2nik Asker\u00ee R\u00fc\u015ftiyesi}} in Sel\u00e2nik. In 1896, he enrolled in the [[Monastir Military High School]].

Both of these regions saw discontent and revolts towards the Ottoman administration.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nOn 13 March 1899, he enrolled in the Ottoman War Academy in Constantinople<!--Use \"Constantinople\" in English until 1930, then switch to Istanbul from that point--> ({{lang-tr|Mekteb-i Harbiye-i \u015eahane}}). It was a boarding school with dormitories within its premises. The military school was strictly controlled by [[Abdul Hamid II]]. Newspapers were not allowed in the school, and textbooks were the only accepted books. The school not only taught military skills but also religious practices and social work. The curriculum at this school demanded either donating money or working for charity. He graduated from the Ottoman War Academy in 1902.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 10 February 1902, he enrolled in the [[Ottoman Military College|Imperial Military Staff College]] in Constantinople<!--Use \"Constantinople\" in English until 1930, then switch to Istanbul from that point-->, from which he graduated on 11 January 1905. There were two officer tracks in the Ottoman imperial army. One of them was the officers \"educated within the army itself\", ''Alayl\u0131'', and the other consisted of officers trained in modern military schools, ''Mektepli''. He was a \"school trained\" officer. School educated officers had a strong ideological imprint toward family and country, and he had shown tendencies toward both. When he joined the Ottoman Army, he had already passed 13 years of military education.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Family==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2015}}\nZ\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m's first child was Fatma, then \u00d6mer, later Ahmet was born.

Kemal was invited to U\u015fakl\u0131gil residence during his stay in Smyrna<!--Change to Izmir after 1930-->. He had chance to observe Latife closely. Their initial acquaintanceship period lasted a relatively short time as he had to return to Angora<!--Use Ankara after 1930--> (now Ankara) on 2 October. Kemal opened up his interest to Latife by asking her \"Don't go anywhere. Wait for me.\" On 29 January 1923, he arranged for the permission to marry from her family, with the assistance of the chief of staff [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]]. [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir]] was present at their wedding. These were not random decisions.\n\nIn Turkish culture, the groom asks his family or respected people, with whom he has close relationships, to perform this act. Latife did not cover her face during the wedding, though during this period it was the tradition for brides to do so. They did not have a honeymoon just after the wedding. The elections for the parliament were coming. He received the representatives of local newspapers next day of his wedding. He prepared for his public speech on 2 February. The honeymoon, an Anatolian tour, was a chance to show his wife's unveiled face as a role model for modern Turkish women. \"It's not just a honeymoon, it's a lesson in reform,\" one observer remarked.<ref name=\"latife1\"/>\n\nAs a [[First Lady]], she was part of the [[emancipation of women|women's emancipation movement]], which started in Turkey in the early 1920s.

Atat\u00fcrk asked Latife to go to Angora<!--Use \"Angora\" in English until 1930, then switch to Ankara from that point-->, with his trusted ADC Salih Bozok. They were divorced on 5 August 1925. The circumstances of their divorce remain publicly unknown. A 25-year-old court order banned the publishing of his former wife's diaries and letters, which might have contained information on the matter.

In 1933, the US ambassador [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Charles H. Sherrill]] interviewed him. In the interview, he said it was good for mankind to pray to God. According to Atat\u00fcrk, the Turkish people do not know what Islam really is and do not read the [[Quran]]. People are influenced by Arabic sentences that they do not understand, and because of their customs they go to mosques. When the Turks read the Quran and think about it, they will leave Islam.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170722130231/http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/ataturk-islam-icin-ne-dusunuyordu-791000/ Atat\u00fcrk \u0130slam i\u00e7in ne d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcn\u00fcyordu?]</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he underwent religious training, though it was brief. His military training included religious imprinting. He knew the Arabic language well enough to understand and interpret the Quran. He studied the \"History of Islam\" by [[Leone Caetani]] and the \"History of Islamic Civilisation\" by [[Jurji Zaydan]]. He authored the chapter in \"Islamic History\" himself when he wanted history books for high schools prepared. Atat\u00fcrk's religious knowledge was considerably high in its nature and level.<ref name=\"ethem\">Ethem Ruhi F\u0131\u011flal\u0131 (1993) \"Atat\u00fcrk and the Religion of Islam\" Atat\u00fcrk Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Merkezi Dergisi, Say\u0131 26, Cilt: IX.</ref>\n\n===General perception===\nAtat\u00fcrk believed that religion is an important institution:<blockquote>Religion is an important institution. A nation without religion cannot survive. Yet it is also very important to note that religion is a link between Allah and the individual believer. The brokerage of the pious cannot be permitted. Those who use religion for their own benefit are detestable. We are against such a situation and will not allow it. Those who use religion in such a manner have fooled our people; it is against just such people that we have fought and will continue to fight. Know that whatever conforms to reason, logic, and the advantages and needs of our people conforms equally to Islam. If our religion did not conform to reason and logic, it would not be the perfect religion, the final religion.<ref>Ahmet Taner K\u0131\u015flal\u0131 \"Kemalizm, Laiklik ve Demokrasi [Kemalism, Laicism and Democracy]\" 1994</ref></blockquote>However, his speeches and publications criticized using religion as a political ideology.<ref name=\"ethem\" /> According to him, \"Religions have been basis of the [[tyranny]] of kings and [[sultan]]s.\"<ref>''Meden\u00ee Bilgiler ve M.

The problem was not religion, but how believers understood and applied religion. True religion could not be understood as long as [[false prophet]]s isolated and religious knowledge is enlightened. The only way to deal with false prophets was to deal with the Turkish people's illiteracy and prejudice.<ref>''Nutuk'', vol. 11, p. 708.</ref>\n\n===Religion and the individual===\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Selimiye Camii'nde (25 Aral\u0131k 1930).png|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk visits [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]], [[Edirne]] on 25 December 1930]]\nReligion, particularly [[Islam]], was between an individual and God in Atat\u00fcrk's eyes.<ref>F\u0131\u011flal\u0131 \"Atat\u00fcrk and the Religion of Islam\"; \"But to mention that religion is a matter of relationship and communication between Allah and his servant\" [recited from K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali, Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Hususiyetleri, Ankara, 1930, p. 116]</ref> When compared to Ottoman practice (political Islam integrated to government life through [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millets]]), Atat\u00fcrk believed in a form of reformed Islam (Islam between an individual and God). He believed it was possible to blend native tradition (based on Islam) and [[Western civilization|Western]] modernism harmoniously.<ref name=\"Jacob\"/> In this equation, he gave more emphasis towards the modernization. His modernization aimed to transform social and mental structures (native traditions of Islam) to eradicate the irrational ideas, magical superstitions and so on.<ref name=\"Jacob\"/>\n\nAtat\u00fcrk was not against religion but what he perceived as all Ottoman religious and cultural elements that brought limits to people's self being.<ref name=\"Jacob\">{{cite book|author=Jacob M.

He viewed civil law and abolition of the caliphate as required for reflection of individual choices. He perceived religion as a matter of conscience or worship, but not politics. The best response on this issue comes from himself:{{Cquote|Religion is a matter of conscience. One is always free to act according to the will of one's conscience. We (as a nation) are respectful of religion. It is not our intention to curtail freedom of worship, but rather to ensure that matters of religion and those of the state do not become intertwined.<ref>M.Orhan Tarhan \"Should Government Teach Religion?\" The Atat\u00fcrk Society of America</ref>}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk believed in [[freedom of religion]], but he was a secular thinker and his concept of freedom of religion was not limitless. He differentiated between social and personal practice of religion. He applied social considerations (secular requirements) when the public practice of religion was considered. He said that no one can force another to accept any religion or a sect ([[freedom of belief]]).<ref>K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali, Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Hususiyetleri, Ankara, 1930, p. 57</ref> Also, everyone has the right to perform or neglect, if he so wishes, obligations of any religion he chooses ([[freedom of worship]]), such as the right to not [[Sawm of Ramadan|fast]] during [[Ramadan]].<ref>A.

It is normal that this perspective was adapted, Karpat says: \"He was not against Islam, but those who are against his political power using the religious arguments.\"<ref name=\"Karpat\"/>\n\n[[Andrew Mango]] wrote in his book ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey'' (1999):\n{{Cquote|I have no religion, and at times I wish all religions at the bottom of the sea. He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap. My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go.

His personal life has been the subject of numerous studies. According to Turkish historian [[Kemal H. Karpat]], Atat\u00fcrk's recent bibliography included 7,010 different sources.<ref name=\"Karpat\">Karpat, \"The Personality of Atat\u00fcrk\", pp. 893\u201399.</ref> Atat\u00fcrk's personal life has its controversies, ranging from where he was born to his correct full name. The details of his marriage have always been a subject of debate. His religious beliefs were discussed in Turkish political life as recently as the [[Republic protests]] during the [[2007 Turkish presidential election|2007 presidential election]].\n\nMustafa Kemal's personality has been an important subject both for scholars and the general public.<ref name=\"Karpat\"/> Much of substantial personal information about him comes from memoirs by his associates, who were at times his rivals, and friends. Some credible information originates from [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy]], [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir]], [[Halide Edib Ad\u0131var]], [[Ali K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7|K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali]], [[Falih R\u0131fk\u0131 Atay]], [[Afet \u0130nan]], there is also secondary analysis by [[Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|Patrick Balfour, the 3rd Baron Kinross]], and, most recently, [[Vam\u0131k Volkan|Vam\u0131k D. Volkan]] and [[Norman Itzkowitz]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Name==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2015}}\nIn Turkish tradition, names have additional honorary or memorial values besides their grammatical identification function. It is possible to translate a name from Turkish to other languages, but care should be given as names' form varies from one language to another. Atat\u00fcrk had [[Mustafa]] as his [[name at birth]]. Mustafa ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649}} \u2013 ''Mu\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101'', \"the chosen one\"), an [[epithet]] of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], was a common name at that time. Young Mustafa studied at Salonica Military School, the military junior high school in Salonica (now [[Thessaloniki]] in modern [[Greece]]), where his mathematics teacher Captain \u00dcsk\u00fcpl\u00fc Mustafa Sabri Bey gave him the additional name \"Kemal\" (\"perfection\") because of his student's academic excellence.<ref>Carl Cavanagh Hodge, Encyclopedia of the Age of Imperialism, 1800\u20131914, p. 393; {{ISBN|978-0-313-33404-7}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 November 1911, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of [[Binba\u015f\u0131]], an Ottoman military rank denoting the commander of \"a thousand soldiers,\" equivalent to the rank of Major in the modern Turkish army. Since, in Ottoman military ranks, \"[[Bey]]\" was a common title given to all ranks for Binba\u015f\u0131 and above, Mustafa Kemal Efendi, henceforth, was addressed as \"Mustafa Kemal Bey\". On 1 April 1916, Mustafa Kemal was promoted to the rank of [[Mirliva]], equivalent to [[Major General]] today. In Ottoman military ranks, [[Pasha]] was a common title given to all ranks at and above Mirliva, and he was from then on addressed as \"Mustafa Kemal Pasha\" ({{lang-tr|Pa\u015fa}}).\n\nKemal Pasha, disgusted by the capitulations and concessions made by the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] to the Allies, and by the occupation of [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (known as [[Istanbul]] in English since 1930) by the British, resigned from his post on 8 July 1919. He escaped from Istanbul by sea, passing through British [[Royal Navy]] patrols and landing on the [[Black Sea]] port city of [[Samsun]], to organize the resistance against the Allied Powers' occupation of Anatolia. After his resignation, the [[Sublime Porte]], the Ottoman imperial government, issued a warrant and later condemned him to death [[in absentia]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 19 September 1921, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Turkish Grand National Assembly]] presented him with the title of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Gazi]], which denotes, a combat or wounded veteran, with the religious connotation of defeating non-Islamic forces, and bestowed upon him the rank of [[Marshal]] for his achievements during the [[Turkish Independence War|War of Independence]]. Henceforth, he'd be addressed as \"Gazi Mustafa Kemal\".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nOn 21 June 1934, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] recognized the need for registration and use of fixed hereditary surnames. The [[Surname Law]] was proposed and later put into force. On 24 November 1934, the Assembly enacted a special law to bestow on Mustafa Kemal the surname \"Atat\u00fcrk,\" which translates as \"Father of the Turks,\"<ref name=\"Ataturk\">Turkish Justice Department website, Article Ataturk</ref><ref>[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/turkey-abstract.html Profile], smithsonianmag.com. Retrieved 28 March 2015.</ref> and established \"Atat\u00fcrk\" as a unique surname.<ref group=note>The law stated that the surname \"Atat\u00fcrk\" may be used only by Gazi Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. The surname \"Atat\u00fcrk\" can be divided in two parts, \"Ata\" and \"T\u00fcrk,\" whereby \"Ata\" means \"father\" or \"ancestor\", while ''T\u00fcrk'' denotes simply \"Turk,\" the \"[[Turkish people]].\" Thus, \"Atat\u00fcrk\" best translates to \"Father of Turkish People\". The current common practice in Turkey as well as abroad is to refer to him as Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.</ref>\n\n===List of names and titles===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header = Atat\u00fcrk's identity documents after the Surname Law\n | image1 = Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn 993 814 seri numaral\u0131 n\u00fcfus c\u00fczdan\u0131.jpg\n | alt1 = Atat\u00fcrk's identity document from 1934\n | caption1 = 1934.

The Ottoman Empire recognized the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]] and the [[Rumi calendar]]. The Hijri was an Islamic calendar, used to mark the religious holidays. It was lunar, with years of 354 or 355 days. The Rumi was a civil calendar, adopted in 1839. It was solar, based on the [[Julian Calendar]]. Both counted time from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], the migration of [[Muhammad]] to [[Medina]]. Between the two calendars significant differences in elapsed time were present. Various reforms were made to reconcile them but typically there was always a difference.\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's birth date was recorded in the public records of Turkish [[Thessaloniki|Selanik]] as [[Anno Hegirae]] 1296 with no sign whether this was based on the Rumi or on the Hijri calendar. In view of this confusion Atat\u00fcrk set his own birthday to coincide with the Turkish Independence Day, which he announced was 19 May 1919, the day of his arrival in [[Samsun]], in a speech given in 1927. His identification with Independence Day implied his selection of the civil calendar, in which AH 1296 lasts from 13 March 1880 to 12 March 1881. The latter dates are in the [[Gregorian Calendar]] just adopted for the Republic by Atat\u00fcrk for purposes of standardization (the Julian Calendar was rejected earlier). Atat\u00fcrk therefore listed his own birthday in all documents official and unofficial as 19 May 1881.<ref>{{cite book|page=106|first=Erik Jan|last=Z\u00fcrcher|author-link=Erik-Jan Z\u00fcrcher|title=The Unionist factor: the r\u00f4le of the Committee of Union and Progress in the Turkish National Movement, 1905\u20131926|year=1984|location=Leiden|publisher=E.J. Brill}}</ref>\n\nAtat\u00fcrk was told by his mother that he was born on a spring day, but his younger sister Makbule Atadan was told by others that he was born at night during a thunderstorm.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Faik Re\u015fit Unat]] received differing responses from Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m's neighbors at Salonika. Some claimed that he was born on a spring day, but others stated on a winter day during either January or February. A date that has gained some acceptance is 19 May, a date which originated with the historian [[Re\u015fit Saffet Atabinen]]. 19 May is the symbolic start of the Turkish Independence War, and Atabinen linked Atat\u00fcrk's birth day to the start of the Independence War \u2013 a gesture which Atat\u00fcrk appreciated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} There was even a plan to establish a \"Gazi\" day. Another story about this date is that a teacher asked Atat\u00fcrk his birth date, that he responded he did not know it, and that the teacher suggested 19 May. Then again, there are two ways to interpret this; the \"Gregorian 19 May 1881\" would imply Rumi 1 March 1297, which conflicts with the only recorded information, Rumi 1296. It is also possible to say \"Rumi 19 May 1296\", which implies a date in the Gregorian year 1880.\n\nSome sources ignore the day and month altogether, and print his birth date as Gregorian 1880/81. Other claims are:\n# [[Enver Behnan \u015eapolyo]] claimed that Atat\u00fcrk was born on Gregorian 23 December 1880.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n# [[\u015eevket S\u00fcreyya Aydemir]] claimed that he was born on Gregorian 4 January 1881.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n# [[Muhtar Kumral]], former head of the Mustafa Kemal Association, claimed that he was born on Gregorian 13 March 1881, and stated they used Makbule Atadan. A conversion from Gregorian to Rumi sets the day in Rumi to 1 March 1297. The validity of this claim is questionable, since the written record states Rumi 1296, not 1297.<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\"/>\n# [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]] claimed that Atat\u00fcrk was born between 10 May and 20 May. He stated that this information was shared with Atat\u00fcrk, and that Atat\u00fcrk responded \"Why not May 19.\"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe memoirs of the Soviet diplomat [[Simon Aralov]] mention a conversation between Aralov and Atat\u00fcrk, where Aralov says he was born in 1880, and Atat\u00fcrk responds \"just like me\".{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's last official [[identity document]] ({{lang-tr|n\u00fcfus c\u00fczdan\u0131}}) does not include the day and month, but the year 1881 is visible.<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\"/> It is exhibited in the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum, \u015ei\u015fli|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]] in [[\u015ei\u015fli]].<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ahmetakyol.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=224&Itemid=45|title=Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Do\u011fum Tarihi|language=Turkish|accessdate=9 July 2011}}</ref> The Republic of Turkey announced 19 May 1881 officially to the public and diplomatically to other countries as his accepted birthday.<ref name=\"ahmetakyol.net\"/>\n\n==Nationality==\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] was not a [[national state]] and the records were not kept based on nationality, but on religion.

[[Russian history, 1855\u20131892|Russia was implementing reforms]]; Japan opened [[Foreign relations of Meiji Japan|its doors to the West]] during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The Ottoman Empire was going through transformation. [[Ottoman military reform efforts]], like the contemporaneous [[Modernization of Japanese Military 1868\u20131931]], managed to develop a modern army. Racial, regional, ethnic and national stereotypes were part of discourse throughout the world. Ottoman people were not immune to these developments and there was a [[rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThe Ottoman State had been weakened by Turkish Islamism. Conservatism was strong both in government and society. Although the empire was transforming itself, the [[Hippocratic school of medicine]], [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] and geography, and other branches of [[medieval studies]] were still in force. Many of these studies had been first amended, then discarded in western Europe with the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. Except for [[Military history of Europe|European military technology]], the penetration of European ideas and practices into Turkey was slow.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Preparatory school===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nAli R\u0131za Bey's desire was to send Atat\u00fcrk to the newly opened \u015eemsi Efendi School, which had a contemporary education program. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m wanted him to attend a traditional school. The traditional Muslim schools had programs based on mostly prayers and hymns. This caused arguments within the family. He first enrolled in a traditional religious school. He later switched to \u015eemsi Efendi School.\n\nIn 1888, Ali R\u0131za Efendi died at an age of 47. Atat\u00fcrk was 7 years old. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m was 31. Z\u00fcbeyde Han\u0131m and her two children lived with her brother H\u00fcseyin for a period. H\u00fcseyin was the manager of a farm outside Salonika.

It was a boarding school with dormitories within its premises. The military school was strictly controlled by [[Abdul Hamid II]]. Newspapers were not allowed in the school, and textbooks were the only accepted books. The school not only taught military skills but also religious practices and social work. The curriculum at this school demanded either donating money or working for charity.

There were two officer tracks in the Ottoman imperial army. One of them was the officers \"educated within the army itself\", ''Alayl\u0131'', and the other consisted of officers trained in modern military schools, ''Mektepli''. He was a \"school trained\" officer. School educated officers had a strong ideological imprint toward family and country, and he had shown tendencies toward both.

Their initial acquaintanceship period lasted a relatively short time as he had to return to Angora<!--Use Ankara after 1930--> (now Ankara) on 2 October. Kemal opened up his interest to Latife by asking her \"Don't go anywhere. Wait for me.\" On 29 January 1923, he arranged for the permission to marry from her family, with the assistance of the chief of staff [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]]. [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir]] was present at their wedding. These were not random decisions.\n\nIn Turkish culture, the groom asks his family or respected people, with whom he has close relationships, to perform this act. Latife did not cover her face during the wedding, though during this period it was the tradition for brides to do so. They did not have a honeymoon just after the wedding. The elections for the parliament were coming. He received the representatives of local newspapers next day of his wedding. He prepared for his public speech on 2 February. The honeymoon, an Anatolian tour, was a chance to show his wife's unveiled face as a role model for modern Turkish women. \"It's not just a honeymoon, it's a lesson in reform,\" one observer remarked.<ref name=\"latife1\"/>\n\nAs a [[First Lady]], she was part of the [[emancipation of women|women's emancipation movement]], which started in Turkey in the early 1920s.

Atat\u00fcrk asked Latife to go to Angora<!--Use \"Angora\" in English until 1930, then switch to Ankara from that point-->, with his trusted ADC Salih Bozok. They were divorced on 5 August 1925. The circumstances of their divorce remain publicly unknown.

In 1933, the US ambassador [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Charles H. Sherrill]] interviewed him. In the interview, he said it was good for mankind to pray to God. According to Atat\u00fcrk, the Turkish people do not know what Islam really is and do not read the [[Quran]]. People are influenced by Arabic sentences that they do not understand, and because of their customs they go to mosques. When the Turks read the Quran and think about it, they will leave Islam.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170722130231/http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/ataturk-islam-icin-ne-dusunuyordu-791000/ Atat\u00fcrk \u0130slam i\u00e7in ne d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcn\u00fcyordu?]</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he underwent religious training, though it was brief. His military training included religious imprinting. He knew the Arabic language well enough to understand and interpret the Quran. He studied the \"History of Islam\" by [[Leone Caetani]] and the \"History of Islamic Civilisation\" by [[Jurji Zaydan]]. He authored the chapter in \"Islamic History\" himself when he wanted history books for high schools prepared. Atat\u00fcrk's religious knowledge was considerably high in its nature and level.<ref name=\"ethem\">Ethem Ruhi F\u0131\u011flal\u0131 (1993) \"Atat\u00fcrk and the Religion of Islam\" Atat\u00fcrk Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Merkezi Dergisi, Say\u0131 26, Cilt: IX.</ref>\n\n===General perception===\nAtat\u00fcrk believed that religion is an important institution:<blockquote>Religion is an important institution. A nation without religion cannot survive. Yet it is also very important to note that religion is a link between Allah and the individual believer. The brokerage of the pious cannot be permitted. Those who use religion for their own benefit are detestable. We are against such a situation and will not allow it. Those who use religion in such a manner have fooled our people; it is against just such people that we have fought and will continue to fight. Know that whatever conforms to reason, logic, and the advantages and needs of our people conforms equally to Islam. If our religion did not conform to reason and logic, it would not be the perfect religion, the final religion.<ref>Ahmet Taner K\u0131\u015flal\u0131 \"Kemalizm, Laiklik ve Demokrasi [Kemalism, Laicism and Democracy]\" 1994</ref></blockquote>However, his speeches and publications criticized using religion as a political ideology.<ref name=\"ethem\" /> According to him, \"Religions have been basis of the [[tyranny]] of kings and [[sultan]]s.\"<ref>''Meden\u00ee Bilgiler ve M.

The problem was not religion, but how believers understood and applied religion. True religion could not be understood as long as [[false prophet]]s isolated and religious knowledge is enlightened. The only way to deal with false prophets was to deal with the Turkish people's illiteracy and prejudice.<ref>''Nutuk'', vol. 11, p. 708.</ref>\n\n===Religion and the individual===\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Selimiye Camii'nde (25 Aral\u0131k 1930).png|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk visits [[Selimiye Mosque, Edirne|Selimiye Mosque]], [[Edirne]] on 25 December 1930]]\nReligion, particularly [[Islam]], was between an individual and God in Atat\u00fcrk's eyes.<ref>F\u0131\u011flal\u0131 \"Atat\u00fcrk and the Religion of Islam\"; \"But to mention that religion is a matter of relationship and communication between Allah and his servant\" [recited from K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali, Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Hususiyetleri, Ankara, 1930, p. 116]</ref> When compared to Ottoman practice (political Islam integrated to government life through [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millets]]), Atat\u00fcrk believed in a form of reformed Islam (Islam between an individual and God). He believed it was possible to blend native tradition (based on Islam) and [[Western civilization|Western]] modernism harmoniously.<ref name=\"Jacob\"/> In this equation, he gave more emphasis towards the modernization. His modernization aimed to transform social and mental structures (native traditions of Islam) to eradicate the irrational ideas, magical superstitions and so on.<ref name=\"Jacob\"/>\n\nAtat\u00fcrk was not against religion but what he perceived as all Ottoman religious and cultural elements that brought limits to people's self being.<ref name=\"Jacob\">{{cite book|author=Jacob M.

He viewed civil law and abolition of the caliphate as required for reflection of individual choices. He perceived religion as a matter of conscience or worship, but not politics. The best response on this issue comes from himself:{{Cquote|Religion is a matter of conscience. One is always free to act according to the will of one's conscience. We (as a nation) are respectful of religion. It is not our intention to curtail freedom of worship, but rather to ensure that matters of religion and those of the state do not become intertwined.<ref>M.Orhan Tarhan \"Should Government Teach Religion?\" The Atat\u00fcrk Society of America</ref>}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk believed in [[freedom of religion]], but he was a secular thinker and his concept of freedom of religion was not limitless. He differentiated between social and personal practice of religion. He applied social considerations (secular requirements) when the public practice of religion was considered. He said that no one can force another to accept any religion or a sect ([[freedom of belief]]).<ref>K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali, Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Hususiyetleri, Ankara, 1930, p. 57</ref> Also, everyone has the right to perform or neglect, if he so wishes, obligations of any religion he chooses ([[freedom of worship]]), such as the right to not [[Sawm of Ramadan|fast]] during [[Ramadan]].<ref>A.

It is normal that this perspective was adapted, Karpat says: \"He was not against Islam, but those who are against his political power using the religious arguments.\"<ref name=\"Karpat\"/>\n\n[[Andrew Mango]] wrote in his book ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey'' (1999):\n{{Cquote|I have no religion, and at times I wish all religions at the bottom of the sea. He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap. My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go.

Created in 1812 by German [[Geology|geologist]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Friedrich Mohs]], it is one of several definitions of [[Hardness comparison|hardness]] in [[materials science]], some of which are more quantitative.<ref name=Brit>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387714/Mohs-hardness \"Mohs hardness\"] in ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online''</ref> The method of comparing hardness by observing which minerals can scratch others is of great antiquity, having been mentioned by [[Theophrastus]] in his treatise ''On Stones'', {{circa|300 BC}}, followed by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'', {{circa|AD 77}}.<ref>[http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/theophrastus-on-stones/page_148/view?searchterm=scratch Theophrastus on Stones].

Non-Destructive Testing Resource Center</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nDespite its lack of precision, the Mohs scale is relevant for field geologists, who use the scale to roughly identify minerals using scratch kits. The Mohs scale hardness of minerals can be commonly found in reference sheets.\n\nMohs hardness is useful in [[Milling (machining)|milling]]. It allows assessment of which kind of mill will best reduce a given product whose hardness is known.<ref name=\"Milling1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Grinding_Milling.html | title=Size reduction, comminution - grinding and milling | publisher=PowderProcess.net | accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref> The scale is used at electronic manufacturers for testing the resilience of flat panel display components (such as cover glass for [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s or encapsulation for [[OLED]]s).\n\nAs an example, most modern smartphone displays use a glass panel that scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7 (on the Mohs scale of hardness).\n\n==Minerals==\nThe Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on the ability of one natural sample of mineral to scratch another mineral visibly. The samples of matter used by Mohs are all different minerals. Minerals are chemically pure solids found in nature. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. As the hardest known naturally occurring substance when the scale was designed, [[diamond]]s are at the top of the scale. The hardness of a material is measured against the scale by finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, or the softest material that can scratch the given material. For example, if some material is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on the Mohs scale would fall between 4 and 5.<ref>American Federation of Mineralogical Societies. [http://www.amfed.org/t_mohs.htm \"Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness\"]. amfed.org</ref> \"Scratching\" a material for the purposes of the Mohs scale means creating non-elastic dislocations visible to the naked eye. Frequently, materials that are lower on the Mohs scale can create microscopic, non-elastic dislocations on materials that have a higher Mohs number. While these microscopic dislocations are permanent and sometimes detrimental to the harder material's structural integrity, they are not considered \"scratches\" for the determination of a Mohs scale number.<ref>Geels, Kay. [http://www.struers.com/resources/elements/12/2474/35art2.pdf \"The True Microstructure of Materials\"], pp. 5\u201313 in ''Materialographic Preparation from Sorby to the Present''. Struers A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark</ref>\n\nThe Mohs scale is a purely [[ordinal scale]].

Non-Destructive Testing Resource Center</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nDespite its lack of precision, the Mohs scale is relevant for field geologists, who use the scale to roughly identify minerals using scratch kits. The Mohs scale hardness of minerals can be commonly found in reference sheets.\n\nMohs hardness is useful in [[Milling (machining)|milling]]. It allows assessment of which kind of mill will best reduce a given product whose hardness is known.<ref name=\"Milling1\">{{cite web | url=http://www.powderprocess.net/Grinding_Milling.html | title=Size reduction, comminution - grinding and milling | publisher=PowderProcess.net | accessdate=27 October 2017}}</ref> The scale is used at electronic manufacturers for testing the resilience of flat panel display components (such as cover glass for [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]s or encapsulation for [[OLED]]s).\n\nAs an example, most modern smartphone displays use a glass panel that scratches at level 6 with deeper grooves at level 7 (on the Mohs scale of hardness).\n\n==Minerals==\nThe Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based on the ability of one natural sample of mineral to scratch another mineral visibly. The samples of matter used by Mohs are all different minerals. Minerals are chemically pure solids found in nature. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. As the hardest known naturally occurring substance when the scale was designed, [[diamond]]s are at the top of the scale. The hardness of a material is measured against the scale by finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, or the softest material that can scratch the given material. For example, if some material is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on the Mohs scale would fall between 4 and 5.<ref>American Federation of Mineralogical Societies. [http://www.amfed.org/t_mohs.htm \"Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness\"]. amfed.org</ref> \"Scratching\" a material for the purposes of the Mohs scale means creating non-elastic dislocations visible to the naked eye. Frequently, materials that are lower on the Mohs scale can create microscopic, non-elastic dislocations on materials that have a higher Mohs number. While these microscopic dislocations are permanent and sometimes detrimental to the harder material's structural integrity, they are not considered \"scratches\" for the determination of a Mohs scale number.<ref>Geels, Kay. [http://www.struers.com/resources/elements/12/2474/35art2.pdf \"The True Microstructure of Materials\"], pp. 5\u201313 in ''Materialographic Preparation from Sorby to the Present''. Struers A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark</ref>\n\nThe Mohs scale is a purely [[ordinal scale]]. For example, [[corundum]] (9) is twice as hard as [[topaz]] (8), but diamond (10) is four times as hard as corundum.

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

Fearing that the interstate's construction would upset the park's fragile ecological balance, environmentalists, backed by the organization [[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park]], waged a 12-year legal battle to prevent highway construction in the park, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe]]''. The Supreme Court remanded the case to the District Court for further review, and it ruled that the highway commission had not adequately explored alternative routes. In 1981, the highway commission abandoned plans to route I-40 through Overton Park, and instead redesignated the northern portion of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]] as I-40.<ref>{{harvp|Moore|1994|pp=112\u2013113}}.</ref> For over 20 years, I-40 signage existed on the dead-end route toward Overton Park.

Additional aspects of this project included the widening of I-40 between the interchange and Covington Pike, which required the replacement of the Wolf River Bridge with a 14-lane bridge, widening of I-240, addition of through lanes on Sam Cooper Boulevard, and reconfiguration of the Covington Pike interchange.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/i40-240memphis/ |author = <!--Not stated--> |date = 2013 |publisher = Tennessee Department of Transportation |access-date = 2020-02-16 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131013014809/http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/i40-240memphis/ |title = I-40/I-240 Interchange |archive-date = 2013-10-13 }}</ref> The project cost $109 million, which was at the time the highest bid project in TDOT history,<ref name=wreg13/> and was completed on December 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://dementconstruction.com/i-40-i-240-interchange-phase-ii/ |title = I-40 / I-240 Interchange \u2013 Phase II |author = <!--Not stated--> |date = 2016 |publisher = Dement Construction Company |access-date = 2020-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe interchange with the eastern terminus of I-240 near downtown Memphis was reconstructed between 2003 and 2006.

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 gas an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. At mile 340, the Interstate crosses into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit is 60&nbsp;mph to 70&nbsp;mph. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].
