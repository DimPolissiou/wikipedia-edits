In the cartoon [[Porky Pig]] is hunting and fires at several rabbits. Soon, Porky and his [[dog]] meet the rabbit and try to outwit him in the forest. Porky and the rabbit get in a long, long fight and soon the hare thinks he has won and that the war is over; Porky, however, finds the rabbit and the Bunny doesn't have any [[brainstorming|brainstorms]] to protect him. The rabbit shows Porky a photo of himself and of how many [[children]] he has with his [[wife]]. However, when Porky's about to shoot him, the [[gun]] fails.\n\nAfter Porky attempts to shoot down and procure the rabbit, the [[rabbit]] asks Porky: \"Do you have a [[hunting]] [[license]]?\" As Porky reaches for his [[pocket]] to obtain the [[document]], the [[Hyperactivity|hyper]]-hare suddenly snatches it out of Porky's grasp, rips it in two, remarks, \"Well you haven't got one now...hoohoohoohoohahahahah..hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha!\" and makes a getaway by twisting his ears as though they were a [[helicopter]] [[propeller]], flying away. Ultimately the rabbit wins when Porky throws [[dynamite]] into the cave in which the hare is hiding and the rabbit throws the dynamite back at him. Porky is in the [[hospital]] and the rabbit comes to him with some [[flowers]]. Porky tells the hare that he'll be out in a few days. The very hyper rabbit then pulls on the [[Traction (orthopedics)|leg holders]] in Porky's [[bed]], adding to the [[pig]]'s injuries, and runs off into the [[forest]].\n\n=== Prest-O Change-O ===\n{{main|Prest-O Change-O}}\nLeon Schlesinger gave [[Chuck Jones]] the next cartoon, ''Prest-O Change-O'' (March 25, 1939). In this cartoon two rogue [[dog]]s are being pursued by a [[Animal control officer|dog catcher]] until they hide in an abandoned house. There they encounter a trunk owned by Sham-Fu the magician (unseen). They open it, and all manner of magic tricks come out of the trunk, including his pet rabbit. The rabbit tricks the two dogs repeatedly, causing them endless frustration, until he is bested by the bigger of the two dogs, who bops him with a lampshade.\n\n=== Hare-um Scare-um ===\n{{main|Hare-um Scare-um}}\nLeon got Hardaway/[[Cal Dalton|Dalton]] to direct the next short, ''Hare-um Scare-um'' (August 12, 1939). It starts with a man reading a newspaper article stating that meat prices have soared (and that customers are sore). Angry, he declares that he'll hunt his own meat to get back at the government for the price inflation. He then tells his dog he is going hunting for rabbits.\n\nA rabbit lays a trap for the dog, and the dog gets scared of the sound. The bunny then plays \"Guess Who\" with the dog, with the dog answering in barks. The hunter then sees rabbits, aims his gun, then runs over to where it was. When he gets there, there is a spinning wheel with rabbit signs. The hunter then sees the hare sleeping. The hunter starts pouring salt on the rabbit's tail, but the rabbit quickly changes position so that the hunter is salting a [[celery]] stalk instead. The rabbit starts eating it and says, \"Celery, mighty fine nerve tonic. Boy, have I got nerve.\" \n\nThe hare runs in a cave, and the hunter runs after him. Before he reaches the cave, an elevator appears and the hunter collides with it. The rabbit then opens it and says, \"Main floor, leather goods, pottery, washing machines and aspirin, going up!\" and closes it as the elevator goes up. The elevator floor goes back down, the hare opens it and says, \"You don't have to be crazy to do this \u2026 but it sure helps,\" closes it and the elevator goes down. The bunny then dresses in girl-dog drag. The dog then sees the rabbit in drag; he thinks it's a dog, then he notices it's the rabbit. \n\nThe hare then pretends he's a policeman, and the hunter then finds the rabbit. He explains to the hunter how poor he is. He then shocks the hunter, who falls to the ground. The hunter then tells the now-hiding hare he can whip the rabbit and his whole family, then he's suddenly surrounded by a lot of rabbits that look like the first rabbit.\n\n=== Jones' \"Elmer and rabbit\" cartoons ===\nJones directed the next experimental cartoon, ''[[Elmer's Candid Camera]]'' (March 2, 1940, First Official [[Elmer Fudd]]). In this cartoon, Elmer has come to the country to photograph wildlife. As he tries to photograph a rabbit, the rabbit finds him a convenient victim to harass. This tormenting eventually drives Elmer insane, causing him to jump into a lake and nearly drown. The rabbit saves him, ensures that Elmer is all right now - and then kicks him straight back into the lake.\n\nThis was followed by [[Tex Avery]]'s final-design setting ''[[A Wild Hare]]'', but that was itself followed by one more cartoon to the same effect as ''...Camera'', that was inadvertently produced first before the former. ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'' (January 4, 1941), originally intended and meant to be the final experimental cartoon, bore a title card shoehorned in between the opening credits and the start of the story reading, \"Starring Bugs Bunny\" (the first on-screen use of that name), but nevertheless featured the same initial off-model versions of Elmer and the hare seen in ''...Camera''. Here, Elmer goes to a pet shop and buys a rabbit that promptly proceeds to turn his life upside down.\n\n==Cameos==\n*The rabbit made two cameos in 1939 and 1940, both starring Porky and both by [[Robert Clampett]]. The two cameos were ''[[Patient Porky]]'' and ''[[Naughty Neighbors (film)|Naughty Neighbors]]''.\n*In the [[Touchstone Pictures]] and [[Amblin Entertainment]] film, ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', the character can be seen walking through the Maroon Cartoon studio lot for three-quarters of a second before the shot changes.\n*In a deleted sequence from the film ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'', Bugs Bunny, upon being zapped by a magical idol, transforms into the character. This sequence can be seen in the \"Deleted Scenes\" featurette on the DVD release.\n\n== Bugs arrives ==\n''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (July 27, 1940) was the debut of Bugs Bunny as he is well-known today. [[Tex Avery]] changed several of the rabbit's characteristics: his voice became a cross between the Bronx and Brooklyn accents, the color of his gloves became white, as did the color of his mouth, and his ears were changed slightly as well. It is worth noting, however, that ''[[Patient Porky]]'' (September 14, 1940) featured a cameo by this prototype Bugs Bunny.\n\nThe cartoon was so successful that WB decided to keep him on as a recurring character, eventually becoming the studio's most popular cartoon character. The character's name, previously only used on model sheets, became the official all-purpose name as well, with one modification: the apostrophe was dropped from his first name (now pronounced \"bugs\" rather than \"bugs-es\"). A title card saying \"featuring Bugs Bunny\" was slapped onto ''[[Elmer's Pet Rabbit]]'' after initial production of that cartoon wrapped up, though that cartoon had the rabbit carry the pre-''Wild Hare'' characteristics.\n\nBugs Bunny's personality continued to evolve over the years, from a largely \"screwball\" character (a la [[Daffy Duck]]), to a mixture of \"screwball\" and \"everyman\" characteristics. His definitive design was created in 1943 by [[Bob Clampett]], who requested one of his animators, Bob McKimson, to create new model sheets of Bugs for the short ''[[Tortoise Wins by a Hare]]''. Bugs' define look would be adopted by each unit slowly (though [[Chuck Jones]], [[Robert McKimson]] and [[Friz Freleng]] had slight variations). Bugs' look was slightly modified again for the 2011 series ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' and yet again for the 2015 series ''[[Wabbit (TV series)|Wabbit]]''.\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n{{Looney Tunes & Merrie Melodies}}\n{{Warner Bros. cartoons}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional hares and rabbits]]\n[[Category:Looney Tunes characters]]\n[[Category:History of animation]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Happy Rabbit\n| series             = \n| franchise          = \n| image              = \n| alt                = \n| caption            = A depiction of Bugs throughout the years..\n| first_major        = \n| first_minor        = \n| first_issue        = \n| first_date         = \n| last_major         = \n| last_minor         = \n| last_issue         = \n| last_date          = \n| first              = ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]'' (April 30, 1938)\n| firstgame          = \n| last               = ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (July 27, 1940)\n| creator            = [[Ben Hardaway]]<br />(character)<br />[[Cal Dalton]]<br />(first design)<br />[[Charles Thorson]]<br />(second design)\n| adapted_by         = \n| portrayer          = \n| voice              = [[Mel Blanc]] (1938-1940)<br>Ben Hardaway (1938)<ref>[https://www.newsfromme.com/pov/col295/ \"Point of View: Moose and Squirrel\"].

While Bugs is commonly referred to as \"Happy Rabbit\", animation historian [[David Gerstein]] disputes this, saying that the only usage of the term was from [[Mel Blanc]] himself; the name \"Bugs Bunny\" was used as early as August 1939, in the [[Motion Picture Herald]], in a review for the short ''[[Hare-um Scare-um]]''.<ref>[https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/fr/cp0/e15/q65/29063817_10155118585791736_588041259190017920_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&efg=eyJpIjoidCJ9&oh=0b5e3d028ec9db5a26026dec84ed71ee&oe=5B3A7194 Motion Picture Herald: August 12, 1939]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \"...With gun and determination, he takes to the field and tracks his prey in the zany person of \"Bugs\" Bunny, a true lineal descendant of the original Mad Hatter if there ever was one...\"</ref>\n\nSeveral published first person accounts, encyclopedic references, and Warner Bros.' own published material describe the inception of the name and of the character.  A model sheet by [[Charlie Thorson]] describes this prototype character as \"Bugs' Bunny\" (note the apostrophe) but in most of the cartoons the character is unnamed.\n\n[[Virgil Ross]], the animator for ''A Wild Hare'' describes how the character came to be named in the interview published by ''Animato!'' magazine #19.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bugshardaway.blogspot.com/2007/10/virgil-ross-interview-in-animato-19.html|title=The Birth of Bugs Bunny: Virgil Ross interview in Animato! #19, Virgil recalls Bugs' Bunny, the drawing by Hardaway chosen as the model for the personality of the character.|first=Seattle|last=Chef|date=22 October 2007|publisher=}}</ref> [[Mel Blanc]] often told the story of the creation of the character and its name.

In the cartoon [[Porky Pig]] is hunting and fires at several rabbits. Soon, Porky and his [[dog]] meet the rabbit and try to outwit him in the forest. Porky and the rabbit get in a long, long fight and soon the hare thinks he has won and that the war is over; Porky, however, finds the rabbit and the Bunny doesn't have any [[brainstorming|brainstorms]] to protect him.
