The bull of 1 January 1586, published on 15 April 1586, was approved by [[Pope Sixtus&nbsp;V]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06733d.htm|title=University of Graz|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)|date=1909|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> For most of its existence it was controlled by the Catholic Church, and was closed in 1782 by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a ''lyceum'', where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-instituted as a university by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], thus gaining the name ''Karl-Franzens-Universit\u00e4t'', meaning ''Charles Francis University''. Over 30,000 students are currently enrolled at the university.\n\nThe university is divided into six faculties, the two largest are the Faculty of [[Arts]] and [[Humanities]] and the Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]]. The other faculties are the Faculty of [[Law]]; the Faculty of Business, Economic and [[Social sciences]]; the Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences; and the Faculty of  [[Catholic]] [[Theology]]. The Faculty of Medicine was separated from the university by state legislation in 2004 and became an independent university \u2013 the [[Medical University of Graz]]. The faculties offer a wide range of undergraduate (BA, BSc), graduate (MA, MSc), and doctoral degree (PhD) programmes, as well as special teaching degrees in their specific areas of expertise.\n\nSince its re-installation, the university has been home to many internationally renowned scientists and thinkers. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] was professor at the university twice, first from 1869 to 1873 and then from 1876 to 1890, while he was developing his statistical theory of heat. Nobel Laureate [[Otto Loewi]] taught at the university from 1909 till 1938 and [[Victor Franz Hess]] (Nobel prize 1936) graduated in Graz and taught there from 1920 to 1931 and from 1937 to 1938. The physicist [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] briefly was chancellor of the university in 1936.\n\nThe University of Graz does not have a distinct faculty of engineering, however, [[Graz University of Technology]], which is focused on engineering and technology, offers inter-university undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in cooperation with the university's Faculty of Natural Sciences under the name \"NAWI Graz\". The main intention behind the cooperation was to avoid duplication of efforts and infrastructure, especially in cost-intensive subjects such as chemistry, industrial chemistry, physics, and geosciences, as both universities are located in close proximity to each other. Students enrolled in one of these programmes attend lectures and seminars at both universities and are awarded a combined degree at the end of their studies.\n\nBecause of the university's geographical location close to the Slovenian border and the two major Slovenian cities, [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]], it has traditionally attracted many students from Slovenia and served as a gateway to South-East Europe for Austrian scholars, scientists and businesses. The establishment of the Department for Slovene Language and Literature at the University of Graz, for example, laid the foundation for scholarly studies of Slovenian culture, literature, and language bundled in the so-called [[Slovene studies]].<ref>{{in lang|sl}}http://london.veleposlanistvo.si/index.php?id=3162</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, the University was implicated in a breach of confidentiality and defamation lawsuit in The Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Paginas/Universiteit-Leiden-heeft-in-sollicitatieprocedure-onrechtmatig-gehandeld.aspx|title=Universiteit Leiden heeft in sollicitatieprocedure onrechtmatig gehandeld|website=www.rechtspraak.nl|language=nl|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref> A Graz professor of Applied Linguistics, Ineke Mennen, conspired to defame an applicant to the role of Professor English Linguistics at Leiden University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vyvevans.net/court-case-evans-vs-leiden|title=Court case: Evans vs Leiden {{!}} Professor Vyvyan Evans {{!}} Official Website {{!}} Language & Communication|website=vyv-evans|language=en|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>   A letter on Graz University's letterhead was submitted illegally by Professor Mennen to Leiden University, which led to Leiden University being convicted in the High Court, in the Hague.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leidschdagblad.nl/cnt/dmf20190620_77785363/universiteit-leiden-veroordeeld-wegens-benadeling-sollicitant-taalkundige-vyvyan-evans-heeft-recht-op-schadevergoeding|title=Universiteit Leiden veroordeeld wegens benadeling sollicitant: taalkundige Vyvyan Evans heeft recht op schadevergoeding|last=Simons|first=Wilfred|website=Leidschdagblad|language=nl-BE|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\n==International acclaim==\n[[File:Graz University main-front.jpg|thumb|right|Historic central building on the main campus]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[College and university rankings|World university rankings]]\n|-\n|  [[CWTS Leiden Ranking|Leiden Ranking]] || 758\n|-\n|  [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] || 501\u2013600 <ref>{{cite web|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017Candidates.html|publisher=ShanghaiRanking Cosultancy|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] || 401\u2013500 <ref>{{cite web|title=World University Rankings 2018|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-graz|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[QS World University Rankings]] || 561\u2013570\n|}\n\nThe university ranks highest in Arts and Humanities, coming 287th in the 2018 [[QS World University Rankings]], whereas all other subject areas lag behind, with the Faculty of Social Sciences ranking at 451\u2013500 and the Faculty of Natural Sciences ranking at 401\u2013450.<ref>https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2018</ref>\n\n== Religious affiliation ==\n[[File:University Graz.jpg|thumb|left|Front view of the central building.]]\n\nHistorically speaking, for most of its existence the University of Graz was controlled by the [[Catholic Church]]. Even after its re-installation in 1827, it took until 1848 for the university's basic principles to be readjusted in accordance with the ideals of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], meaning that the university became autonomous from the state as well as from the church and their influence as far as possible.<ref name=\"history title=History of the University of Graz publisher=University of Graz url=http://archiv.uni-graz.at/de/geschichte/geschichte-der-universitaet\">History of the University of Graz</ref> The Faculty of Catholic Theology has been retained as a part of the university ever since it was established, however, its importance in terms of number of students and its influence on the university board have been diminishing. Evidently, relations between the Catholic Church, especially the local bishop, and the university's Faculty of Theology remain strong, yet general policy is not influenced by these connections. To demonstrate the university's independence and its shift of focus, the [[Holy Name of Jesus|Christogram]] IHS on the very top of the university's seal has been replaced with the sun, symbolising the Enlightenment and von Humboldt's ideas.<ref name=\"motto/hymn\">{{cite web| title = The university's symbols: Coat of arms and hymn | publisher = University of Graz | url =

The bull of 1 January 1586, published on 15 April 1586, was approved by [[Pope Sixtus&nbsp;V]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06733d.htm|title=University of Graz|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)|date=1909|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> For most of its existence it was controlled by the Catholic Church, and was closed in 1782 by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a ''lyceum'', where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-instituted as a university by Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], thus gaining the name ''Karl-Franzens-Universit\u00e4t'', meaning ''Charles Francis University''. Over 30,000 students are currently enrolled at the university.\n\nThe university is divided into six faculties, the two largest are the Faculty of [[Arts]] and [[Humanities]] and the Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]]. The other faculties are the Faculty of [[Law]]; the Faculty of Business, Economic and [[Social sciences]]; the Faculty of Environmental, Regional and Educational Sciences; and the Faculty of  [[Catholic]] [[Theology]]. The Faculty of Medicine was separated from the university by state legislation in 2004 and became an independent university \u2013 the [[Medical University of Graz]]. The faculties offer a wide range of undergraduate (BA, BSc), graduate (MA, MSc), and doctoral degree (PhD) programmes, as well as special teaching degrees in their specific areas of expertise.\n\nSince its re-installation, the university has been home to many internationally renowned scientists and thinkers. [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] was professor at the university twice, first from 1869 to 1873 and then from 1876 to 1890, while he was developing his statistical theory of heat. Nobel Laureate [[Otto Loewi]] taught at the university from 1909 till 1938 and [[Victor Franz Hess]] (Nobel prize 1936) graduated in Graz and taught there from 1920 to 1931 and from 1937 to 1938. The physicist [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] briefly was chancellor of the university in 1936.\n\nThe University of Graz does not have a distinct faculty of engineering, however, [[Graz University of Technology]], which is focused on engineering and technology, offers inter-university undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in cooperation with the university's Faculty of Natural Sciences under the name \"NAWI Graz\". The main intention behind the cooperation was to avoid duplication of efforts and infrastructure, especially in cost-intensive subjects such as chemistry, industrial chemistry, physics, and geosciences, as both universities are located in close proximity to each other. Students enrolled in one of these programmes attend lectures and seminars at both universities and are awarded a combined degree at the end of their studies.\n\nBecause of the university's geographical location close to the Slovenian border and the two major Slovenian cities, [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]], it has traditionally attracted many students from Slovenia and served as a gateway to South-East Europe for Austrian scholars, scientists and businesses. The establishment of the Department for Slovene Language and Literature at the University of Graz, for example, laid the foundation for scholarly studies of Slovenian culture, literature, and language bundled in the so-called [[Slovene studies]].<ref>{{in lang|sl}}http://london.veleposlanistvo.si/index.php?id=3162</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, the University was implicated in a breach of confidentiality and defamation lawsuit in The Netherlands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rechtspraak.nl/Paginas/Universiteit-Leiden-heeft-in-sollicitatieprocedure-onrechtmatig-gehandeld.aspx|title=Universiteit Leiden heeft in sollicitatieprocedure onrechtmatig gehandeld|website=www.rechtspraak.nl|language=nl|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref> A Graz professor of Applied Linguistics, Ineke Mennen, conspired to defame an applicant to the role of Professor English Linguistics at Leiden University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vyvevans.net/court-case-evans-vs-leiden|title=Court case: Evans vs Leiden {{!}} Professor Vyvyan Evans {{!}} Official Website {{!}} Language & Communication|website=vyv-evans|language=en|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>   A letter on Graz University's letterhead was submitted illegally by Professor Mennen to Leiden University, which led to Leiden University being convicted in the High Court, in the Hague.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leidschdagblad.nl/cnt/dmf20190620_77785363/universiteit-leiden-veroordeeld-wegens-benadeling-sollicitant-taalkundige-vyvyan-evans-heeft-recht-op-schadevergoeding|title=Universiteit Leiden veroordeeld wegens benadeling sollicitant: taalkundige Vyvyan Evans heeft recht op schadevergoeding|last=Simons|first=Wilfred|website=Leidschdagblad|language=nl-BE|access-date=2019-06-22}}</ref>\n\n==International acclaim==\n[[File:Graz University main-front.jpg|thumb|right|Historic central building on the main campus]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[College and university rankings|World university rankings]]\n|-\n|  [[CWTS Leiden Ranking|Leiden Ranking]] || 758\n|-\n|  [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] || 501\u2013600 <ref>{{cite web|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2017|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2017Candidates.html|publisher=ShanghaiRanking Cosultancy|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] || 401\u2013500 <ref>{{cite web|title=World University Rankings 2018|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-graz|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[QS World University Rankings]] || 561\u2013570\n|}\n\nThe university ranks highest in Arts and Humanities, coming 287th in the 2018 [[QS World University Rankings]], whereas all other subject areas lag behind, with the Faculty of Social Sciences ranking at 451\u2013500 and the Faculty of Natural Sciences ranking at 401\u2013450.<ref>https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings/2018</ref>\n\n== Religious affiliation ==\n[[File:University Graz.jpg|thumb|left|Front view of the central building.]]\n\nHistorically speaking, for most of its existence the University of Graz was controlled by the [[Catholic Church]]. Even after its re-installation in 1827, it took until 1848 for the university's basic principles to be readjusted in accordance with the ideals of [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], meaning that the university became autonomous from the state as well as from the church and their influence as far as possible.<ref name=\"history title=History of the University of Graz publisher=University of Graz url=http://archiv.uni-graz.at/de/geschichte/geschichte-der-universitaet\">History of the University of Graz</ref> The Faculty of Catholic Theology has been retained as a part of the university ever since it was established, however, its importance in terms of number of students and its influence on the university board have been diminishing.

To demonstrate the university's independence and its shift of focus, the [[Holy Name of Jesus|Christogram]] IHS on the very top of the university's seal has been replaced with the sun, symbolising the

{"title_page": "Agrarianism", "text_new": "{{short description|Political ideology supporting rural society}}\n'''Agrarianism''' is a [[social philosophy]] or [[political philosophy]] which relates to the ownership and use of land for farming, or relating to the part of a society or economy that is tied to agriculture. Agrarianism and Agrarians will typically advocate on behalf of farmers and those in rural communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agrarianism |title=Definition of agrarianism |last= |first= |date= |website=merriam-webster.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020|quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/agrarian |title=Definition of\u2004'agrarian' |last= |first= |date= |website=collinsdictionary.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> While there are many schools of thought within Agrarianism, historically a reoccurring feature of Agrarians has been a commitment to [[Egalitarianism]], with Agrarian political parties normally supporting the rights of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society.      \n\n== Philosophy ==\nSome scholars suggest that Agrarianism values rural society as superior to urban society and the independent farmer as superior to the paid worker, and sees farming as a way of life that can shape the ideal social values.<ref>Thompson, Paul. 2010. \u201cInterview Eighteen\u201d in Sustainability Ethics: 5 Questions Ed. Ryne Raffaelle, Wade Robinson, and Evan Selinger. United States: Automatic Press</ref> It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life. For example, [[M. Thomas Inge]] defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets:<ref>M. Thomas Inge, ed. ''Agrarianism in American Literature'' (1969), introduction; [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS/Yoeman/agri1.html paraphrased]</ref>\n*Farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self-sufficiency.\n*Urban life, capitalism, and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness.\n*The agricultural community, with its fellowship of labor and co-operation, is the model society.\n*The farmer has a solid, stable position in the world order. They have \"a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.\" The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society.\n*Cultivation of the soil \"has within it a positive spiritual good\" and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of \"honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality.\" They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of agrarianism}}\nThe philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of [[Agriculturalism]] (\u519c\u5bb6/\u8fb2\u5bb6) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian [[communalism]] and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by [[Confucianism]], the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon.<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite book |last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> That influenced European intellectuals like [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], an avid Confucianist and advocate of China's agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of [[physiocracy]].<ref>L.A. Maverick, \"Chinese Influences upon the Physiocrats,\" ''Economic History'', 3:54\u201367 (February 1938),</ref> The physiocrats, along with the ideas of [[John Locke]] and the [[Romantic Era]], formed the basis of modern European and American agrarianism.\n\n\n\n==Types of Agrarianism==\n===Jeffersonian democracy===\n{{Main|Jeffersonian democracy}}\n[[File:T Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale 1791 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Thomas Jefferson]] and his supporters idealised farmers as the citizens that the American Republic should be formed around.]] \nThe United States president [[Thomas Jefferson]] was an agrarian who based his ideas about the budding American democracy around the notion that farmers are \u201cthe most valuable citizens\u201d and the truest [[Republicanism in the United States|republicans]].<ref>Thomas P. Govan, \"Agrarian and Agrarianism: A Study in the Use and Abuse of Words,\" ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 30#1  (Feb., 1964), pp. 35\u201347 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2205372 in JSTOR]</ref> Jefferson and his support base were committed to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], which saw as being in opposition to [[aristocracy]], opposition to [[corruption]], and priority on [[virtue]], examplified by the \"[[yeoman farmer]]\", \"[[Plantations in the American South|planters]]\", and the [[Plain Folk of the Old South|\"plain folk\"]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Gordon S. |author-link= |date= |title=The American Revolution: A History |url= |location= |publisher= |page=100 |isbn=}}</ref> While praising the rural farmfolk, the Jeffersonians felt that financiers, bankers and industrialists created \"cesspools of corruption\" in the cites and should thus were to be avoided.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick.  (1995) ch 5; Wallace Hettle, ''The Peculiar Democracy: Southern Democrats in Peace and Civil War'' (2001)  p. 15</ref>\n\nThe Jeffersonians sought to orientate the American economy more towards agriculture than industry. Part of their motive to do was Jefferson's fear that the over industrialisation of American would create a class of wage laborers who relied on their employers for income and sustenance. In turn, these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers. In order to counter this, Jefferson introduced, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, \"a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward\" as well as tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy.<ref>Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 26</ref> In 1811 Jefferson, writing to a friend, explained: ''These revenues will be levied entirely on the rich . ... The Rich alone use imported article, and on these alone the whole taxes of the General Government are levied. The poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the General Government, but on his salt.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Jefferson|title=The writings of Thomas Jefferson vol 13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW5XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42|year=1907|page=42}}</ref> \n\n===Agrarian socialism===\n{{Main|Agrarian socialism}}\nAgrarian Socialism is a form of Agrarianism that is [[Anti-Capitalist]] in nature and seeks to introduce [[Socialist]] economic systems in their stead. \n\n====Zapatismo====\n[[File:Emiliano Zapata4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emiliano Zapata]] fought in the Mexican Revolution in the name of the Mexican peasants and sought to introduce reforms such as land redistribution.]]\nNotable Agrarian Socialists include [[Emiliano Zapata]] who was a leading figure in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. As part of the [[Liberation Army of the South]], his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the Mexican peasants, whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes. Zapata published [[Plan of Ayala]], which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in Mexico as part of the revolution. Zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the Revolution, but his political ideas lived on in the form of [[Zapatismo]]. \n\nZapatismo would form the basis for [[Neozapatismo]], the ideology of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]. Known as ''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' or EZLN in Spanish, EZLN is a [[far-left]] [[libertarian socialist]] political and militant group that emerged in the state of [[Chiapas]] in southmost Mexico in 1994. EZLN and Neozapatismo, as explicit in their name, seek to revive the Agrarian Socialist movement of Zapata, but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community-level decision making. \n\n[[Subcommander Marcos]], a leading member of the movement, argues that the peoples' collective ownership of the land was and is the basis for all subsequent developments the movement sought to create:<blockquote>\n\u2026When the land became property of the peasants \u2026 when the land passed into the hands of those who work it \u2026 [This was] the starting point for advances in government, health, education, housing, nutrition, women\u2019s participation, trade, culture, communication, and information \u2026[it was] was recovering the means of production, in this case, the land, animals, and machines that were in the hands of large property owners.\u201d<ref>See ''The Zapatistas\u2019 Dignified Rage: Final Public Speeches of Subcommander Marcos''. Edited by Nick Henck. Translated by Henry Gales. (Chico: AK Press, 2018), pp. 81-82. </ref></blockquote>\n\n====Maoism====\n[[Maoism]], the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[ideology]] of [[Mao Zedong]] and his followers, places a heavy emphasis on the role of peasants in its goals. In contrast to other [[Marxism|Marxist]] schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers, Maoism sees the peasantry as key.

In 1958 Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], a social and economic campaign which, amongst other things, altered many aspects of rural Chinese life. It introduced mandatory [[Collective farming]] and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as [[People's commune]]s. These communes, which consisted of 5,000 people on average, were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life. The communes were run as [[co-operative]]s where wages and money were replaced by work points. Peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as \"[[Right-wing politics|Rightists]]\" and \"[[Counter-revolutionary|Counter-Revolutionaries]]\". Leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible, and those who attempted it were subjected to \"party-orchestrated public [[struggle sessions]],\" which further jeopardized their survival.<ref>Thaxton, Ralph A.

However, following the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], Mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into China, and thus engineers were often not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned. Similarly, the experimentation with the crops did not produce results. In addition to this the [[Four Pests Campaign]] was launched, in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion. This campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators.\n\nNone of these new systems was working, but local leaders did not dare to state this, instead, they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas. In many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas, and in turn, the Chinese State developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the Commune system.<ref name=hinton1984>{{Cite book  | last = Hinton | first = William  | authorlink = William H.

''Communism: A Very Short Introduction'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-19-955154-5}}. p. 32 \"Most estimates of the number of Chinese people who died range from 15 to 30 million.\"</ref> A combination of bad weather and the new, failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food. By 1962, the Great Leap Forward was declared to be at an end. \n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mao once again radically altered life in rural China with the launching of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. As a response to the Great Chinese Famine, the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]] began \"sending down\" urban youths to rural China in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities. However, Mao turned the practice into a political crusade, declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants. In reality, it was the Communist Party's attempt to reign in the [[Red Guards]], who had become uncontrollable during the course of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 10% of the 1970 urban population of China was sent out to remote rural villages, often in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The villages, which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the Great Chinese Famine, did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers. Furthermore, the so-called \"[[Sent-down youth]]\" had no agricultural experience and as a result, they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside, and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector. As a result, many of the sent-down youth died in the countryside. The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/up-to-the-mountains.php|title=Up to the mountains, down to the villages (1968)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nIn imitation of Mao's policies, the [[Khmer Rouge]] of [[Cambodia]] (who were heavily funded and supported by the People's Republic of China)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visiontimes.com/2018/01/28/how-red-china-supported-the-brutal-khmer-rouge.html |title=How Red China Supported the Brutal Khmer Rouge |last=Burke |first=James |date=28 January 2018 |website=VisionTimes.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> created their own version of the Great Leap Forward which was known as \"Maha Lout Ploh\".

Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted [[village cooperatives]] to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.\n\nPeasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.\n\n===Tunisia===\n\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.\n\n====Czechoslovakia====\nIn [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Sharon Werning Rivera, \"Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\" ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208.</ref>\n\n====France====\nIn [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the [[2002 French presidential election]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]].\n\n====Ireland====\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish [[landlordism]] in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The \"[[Land War]]\" of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers.\n\nPost-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.\n\n[[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.\n\n====Lithuania====\nIn Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]].\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined.\n\n====Romania====\nIn [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928\u20131930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996\u20132000.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.\n\n====Ukraine====\nIn Ukraine, the [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko]] has promised to purify the country of [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]] \"with a [[pitchfork]]\".<ref name=BBCUE14RPst>[http://www.bbc.com/nes/world-europe-29739514 Ukraine election: What to look for], [[BBC News]] (24 October 2014)</ref> The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (lower salary taxes, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village\n<ref name=radppUW>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/121957 The Communist Party May Be on Its Last Legs, But Social Populism is Still Alive], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 October 2014)</ref>), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0 |title=With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nHistorian F.K. Crowley finds that:\n: Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, as well as more healthy, more important and more productive, than life in the towns and cities....The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior.<ref>F.K.

The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.<ref>Rae Wear, \"Countrymindedness Revisited,\" (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nThe [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called \"[[populism]].\" [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]].\n\nTo obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.<ref>James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346</ref><ref>Tom Brooking, \"'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&action=null online]</ref>\n\n== Back-to-the-land movement ==\nAgrarianism is similar to but not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]]. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the \"progressive\" character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale.<ref>Jeffrey Carl Jacob, ''New Pioneers: The Back-to-the-Land Movement and the Search for a Sustainable Future'' (Penn State University Press. 1997)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Agropedia}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Agrarian Justice]]\n*[[Agrarian socialism]]\n*[[Agrarian society]]\n*[[Agrarian system]]\n*[[Georgism]]\n*[[Jeffersonian democracy]]\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Physiocrats]], 18th-century French thinkers\n*[[International Agrarian Bureau]]\n*[[Nordic agrarian parties]]\n*[[Yeoman]], English farmers\n*[[Permaculture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{further reading cleanup|date=April 2020}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n=== Agrarian values ===\n* Brass, Tom.

Ryne Raffaelle, Wade Robinson, and Evan Selinger. United States: Automatic Press</ref> It stresses the superiority of a simpler rural life as opposed to the complexity of city life. For example, [[M. Thomas Inge]] defines agrarianism by the following basic tenets:<ref>M. Thomas Inge, ed. ''Agrarianism in American Literature'' (1969), introduction; [http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS/Yoeman/agri1.html paraphrased]</ref>\n*Farming is the sole occupation that offers total independence and self-sufficiency.\n*Urban life, capitalism, and technology destroy independence and dignity and foster vice and weakness.\n*The agricultural community, with its fellowship of labor and co-operation, is the model society.\n*The farmer has a solid, stable position in the world order. They have \"a sense of identity, a sense of historical and religious tradition, a feeling of belonging to a concrete family, place, and region, which are psychologically and culturally beneficial.\" The harmony of their life checks the encroachments of a fragmented, alienated modern society.\n*Cultivation of the soil \"has within it a positive spiritual good\" and from it the cultivator acquires the virtues of \"honor, manliness, self-reliance, courage, moral integrity, and hospitality.\" They result from a direct contact with nature and, through nature, a closer relationship to God. The agrarian is blessed in that they follow the example of God in creating order out of chaos.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of agrarianism}}\nThe philosophical roots of agrarianism include European and Chinese philosophers. The Chinese school of [[Agriculturalism]] (\u519c\u5bb6/\u8fb2\u5bb6) was a philosophy that advocated peasant utopian [[communalism]] and egalitarianism. In societies influenced by [[Confucianism]], the farmer was considered an esteemed productive member of society, but merchants who made money were looked down upon.<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite book |last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> That influenced European intellectuals like [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]], an avid Confucianist and advocate of China's agrarian policies, in forming the French agrarian philosophy of [[physiocracy]].<ref>L.A.

Govan, \"Agrarian and Agrarianism: A Study in the Use and Abuse of Words,\" ''Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 30#1  (Feb., 1964), pp. 35\u201347 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2205372 in JSTOR]</ref> Jefferson and his support base were committed to [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], which saw as being in opposition to [[aristocracy]], opposition to [[corruption]], and priority on [[virtue]], examplified by the \"[[yeoman farmer]]\", \"[[Plantations in the American South|planters]]\", and the [[Plain Folk of the Old South|\"plain folk\"]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Gordon S. |author-link= |date= |title=The American Revolution: A History |url= |location= |publisher= |page=100 |isbn=}}</ref> While praising the rural farmfolk, the Jeffersonians felt that financiers, bankers and industrialists created \"cesspools of corruption\" in the cites and should thus were to be avoided.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick.  (1995) ch 5; Wallace Hettle, ''The Peculiar Democracy: Southern Democrats in Peace and Civil War'' (2001)  p. 15</ref>\n\nThe Jeffersonians sought to orientate the American economy more towards agriculture than industry. Part of their motive to do was Jefferson's fear that the over industrialisation of American would create a class of wage laborers who relied on their employers for income and sustenance. In turn, these workers would cease to be independent voters as their vote could be manipulated by said employers. In order to counter this, Jefferson introduced, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, \"a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward\" as well as tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy.<ref>Jenkinson, ''Becoming Jefferson's People'', p. 26</ref> In 1811 Jefferson, writing to a friend, explained: ''These revenues will be levied entirely on the rich . ... The Rich alone use imported article, and on these alone the whole taxes of the General Government are levied. The poor man ... pays not a farthing of tax to the General Government, but on his salt.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Jefferson|title=The writings of Thomas Jefferson vol 13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW5XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42|year=1907|page=42}}</ref> \n\n===Agrarian socialism===\n{{Main|Agrarian socialism}}\nAgrarian Socialism is a form of Agrarianism that is [[Anti-Capitalist]] in nature and seeks to introduce [[Socialist]] economic systems in their stead. \n\n====Zapatismo====\n[[File:Emiliano Zapata4.jpg|right|thumb|[[Emiliano Zapata]] fought in the Mexican Revolution in the name of the Mexican peasants and sought to introduce reforms such as land redistribution.]]\nNotable Agrarian Socialists include [[Emiliano Zapata]] who was a leading figure in the [[Mexican Revolution]]. As part of the [[Liberation Army of the South]], his group of revolutionaries fought on behalf of the Mexican peasants, whom they saw as exploited by the landowning classes. Zapata published [[Plan of Ayala]], which called for significant land reforms and land redistribution in Mexico as part of the revolution. Zapata was killed and his forces crushed over the course of the Revolution, but his political ideas lived on in the form of [[Zapatismo]]. \n\nZapatismo would form the basis for [[Neozapatismo]], the ideology of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]. Known as ''Ej\u00e9rcito Zapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional'' or EZLN in Spanish, EZLN is a [[far-left]] [[libertarian socialist]] political and militant group that emerged in the state of [[Chiapas]] in southmost Mexico in 1994. EZLN and Neozapatismo, as explicit in their name, seek to revive the Agrarian Socialist movement of Zapata, but fuse it with new elements such as a commitment to indigenous rights and community-level decision making. \n\n[[Subcommander Marcos]], a leading member of the movement, argues that the peoples' collective ownership of the land was and is the basis for all subsequent developments the movement sought to create:<blockquote>\n\u2026When the land became property of the peasants \u2026 when the land passed into the hands of those who work it \u2026 [This was] the starting point for advances in government, health, education, housing, nutrition, women\u2019s participation, trade, culture, communication, and information \u2026[it was] was recovering the means of production, in this case, the land, animals, and machines that were in the hands of large property owners.\u201d<ref>See ''The Zapatistas\u2019 Dignified Rage: Final Public Speeches of Subcommander Marcos''.

(Chico: AK Press, 2018), pp. 81-82. </ref></blockquote>\n\n====Maoism====\n[[Maoism]], the [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[ideology]] of [[Mao Zedong]] and his followers, places a heavy emphasis on the role of peasants in its goals. In contrast to other [[Marxism|Marxist]] schools of thought which normally seek to acquire the support of urban workers, Maoism sees the peasantry as key. Believing that \"[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Maoism saw the Chinese Peasantry as the prime source for a [[Vanguardism|Marxist vanguard]] because it possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref> During the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] made extensive use of peasants and rural bases in their military tactics, often eschewing the cities. \n\nFollowing the eventual victory of the Communist Party in both wars, the countryside and how it should be run remained a focus for Mao. In 1958 Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], a social and economic campaign which, amongst other things, altered many aspects of rural Chinese life. It introduced mandatory [[Collective farming]] and forced the peasantry to organize itself into communal living units which were known as [[People's commune]]s. These communes, which consisted of 5,000 people on average, were expected to meet high production quotas while the peasants who lived on them adapted to this radically new way of life. The communes were run as [[co-operative]]s where wages and money were replaced by work points. Peasants who criticised this new system were persecuted as \"[[Right-wing politics|Rightists]]\" and \"[[Counter-revolutionary|Counter-Revolutionaries]]\". Leaving the communes was forbidden and escaping from them was difficult or impossible, and those who attempted it were subjected to \"party-orchestrated public [[struggle sessions]],\" which further jeopardized their survival.<ref>Thaxton, Ralph A. Jr (2008).

[[Cambridge University Press]]. p.&nbsp;3. {{ISBN|0-521-72230-6}}.</ref> These Public [[Struggle session|criticism sessions]] were often used to intimidate the peasants into obeying local officials and they often devolved into little more than public beatings. <ref>Thaxton 2008, p.&nbsp;212.</ref>\n\nOn the communes, experiments were conducted in order to find new methods of planting crops, efforts were made to construct new irrigation systems on a massive scale, and the communes were all encouraged to produce steel backyard furnaces as part of an effort to increase steel production. However, following the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]], Mao had instilled a mass distrust of intellectuals into China, and thus engineers were often not consulted with regard to the new irrigation systems and the wisdom of asking untrained peasants to produce good quality steel from scrap iron was not publicly questioned. Similarly, the experimentation with the crops did not produce results. In addition to this the [[Four Pests Campaign]] was launched, in which the peasants were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until they dropped from exhaustion. This campaign resulted in an ecological disaster that saw an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which was consequently not in danger of being killed by predators.\n\nNone of these new systems was working, but local leaders did not dare to state this, instead, they falsified reports so as not to be punished for failing to meet the quotas. In many cases they stated that they were greatly exceeding their quotas, and in turn, the Chinese State developed a completely false sense of success with regard to the Commune system.<ref name=hinton1984>{{Cite book  | last = Hinton | first = William  | authorlink = William H.

''Communism: A Very Short Introduction'' ([[Oxford University Press]] 2009). {{ISBN|978-0-19-955154-5}}. p. 32 \"Most estimates of the number of Chinese people who died range from 15 to 30 million.\"</ref> A combination of bad weather and the new, failed farming techniques that were introduced by the state led to massive shortages of food. By 1962, the Great Leap Forward was declared to be at an end. \n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mao once again radically altered life in rural China with the launching of the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. As a response to the Great Chinese Famine, the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]] began \"sending down\" urban youths to rural China in order to recover its population losses and alleviate overcrowding in the cities. However, Mao turned the practice into a political crusade, declaring that the sending down would strip the youth of any bourgeois tendencies by forcing them to learn from the unprivileged rural peasants. In reality, it was the Communist Party's attempt to reign in the [[Red Guards]], who had become uncontrollable during the course of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. 10% of the 1970 urban population of China was sent out to remote rural villages, often in [[Inner Mongolia]]. The villages, which were still poorly recovering from the effects of the Great Chinese Famine, did not have the excess resources that were needed to support the newcomers. Furthermore, the so-called \"[[Sent-down youth]]\" had no agricultural experience and as a result, they were unaccustomed to the harsh lifestyle that existed in the countryside, and their unskilled labor in the villages provided little benefit to the agricultural sector. As a result, many of the sent-down youth died in the countryside. The relocation of the youths was originally intended to be permanent, but by the end of the Cultural Revolution, the Communist party relented and some of those who had the capacity to return to the cities were allowed to do so. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chineseposters.net/themes/up-to-the-mountains.php|title=Up to the mountains, down to the villages (1968)|website=chineseposters.net|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nIn imitation of Mao's policies, the [[Khmer Rouge]] of [[Cambodia]] (who were heavily funded and supported by the People's Republic of China)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.visiontimes.com/2018/01/28/how-red-china-supported-the-brutal-khmer-rouge.html |title=How Red China Supported the Brutal Khmer Rouge |last=Burke |first=James |date=28 January 2018 |website=VisionTimes.com |publisher= |access-date=3 April 2020 |quote=}}</ref> created their own version of the Great Leap Forward which was known as \"Maha Lout Ploh\".

Agrarian parties advocated land reforms to redistribute land on large estates among those who work it. They also wanted [[village cooperatives]] to keep the profit from crop sales in local hands and credit institutions to underwrite needed improvements. Many peasant parties were also nationalist parties because peasants often worked their land for the benefit of landlords of different ethnicity.\n\nPeasant parties rarely had any power before World War I but some became influential in the interwar era, especially in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]]. For a while, in the 1920s and the 1930s, there was a Green International ([[International Agrarian Bureau]]) based on the peasant parties in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. It functioned primarily as an information center that spread the ideas of agrarianism and combating socialism on the left and landlords on the right and never launched any significant activities.\n\n===Tunisia===\n\nThe [[Farmers' Voice Party]] won a seat in the district of [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] after the [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031105610/http://www.isie.tn/documents/arrete-resultats-preliminaires.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-31 }} in Arabic</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n\n====Bulgaria====\nIn Bulgaria, the [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union]] (BZNS) was organized in 1899 to resist taxes and build cooperatives. BZNS came to power in 1919 and introduced many economic, social, and legal reforms. However, conservative forces crushed BZNS in a 1923 coup and assassinated its leader, [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] (1879\u20131923). BZNS was made into a communist puppet group until 1989, when it reorganized as a genuine party.\n\n====Czechoslovakia====\nIn [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Republican Party of Agricultural and Smallholder People]] often shared power in parliament as a partner in the five-party p\u011btka coalition. The party's leader, [[Antonin Svehla]] (1873\u20131933), was prime minister several times. It was consistently the strongest party, forming and dominating coalitions. It moved beyond its original agrarian base to reach middle-class voters. The party was banned by the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Sharon Werning Rivera, \"Historical cleavages or transition mode? Influences on the emerging party systems in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.\" ''Party Politics'' (1996) 2#2 : 177-208.</ref>\n\n====France====\nIn [[France]], the [[Hunting, Fishing, Nature, Tradition]] party is a moderate conservative, agrarianist party, reaching a peak of 4.23% in the [[2002 French presidential election]]. It would later on become affiliated to France's main conservative party, [[Union for a Popular Movement]].\n\n====Ireland====\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Irish National Land League]] aimed to abolish [[landlordism]] in [[Ireland]] and enable tenant farmers to own the land they worked on. The \"[[Land War]]\" of 1878\u20131909 led to the [[Irish Land Acts]], ending [[absentee landlords]] and [[ground rent]] and redistributing land among peasant farmers.\n\nPost-independence, the [[Farmers' Party (Ireland)|Farmers' Party]] operated in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922, folding into the [[National Centre Party (Ireland)|National Centre Party]] in 1932. It was mostly supported by wealthy farmers in the east of Ireland.\n\n[[Clann na Talmhan]] (Family of the Land; also called the ''National Agricultural Party'') was founded in 1938. They focused more on the poor smallholders of the west, supporting [[land reclamation]], [[afforestation]], [[social democracy]] and [[rates (tax)|rates]] reform. They formed part of the governing coalition of the [[Government of the 13th D\u00e1il]] and [[Government of the 15th D\u00e1il]]. Economic improvement in the 1960s saw farmers vote for other parties and Clann na Talmhan disbanded in 1965.\n\n====Latvia====\nIn Latvia, the [[Union of Greens and Farmers]] is supportive of traditional small farms and perceives them as more environmentally friendly than large-scale farming: Nature is threatened by development, while small farms are threatened by large industrial-scale farms.\n\n====Lithuania====\nIn Lithuania, as of 2017, the government is led by the [[Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union]], under the leadership of industrial farmer [[Ram\u016bnas Karbauskis]].\n\n====Poland====\nIn [[Poland]], the [[Polish People's Party]] traces its tradition to an agrarian party in [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galician Poland]]. After the fall of the communist regime, PPP's biggest success came in [[1993 Polish parliamentary election|1993 elections]], where it won 132 out of 460 parliamentary seats. Since then, PPP's support has steadily declined.\n\n====Romania====\nIn [[Romania]], older parties from [[Transylvania]], [[Moldavia]], and [[Wallachia]] merged to become the [[National Peasants' Party]] in 1926. [[Iuliu Maniu]] (1873\u20131953) was a prime minister with an agrarian cabinet from 1928\u20131930 and briefly in 1932\u20131933, but the [[Great Depression]] made proposed reforms impossible. The [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] dissolved the party in 1947, but it reformed in 1989 after they fell from power.\n\nThe [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|reformed party]], which also incorporated elements of [[Christian democracy]] in its ideology, governed Romania as part of the [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] between 1996\u20132000.\n\n====Serbia====\nIn Serbia, [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] (1845\u20131926) and his [[People's Radical Party]] dominated Serbian politics after 1903. The party also monopolized power in Yugoslavia from 1918 to 1929. During the dictatorship of the 1930s, the prime minister was from that party.\n\n====Ukraine====\nIn Ukraine, the [[Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko]] has promised to purify the country of [[Ukrainian oligarchs|oligarchs]] \"with a [[pitchfork]]\".<ref name=BBCUE14RPst>[http://www.bbc.com/nes/world-europe-29739514 Ukraine election: What to look for], [[BBC News]] (24 October 2014)</ref> The party advocates a number of traditional left-wing positions (lower salary taxes, a ban on agricultural land sale and eliminating the illegal land market, a tenfold increase in budget spending on health, setting up primary health centres in every village\n<ref name=radppUW>[http://ukrainianweek.com/Politics/121957 The Communist Party May Be on Its Last Legs, But Social Populism is Still Alive], [[The Ukrainian Week]] (23 October 2014)</ref>), and mixes them with strong nationalist sentiments.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/25/world/europe/with-stunts-and-vigilante-escapades-a-populist-gains-ground-in-ukraine.html?_r=0 |title=With Stunts and Vigilante Escapades, a Populist Gains Ground in Ukraine|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\n\n====Australia====\nHistorian F.K. Crowley finds that:\n: Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, as well as more healthy, more important and more productive, than life in the towns and cities....The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior.<ref>F.K. Crowley, ''Modern Australia in Documents: 1901 \u2013 1939'' (1973) pp 77-78.</ref>\n\nThe [[National Party of Australia]] (formerly called the Country Party), from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called \"[[countrymindedness]]\".  The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of big sheep ranches) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.<ref>Rae Wear, \"Countrymindedness Revisited,\" (Australian Political Science Association, 1990) [http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf online edition ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723145257/http://apsa2000.anu.edu.au/confpapers/wear.rtf |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nThe [[New Zealand Liberal Party]] aggressively promoted agrarianism in its heyday (1891\u20131912). The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled Britain at this time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but its wealthy landowners largely controlled politics before 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called \"[[populism]].\" [[Richard Seddon]] had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: \"It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Leslie Lipson|title=The Politics of Equality: New Zealand's Adventures in Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe8jAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=U. of Chicago Press}}</ref>  The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small landowning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. The [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal government]] also established the basis of the later welfare state such as [[old age pensions]] and developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893, it [[women's suffrage in New Zealand|extended voting rights to women]], making New Zealand the first country in the world to [[women's suffrage|do so]].\n\nTo obtain land for farmers, the Liberal government from 1891 to 1911 purchased {{convert|3,100,000|acres|ha}} of Maori land. The government also purchased {{convert|1,300,000|acres|ha}} from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. The Advances to Settlers Act (1894) provided low-interest mortgages, and the agriculture department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organized opposition in Parliament.<ref>James Belich, ''Paradise Reforged: A history of the New Zealanders'' (2001) pp. 39\u201346</ref><ref>Tom Brooking, \"'Busting Up' the Greatest Estate of All: Liberal Maori Land Policy, 1891\u20131911,\" ''New Zealand Journal of History'' (1992) 26#1 pp. 78\u201398 [http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=802&action=null online]</ref>\n\n== Back-to-the-land movement ==\nAgrarianism is similar to but not identical with the [[back-to-the-land movement]]. Agrarianism concentrates on the fundamental goods of the earth, on communities of more limited economic and political scale than in modern society, and on simple living, even when the shift involves questioning the \"progressive\" character of some recent social and economic developments. Thus, agrarianism is not [[industrial farming]], with its specialization on products and industrial scale.<ref>Jeffrey Carl Jacob, ''New Pioneers: The Back-to-the-Land Movement and the Search for a Sustainable Future'' (Penn State University Press. 1997)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Agropedia}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Agrarian Justice]]\n*[[Agrarian socialism]]\n*[[Agrarian society]]\n*[[Agrarian system]]\n*[[Georgism]]\n*[[Jeffersonian democracy]]\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Physiocrats]], 18th-century French thinkers\n*[[International Agrarian Bureau]]\n*[[Nordic agrarian parties]]\n*[[Yeoman]], English farmers\n*[[Permaculture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{further reading cleanup|date=April 2020}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n=== Agrarian values ===\n* Brass, Tom.
