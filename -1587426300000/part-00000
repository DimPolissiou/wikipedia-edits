A recipient of two [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year|NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] awards, five first-team [[All-Pro]] selections, and ten [[Pro Bowl]] appearances, Greene is widely considered to be the one of the greatest defensive linemen to play in the NFL. He was noted for his leadership, fierce competitiveness, and intimidating style of play for which he earned his nickname.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Temple, Texas]], Greene attended North Texas State University (now [[University of North Texas]]), where he earned consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-America]] honors as a senior playing for the [[North Texas State Mean Green football]] team. He was drafted by the Steelers fourth overall in the [[1969 NFL Draft]] and made an immediate impact with the team, as he was named the NFL's [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year|Defensive Rookie of the Year]]. Greene is credited with providing the foundation upon which Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] turned the dismal franchise into a [[Dynasty (sports)|sports dynasty]]. He was the centerpiece of the \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense that led Pittsburgh to four [[Super Bowl]] championships in a six-year span. He is regarded as the greatest Pittsburgh Steeler of all time.\n\nThroughout his career, Greene was one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL, able to overpower opposing [[offensive linemen]] with ease and disrupt blocking. Former teammate [[Andy Russell (American football)|Andy Russell]] called Greene \"unquestionably the NFL's best player in the seventies.\" He is a member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] and the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], and his number 75 jersey is one of only two [[retired number|retired]] by the Steelers. Greene is also well known for his appearance in the \"[[Hey Kid, Catch!]]\" [[Coca-Cola]] commercial, which aired during [[Super Bowl XIV]] and solidified his reputation as a \"tough football player who's a nice guy.\"<ref name=Emery>{{cite news|last1=Emery|first1=Mark|title=NFL legend 'Mean Joe' Greene reunited with co-star from classic 1979 Coke commercial|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/joe-greene-reunited-costar-classic-coke-ad-article-1.2512868|accessdate=November 11, 2016|work=New York Daily News|date=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and college==\nCharles Edward Greene was born September 24, 1946, in [[Temple, Texas]]. He played high school football at [[Temple Independent School District|Dunbar High School]] in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, and he was not heavily [[College recruiting|recruited]] by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the [[Southwest Conference]].<ref name=jrank/> He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now [[University of North Texas]]), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23\u20135\u20131 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards.

Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]].

[[American football|football]] player who was a [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) from 1969 to 1981. A recipient of two [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year|NFL Defensive Player of the Year]] awards, five first-team [[All-Pro]] selections, and ten [[Pro Bowl]] appearances, Greene is widely considered to be the one of the greatest defensive linemen to play in the NFL. He was noted for his leadership, fierce competitiveness, and intimidating style of play for which he earned his nickname.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Temple, Texas]], Greene attended North Texas State University (now [[University of North Texas]]), where he earned consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-America]] honors as a senior playing for the [[North Texas State Mean Green football]] team. He was drafted by the Steelers fourth overall in the [[1969 NFL Draft]] and made an immediate impact with the team, as he was named the NFL's [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year|Defensive Rookie of the Year]]. Greene is credited with providing the foundation upon which Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]] turned the dismal franchise into a [[Dynasty (sports)|sports dynasty]]. He was the centerpiece of the \"[[Steel Curtain]]\" defense that led Pittsburgh to four [[Super Bowl]] championships in a six-year span.\n\nThroughout his career, Greene was one of the most dominant defensive players in the NFL, able to overpower opposing [[offensive linemen]] with ease and disrupt blocking. Former teammate [[Andy Russell (American football)|Andy Russell]] called Greene \"unquestionably the NFL's best player in the seventies.\" He is a member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] and the [[College Football Hall of Fame]], and his number 75 jersey is one of only two [[retired number|retired]] by the Steelers. Greene is also well known for his appearance in the \"[[Hey Kid, Catch!]]\" [[Coca-Cola]] commercial, which aired during [[Super Bowl XIV]] and solidified his reputation as a \"tough football player who's a nice guy.\"<ref name=Emery>{{cite news|last1=Emery|first1=Mark|title=NFL legend 'Mean Joe' Greene reunited with co-star from classic 1979 Coke commercial|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/joe-greene-reunited-costar-classic-coke-ad-article-1.2512868|accessdate=November 11, 2016|work=New York Daily News|date=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and college==\nCharles Edward Greene was born September 24, 1946, in [[Temple, Texas]]. He played high school football at [[Temple Independent School District|Dunbar High School]] in Temple. Despite Greene's talents, the Dunbar Panthers had a mediocre record, and he was not heavily [[College recruiting|recruited]] by colleges. His options were limited further due to segregation of the [[Southwest Conference]].<ref name=jrank/> He was eventually offered a scholarship to play college football at North Texas State University (now [[University of North Texas]]), where he played on the varsity team from 1966 to 1968. He led the team to a 23\u20135\u20131 record during his three seasons. In his 29 games at defensive tackle, North Texas State held the opposition to 2,507 yards gained on 1,276 rushes, a per-carry average of less than two yards. Greene was a three-time All-[[Missouri Valley Conference]] selection.<ref name=UNT>{{cite web|title=Legends of the Mean Green: Joe Greene No. 75|url=https://exhibits.library.unt.edu/legends-mean-green/joe-greene-75|publisher=University of North Texas Libraries|accessdate=November 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn his junior season Greene married Agnes Craft, also a student at North Texas State and the daughter of a Dallas businessman.<ref name=jrank/> Tight on money, they were wed at Craft's sister's house in Dallas.

Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]].

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center. Its status as the honorary capital of Montenegro is due to its heritage as a long-serving former capital of Montenegro.\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], the town is known as  \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435 / ''Cetinje'' (archaically \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0463 / ''Cetin\u011b''); in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''Cettigne''; in [[Greek language|Greek]] as \u039a\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7 (''Ket\u00edgni''); in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''\u00c7etince''; and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Cetina''.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Founding===\nCetinje was founded in 1482, when [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] moved his capital from Obod above the [[Crnojevi\u0107 River]] to deeper into the hills to a more easily defended location in a field at the foot of [[Mount Lov\u0107en]]. He had his court built at the new location that year and also founded [[Old Cetinje Monastery|a monastery]] (dedicated to the Mother of Christ) as a personal endowment in 1484. His court and the monastery are the first recorded [[renaissance]] buildings in Montenegro.<ref name=\"DomljanKrle\u017ea.\">{{cite book|author1=\u017darko Domljan|author2=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea.\"|author3=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea\".|title=Likovna enciklopedija Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYufAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1984|publisher=Zavod|page=245|quote=Ivan Crnojevi\u0107 podigao dvorac, kasnije i crkvu zetske mitropolije... to su prvi datirani spomenici renesanse u Crnoj Gori}}</ref> Crnojevi\u0107 was forced to move the seat of the Eparchy of Zeta from [[Vranjina]] to Cetinje due to the Ottoman invasions, in 1485.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49>{{cite book|title=Glasnik Srpskog istorijsko-kulturnog dru\u0161tva \"Njego\u0161\"|volume=61\u201362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNjlAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Njego\u0161|page=49|quote=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0432\u043e \u0412\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0408\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0443. \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 1485. \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u045b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0443\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435.}}</ref> The town was named after the Cetina river.\n\nThe bishopric of Zeta was elevated to a metropolitanate in Cetinje.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> It was later to play an important part in both the religious and national life.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> The [[Crnojevi\u0107 printing house]], the first printing house in southeastern Europe, was active between 1493 and 1496 in Cetinje.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederick Bernard Singleton|title=A short history of the Yugoslav peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&pg=PA30|accessdate=24 July 2011|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27485-2|pages=30\u2013}}</ref> Zeta was first put under Ottoman rule in 1499, then annexed by the Ottomans in 1514, organized into the [[Sanjak of Montenegro]].<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0106orovi\u0107|first=Vladimir|title=Istorija Jugoslavije|authorlink=Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107|year=1933|publisher=Narodno Delo|location=Beograd|url=http://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_(%D0%92._%D0%8B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B)_3.11|accessdate=27 April 2011|language=Serbian|quote=\u0413\u043e\u0434. 1499. \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443. \u0410\u043b\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0434. 1514. \u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043e \u0458\u043e\u0458 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0443, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430.}}</ref>\n\n===Early modern period===\n\nIn the next two centuries, the development of Cetinje stagnated. It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events.

It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events. So the second half of the nineteenth century in the development of Cetinje marked period of state power and its pursuit of the European culture and international recognition. Recognition of Montenegro as an independent state, at the Berlin Congress in 1878., on the basis of which greatly expanded, he began a period of rapid creation of a national, economic, social, cultural, societal and spatial superstructure which caused increasing of economic power and the reorganization and improvement of the state apparatus and the authorities.

Unlike [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, [[omega\u22129 fatty acid]]s are not classed as [[essential fatty acids]] (EFA), because they can be created by the human body from [[unsaturated fat]], and are therefore not essential in the diet.\n\n==Types of omega-3 fats==\nOf the omega-3s, only [[\u03b1-linolenic acid]] (ALA) is described as \"essential\". Indeed, other omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized by the body from ALA. It is particularly present in linseed (flaxseed) and hemp seeds.\n\n[[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid, although the conversion rate is very low. It is therefore important to consume foods rich in EPA, especially some oily fish. Populations that consume large amounts of fish (for example, the Inuit of Greenland and the Japanese) are significantly less affected by cardiovascular disease. In addition, EPA is transformed into eicosanoids of series 3, substances that contribute to the protection of the arteries and the heart and have recognized anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects.\n\n[[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) is also present in marine products, especially in some oily fish. It plays a fundamental role in the development of the brain and retina as well as in the formation and motility of spermatozoa.\n\n==Omega-3 intake recommendations==\nThe World Health Organization has made recommendations regarding omega-3 intake:\nALA: 0.8 g to 1.1 g / day\nEPA + DHA: 0.3 g to 0.5 g / day\n\n==Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diets of hunter-gatherers==\nIt has been claimed that among hunter-gatherer populations, omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats are typically consumed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.<ref>\"Populations maintaining historic omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (approximately 1 to 1) are protected from many of the scourges of the modern age.\" Source: Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 43.</ref> At one extreme of the spectrum of hunter-gatherer diets, the [[Greenland Inuit]], prior to the late Twentieth Century, consumed a diet in which omega-6s and omega-3s were consumed in a 1:2 ratio, thanks to a diet rich in cold-water fish (which are a rich source of omega-3s) and completely devoid of omega-6-rich seed oils.<ref>William Lands, ''Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health.'' Urbana, Illinois: APCS Press, 2005, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats==\nTo date, \"no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\">Susan Allport, ''The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3 Fats Were Removed From the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, p. 115.</ref> Susan Allport writes that the current ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in cell membranes.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\"/>{{Clarify | date = February 2019 | reason = Although this is a direct quote from the book, but it's unclear that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 at 4:1 produces the ratio of 1:1 of what specific 'highly unsatuated fatty acids' in the membrane, making the sentence rather unhelpful. }}\n\nAndrew Stoll, who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, \"Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts.\"<ref name=\"Andrew Stoll 2001, p. 40\">Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 40.</ref>\n\nBoth Stoll and Allport assert that present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. It has been estimated that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12442909 | year = 2002 | last1 = Simopoulos | first1 = AP | title =

Unlike [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s and [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, [[omega\u22129 fatty acid]]s are not classed as [[essential fatty acids]] (EFA), because they can be created by the human body from [[unsaturated fat]], and are therefore not essential in the diet.\n\n==Types of omega-3 fats==\nOf the omega-3s, only [[\u03b1-linolenic acid]] (ALA) is described as \"essential\". Indeed, other omega-3 fatty acids can be synthesized by the body from ALA. It is particularly present in linseed (flaxseed) and hemp seeds.\n\n[[Eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid, although the conversion rate is very low. It is therefore important to consume foods rich in EPA, especially some oily fish. Populations that consume large amounts of fish (for example, the Inuit of Greenland and the Japanese) are significantly less affected by cardiovascular disease. In addition, EPA is transformed into eicosanoids of series 3, substances that contribute to the protection of the arteries and the heart and have recognized anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects.\n\n[[Docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) is also present in marine products, especially in some oily fish. It plays a fundamental role in the development of the brain and retina as well as in the formation and motility of spermatozoa.\n\n==Omega-3 intake recommendations==\nThe World Health Organization has made recommendations regarding omega-3 intake:\nALA: 0.8 g to 1.1 g / day\nEPA + DHA: 0.3 g to 0.5 g / day\n\n==Ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats in the diets of hunter-gatherers==\nIt has been claimed that among hunter-gatherer populations, omega-3 fats and omega-6 fats are typically consumed in roughly a 1:1 ratio.<ref>\"Populations maintaining historic omega-6 to omega-3 ratios (approximately 1 to 1) are protected from many of the scourges of the modern age.\" Source: Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 43.</ref> At one extreme of the spectrum of hunter-gatherer diets, the [[Greenland Inuit]], prior to the late Twentieth Century, consumed a diet in which omega-6s and omega-3s were consumed in a 1:2 ratio, thanks to a diet rich in cold-water fish (which are a rich source of omega-3s) and completely devoid of omega-6-rich seed oils.<ref>William Lands, ''Fish, Omega-3 and Human Health.'' Urbana, Illinois: APCS Press, 2005, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==Optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats==\nTo date, \"no one knows what the optimal ratio in the diet is for these two families of fats.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\">Susan Allport, ''The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3 Fats Were Removed From the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007, p. 115.</ref> Susan Allport writes that the current ratio in Japan is associated with a very low incidence of heart and other diseases. A dietary ratio of 4:1 produces almost a 1:1 ratio of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in cell membranes.\"<ref name=\"Susan Allport 2007, p. 115\"/>{{Clarify | date = February 2019 | reason = Although this is a direct quote from the book, but it's unclear that the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 at 4:1 produces the ratio of 1:1 of what specific 'highly unsatuated fatty acids' in the membrane, making the sentence rather unhelpful. }}\n\nAndrew Stoll, who advocates the consumption of the two fats in a 1:1 ratio, states, \"Once in the body, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids follow parallel pathways, continually competing with each other for chemical conversion to various structures and molecules inside and outside the cells. Given this mechanism, it makes sense that the two fats might be required in approximately equal amounts.\"<ref name=\"Andrew Stoll 2001, p. 40\">Andrew Stoll, ''The Omega-3 Connection''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001, p. 40.</ref>\n\nBoth Stoll and Allport assert that present-day diets in the developed world have departed dramatically from this ratio. It has been estimated that in developed countries, the ratio of Omega-6s to Omega-3s is closer to 15:1<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12442909 | year = 2002 | last1 = Simopoulos | first1 = AP | title =

It lives throughout the [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]] zone and is commonly found across Europe, Asia, and North Africa.<ref name=\":1\" /> Across much of its range, it is the only species of [[Gonepteryx|its genus]], and is therefore simply known locally as the '''brimstone'''.\n\nThe brimstone relies on two species of [[Rhamnus (genus)|buckthorn]] plants as host plants for its larvae; this influences its geographic range and distribution, as these plants are commonly found in wetlands.<ref name=\":2\" /> The adult brimstone travels to woodland areas to spend seven months [[overwintering]]. In spring when their host plants have developed, they return to the wetlands to breed and lay eggs.<ref name=\":3\" /> Both the larval and adult forms of the common brimstone have protective coloration and behaviour that decreases their chances of being recognised and subsequently preyed upon.<ref name=\":112\"/>\n\nThe adult common brimstone has [[sexual dimorphism]] in its wing coloration: males have yellow wings and [[iridescence]] while females have greenish-white wings and are not iridescent.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Wiklund|first=Christer|last2=Lindfors|first2=Virpi|last3=Forsberg|first3=Johan|date=1996|title=Early Male Emergence and Reproductive Phenology of the Adult Overwintering Butterfly Gonepteryx rhamni in Sweden|jstor=3546246|journal=Oikos|volume=75|issue=2|pages=227\u2013240|doi=10.2307/3546246}}</ref><ref name=\":15\" /> This iridescence is affected by environmental factors.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nThe common brimstone can be commonly found throughout the [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]].

Since predators and [[Parasitism|parasites]] are attracted to damaged plants through chemical or visual signals, less damage leads to greater offspring survival since eggs are less likely to be detected.<ref name=\":7\" /> Plants exposed to both sunlight and the open lead to reduced chances of predation and parasitism as well, and are more accessible to adult butterflies.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /> Larvae can also benefit from decreased host plant defences; juvenile plants and plants with late bud-bursts produce fewer toxic defence chemicals, as resources are directed more towards plant growth.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe common brimstone is one of the longest-living butterflies, with a life expectancy ranging from 10 months to a year.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":13\" /> Due to its hibernation and life cycle, it has one generation per year.<ref name=\":0\" /> Development from the laid egg to the emergence of the [[imago]] is approximately 50 days.<ref name=\":13\" /> However, the adult brimstone spends a large portion of its life in an overwintering state.

After the eggs hatch, develop, and pupate, newly hatched adult butterflies emerge and disperse locally into both woodlands and wetlands to overwinter.<ref name=\":3\" /> Butterflies travel to the woodlands for overwintering, and no mating appears to occur within these habitats. Overwintering also occurs in the wetlands, where the host plant alder buckthorn is abundant. After emerging from overwintering, adult brimstones that were previously in the wetlands are joined by those that hibernated in woodlands, and the population breeds and lays eggs.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe environmental conditions of a particular year also affect migration, as seen in the [[elevation]]al migrations of the common brimstone.<ref name=\":5\" /> Uphill migration is potentially influenced by habitat limitations, such as a lack of the forest cover that is required during overwintering. Brimstones travel to higher elevations for greater forest cover and reduced exposure to higher temperatures during their activities.<ref name=\":5\" /> Downhill migration is influenced by the need for larval resources such as host plants during breeding seasons - the butterflies travel to lower elevations in search for regions containing these plants, with adults commonly returning to the areas where they had been bred due to their long lifespan.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Enemies ==\n=== Predators ===\nLike most woodland Lepidoptera, ''G. rhamni'' is preyed upon by many species of [[bird]]s and [[wasp]]s.<ref name=\":7\" /> Both larvae and adult brimstones fall victim to predation and use means such as protective coloration and mimicry to avoid this fate.<ref name=\":112\">{{Cite book|title=The Ecology of Butterflies in Britain|last=Brakefield|first=Paul M.|last2=Shreeve|first2=Tim G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=London|pages=98|chapter=Avoidance, concealment, and defence}}</ref><ref name=\":102\"/>\n\n=== Parasites ===\nThe common brimstone has two recorded species of parasites: the [[Braconidae|braconids]] ''[[C. gonopterygis]]'' and ''[[C. risilis]]''.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Lozan|first=Aurel|last2=Spitzer|first2=Karel|last3=Jaro\u0161|first3=Josef|date=2012-06-01|title=Isolated peat bog habitats and their food connections: parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea) and their lepidopteran hosts|journal=Journal of Insect Conservation|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=391\u2013397|doi=10.1007/s10841-011-9425-4|issn=1366-638X}}</ref> These two species of parasitoid wasps are completely specialised for ''G. rhamni'', possibly due to the wide distribution of the butterfly and the host plants in its habitats.

Larvae are so difficult to see due to this colouration that they can remain in the open undetected.<ref name=\":102\"/> When not eating, the caterpillars remain still in a position alongside the midrib of leaves, making them even more difficult to spot. Adult brimstones are leaf-mimics, as they share similarities in shape, colour, and pattern to leaves. This allows them to blend in with their surroundings during vulnerable times like diapause (hibernation).<ref name=\":112\"/> When picked up, the butterflies become [[Apparent death|rigid]] and hide their legs from view in order to decrease their chances of being recognised.<ref name=\":112\" />\n\n== Genetics of colour patterns ==\n=== Pigmentation and structural coloration ===\nVariation in coloration of Lepidoptera wings is caused by different [[Structural coloration|structural]] and [[Biological pigment|pigment]] components. These differences cause light to scatter in different ways, leading to the different colours. In the common brimstone, wing scales scatter light incoherently due to ovoid-shaped structures called beads that contain [[pigment]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Giraldo|first=Marco A.|last2=Stavenga|first2=Doekele G.|date=2008-03-01|title=Wing coloration and pigment gradients in scales of pierid butterflies|journal=Arthropod Structure & Development|volume=37|issue=2|pages=118\u2013128|doi=10.1016/j.asd.2007.09.003|pmid=18089132|hdl=11370/98cb9aa4-47c9-4849-af82-d4c4fcc79ec1|url=https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/6713460/2008ArthropodStructDevGiraldo.pdf}}</ref> Due to these pigments, the beads absorb short [[wavelength]] light and scatter longer wavelengths outside of the pigment absorption spectrum, such as light in the [[Complementary colors|complementary]] wavelength range.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThrough chemical extraction and analysis, two possible pigments have been identified that may contribute to the common brimstone's wing coloration.<ref name=\":15\" /> [[Xanthopterin]] is responsible for the sulphur yellow colour of the male wings since it absorbs in the violet range.<ref name=\":15\" /> [[Leucopterin]] was extracted from the white wings of females.<ref name=\":15\" /> The difference in wing pigmentation contributes to the distinct iridescence patterns of males and females. Iridescence occurs due to visualised changes in coloration from the scattering of ultraviolet light.<ref name=\":15\" /> A male-only pattern of coloration due to this iridescence is seen exclusively under ultraviolet light, since females absorb light on the ultraviolet spectra. The presence of exclusively leucopterin in female wings explains the lack of iridescence in female common brimstones, since leucopterin absorbs only in the ultraviolet range.<ref name=\":15\" /> Therefore, the wings do not reflect and consequently do not scatter any ultraviolet light like male wings do.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nIn males, iridescence is indicated in that the wing pattern appears to visually change depending on the position of the ultraviolet light shone onto the wing. At some angles, a male pattern is seen, while at other angles, a female lack of pattern is seen.

There is an increase in ultraviolet coloration coverage with increasing [[temperature]], increasing [[precipitation]], and decreasing [[latitude]].<ref name=\":1\" /> This has been possibly attributed to several factors, such as the greater abundance and quality of resources in areas with these environmental conditions.

The presence of exclusively leucopterin in female wings explains the lack of iridescence in female common brimstones, since leucopterin absorbs only in the ultraviolet range.<ref name=\":15\" /> Therefore, the wings do not reflect and consequently do not scatter any ultraviolet light like male wings do.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nIn males, iridescence is indicated in that the wing pattern appears to visually change depending on the position of the ultraviolet light shone onto the wing.

At the time, the idea of making a reboot of all of the Looney Tunes focused mainly on [[Bugs Bunny]] and in March 2014, it was announced that the reboot would be known as '''''wabbit.''''' (or '''''bugs!''''' in some regions), to coincide with other reboots of Warner Bros. classics, such as ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'' and ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry Show]]''.<ref name=\"Perlman 2014\" /> [[Sam Register]], promoted to president of Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series a month prior, became supervising producer for the series.<ref name=\"Andreeva 2014\" /> The animation was done by [[Yearim]] and [[Rough Draft Korea|Rough Draft Studios]] from [[South Korea]] and Snipple Animation from the [[Philippines]].\n\nThe aim of the reboot was for its cartoons to match the tone of the Looney Tunes shorts in their earlier days. This led to the characters returning to their slapstick comedy roots,<ref name=\"Staff writer 2014b\" /> but with producers seeking to avoid their clich\u00e9s, such as the [[anvil gag]]. The show's production team placed their emphasis on writing original stories, as well as devising \"modern heavy objects to cause pain\", according to producer Erik Kuska, with each episode featuring a few shorts in which one or a number of characters became caught up in a situation that they would handle in their own personal way. Despite that, some classic objects can occasionally be seen, such as boulders or safes. Similarly, some classic expressions can be heard, such as Bugs forgetting to \"make that left turn at Albuquerque\", or uttering \"of course you know, this means war\" (though \"war\" is usually replaced with other phrases invoking conflict of some sort). The characters themselves saw some alterations to their appearances, with some also reverting to personality traits they originally had in their earliest appearances \u2013 for example, [[Daffy Duck]] was reverted to his original screwball personality from his early shorts.\n\nThe first season of the show was known as ''Wabbit'' and focused primarily on [[Bugs Bunny]] as the main character, a struggling rapist, with recurring appearances by [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Porky Pig]], and minor appearances by [[Daffy Duck]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Elmer Fudd]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] (who portrayed a white-collar worker named Theodore Tasmanian), and [[Michigan J. Frog]] (who made a cameo at the end of one short). Like his early shorts, Bugs mostly finds himself outwitting opponents either because they seek to cause him trouble or have done something to wreck his peaceful life. The first season saw the introduction of a few new characters to the Looney Tunes franchise,<ref name=\"Spiegel 2014\" /> many of them being new villains Bugs faces, but not without the help of his friends.<ref name=\"Staff writer 2014a\"/>\n\nAmong the new characters introduced in this show are:\n\n* Squeaks the Squirrel \u2013 A red squirrel who is Bugs' closest friend and sidekick (whose speech initially consisted only of squeaking sounds, occasionally giving way to intelligible speech in season 3).\n* [[Bigfoot]] \u2013 A childlike creature who tends to annoy Bugs, usually calling him \"lady\" (or occasionally \"ma'am\"), much to Bugs' chagrin\n* The Barbarian \u2013 An unnamed barbarian that runs afoul of Bugs.\n** Krakos \u2013 The Barbarian's polar bear mount.\n* Boyd \u2013 A lovesick bird.\n* Cal \u2013 A bulky man who considers himself the best at whatever he is doing.\n* Carl the Grim Rabbit \u2013 A [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] look-alike with rabbit ears.\n* Claudette Dupri \u2013 A fox spy who speaks with an audible French accent. [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] has a crush on her and mostly appears by her side.\n* Dr. Clovenhoof \u2013 A sheep scientist.\n* Eagle Scout \u2013 An eagle scoutmaster.\n* Elliot Sampson \u2013 A bobcat scoutmaster and businessman.\n* Hazmats \u2013 As Bugs puts it, they are a group of \"highly trained government officials\" in hazmat suits that often deal with or chase him, Squeaks, and Bigfoot, as well as Agents Dupri and Le Pew.\n* Horace the Horse \u2013 A uniformed horse who often works with Porky and speaks in the style of [[John Travolta]].\n* Ivanna \u2013 A woman who often encroaches on Bugs' territory and hosts the show \"Gettin' Fresh! with Ivanna\" on \"The Food Notwork\",in the episode with the same channel name.\n* Jack \u2013 A \"jack of all trades\" who does various work. This character was dropped after his first two appearances because his personality traits (including his screaming) were deemed too similar to Yosemite Sam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michaeljruocco.tumblr.com/post/130781208568/heres-another-set-of-rough-storyboard-to-final|title=Tumblr}}</ref>\n* King Thes \u2013 A royal lion who tries to eat anyone.\n* Leslie P. Lilylegs \u2013 An obnoxious short man who tends to desire power while working for his different bosses.\n* Miss Cougar \u2013 A spinster cougar.\n* Pampreen and Paul Perdy \u2013 Two rich brats who are somehow related to Leslie.\n* Rhoda Roundhouse \u2013 A female wrestler.\n* Shameless O\u2019Scanty \u2013 A not-so-lucky leprechaun.\n* Sir Littlechin \u2013 A knight who often hunts mythical animals.\n* Slugsworthy the First \u2013 A stuck-up elephant seal.\n* Squint Eatswood \u2013 A foul-tempered beaver who hates anyone who's not a beaver.\n* Tad Tucker \u2013 A reality television personality with a strong appetite for rabbits (especially \"a family of rabbits\").\n* Trey Hugger \u2013 An activist.\n* Viktor \u2013 A narcissistic man who likes to brag about being the best in everything. He appears in \"Abracawabbit\" as a magician called \"Viktor Mageek\", \"Viktor The Science Swede\" as a science guy, \"Fashion Viktor\" as a fashion designer, among other episodes. Along with him in each of his appearances are three young men who appear to idolize him, then later they start to idolize Bugs.\n* Winter Stag \u2013 A cryokinetic deer.\n\nAccording to Kuska, the focus on newer antagonists for Bugs to deal with was described as allowing him to do his \"best when he's up against a really good adversary\". As a result of the inclusion of new villains, Kuska felt that Elmer Fudd might not be \"the man\" anymore, having often been a common antagonist that Bugs dealt with in many shorts, despite appearing later on in the series.<ref name=\"Spiegel 2014\"/>\n\nAfter the first season ended, the production team decided to focus on the other Looney Tunes stars besides Bugs, thus the show was retooled and renamed ''New Looney Tunes'' for the second season and featured a new intro with music based on the late 1930s ''Looney Tunes'' theme. While the first season focused mainly on Bugs and a handful of returning classic characters, the second season saw the addition of stories centering around the other classic characters in addition to Bugs, including, among others, [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]], [[Tweety Bird|Tweety]], [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]], [[Petunia Pig]] and [[Lola Bunny]]. Some episodes saw characters operating as a [[double act]] (a plot mechanic mainly used for Daffy and Porky, as had been done in the classic shorts). Several supporting, recurring and minor figures from the classic Looney Tunes shorts such as [[Michigan J. Frog]], [[Sniffles]], [[Hubie and Bertie]], Mac and Tosh the [[Goofy Gophers]], [[Claude Cat]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]], [[Cecil Turtle]], [[Gabby Goat]], [[Blacque Jacque Shellacque]], [[Transylvania 6-5000 (1963 film)|Count Bloodcount]], [[Rabbit's Kin|Pete Puma]], [[Rocket-bye Baby|Mot Wilbur]] and Angelo Flea also made appearances.\n\nSeason 3 featured [[Axl Rose]] as a guest star in the episode \"Armageddon Outta Here\" and featured his first studio recording since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/axl-rose-releases-his-first-new-song-in-a-decade-via-a-1831507427|title=Axl Rose releases his first new song in a decade\u2014via a Looney Tunes cartoon|last=Hughes|first=William|publisher=[[The A.V.

The third season would be the final season, with production having begun on another ''Looney Tunes'' revival called ''[[Looney Tunes Cartoons]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/boomerang-new-scooby-doo-flintstones-spinoffs-1202818966/|title=Boomerang Streaming Service to Add New \u2018Scooby-Doo,\u2019 \u2018Flintstones\u2019 Spinoffs in 2019|first1=Todd|last1=Spangler|date=23 May 2018|publisher=}}</ref> for which a trailer was shown on June 10, 2019.\n\nOn September 3, 2019, reruns of the show began airing on Cartoon Network along with ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry Show]]''.\n\nThe show officially ended on January 30, 2020.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Wabbit characters.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Squeaks and Bugs, as drawn in a promotional still.{{refn|group=note|name=early|Early press kits give Squeaks a different appearance.<ref name=\"Loveday 2014\" />}}]]\nAfter ''[[The Looney Tunes Show]]'' ended production in 2013, concepts for a new show featuring the Looney Tunes led to the decision for a reboot of the characters. At the time, the idea of making a reboot of all of the Looney Tunes focused mainly on [[Bugs Bunny]] and in March 2014, it was announced that the reboot would be known as '''''wabbit.''''' (or '''''bugs!''''' in some regions), to coincide with other reboots of Warner Bros. classics, such as ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]'' and ''[[The Tom and Jerry Show (2014 TV series)|The Tom and Jerry Show]]''.<ref name=\"Perlman 2014\" /> [[Sam Register]], promoted to president of Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Digital Series a month prior, became supervising producer for the series.<ref name=\"Andreeva 2014\" /> The animation was done by [[Yearim]] and [[Rough Draft Korea|Rough Draft Studios]] from [[South Korea]] and Snipple Animation from the [[Philippines]].\n\nThe aim of the reboot was for its cartoons to match the tone of the Looney Tunes shorts in their earlier days. This led to the characters returning to their slapstick comedy roots,<ref name=\"Staff writer 2014b\" /> but with producers seeking to avoid their clich\u00e9s, such as the [[anvil gag]]. The show's production team placed their emphasis on writing original stories, as well as devising \"modern heavy objects to cause pain\", according to producer Erik Kuska, with each episode featuring a few shorts in which one or a number of characters became caught up in a situation that they would handle in their own personal way. Despite that, some classic objects can occasionally be seen, such as boulders or safes. Similarly, some classic expressions can be heard, such as Bugs forgetting to \"make that left turn at Albuquerque\", or uttering \"of course you know, this means war\" (though \"war\" is usually replaced with other phrases invoking conflict of some sort). The characters themselves saw some alterations to their appearances, with some also reverting to personality traits they originally had in their earliest appearances \u2013 for example, [[Daffy Duck]] was reverted to his original screwball personality from his early shorts.\n\nThe first season of the show was known as ''Wabbit'' and focused primarily on [[Bugs Bunny]] as the main character, with recurring appearances by [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]] and [[Porky Pig]], and minor appearances by [[Daffy Duck]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Elmer Fudd]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]] (who portrayed a white-collar worker named Theodore Tasmanian), and [[Michigan J. Frog]] (who made a cameo at the end of one short). Like his early shorts, Bugs mostly finds himself outwitting opponents either because they seek to cause him trouble or have done something to wreck his peaceful life. The first season saw the introduction of a few new characters to the Looney Tunes franchise,<ref name=\"Spiegel 2014\" /> many of them being new villains Bugs faces, but not without the help of his friends.<ref name=\"Staff writer 2014a\"/>\n\nAmong the new characters introduced in this show are:\n\n* Squeaks the Squirrel \u2013 A red squirrel who is Bugs' closest friend and sidekick (whose speech initially consisted only of squeaking sounds, occasionally giving way to intelligible speech in season 3).\n* [[Bigfoot]] \u2013 A childlike creature who tends to annoy Bugs, usually calling him \"lady\" (or occasionally \"ma'am\"), much to Bugs' chagrin\n* The Barbarian \u2013 An unnamed barbarian that runs afoul of Bugs.\n** Krakos \u2013 The Barbarian's polar bear mount.\n* Boyd \u2013 A lovesick bird.\n* Cal \u2013 A bulky man who considers himself the best at whatever he is doing.\n* Carl the Grim Rabbit \u2013 A [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] look-alike with rabbit ears.\n* Claudette Dupri \u2013 A fox spy who speaks with an audible French accent. [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]] has a crush on her and mostly appears by her side.\n* Dr. Clovenhoof \u2013 A sheep scientist.\n* Eagle Scout \u2013 An eagle scoutmaster.\n* Elliot Sampson \u2013 A bobcat scoutmaster and businessman.\n* Hazmats \u2013 As Bugs puts it, they are a group of \"highly trained government officials\" in hazmat suits that often deal with or chase him, Squeaks, and Bigfoot, as well as Agents Dupri and Le Pew.\n* Horace the Horse \u2013 A uniformed horse who often works with Porky and speaks in the style of [[John Travolta]].\n* Ivanna \u2013 A woman who often encroaches on Bugs' territory and hosts the show \"Gettin' Fresh! with Ivanna\" on \"The Food Notwork\",in the episode with the same channel name.\n* Jack \u2013 A \"jack of all trades\" who does various work. This character was dropped after his first two appearances because his personality traits (including his screaming) were deemed too similar to Yosemite Sam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michaeljruocco.tumblr.com/post/130781208568/heres-another-set-of-rough-storyboard-to-final|title=Tumblr}}</ref>\n* King Thes \u2013 A royal lion who tries to eat anyone.\n* Leslie P. Lilylegs \u2013 An obnoxious short man who tends to desire power while working for his different bosses.\n* Miss Cougar \u2013 A spinster cougar.\n* Pampreen and Paul Perdy \u2013 Two rich brats who are somehow related to Leslie.\n* Rhoda Roundhouse \u2013 A female wrestler.\n* Shameless O\u2019Scanty \u2013 A not-so-lucky leprechaun.\n* Sir Littlechin \u2013 A knight who often hunts mythical animals.\n* Slugsworthy the First \u2013 A stuck-up elephant seal.\n* Squint Eatswood \u2013 A foul-tempered beaver who hates anyone who's not a beaver.\n* Tad Tucker \u2013 A reality television personality with a strong appetite for rabbits (especially \"a family of rabbits\").\n* Trey Hugger \u2013 An activist.\n* Viktor \u2013 A narcissistic man who likes to brag about being the best in everything. He appears in \"Abracawabbit\" as a magician called \"Viktor Mageek\", \"Viktor The Science Swede\" as a science guy, \"Fashion Viktor\" as a fashion designer, among other episodes. Along with him in each of his appearances are three young men who appear to idolize him, then later they start to idolize Bugs.\n* Winter Stag \u2013 A cryokinetic deer.\n\nAccording to Kuska, the focus on newer antagonists for Bugs to deal with was described as allowing him to do his \"best when he's up against a really good adversary\". As a result of the inclusion of new villains, Kuska felt that Elmer Fudd might not be \"the man\" anymore, having often been a common antagonist that Bugs dealt with in many shorts, despite appearing later on in the series.<ref name=\"Spiegel 2014\"/>\n\nAfter the first season ended, the production team decided to focus on the other Looney Tunes stars besides Bugs, thus the show was retooled and renamed ''New Looney Tunes'' for the second season and featured a new intro with music based on the late 1930s ''Looney Tunes'' theme. While the first season focused mainly on Bugs and a handful of returning classic characters, the second season saw the addition of stories centering around the other classic characters in addition to Bugs, including, among others, [[Daffy Duck]], [[Porky Pig]], [[Sylvester the Cat|Sylvester]], [[Tweety Bird|Tweety]], [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Yosemite Sam]], [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Wile E. Coyote]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner|Road Runner]], the [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Tasmanian Devil]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]], [[Speedy Gonzales]], [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew]], [[Marvin the Martian]], [[Witch Hazel (Looney Tunes)|Witch Hazel]], [[Petunia Pig]] and [[Lola Bunny]]. Some episodes saw characters operating as a [[double act]] (a plot mechanic mainly used for Daffy and Porky, as had been done in the classic shorts). Several supporting, recurring and minor figures from the classic Looney Tunes shorts such as [[Michigan J. Frog]], [[Sniffles]], [[Hubie and Bertie]], Mac and Tosh the [[Goofy Gophers]], [[Claude Cat]], [[Marc Antony and Pussyfoot]], [[Cecil Turtle]], [[Gabby Goat]], [[Blacque Jacque Shellacque]], [[Transylvania 6-5000 (1963 film)|Count Bloodcount]], [[Rabbit's Kin|Pete Puma]], [[Rocket-bye Baby|Mot Wilbur]] and Angelo Flea also made appearances.\n\nSeason 3 featured [[Axl Rose]] as a guest star in the episode \"Armageddon Outta Here\" and featured his first studio recording since 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/axl-rose-releases-his-first-new-song-in-a-decade-via-a-1831507427|title=Axl Rose releases his first new song in a decade\u2014via a Looney Tunes cartoon|last=Hughes|first=William|publisher=[[The A.V.

Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara, which are now in various states of preservation or dilapidation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the entire [[History of ancient Egypt|pharaonic period]]. It remained an essential complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000&nbsp;years, well into [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.\n\nNorth of the area, known as Saqqara lies [[Abusir]],  and south lies [[Dahshur]]. The area running from [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]] to Dahshur has been used as a necropolis by the inhabitants of Memphis at different times, and it was designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/86 |title=Memphis and its Necropolis&nbsp;\u2013 the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur&nbsp;\u2014 UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>\nSome scholars believe that the name Saqqara is not derived from the ancient Egyptian funerary deity, [[Seker|Sokar]], but supposedly, from a local Berber Tribe called Beni Saqqar.<ref>Graindorge, Catherine, \"Sokar.\" In Redford, Donald B., (ed) ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt'', vol.

During this time, the royal burial ground was at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. The first royal burials at Saqqara, comprising underground galleries, date to the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]]. The last Second Dynasty king, [[Khasekhemwy]], was buried in his tomb at Abydos, but also built a funerary monument at Saqqara consisting of a large rectangular enclosure, known as [[Gisr el-Mudir]]. It probably inspired the great enclosure wall around the Step Pyramid complex. Djoser's funerary complex, built by the royal architect [[Imhotep]], further comprises a large number of dummy buildings and a secondary mastaba (the so-called 'Southern Tomb'). French architect and Egyptologist [[Jean-Philippe Lauer]] spent the more significant part of his life excavating and restoring Djoser's funerary complex.\n\n====Early Dynastic monuments====\n*tomb of king [[Hotepsekhemwy]] or [[Raneb]]\n*tomb of king [[Nynetjer]]\n*[[Buried Pyramid]], funerary complex of king [[Sekhemkhet]]\n*[[Gisr el-Mudir]], funerary complex of king [[Khasekhemwy]]\n*[[Pyramid of Djoser|Step Pyramid]], funerary complex of king [[Djoser]]\n[[File:Saqqara BW 1.jpg|thumb|right|Funerary complex of Djoser]]\n\n===Old Kingdom===\n[[File:\u00c4gyptisches Museum Kairo 2016-03-29 Ka-aper 01.jpg|thumb|Wooden statue of the scribe [[Kaaper]], 5th or 4th dynasty of the [[Old Kingdom]], from Saqqara, c. 2500 BC]]\n\nNearly all [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] kings chose a different location for their [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. During the second half of the [[Old Kingdom]], under the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth]] and [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth]] Dynasties, Saqqara was again the royal burial ground. The Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids are not built wholly of massive stone blocks, but instead with a core consisting of rubble. Consequently, they are less well preserved than the world-famous pyramids built by the Fourth Dynasty kings at [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]]. [[Unas]], the last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, was the first king to adorn the chambers in his pyramid with [[Pyramid Texts]]. During the Old Kingdom, it was customary for courtiers to be buried in mastaba tombs close to the pyramid of their king. Thus, clusters of private tombs were formed in Saqqara around the pyramid complexes of Unas and [[Teti]].\n\n====Old Kingdom monuments====\n*[[Mastabet el-Fara'un]], tomb of king [[Shepseskaf]] (Dynasty Four)\n*[[Pyramid of Userkaf|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Userkaf]] (Dynasty Five)\n*[[Pyramid of Djedkare-Isesi|Haram el-Shawaf]], pyramid complex of king [[Djedkare Isesi|Djedkare]]\n*Pyramid of king [[Menkauhor Kaiu|Menkauhor]]\n*Mastaba of Ti\n*Mastaba of the Two Brothers ([[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum]])\n*[[Pyramid of Unas|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Unas]]\n*Mastaba of [[Ptahhotep]]\n*[[Pyramid of Teti|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Teti]] (Dynasty Six)\n*Mastaba of [[Mereruka]]\n*Mastaba of Kagemni\n*[[Tomb of Akhethetep|Mastaba of Akhethetep]]\n*[[Pyramid of Pepi I|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]]\n*[[Pyramid of Merenre|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I|Merenre]]\n*Pyramid complex of king [[Pepi II Neferkare|Pepi II]]\n*[[Tomb of Perneb]] (now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of New York)\n\n====First Intermediate Period monuments====\n*[[Qakare Ibi#Pyramid complex|Pyramid]] of king [[Qakare Ibi|Ibi]] (Dynasty Eight)\n\n===Middle Kingdom===\nFrom the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onward, Memphis was no longer the capital of the country, and kings built their funerary complexes elsewhere.

From the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] onward, many high officials built tombs at Saqqara. While still a general, [[Horemheb]] built a large tomb here, although he later was buried as pharaoh in the [[Valley of the Kings]] at Thebes. Other important tombs belong to the vizier [[Aperel]], the vizier [[Neferrenpet]], the artist [[Tomb of Thutmose|Thutmose]], and the wet-nurse of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Maia (nurse)|Maia]].\n\nMany monuments from earlier periods were still standing but dilapidated by this period. Prince [[Khaemweset]], son of Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], made repairs to buildings at Saqqara. Among other things, he restored the [[Pyramid of Unas]] and added an inscription to its south face to commemorate the restoration. He enlarged the [[Serapeum of Saqqara|Serapeum]], the burial site of the mummified [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis bulls]], and was later buried in the catacombs. The Serapeum, containing one undisturbed interment of an Apis bull and the tomb of Khaemweset, was rediscovered by the French Egyptologist [[Auguste Mariette]] in 1851.\n\n====New Kingdom monuments====\n*Several clusters of tombs of high officials, among which the tombs of [[Horemheb]] and of [[Maya (Egyptian)|Maya]] and Merit. Reliefs and statues from these two tombs are on display in the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] at Leiden, the Netherlands, and in the [[British Museum]], London.\n\n===After the New Kingdom===\nDuring the periods after the New Kingdom, when several cities in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] served as the capital of Egypt, Saqqara remained in use as a burial ground for nobles. Moreover, the area became an important destination for pilgrims to several cult centres. Activities sprang up around the Serapeum, and extensive underground galleries were cut into the rock as burial sites for large numbers of mummified ibises, baboons, cats, dogs, and falcons.\n\n====Monuments of the Late Period, the Graeco-Roman and later periods====\n*Several shaft tombs of officials of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]\n*[[Serapeum of Saqqara|Serapeum]] (the larger part dating to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaeic Period]])\n*The so-called 'Philosophers circle', a monument to important [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thinkers and poets, consisting of statues of [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Pindar]], [[Plato]], and others (Ptolemaic)\n*Several [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] monasteries, among which the [[Monastery of Apa Jeremias]] ([[Egypt (Roman province)#Byzantine Egypt|Byzantine]] and [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Early Islamic]] Periods)\n\n==Site looting during 2011 protests==\nSaqqara and the surrounding areas of [[Abusir]] and Dahshur suffered damage by looters during the [[2011 Egyptian protests]].

Another 16 Egyptian kings built pyramids at Saqqara, which are now in various states of preservation or dilapidation. High officials added private funeral monuments to this necropolis during the entire [[History of ancient Egypt|pharaonic period]]. It remained an important complex for non-royal burials and cult ceremonies for more than 3,000&nbsp;years, well into [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.\n\nNorth of the area known as Saqqara lies [[Abusir]],  and south lies [[Dahshur]]. The area running from [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]] to Dahshur has been used as a necropolis by the inhabitants of Memphis at different times, and it was designated as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/86 |title=Memphis and its Necropolis&nbsp;\u2013 the Pyramid Fields from Giza to Dahshur&nbsp;\u2014 UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}</ref>\nSome scholars believe that the name Saqqara is not derived from the ancient Egyptian funerary deity, [[Seker|Sokar]], but supposedly, from a local Berber Tribe called Beni Saqqar.<ref>Graindorge, Catherine, \"Sokar\".

During this time, the royal burial ground was at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. The first royal burials at Saqqara, comprising underground galleries, date to the [[Second dynasty of Egypt|Second Dynasty]]. The last Second Dynasty king, [[Khasekhemwy]], was buried in his tomb at Abydos, but also built a funerary monument at Saqqara consisting of a large rectangular enclosure, known as [[Gisr el-Mudir]]. It probably inspired the monumental enclosure wall around the Step Pyramid complex. Djoser's funerary complex, built by the royal architect [[Imhotep]], further comprises a large number of dummy buildings and a secondary mastaba (the so-called 'Southern Tomb'). French architect and Egyptologist [[Jean-Philippe Lauer]] spent the greater part of his life excavating and restoring Djoser's funerary complex.\n\n====Early Dynastic monuments====\n*tomb of king [[Hotepsekhemwy]] or [[Raneb]]\n*tomb of king [[Nynetjer]]\n*[[Buried Pyramid]], funerary complex of king [[Sekhemkhet]]\n*[[Gisr el-Mudir]], funerary complex of king [[Khasekhemwy]]\n*[[Pyramid of Djoser|Step Pyramid]], funerary complex of king [[Djoser]]\n[[File:Saqqara BW 1.jpg|thumb|right|Funerary complex of Djoser]]\n\n===Old Kingdom===\n[[File:\u00c4gyptisches Museum Kairo 2016-03-29 Ka-aper 01.jpg|thumb|Wooden statue of the scribe [[Kaaper]], 5th or 4th dynasty of the [[Old Kingdom]], from Saqqara, c. 2500 BC]]\n\nNearly all [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] kings chose a different location for their [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]]. During the second half of the [[Old Kingdom]], under the [[Fifth dynasty of Egypt|Fifth]] and [[Sixth dynasty of Egypt|Sixth]] Dynasties, Saqqara was again the royal burial ground. The Fifth and Sixth Dynasty pyramids are not built wholly of massive stone blocks, but instead with a core consisting of rubble. Consequently, they are less well preserved than the world-famous pyramids built by the Fourth Dynasty kings at [[Giza Necropolis|Giza]]. [[Unas]], the last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty, was the first king to adorn the chambers in his pyramid with [[Pyramid Texts]]. During the Old Kingdom, it was customary for courtiers to be buried in mastaba tombs close to the pyramid of their king. Thus, clusters of private tombs were formed in Saqqara around the pyramid complexes of Unas and [[Teti]].\n\n====Old Kingdom monuments====\n*[[Mastabet el-Fara'un]], tomb of king [[Shepseskaf]] (Dynasty Four)\n*[[Pyramid of Userkaf|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Userkaf]] (Dynasty Five)\n*[[Pyramid of Djedkare-Isesi|Haram el-Shawaf]], pyramid complex of king [[Djedkare Isesi|Djedkare]]\n*Pyramid of king [[Menkauhor Kaiu|Menkauhor]]\n*Mastaba of Ti\n*Mastaba of the Two Brothers ([[Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum]])\n*[[Pyramid of Unas|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Unas]]\n*Mastaba of [[Ptahhotep]]\n*[[Pyramid of Teti|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Teti]] (Dynasty Six)\n*Mastaba of [[Mereruka]]\n*Mastaba of Kagemni\n*[[Tomb of Akhethetep|Mastaba of Akhethetep]]\n*[[Pyramid of Pepi I|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Pepi I Meryre|Pepi I]]\n*[[Pyramid of Merenre|Pyramid complex]] of king [[Merenre Nemtyemsaf I|Merenre]]\n*Pyramid complex of king [[Pepi II Neferkare|Pepi II]]\n*[[Tomb of Perneb]] (now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] of New York)\n\n====First Intermediate Period monuments====\n*[[Qakare Ibi#Pyramid complex|Pyramid]] of king [[Qakare Ibi|Ibi]] (Dynasty Eight)\n\n===Middle Kingdom===\nFrom the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] onward, Memphis was no longer the capital of the country, and kings built their funerary complexes elsewhere.

From the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] onward many high officials built tombs at Saqqara. While still a general, [[Horemheb]] built a large tomb here, although he later was buried as pharaoh in the [[Valley of the Kings]] at Thebes. Other important tombs belong to the vizier [[Aperel]], the vizier [[Neferrenpet]], the artist [[Tomb of Thutmose|Thutmose]], and the wet-nurse of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Maia (nurse)|Maia]].\n\nMany monuments from earlier periods were still standing, but dilapidated by this period. Prince [[Khaemweset]], son of Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]], made repairs to buildings at Saqqara. Among other things, he restored the [[Pyramid of Unas]] and added an inscription to its south face to commemorate the restoration. He enlarged the [[Serapeum of Saqqara|Serapeum]], the burial site of the mummified [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis bulls]], and was later buried in the catacombs. The Serapeum, containing one undisturbed interment of an Apis bull and the tomb of Khaemweset, were rediscovered by the French Egyptologist [[Auguste Mariette]] in 1851.\n\n====New Kingdom monuments====\n*Several clusters of tombs of high officials, among which the tombs of [[Horemheb]] and of [[Maya (Egyptian)|Maya]] and Merit. Reliefs and statues from these two tombs are on display in the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden|National Museum of Antiquities]] at Leiden, the Netherlands, and in the [[British Museum]], London.\n\n===After the New Kingdom===\nDuring the periods after the New Kingdom, when several cities in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] served as capital of Egypt, Saqqara remained in use as a burial ground for nobles. Moreover, the area became an important destination for pilgrims to a number of cult centres. Activities sprang up around the Serapeum, and extensive underground galleries were cut into the rock as burial sites for large numbers of mummified ibises, baboons, cats, dogs, and falcons.\n\n====Monuments of the Late Period, the Graeco-Roman and later periods====\n*Several shaft tombs of officials of the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]\n*[[Serapeum of Saqqara|Serapeum]] (the larger part dating to the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaeic Period]])\n*The so-called 'Philosophers circle', a monument to important [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] thinkers and poets, consisting of statues of [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Pindar]], [[Plato]], and others (Ptolemaeic)\n*Several [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] monasteries, among which the [[Monastery of Apa Jeremias]] ([[Egypt (Roman province)#Byzantine Egypt|Byzantine]] and [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Early Islamic]] Periods)\n\n==Site looting during 2011 protests==\nSaqqara and the surrounding areas of [[Abusir]] and Dahshur suffered damage by looters during the [[2011 Egyptian protests]].

The scientists identified that most of the bodies were poorly preserved and all organic materials, as well as, the wooden caskets decayed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://polandin.com/43249026/polish-archeologists-uncover-egyptian-mummies|title=Polish archeologists uncover Egyptian mummies|last=S.A|first=Telewizja Polska|website=polandin.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://scienceinpoland.pap.pl/en/news/news%2C77724%2Cdozens-mummies-discovered-polish-archaeologists-next-worlds-oldest-pyramid.html|title=Dozens of mummies discovered by Polish archaeologists next to the world`s oldest pyramid|website=Science in Poland|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/dozens-of-mummies-dating-back-2000-years-found-next-to-worlds-oldest-pyramid-6545|title=Dozens of mummies dating back 2,000 years found next to world\u2019s oldest pyramid|website=www.thefirstnews.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=Most of the mummies we discovered last season were very modest, they were only subjected to basic embalming treatments, wrapped in bandages and placed directly in pits dug in the sand|sign=Dr. Kamil Kuraszkiewicz.|source=}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Imhotep Museum]]\n*[[List of Egyptian pyramids]]\n*[[Saqqara Bird]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090703112911/http://www.ancient-egypt.org/topography/saqqara/index.html Information on Saqqara]\n*[http://www.saqqara.nl Saqqara.nl (Friends of Saqqara Foundation)]\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6379431.stm Discoveries on the site from February 2007]\n*[http://www.sas.upenn.edu/aamw/resources/fieldwork/#Saqqara%20%28Egypt%29 University of Pennsylvania Museum excavations at Saqqara]\n*[http://www.historvius.com/saqqara-50/ Saqqara Information - Historvius]\n\n{{Memphis Necropolis}}\n{{Ancient Egypt topics}}\n\n[[Category:Memphis, Egypt]]\n[[Category:Saqqara]]\n[[Category:Giza Governorate]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Egypt]]\n", "name_user": "Broadwood-park", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling, punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara"}
