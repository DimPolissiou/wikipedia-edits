He was the head coach for both the [[Phoenix Suns]] (2013\u20132016) and the [[New York Knicks]] (2016\u20132018) of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). He played [[shooting guard]] in the NBA from [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986]] through [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]].\n\n==Elementary and high school==\nHe attended Komarek Elementary School in [[North Riverside, Illinois]], and Gurrie Middle School and [[Lyons Township High School]] in [[La Grange, Illinois|La Grange]], [[Cook County, Illinois]].\n\n==College==\nHornacek [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State University]] (ISU) in 1981; he was a team [[wiktionary:walk-on|walk-on]] who played from 1982 to 1986.<ref name=\"NBA bio\">{{cite web|title=Jeff Hornacek bio|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jeff_hornacek/bio.html|publisher=NBA|accessdate=June 21, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628192524/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jeff_hornacek/bio.html|archivedate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> The son of a high school basketball coach, he became an all-conference player in the [[Big Eight Conference]], playing for coach [[Johnny Orr (basketball, born 1927)|Johnny Orr]]. As a [[point guard]] he guided the [[Iowa State Cyclones|Cyclones]] to the Sweet Sixteen of the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|tournament]]. His shining moment came at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]] when, after first hitting a shot to tie the game and send it to [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], Hornacek hit the game winning shot in overtime, a 26-foot jumper at the buzzer, to give ISU its first NCAA tournament victory since [[1944 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1944]], beating [[Miami RedHawks|Miami University]], March 14, 1986, 81\u201379. Two days later, he led the Cyclones to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen, in a 72\u201369 upset of second seed [[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]]. Orr, who had previously left Michigan to coach at Iowa State, called it the greatest victory of his career. Hornacek left ISU with a Big-8 record of 665 career assists and 1,313 career points. He was the fourth player in Cyclone basketball history to have his number retired when his No. 14 jersey was hung from the rafters of [[Hilton Coliseum]] in 1991.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Phoenix Suns===\n[[File:Jeff Hornacek - Phoenix Suns.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Hornacek in 1987]]\nHe was the 22nd pick in the second round (46th overall) of the [[1986 NBA draft]], by the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The 2nd round draft pick that was used to select him was traded three times before finally ending up with the Suns.  First, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] packaged it in the deal to acquire [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] from the [[San Diego Clippers]] before the 1983\u201384 season.  A week later, the Clippers sent the pick to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a deal to acquire [[Ricky Pierce]], and on that same day, the Pistons dealt the pick to the Suns for [[David Thirdkill]].\n\nThe Suns struggled in Hornacek's first two seasons, but after hiring [[Cotton Fitzsimmons]] as coach and acquiring free agent [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]], the Suns went from 28 wins in 1987\u201388 to 55 in 1988\u201389.  Hornacek was a \"third option\" on offense after Chambers and [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]].  This trio led the Suns to four straight NBA playoff appearances, including two Western Conference Finals.\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nAfter his sixth and most productive season in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]], in which he led the Suns in scoring average (20.1 ppg) and earned an [[All-Star]] appearance, Hornacek was traded (along with [[Andrew Lang (basketball)|Andrew Lang]] and [[Tim Perry]]) to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for [[Charles Barkley]]. With [[Hersey Hawkins]], the Sixers' leading scorer, in the shooting guard position, Hornacek was assigned point guard responsibilities.  Although he had a career high 6.9 assists per game in his only complete season with the Sixers ([[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393 season]]), his stint as a point guard was not a success (26 wins, 56 losses). Midway through the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] (February 24) he was traded to the [[Utah Jazz]] (for [[Jeff Malone]]) where he could return to his natural shooting guard position alongside [[John Stockton]].\n\n===Utah Jazz===\nLike in Phoenix, Hornacek was a complementary \"third option\" to [[Karl Malone]] and Stockton. Hornacek was also one of the best on offense in the NBA in moving without the ball, something essential for a shooting guard. He was an instrumental part of the Jazz's drive to the NBA Finals in [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]], where the Jazz lost to the [[Chicago Bulls]] both times.  He remained with the Jazz until knee problems forced his retirement in 2000.  It was revealed that he has no left meniscus due to wear and tear on his body, so bad that he could have needed [[knee reconstruction]] because it also is arthritic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/813381/Jeff-Hornacek-Battle-on-Wounded-Knee.html?pg=all|title=Jeff Hornacek: Battle on Wounded Knee|date=April 21, 2000|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn November 23, 1994, he set a then-NBA record with eight consecutive three-pointers in a single game against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. That same season, he also tied an NBA record 11 consecutive three-pointers, from December 30, 1994 through January 11, 1995. One of the best [[free throw]] shooters in the league, once making 67 in a row (November 12, 1999 \u2013 January 6, 2000), one of his most well-known mannerisms was stroking the side of his face three times before every free-throw attempt.

He played [[shooting guard]] in the NBA from [[1986\u201387 NBA season|1986]] through [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]].\n\n==Elementary and high school==\nHe attended Komarek Elementary School in [[North Riverside, Illinois]], and Gurrie Middle School and [[Lyons Township High School]] in [[La Grange, Illinois|La Grange]], [[Cook County, Illinois]].\n\n==College==\nHornacek [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] at [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State University]] (ISU) in 1981; he was a team [[wiktionary:walk-on|walk-on]] who played from 1982 to 1986.<ref name=\"NBA bio\">{{cite web|title=Jeff Hornacek bio|url=http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jeff_hornacek/bio.html|publisher=NBA|accessdate=June 21, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628192524/http://www.nba.com/playerfile/jeff_hornacek/bio.html|archivedate=June 28, 2011}}</ref> The son of a high school basketball coach, he became an all-conference player in the [[Big Eight Conference]], playing for coach [[Johnny Orr (basketball, born 1927)|Johnny Orr]]. As a [[point guard]] he guided the [[Iowa State Cyclones|Cyclones]] to the Sweet Sixteen of the [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|tournament]]. His shining moment came at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] in [[Minneapolis]] when, after first hitting a shot to tie the game and send it to [[overtime (sports)|overtime]], Hornacek hit the game winning shot in overtime, a 26-foot jumper at the buzzer, to give ISU its first NCAA tournament victory since [[1944 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1944]], beating [[Miami RedHawks|Miami University]], March 14, 1986, 81\u201379. Two days later, he led the Cyclones to the NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen, in a 72\u201369 upset of second seed [[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]]. Orr, who had previously left Michigan to coach at Iowa State, called it the greatest victory of his career. Hornacek left ISU with a Big-8 record of 665 career assists and 1,313 career points. He was the fourth player in Cyclone basketball history to have his number retired when his No. 14 jersey was hung from the rafters of [[Hilton Coliseum]] in 1991.\n\n==NBA career==\n\n===Phoenix Suns===\n[[File:Jeff Hornacek - Phoenix Suns.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Hornacek in 1987]]\nHe was the 22nd pick in the second round (46th overall) of the [[1986 NBA draft]], by the [[Phoenix Suns]]. The 2nd round draft pick that was used to select him was traded three times before finally ending up with the Suns.  First, the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] packaged it in the deal to acquire [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] from the [[San Diego Clippers]] before the 1983\u201384 season.  A week later, the Clippers sent the pick to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a deal to acquire [[Ricky Pierce]], and on that same day, the Pistons dealt the pick to the Suns for [[David Thirdkill]].\n\nThe Suns struggled in Hornacek's first two seasons, but after hiring [[Cotton Fitzsimmons]] as coach and acquiring free agent [[Tom Chambers (basketball)|Tom Chambers]], the Suns went from 28 wins in 1987\u201388 to 55 in 1988\u201389.  Hornacek was a \"third option\" on offense after Chambers and [[Kevin Johnson (basketball)|Kevin Johnson]].  This trio led the Suns to four straight NBA playoff appearances, including two Western Conference Finals.\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nAfter his sixth and most productive season in [[1991\u201392 NBA season|1991\u201392]], in which he led the Suns in scoring average (20.1 ppg) and earned an [[All-Star]] appearance, Hornacek was traded (along with [[Andrew Lang (basketball)|Andrew Lang]] and [[Tim Perry]]) to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] for [[Charles Barkley]]. With [[Hersey Hawkins]], the Sixers' leading scorer, in the shooting guard position, Hornacek was assigned point guard responsibilities.  Although he had a career high 6.9 assists per game in his only complete season with the Sixers ([[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393 season]]), his stint as a point guard was not a success (26 wins, 56 losses). Midway through the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]] (February 24) he was traded to the [[Utah Jazz]] (for [[Jeff Malone]]) where he could return to his natural shooting guard position alongside [[John Stockton]].\n\n===Utah Jazz===\nLike in Phoenix, Hornacek was a complementary \"third option\" to [[Karl Malone]] and Stockton. Hornacek was also one of the best on offense in the NBA in moving without the ball, something essential for a shooting guard. He was an instrumental part of the Jazz's drive to the NBA Finals in [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]], where the Jazz lost to the [[Chicago Bulls]] both times.  He remained with the Jazz until knee problems forced his retirement in 2000.  It was revealed that he has no left meniscus due to wear and tear on his body, so bad that he could have needed [[knee reconstruction]] because it also is arthritic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/813381/Jeff-Hornacek-Battle-on-Wounded-Knee.html?pg=all|title=Jeff Hornacek: Battle on Wounded Knee|date=April 21, 2000|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn November 23, 1994, he set a then-NBA record with eight consecutive three-pointers in a single game against the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. That same season, he also tied an NBA record 11 consecutive three-pointers, from December 30, 1994 through January 11, 1995. One of the best [[free throw]] shooters in the league, once making 67 in a row (November 12, 1999 \u2013 January 6, 2000), one of his most well-known mannerisms was stroking the side of his face three times before every free-throw attempt.

Hornacek also coached the Suns' Summer League team during the 2013 season in Las Vegas. In his first game as head coach at the Summer League, he helped lead the team to an 82\u201369 victory over the [[Portland Trail Blazers]]. The Suns went on a six-game winning streak before ultimately losing in the inaugural championship round to the [[Golden State Warriors]] 91\u201377. Hornacek was 5\u20132 in pre-season and he started the [[2013\u201314 NBA season]] with a 104\u201391 victory over the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and an 87\u201384 victory over the [[Utah Jazz]], both times at home. Hornacek also became the team's first ever head coach to start out his coaching stint with a 4\u20130 record at home games.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nHornacek won the NBA Coach of the Month award in December 2013, his first coaching honor, after leading the Suns to a 10\u20133 record during the month. Hornacek also became the third former NBA player to win both Player of the Month and Coach of the Month awards (after [[Larry Bird]] and [[Larry Drew]]), and the first coach to receive both awards with the same team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2014/1/2/5267248/phoenix-suns-jeff-hornacek-wins-western-conference-coach-of-the-month|title=Hornacek named Western Conference Coach of Month|publisher=|date=January 2, 2014}}</ref> For the season, the Suns improved by 23 victories upon the previous season's record, which led to a 48\u201334 record in Hornacek's first season as a head coach. This accomplishment lead to the Phoenix Suns becoming the most improved team during the 2013\u201314 NBA season. Despite the improvement, the Suns still missed the playoffs and Hornacek was the runner-up coach in the [[NBA Coach of the Year Award]] receiving 37 1st place votes.

Development typically progresses through a number of phases.  Broad ''position paper''s are first exchanged, introducing each side's aims and ambitions for each aspect.  These are followed by ''textual proposals'' from each side, accompanied (in areas such as tariffs, and market access) by each side's \"initial offer.\" These negotiations and draft documents can evolve (change) through the various stages of their development. When both sides are ready, a ''consolidated text'' is prepared, with remaining differences for discussion expressed in square brackets. These texts are then provisionally closed topic by topic as a working consensus is reached.  However the agreement is negotiated as a whole, so no topic's text is finalised until full consensus is reached.<ref>[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1126 Commission publishes state of play of TTIP negotiations ahead of 6th round of talks], European Commission DG Trade, 11 July 2014</ref>\n\n===Negotiation rounds===\nNegotiations are held in week-long cycles alternating between Brussels and the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/documents-and-events/index_en.htm#negotiation-rounds |title=Documents and events \u2013 Negotiation rounds |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= [[European Commission|EU Commission]] |accessdate= 4 August 2015}}</ref> The negotiators were hoping to conclude their work by the end of 2016.<ref name=\"trade.ec.europa.eu\">{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/april/tradoc_154477.pdf |title=The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) State of Play |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}</ref>\n\n* The 1st round of negotiations: 7\u201312 July 2013 in Washington DC \n* The 2nd round of negotiations: 11\u201315 November 2013 in Brussels \n* The 3rd round of negotiations: 16\u201321 December 2013 in Washington DC \n* The 4th round of negotiations: 10\u201314 March 2014 in Brussels \n* The 5th round of negotiations: 19\u201323 May 2014 in Arlington, Virginia\n* The 6th round of negotiations: 13\u201318 July 2014 in Brussels \n* The 7th round of negotiations: 29 September \u2013 3 October 2014 in Chevy Chase, Maryland\n* The 8th round of negotiations: 2\u20136 February 2015 in Brussels \n* The 9th round of negotiations: 20\u201324 April 2015 in New York \n* The 10th round of negotiations: 13\u201317 July 2015 in Brussels\n* The 11th round of negotiations: 19\u201323 October 2015 in Miami\n* The 12th round of negotiations: 22\u201326 February 2016 in Brussels\n* The 13th round of negotiations: 25\u201329 April 2016 in New York\n* The 14th round of negotiations: 11\u201315 July 2016 in Brussels\n* The 15th round of negotiations: 3\u20137 October 2016 in New York\n\n===Confidentiality measures===\nOnly a few people can access the documents known as \"consolidated texts\", the drafts containing the most recent results of the negotiations.

Development typically progresses through a number of phases.  Broad ''position paper''s are first exchanged, introducing each side's aims and ambitions for each aspect.  These are followed by ''textual proposals'' from each side, accompanied (in areas such as tariffs, and market access) by each side's \"initial offer.\" These negotiations and draft documents can evolve (change) through the various stages of their development. When both sides are ready, a ''consolidated text'' is prepared, with remaining differences for discussion expressed in square brackets. These texts are then provisionally closed topic by topic as a working consensus is reached.  However the agreement is negotiated as a whole, so no topic's text is finalised until full consensus is reached.<ref>[http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1126 Commission publishes state of play of TTIP negotiations ahead of 6th round of talks], European Commission DG Trade, 11 July 2014</ref>\n\n===Negotiation rounds===\nNegotiations are held in week-long cycles alternating between Brussels and the USA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/documents-and-events/index_en.htm#negotiation-rounds |title=Documents and events \u2013 Negotiation rounds |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= [[European Commission|EU Commission]] |accessdate= 4 August 2015}}</ref> The negotiators were hoping to conclude their work by the end of 2016.<ref name=\"trade.ec.europa.eu\">{{cite web|url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/april/tradoc_154477.pdf |title=The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) State of Play |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}</ref>\n\n* The 1st round of negotiations: 7\u201312 July 2013 in Washington DC \n* The 2nd round of negotiations: 11\u201315 November 2013 in Brussels \n* The 3rd round of negotiations: 16\u201321 December 2013 in Washington DC \n* The 4th round of negotiations: 10\u201314 March 2014 in Brussels \n* The 5th round of negotiations: 19\u201323 May 2014 in Arlington, Virginia\n* The 6th round of negotiations: 13\u201318 July 2014 in Brussels \n* The 7th round of negotiations: 29 September \u2013 3 October 2014 in Chevy Chase, Maryland\n* The 8th round of negotiations: 2\u20136 February 2015 in Brussels \n* The 9th round of negotiations: 20\u201324 April 2015 in New York \n* The 10th round of negotiations: 13\u201317 July 2015 in Brussels\n* The 11th round of negotiations: 19\u201323 October 2015 in Miami\n* The 12th round of negotiations: 22\u201326 February 2016 in Brussels\n* The 13th round of negotiations: 25\u201329 April 2016 in New York\n* The 14th round of negotiations: 11\u201315 July 2016 in Brussels\n* The 15th round of negotiations: 3\u20137 October 2016 in New York\n\n===Confidentiality measures===\nOnly a few people can access the documents known as \"consolidated texts\", the drafts containing the most recent results of the negotiations.

It spread outward from '''Imerina''', the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] region primarily inhabited by the [[Merina people|Merina]] [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group]] with a spiritual capital at [[Ambohimanga]] and a political capital {{convert|24|km}} west at [[Antananarivo]], currently the seat of government for the modern state of Madagascar. The Merina kings and queens who ruled over greater Madagascar in the 19th century were the descendants of a [[List of Imerina monarchs|long line of hereditary Merina royalty]] originating with [[Andriamanelo]], who is traditionally credited with founding Imerina in 1540.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hova-Vazimba conflict===\n[[File:Imerina countryside riziere rice paddies Madagascar.jpg|thumb|alt=colorful rice paddies cover rolling hills|Andriamanelo waged war against the Vazimba in an effort to expel them from the highlands.]]\nMadagascar's central highlands were first inhabited between 200 BCE\u2013300 CE by the island's earliest settlers,<ref name = prehistory>{{cite journal | last = Crowley | first = B.E. | title = A refined chronology of prehistoric Madagascar and the demise of the megafauna | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 19\u201320 | pages = 2591\u20132603 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.06.030|bibcode = 2010QSRv...29.2591C }}</ref> the [[Vazimba]], who appear to have arrived by [[pirogue]] from southeastern [[Borneo]] to establish simple villages in the island's dense forests.{{sfn|Dahl|1991|p=72}} By the 15th century the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] people from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands<ref name=\"Campbell 1993\">{{cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Gwyn | title = The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750\u20131810 | journal = The International Journal of African Historical Studies | volume = 26 | issue = 1 |pages = 111\u2013148 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.2307/219188 }}</ref> where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings and queens.{{sfn|Ranaivoson|2005|p=35}} The two peoples coexisted peacefully for several generations and are known to have intermarried.

There he established the fortified compound (''rova'') that would form the heart of his new capital city of [[Antananarivo]].  Upon his orders, the first structures within this fortified compound (known as the [[Rova of Antananarivo]]) were constructed: several traditional royal houses were built, and plans for a series of royal tombs were designed. These buildings took on an enduring political and spiritual significance, ensuring their preservation until being destroyed by fire in 1995. Andrianjaka obtained a sizable cache of firearms and gunpowder, materials that helped to establish and preserve his dominance and expand his rule over greater Imerina.\n<!--\n===Establishing the Merina identity===\n\n-->\n\n===Expansion of sovereignty===\nPolitical life on the island from the 16th century was characterised by sporadic conflict between the Merina and Sakalava kingdoms, originating with Sakalava slave-hunting incursions into Imerina.\n\n===Division and civil war===\nKing [[Andriamasinavalona]] quartered the kingdom to be ruled by his four favourite sons, producing persistent fragmentation and warfare between principalities in Imerina. He extended the borders of the kingdom to their largest historical extent prior to the kingdom's fragmentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Reunification===\n[[File:Andrianampoinimerina.jpg|thumb|left|King Andrianampoinimerina (ca. 1787\u20131810)]]\nIt was from this context in 1787 that Prince Ramboasalama, nephew of King [[Andrianjafy]] of [[Ambohimanga]] (one of the four kingdoms of Imerina) expelled his uncle and took the throne under the name [[Andrianampoinimerina]]. The new king used both diplomacy and force to reunite Imerina with the intent to bring all of Madagascar under his rule.\n\n===Kingdom of Madagascar===\n[[File:Ranavalona III of Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranavalona III]] was the last monarch of Madagascar.]]\nThis objective was largely completed under his son, [[Radama I]], who was the first to admit and regularly engage European missionaries and diplomats in Antananarivo.\n\nThe 33-year reign of Queen [[Ranavalona I]], the widow of Radama I, was characterised by a struggle to preserve the cultural isolation of Madagascar from modernity, especially as represented by the French and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. Her son and heir, King [[Radama II]], signed the unpopular [[Lambert Charter]] giving French entrepreneur [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the [[andriana|aristocracy]], however, and Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]]  had the King strangled in a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. This aristocratic revolution saw [[Rasoherina]], the [[queen dowager]], placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a [[constitutional monarchy]] that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], who retained the role for three decades and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, [[Ranavalona II]], converted the nation to Christianity and had all the ''[[sampy]]'' (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen [[Ranavalona III]], acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to [[R\u00e9union Island]] and later [[French Algeria]] following [[French Madagascar|French colonisation]] of the island in 1896.\n\n===French colonisation===\n{{main|Franco-Hova Wars}}\n[[File:FrenchTroopsMadagasgar.jpg|thumb|Landing of the ''40th Battaillon de Chasseur \u00e0 Pieds'' in [[Majunga]], between 5 and 24 May 1895.]]\nAngry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, [[French Third Republic|France]] invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the [[First Madagascar expedition|First Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' referring to the ''[[andriana]]''). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Di\u00e9go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert. Meanwhile, in Europe, diplomats [[Berlin Conference|partitioning the African continent]] worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], ceded its rights over [[Heligoland]] to the [[German Empire]] and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement proved detrimental for the monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain.\n\nIn 1895, a French [[flying column|flying-column]] landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city's defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French [[Protectorate|protection]] as the [[Malagasy Protectorate]] and in 1897 the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty.{{Sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=142}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Spatial organization===\n[[File:Map of sacred hills of Imerina Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=map showing villages of highland Madagascar around Antananarivo|Sacred hills of Imerina]]\nAndriamanelo established the first fortified ''[[Rova (Madagascar)|rova]]'' (royal compound) at his capital at Alasora. This fortified palace bore specific features - ''[[Architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|hadivory]]'' (dry moats), ''hadifetsy'' (defensive trenches) and ''vavahady'' (town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier) - that rendered the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks.{{Sfn|de la Vassi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|p=62}}\n\nAndrianjaka's policies and tactics highlighted and increased the separation between the king and his subjects. He transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom.{{Sfn|Campbell|2005|p=120}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndrianjaka unified the principalities on what he later designated as the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]] at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka.<ref name=\"Ark2\"/> These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when [[Andrianampoinimerina]] redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.{{Sfn|Administration coloniale|1898|p=895}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nUnder Andriamasinavalona, the Kingdom of Imerina was composed of six provinces (''toko''): Avaradrano, constituting Antananarivo and land to the northeast of the capital, including Ambohimanga; Vakinisisaony, including the land to the south of Avaradrano and its capital at Alasora; Vonizongo to the northwest of Antananarivo with its capital at Fihaonana; Marovatana to the south of Vonizongo, with its capital at Ambohidratrimo; Ambodirano, south of Marovatana with its capital at Fenoarivo; and Vakinankaratra to the south of Antananarivo with its capital at Betafo. Andrianampoinimerina reunited these provinces and added Imamo to the west, which has been described by some historians as having been incorporated into Ambodirano, and by others as separate from it; and Valalafotsy to the northwest.  Together, these areas constitute the core territory rightly called Imerina, the homeland of the Merina people.{{Sfn|Campbell|2012|p=500}}\n\n==Social organization==\n\n===Caste system===\nAndriamanelo was reportedly the first to formally establish the [[andriana]] as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society.{{Sfn|Miller|Rowlands|1989|p=143}} From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140&ndash;154}} The first sub-divisions of the ''[[andriana]]'' noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}}\n\nAndrianjaka was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo, his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana (seven tombs placed in a row on the Rova grounds).<ref name = Piolet>Piolet (1895), pp. 209&ndash;210</ref> To commemorate his greatness, his subjects erected a small wooden house called a [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|small sacred house]] on top of his tomb.  Future [[Merina]] sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Malagasy mythology}}\nAndriamanelo is credited with introducing [[astrology]] (''sikidy'') in Imerina.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} The Merina rite of [[circumcision]], described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century. The origins of these practices can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers.{{Sfn|Radimilahy|1993|pp=478-483}}\n\n[[File:Sampy talisman idol Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=boar tusks and metal trinkets fastened with twine to a cluster of wooden dowels|Each ''sampy'' was fashioned from diverse components.]]\nUnder Andriamanelo's son Ralambo, the sovereign became imbued with increasing power to protect the realm. This was preserved by honoring the ''[[sampy]]'', traditional amulets made from assorted natural materials. Amulets and idols called ''ody'' had long occupied an important place among many [[ethnic groups of Madagascar]], but these were believed to offer protection to the individual wearer only and were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. After Ralambo received a highly powerful ''sampy'' called Kelimalaza that was distinguished by its supposed capacity to extend protection to an entire community, he sought out and amassed a total of twelve others from communities across Imerina believed to have such a quality. These sampy were personified&mdash;complete with a distinct personality&mdash;and offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo then transformed the nature of the relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the king's sovereignty and the integrity of the state, which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampy&mdash;twelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmology&mdash;and transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.{{Sfn|Graeber|2007|pp=35&ndash;38}}  Oral history recounts numerous instances where sampy were taken into battle, and subsequent successes and varying miracles were attributed to them, including several key victories against [[Sakalava]] marauders.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=63&ndash;71}} The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}} These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the ''sampin'andriana'': the \"Royal Sampy\") which were all in the possession of the king.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}} These royal sampy, including ''Kelimalaza'', continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen [[Ranavalona II]] upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869.{{Sfn|Oliver|1886|p=118}}\n\nAlso beginning under Ralambo, the ritual sanctification of the realm occurred through the annual ''fandroana'' festival at the start of each year. Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts provide insight into the festival as it was practiced at that time.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&ndash;70}} Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an \"orgy\") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&ndash;70}} On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to [[Anointing|anoint]] the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=285&ndash;290}} Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as ''jaka'', a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with [[suet]] in a decorative clay jar. The [[confit]] would then be conserved in a pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=29}}\n\n===Customs===\nThe marriage tradition of the ''vodiondry'', still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry&mdash;meat from the hindquarters of a sheep&mdash;which he believed to be the tastiest portion.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kent | first = R.K. | title = Madagascar and Africa II: The Sakalava, Maroserana, Dady and Tromba before 1700 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 517&ndash;546 | year = 1968 | doi = 10.1017/S0021853700009026 | ref = harv}}</ref> The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due.

While the Vazimba had historically tended to favor rule by queens, the Hova favored male heirs, and the marriage between Andriamanelo's Vazimba and Hova parents had produced two sons and a daughter. To prevent conflict, the queen decided that Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother.{{Sfn|Kus|1982|pp=47-62}} This system of succession was ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=239}}  Ralambo was the first Merina sovereign to practice polygamy, and his second wife was the first to give him a son. While his younger son by his first wife was to rule, Ralambo sought to assuage the elder son by declaring that the crown could henceforth only be passed to a child born of the reigning sovereign and a princess from the elder son Andriantompokoindrindra's family line.<ref name=\"iarivo\">{{Cite web|last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e?url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |language=French |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is believed to have originated with Ralambo.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}\n\nImerina was initially ruled under Andriamanelo from his mother's home village of Alasora.

Her son and heir, King [[Radama II]], signed the unpopular [[Lambert Charter]] giving French entrepreneur [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the [[andriana|aristocracy]], however, and Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]]  had the King strangled in a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. This aristocratic revolution saw [[Rasoherina]], the [[queen dowager]], placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a [[constitutional monarchy]] that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], who retained the role for three decades and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, [[Ranavalona II]], converted the nation to Christianity and had all the ''[[sampy]]'' (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen [[Ranavalona III]], acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to [[R\u00e9union Island]] and later [[French Algeria]] following [[French Madagascar|French colonisation]] of the island in 1896.\n\n===French colonisation===\n{{main|Franco-Hova Wars}}\n[[File:FrenchTroopsMadagasgar.jpg|thumb|Landing of the ''40th Battaillon de Chasseur \u00e0 Pieds'' in [[Majunga]], between 5 and 24 May 1895.]]\nAngry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, [[French Third Republic|France]] invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the [[First Madagascar expedition|First Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' referring to the ''[[andriana]]''). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Di\u00e9go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert. Meanwhile, in Europe, diplomats [[Berlin Conference|partitioning the African continent]] worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], ceded its rights over [[Heligoland]] to the [[German Empire]] and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement proved detrimental for the monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain.\n\nIn 1895, a French [[flying column|flying-column]] landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city's defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French [[Protectorate|protection]] as the [[Malagasy Protectorate]] and in 1897 the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty.{{Sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=142}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Spatial organization===\n[[File:Map of sacred hills of Imerina Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=map showing villages of highland Madagascar around Antananarivo|Sacred hills of Imerina]]\nAndriamanelo established the first fortified ''[[Rova (Madagascar)|rova]]'' (royal compound) at his capital at Alasora.

He transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom.{{Sfn|Campbell|2005|p=120}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndrianjaka unified the principalities on what he later designated as the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]] at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka.<ref name=\"Ark2\"/> These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when [[Andrianampoinimerina]] redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.{{Sfn|Administration coloniale|1898|p=895}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nUnder Andriamasinavalona, the Kingdom of Imerina was composed of six provinces (''toko''): Avaradrano, constituting Antananarivo and land to the northeast of the capital, including Ambohimanga; Vakinisisaony, including the land to the south of Avaradrano and its capital at Alasora; Vonizongo to the northwest of Antananarivo with its capital at Fihaonana; Marovatana to the south of Vonizongo, with its capital at Ambohidratrimo; Ambodirano, south of Marovatana with its capital at Fenoarivo; and Vakinankaratra to the south of Antananarivo with its capital at Betafo. Andrianampoinimerina reunited these provinces and added Imamo to the west, which has been described by some historians as having been incorporated into Ambodirano, and by others as separate from it; and Valalafotsy to the northwest.  Together, these areas constitute the core territory rightly called Imerina, the homeland of the Merina people.{{Sfn|Campbell|2012|p=500}}\n\n==Social organization==\n\n===Caste system===\nAndriamanelo was reportedly the first to formally establish the [[andriana]] as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society.{{Sfn|Miller|Rowlands|1989|p=143}} From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140&ndash;154}} The first sub-divisions of the ''[[andriana]]'' noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}}\n\nAndrianjaka was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo, his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana (seven tombs placed in a row on the Rova grounds).<ref name = Piolet>Piolet (1895), pp. 209&ndash;210</ref> To commemorate his greatness, his subjects erected a small wooden house called a [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|small sacred house]] on top of his tomb.  Future [[Merina]] sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Malagasy mythology}}\nAndriamanelo is credited with introducing [[astrology]] (''sikidy'') in Imerina.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} The Merina rite of [[circumcision]], described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century. The origins of these practices can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers.{{Sfn|Radimilahy|1993|pp=478-483}}\n\n[[File:Sampy talisman idol Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=boar tusks and metal trinkets fastened with twine to a cluster of wooden dowels|Each ''sampy'' was fashioned from diverse components.]]\nUnder Andriamanelo's son Ralambo, the sovereign became imbued with increasing power to protect the realm. This was preserved by honoring the ''[[sampy]]'', traditional amulets made from assorted natural materials. Amulets and idols called ''ody'' had long occupied an important place among many [[ethnic groups of Madagascar]], but these were believed to offer protection to the individual wearer only and were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. After Ralambo received a highly powerful ''sampy'' called Kelimalaza that was distinguished by its supposed capacity to extend protection to an entire community, he sought out and amassed a total of twelve others from communities across Imerina believed to have such a quality. These sampy were personified&mdash;complete with a distinct personality&mdash;and offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo then transformed the nature of the relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the king's sovereignty and the integrity of the state, which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampy&mdash;twelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmology&mdash;and transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.{{Sfn|Graeber|2007|pp=35&ndash;38}}  Oral history recounts numerous instances where sampy were taken into battle, and subsequent successes and varying miracles were attributed to them, including several key victories against [[Sakalava]] marauders.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=63&ndash;71}} The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}} These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the ''sampin'andriana'': the \"Royal Sampy\") which were all in the possession of the king.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}} These royal sampy, including ''Kelimalaza'', continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen [[Ranavalona II]] upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869.{{Sfn|Oliver|1886|p=118}}\n\nAlso beginning under Ralambo, the ritual sanctification of the realm occurred through the annual ''fandroana'' festival at the start of each year. Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts provide insight into the festival as it was practiced at that time.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&ndash;70}} Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an \"orgy\") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&ndash;70}} On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to [[Anointing|anoint]] the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=285&ndash;290}} Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as ''jaka'', a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with [[suet]] in a decorative clay jar. The [[confit]] would then be conserved in a pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=29}}\n\n===Customs===\nThe marriage tradition of the ''vodiondry'', still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry&mdash;meat from the hindquarters of a sheep&mdash;which he believed to be the tastiest portion.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kent | first = R.K. | title = Madagascar and Africa II: The Sakalava, Maroserana, Dady and Tromba before 1700 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 517&ndash;546 | year = 1968 | doi = 10.1017/S0021853700009026 | ref = harv}}</ref> The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for the groom to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic [[piastre]], sums of money and other gifts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grandidier |first=Guillaume |title=Le mariage \u00e0 Madagascar |journal=Bulletins et M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'anthropologie de Paris |volume=4 |pages=9&ndash;46 |year=1913 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0037-8984_1913_num_4_1_8571 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515034605/http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bmsap_0037-8984_1913_num_4_1_8571 |archivedate=May 15, 2010 |doi=10.3406/bmsap.1913.8571 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Andriamanelo's son Ralambo is credited with introducing the tradition of polygamy in Imerina.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}} He also introduced the traditions of circumcision and family intermarriage (such as between parent and step-child, or between half-siblings) among Merina nobles, these practices having already existed among certain other Malagasy ethnic groups.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}\n\nAccording to oral history, the institution of lengthy formal mourning periods for deceased sovereigns in Imerina may also have begun with the death of Andrianjaka.

While the Vazimba had historically tended to favor rule by queens, the Hova favored male heirs, and the marriage between Andriamanelo's Vazimba and Hova parents had produced two sons and a daughter. To prevent conflict, the queen decided that Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother.{{Sfn|Kus|1982|pp=47-62}} This system of succession was ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=239}}  Ralambo was the first Merina sovereign to practice polygamy, and his second wife was the first to give him a son. While his younger son by his first wife was to rule, Ralambo sought to assuage the elder son by declaring that the crown could henceforth only be passed to a child born of the reigning sovereign and a princess from the elder son Andriantompokoindrindra's family line.<ref name=\"iarivo\">{{Cite web|last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e?url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |language=French |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is believed to have originated with Ralambo.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}\n\nImerina was initially ruled under Andriamanelo from his mother's home village of Alasora.

King [[Radama I]] likewise inhabited the building for much of his time at the Rova,{{Sfn|Fr\u00e9migacci|1999|p=427}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}} and in 1820 he designated the

{"title_page": "Monarchy in ancient India", "text_new": "'''Monarchy in ancient India''' was sovereignty over a territory by a King who functioned as its protector, a role which involved both secular and religious power. The meaning and significance of kingship changed dramatically between the [[Vedic Period|Vedic]] and [[Vedic Period#The later Vedic period|Later Vedic]] period, and underwent further development under the influence of [[Buddhist kingship|Buddhism]]. Although there is evidence that kingship was not always hereditary during the Vedic and into the Later Vedic period, by the time of composition of the {{IAST|[[Br\u0101hma\u1e47a]]}} literature, traces of elective kingship had already begun to disappear.<ref>Altekar, A.S. ''State and Government in Ancient India'', p. 312</ref>  \n\n==Kingship and the Vedas==\n\nVedic ideas about the establishment of the office of king ultimately draw upon legends about the coronation of one god as king of all others. Legends abound as to which of the gods won this position;<ref>See, for example, [[Aitareya Brahmana|A. Br.]], 1.14; [[Taittiriya Brahmana|T. Br.]] 2.2.7.2; [[Jaiminiya Brahmana|J. Br.]] 3.152.</ref> In the ''[[Rig Veda|{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}]]'', [[Indra]], [[Agni]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], [[Yama]], and [[Varuna|{{IAST|Varu\u1e47a}}]] are all addressed as \"King.\"  Indeed, kingship in the ''[[Rig Veda|{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}]]'' largely manifests only in the form of gods as kings. Hymns directly addressed to earthly kings, like 10.173-10.175, are the exception rather than the rule. In these hymns, the king is said to have been \"established\" by Indra and \"made victorious\" by Soma and [[Savitr|{{IAST|Savit\u1e5b}}]]. Although this implies a close dependence of the king upon the gods, the rarity of the figure of the human king in the ''{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}'' agrees with the idea that kings at this time were basically on a level with tribal chiefs and were not viewed as divine.<ref>see Sharma, Ram Sharan. ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in Ancient India.'' p. 162; 186</ref>  There is a provocative line at 10.124.8 which mentions people electing their king, and 3.4.2 in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' seems to confirm this. Also, several hymns in the ''{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}'' demonstrate the importance of the ''samiti'' (10.166.4, 10.191), the governing assembly, further indicating that the early Vedic king ruled in a tribal setting where decision making by assembly still played a major role.\n\nAs was stated above, the king was not considered divine in the early Vedic period.<ref>Altekar, p. 83.</ref>  By the time the {{IAST|Br\u0101hma\u1e47as}} were composed, however, the king was increasingly associated with the gods through his qualities and the rituals he performed.<ref>Altekar, p. 89-90; see also Sharma, p. 165 one example from the [[Satapatha Brahmana|{{IAST|\u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a}}]] in which the king is equated with [[Prajapati|Praj\u0101pati]].</ref>  Also by this time, kingship had transitioned to a hereditary position and the ''samiti'' began to wane in importance.<ref>See Sharma, p. 64; 165.</ref>\n\n==Dharma and the King==\nPrior to the Vedas, the Aryan tribes that arrived in India \"formed a military fraternity\" governing the alien, local population. As they became absorbed into the local population, political power within the society began to change from an inter-clan system in which various clans divided up responsibilities into a more Vedic-like system in which one ruler ruled over and provided for his subjects<ref>Drekmeier, p.38</ref>. In this new system first emerged the ideas of brahman and ksatra, or spiritual and temporal power, respectively. In order for the communal [[dharma]] to be achieved, the Brahmin had to correctly \u201cinstruct the others in their duties\u201d and guide their spiritual practice; the Ksatriya, on the other hand, was invested with the \u201croyal function\u201d of maintaining obedience in accordance with dharma and thus ensuring that the proper practices were being executed. Given that the former decided on correct spiritual action while the later enforced it, an essential cooperation arose between the two in order to ensure the performance of dharma, and this cooperation formed \u201cone of the fundamental elements in [[smriti]]\u2019s theory of kingship\u201d<ref>Lingat, p.216</ref>. This coincided with the development of the doctrine of the soul\u2019s rebirth and potential release [[moksha]] from the cycle of continual rebirths known as [[samsara]], thus devaluing the brazen action and heroism of the \u201cAryan Way\u201d as exemplified by stories predating the Hindu epics, such as the story of Vidula in which the warrior is emotionally roused to fulfill his duties as a warrior in the face of unpleasant adversity <ref>Drekmeier, p.150</ref>. According to this new philosophy, rulers are to \u201caccept and fulfill [their] duty without ever desiring that which does not have enduring worth,\u201d in other words, by not attaching themselves to their actions and thinking of only the end result of their action. Enabling, and if necessary enforcing everyone to behave this way, \u201cleads finally to escape from karma\u201d <ref>Drekmeier, p.154</ref> and thus achieves the spiritual goal of brahma, escape from the cycle of samsara. As mentioned above, the best examples of this kind of detached devotion to duty by a king are seen in the smriti epics of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Ramayana]].\n\n==Kingship in Dharma Literature==\n{{See also|Raja}}\n\n===Divinity of the King===\n[[File:Aihole inscription of Ravi Kirti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Royal inscription extolling the conquests of Badami [[Chalukya]] King [[Pulakeshin II]] dated to 634 CE]]\nBy the time of the composition of the ''[[Laws of Manu|M\u0101nava Dharma\u015b\u0101stra]]'', the divinity of the king had become well established. In ''Manu'' 7.4, the king is said to be made out of divine particles of several gods, including Yama, Indra, {{IAST|Varu\u1e47a}}, and [[Kubera]]. This may be seen as closely related to the earlier belief that at his coronation, the king assumed various aspects of the gods.<ref>See Alterkar, p.78; Lingat, Robert. ''The Classical Law of India''. p. 208</ref>  At ''Manu'' 7.8, it is stated that even an infant king must never be treated with disrespect, because he is in reality a god on earth.  ''[[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti|N\u0101rada]]'' 18.49-50 echoes this sentiment, saying that the king's divinity is apparent in the force of his decrees: his words are law as soon as he utters them. This is in contrast to earlier [[Dharmasutra|Dharmas\u016btra]] texts, which seem to stress the king's subordinate status in comparison to [[Brahmin]]s and make no mention of his divinity.<ref>See, for example, ''Gautama'' 11.1-5</ref>\n\n===King as Protector===\nThe Dharmas\u016btras and [[Dharma\u015b\u0101stras]] agree that it is the special duty of the king to protect, to punish, and to preserve dharma for those in his kingdom.<ref>In the Dharmas\u016btras, see ''{{IAST|Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha}}'' 19.1; ''Gautama'' 8.1-3; in the Dharma\u015b\u0101stras, see ''Manu'' 7.2-4; ''N\u0101rada'' 18.31; ''[[Yajnavalkya Smriti|Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya]]'' 1.323</ref>  However, a new myth of the creation of kingship not found in the Dharmas\u016btras and differing from those found in previous Vedic literature is seen in the Dharma\u015b\u0101stras. At ''Manu'' 7.2, it is stated that the [[Svayambhu|Self-existent Lord]] created the king to restore order to the chaotic world which had existed without him. Then the Lord created Punishment (spoken of as a deity), because through punishment the world is subdued (''Manu'' 7.22). By performing his duty as protector and punisher, the king flourishes (''Manu'' 7.107). The weak and helpless (i.e. widows, children, the mentally ill, the destitute) were to receive royal protection.<ref>See, for example, ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 8.27-29; ''[[Visnusmrti|{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}]] 3.65</ref>  Beyond protecting his subjects against each other, the king, as a [[Kshatriya|{{IAST|k\u1e63atriya}}]], also had a duty to protect his subjects against external threats and wage war with rival kingdoms.  ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 7.87, for instance, states that a king, when challenged, must never back down from a battle; indeed, doing battle is his [[dharma]].\n\n===''{{IAST|Var\u1e47a}}'' of the King===\nAs was stated above ''Manu'' 7.2 specifically states that a {{IAST|k\u1e63atriya}} who has received vedic initiation is eligible to become a king. Elsewhere, any [[twice-born]] person is forbidden to live in a country ruled over by a \u015audra (4.61); likewise, Brahmins are forbidden to accept gifts from any king not of proper royal lineage (4.84). Yet commentators like [[Medh\u0101tithi]], Kull\u016bka, and [[Vij\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvara]] essentially overturned such rules about the king's lineage, stating that any person recognized as having power over a territory is to be understood as king, regardless of his ''{{IAST|[[var\u1e47a]]}}''.<ref>For a discussion of this, see Lingat, p. 210</ref>\n\n===Authority of the King===\nThe basis of the king's authority is a matter of some discrepancy in the Dharma literature. Some authors of dharma texts make it seem as though the king's power lies solely in his adherence to dharma and its preservation. His edicts are powerful only in that they are in accordance with the Law; his legal decisions should be based on what is stated in the \u015b\u0101stras alone, not on his own will and authority. Furthermore, the king really only enforces what his Brahmin advisers declare to be dharma.<ref>On this, see, for example, ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 7.28-31 and ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.29; see also the discussion in Altekar, p. 156-157</ref>  The ''{{IAST|Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Dharmas\u016btra}}'', for example, is explicit that Brahmins will state what is dharma for the three ''{{IAST|[[var\u1e47a]]s}}'', and the king will govern accordingly (1.39-41). In other texts however, or even in passages in the same texts, the authority of the king involves the application of his own reason and will. So, in contrast to ''Manu'' 7.28-31, 8.44-45 in the same text states that the king should rely on his own powers of deduction in the administration of justice. Reasoning as a means of reaching a judgment even appears as early as the ''Gautama Dharmas\u016btra'' (11.23-24). But by the time of the ''{{IAST|[[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]]}}'', royal decree had been placed above all other sources of law as the most powerful, abrogating all the rest.<ref>See ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.10</ref> The power behind royal decrees is thus located increasingly in the king himself, even though he is still urged to preserve dharma.\n\nIndeed, while certain sources do mention that the king kept a cohort of religious advisers to consult in regards to various religious matters, the king remained a power unto himself for the simple fact that he bore the results of his actions and decisions, an idea grounded in the reciprocity shared between the king and his subjects: the king's salvation \"depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire\". Similarly, his subjects depend on him, for if he \"protects them as he should,\" his people may devote themselves \"to their duties\".<ref>Lingat, p.212</ref> Moreover, while power was increasingly located within the king, his role was maintained within a set of boundaries and the role he played within society did not extend into previously untouched areas. For example, within the matter of spiritual salvation (i.e. [[moksa]]), the king played no direct role at all; it is not his responsibility to \"propound any superstitious idea, to lay down any part of righteousness,\" or to help define \"what is or is not religion\" nor determine its practice.<ref>Derrett, p. 599</ref> On the contrary, the king was to act as the enforcer and sometimes intermediary through which the \"imperial sacrificial ceremonies\" occurred. Indeed, a special \"affinity with the gods,\" most notably Indra, resulting from his role in personally conducting special sacrifice and ensuring others likewise performed the rites is mentioned as a source of the king's authority. Examples of such sacrifices include the ''[[Rajasuya]]'' (\"the king's inauguration sacrifice\"), the ''[[Asvamedha]]'' (\"the horse sacrifice\"), and the ''Aindramahabhisheka'' (\"The Great Consecration of Indra\").<ref>Ghosal, p.24-25</ref>\n\n===Statecraft===\n\nFollowing in the tradition of the [[Artha\u015b\u0101stra]], Manu and Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, in defining ''r\u0101jadharma'' (law of or for the king) go into great detail regarding how the king is to set up his government and manage his kingdom. In ''Manu'', for example, the discussion of how the king should choose his ministers directly follows the description of qualities a king should cultivate.  ''Manu'' 7.54 advises the king to choose seven or eight counselors who are learned and of noble birth, without specifically defining their ''{{IAST|va\u1e5b\u1e47a}}''. Out of these, however, one individual should be chosen as a prime minister, and the text specifies that this individual is to be a Brahmin.<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.58;  ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.70; ''Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya'' 1.312</ref>  ''[[Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti|Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya]]'' 1.310, on the other hand, advises that all [[mantri]]ns be Brahmins.\n\nLower officials (''am\u0101tya''s) should be assigned to duties based on their personal attributes, including honesty, intelligence, and cleverness.<ref>''Manu'' 7.60-62. Artha\u015b\u0101stra 1.8 gives a description of the differences between ''mantrin''s an ''am\u0101tya''s. See also Ganguly, D. K. ''Aspects of Ancient Indian Administration''. p. 162.</ref>  Among the tasks to be overseen by the ''am\u0101tya''s were collecting taxes, supervising the royal mines, and collecting tolls for use of public transportation.<ref>See ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.16</ref>\n\nManu follows {{IAST|[[Kau\u1e6dilya]]}} in saying that [[diplomat|envoy]]s (''d\u016bta'') should be chosen based on cleverness and the ability to decipher hints and gestures, i.e., to read a rival king's appearance for clues as to his intentions and general disposition.<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.67, ''Artha\u015b\u0101stra'' 1.15.7-9</ref>  The role of the envoy was vital for both diplomacy and reconnaissance. The importance of the role of the envoy can be seen in ''[[Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti|Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya]]'' 13.328, where an involved set of preparations in made for both the dispatching and return of the d\u016bta, including the meeting of the king with all his ministers.\n\nAs to the organization of his kingdom, a king, according to Manu, should place [[constable]]s between ever second, third, and fifth village, and at the hundredth village. Superintendents with jurisdiction over one, ten, twenty, a hundred, and a thousand villages should also be appointed (''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.9-10 has one, ten, a hundred, and a whole district).<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.114-115</ref>  Any problems arising in villages are to be reported to progressively higher superintendents; {{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}} states that when a solution is not reached by a lower superintendent, the problem must be reported to the next highest superintendent and so on.<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.116-117; ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.11-15</ref>\n\n===The King and Legal Procedure===\n[[File:Oriya land grant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A facsimile of an inscription in [[Oriya script|Oriya]] script on a copper plate recording a land grant made by R\u0101ja Purushottam Deb, king of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], in the fifth year of his reign (1483).  Land grants made by royal decree were protected by law, with deeds often being recorded on metal plates]]\n\n{{main|vyavah\u0101ra}}\n\nAccording to N\u0101rada, the king is the highest venue of [[legal procedure]].<ref>See ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.7</ref>  This would indicate that only the most important of cases would be heard directly by the king, i.e. cases for which a decision had not been reachable in local community or guild courts.<ref>Richard Lariviere, in his translation of the ''{{IAST|[[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]]}}'', takes this to be the verse's import. See Lariviere, ''The {{IAST|N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti}}: Critically Edited with an Introduction, Annotated Translation, and Appendices''. p. 5.</ref>  Manu and {{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}} both state that the king may either try cases himself (accompanied, of course, by Brahmin jurists), or he may appoint a Brahmin judge to oversee trials for him.<ref>See ''[[Vi\u1e63\u1e47usm\u1e5bti|{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}]]'' 3.72-73; ''Manu'' 8.9; see also ''{{IAST|Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha}}'' 16.2</ref>  Manu even allows that a non-Brahmin ''[[dvija]]'' can be appointed as a legal interpreter, but under no circumstances may a [[\u015audra]] act as one.<ref>See ''Manu'' 8.20</ref>\n\nDharma texts uniformly stress that the king be impartial in his judgments. Manu states that a king who is partial and unjust in his inflicting of punishment will himself be punished (7.27), saying at 8.128 that punishing one who does not deserve to be punished condemns the king to hell. Elsewhere, {{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}} and N\u0101rada stress that both the king and his judges be unbiased in their hearing of cases.<ref>See ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.74;  ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.28 and 1.58</ref>  This had religious as well as strictly legal implications; according to ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.65, a king who follows proper procedure in hearing lawsuits is ensured fame in this world and heaven in the afterlife.\n\nIn the ''{{IAST|[[B\u1e5bhaspatism\u1e5bti]]}}'', the king is advised to hear cases in the morning, dressed in his regalia after having performed morning [[Ritual purification|ablutions]].<ref>See ''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhaspati}}'' 1.21</ref>  This contradicts with ''Manu'' 8.2, which states that the king's clothing during his daily hearing of court case should be modest.\n\nMuch as an envoy is to decipher the disposition of a rival king through bodily and gestural clues, the king is advised to note a litigant's external clues while hearing cases to discern his disposition.<ref>See ''Manu'' 8.25</ref>  ''Manu'' 8.62-72 distinguishes who the king may or may not have questioned as a witness in connection with a trial; a greatly expanded list is given at ''N\u0101rada'' 1.159. Upon hearing contradictory testimony from witnesses, the king is advised at ''Manu'' 8.73 to rely on what the majority of witnesses say, or else the testimony of witnesses of superior qualities; if discrepancy persists, the testimony of Brahmins is to be relied upon.<ref>''N\u0101rada'' 1.209-210 replaces \"testimony of Brahmins\" with testimony of those witnesses with the best memories. If those with the best memories disagree, the testimony is to be disqualified.</ref>  ''N\u0101rada'' 1.142 states that the king should dismiss witnesses whose testimonies continuously contradict each other.\n\nFollowing this inquiry, the case may be decided upon.<ref>See ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.30</ref>\n\n==Taxation==\nThe king's right to tax was the logical next step after the theory of absolute ownership of lands by the king. Manu describes the king as the absolute lord of the land and as such, the king was entitled to his share in the produce of the lands. The permission of the king was needed to buy, sell and donate land.<ref>Sarkar, K.R. ''Public Finance in Ancient India'', p. 55</ref> In reality, the land was the people\u2019s own, with the king only claiming absolute ownership. As long as the people worked the land and paid their taxes, they would be fine, but otherwise, the king could exercise his power and confiscate the land.<ref>Sarkar, p. 59</ref>\n\n===Bilateral contract===\nThis understanding was part of a bilateral contract made between the king and the people. The people would work the land and give taxes to the king for protection. The contract implies that the people submitted to a sovereign authority that they created, they volunteered to pay the tax, the tax rate was fixed by the people, the taxes are paid to the king as a wage for his protection and the king has to answer to the people. From this it can be concluded that the king has the right to tax, it is the duty of the people to pay taxes, and the duty is conditional on the performance of the king in his duties.<ref>Sarkar, p. 59</ref> This idea of the king\u2019s performance in protection in relationship to taxation is so important that some texts require the king to compensate for any stolen goods he failed to recover.<ref>Ghoshal, U.N. ''Contributions to the History of the Hindu Revenue System'', p. 25</ref>\n\n===Limits===\nThe king had limitations on how he could tax. He had to know when to tax as some times were better than others. The amount the person was taxed was to be determined by the nature of the person. If they had gotten rich from doing wrong, they were to be highly taxed, those who were prosperous were to be taxed little by little and those who could not pay should never be taxed. The limit people could pay in taxes should not be crossed. Only profits and surpluses should be taxed.<ref>Ghoshal, p. 26</ref> Increases should be done gradually and at the proper time. The king should use the taxes to help benefit the people.<ref>Sarkar, p. 62-67</ref><ref>Ghoshal, p. 30</ref>\n\n===Types of taxes===\n====Bali====\nIn the early Vedic period the king collected taxes regularly from his subjects. The taxes were called bali and consisted of 1/6 the agricultural produce or cattle for a given person.<ref>Ghoshal, p. 10</ref> Another form of bali was tributes extracted from conquered enemies by the king. There was a system in place to collect these taxes, but the exact details have been lost to time.<ref>Ghoshal, p. 14</ref> Even when other forms of taxes appeared in the later periods, bali was still present. It was used a special tax that was used differently by different kingdoms in order to gain additional revenue.<ref>Sarkar, p. 105</ref>\n\n====Land revenue====\nThis was the main tax in the post-Vedic period as it evolved out of bali. It was important source of income for the state and it was employed in every kingdom since its founding. This tax entailed the state receiving 1/6 of the produce of the land. This tax was of the profits made from the land, not the gross produce. People could pay the tax either in the good produced or with money. There  Also a survey would be done to assist in the proper collection of the tax.<ref>Sarkar, p. 87-88</ref>\n\n====Irrigation tax====\nThe state had to look over and protect the natural sources of water. Also they had to build and maintain irrigation devices such as canals. If water was taken from rivers, tanks, lakes or wells a rate of a fourth of the produce was taken.<ref>Sarkar, p. 90-91</ref>\n\n====Toll charges====\nDuties placed on goods imported from foreign lands, produced in country parts and within the city. The rates varied between 4% and 20%. Marriage and religious commodities were except. There were other types of toll charges including: a water ferry toll, toll to enter the city, road toll and a use of harbor toll.<ref>Sarkar, p. 92-94</ref>\n\n====Sales tax====\nThere were two types of sale taxes. One was a general tax of 10% placed on all goods. The other taxes placed on special goods such as jewels, land auctions and immovable objects. The punishment of tax evasion was the confiscation of the goods purchased.<ref>Sarkar, p. 98-99</ref>\n\n====Labor tax====\nEveryone was expected to contribute to the common good. For poor people who could not pay their taxes in kind or with money, they would have to work in state factories. Also one day of each month, each person, including Brahmins, had to work solely for the king, called Visti.<ref>Sarkar, p. 101-102</ref>\n\n====Poll tax====\nThis is a tax levied on individuals. There were two forms of the poll tax. The first was a general tax was levied on every member of a family. The second was a special tax that undesirable foreigners had to pay to enter a city.<ref>Sarkar, p. 106</ref>\n\n====Other taxes====\n*Customs duty\n*Excise tax\n*Salt tax\n*Excise profit tax\n*Trade tax\n*Professional tax\n*Income tax\n*Gambling tax\n*General property tax (Kara)<ref>Ghoshal, p.47</ref>\n*Construction tax (V\u0101stuka)\n*Survey tax (Rajju)\n*Police tax (Chorarajju)\n*Tax on villages on the water (Kl\u0157pta)\n*General tax on villages (Pi\u0146dakara)\n*Emergency tax (Pra\u0146aya)\n*Celebration tax (Utsanga)\n*War tax (Sen\u0101bhakta)<ref>Sarkar, p. 95-111</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Monarchy]]\n*[[Kingdoms of ancient India]]\n*[[Chakravartin]]\n*[[Raja]]\n*[[Maharaja]]\n*[[Buddhist kingship]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author = Translation by Richard W.

The meaning and significance of kingship changed dramatically between the [[Vedic Period|Vedic]] and [[Vedic Period#The later Vedic period|Later Vedic]] period, and underwent further development under the influence of [[Buddhist kingship|Buddhism]]. Although there is evidence that kingship was not always hereditary during the Vedic and into the Later Vedic period, by the time of composition of the {{IAST|[[Br\u0101hma\u1e47a]]}} literature, traces of elective kingship had already begun to disappear.<ref>Altekar, A.S. ''State and Government in Ancient India'', p. 312</ref>  \n\n==Kingship and the Vedas==\n\nVedic ideas about the establishment of the office of king ultimately draw upon legends about the coronation of one god as king of all others. Legends abound as to which of the gods won this position;<ref>See, for example, [[Aitareya Brahmana|A. Br.]], 1.14; [[Taittiriya Brahmana|T. Br.]] 2.2.7.2; [[Jaiminiya Brahmana|J. Br.]] 3.152.</ref> In the ''[[Rig Veda|{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}]]'', [[Indra]], [[Agni]], [[Soma (deity)|Soma]], [[Yama]], and [[Varuna|{{IAST|Varu\u1e47a}}]] are all addressed as \"King.\"  Indeed, kingship in the ''[[Rig Veda|{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}]]'' largely manifests only in the form of gods as kings. Hymns directly addressed to earthly kings, like 10.173-10.175, are the exception rather than the rule. In these hymns, the king is said to have been \"established\" by Indra and \"made victorious\" by Soma and [[Savitr|{{IAST|Savit\u1e5b}}]]. Although this implies a close dependence of the king upon the gods, the rarity of the figure of the human king in the ''{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}'' agrees with the idea that kings at this time were basically on a level with tribal chiefs and were not viewed as divine.<ref>see Sharma, Ram Sharan. ''Aspects of Political Ideas and Institutions in Ancient India.'' p. 162; 186</ref>  There is a provocative line at 10.124.8 which mentions people electing their king, and 3.4.2 in the ''[[Atharvaveda]]'' seems to confirm this. Also, several hymns in the ''{{IAST|\u1e5ag Veda}}'' demonstrate the importance of the ''samiti'' (10.166.4, 10.191), the governing assembly, further indicating that the early Vedic king ruled in a tribal setting where decision making by assembly still played a major role.\n\nAs was stated above, the king was not considered divine in the early Vedic period.<ref>Altekar, p. 83.</ref>  By the time the {{IAST|Br\u0101hma\u1e47as}} were composed, however, the king was increasingly associated with the gods through his qualities and the rituals he performed.<ref>Altekar, p. 89-90; see also Sharma, p. 165 one example from the [[Satapatha Brahmana|{{IAST|\u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a}}]] in which the king is equated with [[Prajapati|Praj\u0101pati]].</ref>  Also by this time, kingship had transitioned to a hereditary position and the ''samiti'' began to wane in importance.<ref>See Sharma, p. 64; 165.</ref>\n\n==Dharma and the King==\nPrior to the Vedas, the Aryan tribes that arrived in India \"formed a military fraternity\" governing the alien, local population. As they became absorbed into the local population, political power within the society began to change from an inter-clan system in which various clans divided up responsibilities into a more Vedic-like system in which one ruler ruled over and provided for his subjects<ref>Drekmeier, p.38</ref>. In this new system first emerged the ideas of brahman and ksatra, or spiritual and temporal power, respectively. In order for the communal [[dharma]] to be achieved, the Brahmin had to correctly \u201cinstruct the others in their duties\u201d and guide their spiritual practice; the Ksatriya, on the other hand, was invested with the \u201croyal function\u201d of maintaining obedience in accordance with dharma and thus ensuring that the proper practices were being executed. Given that the former decided on correct spiritual action while the later enforced it, an essential cooperation arose between the two in order to ensure the performance of dharma, and this cooperation formed \u201cone of the fundamental elements in [[smriti]]\u2019s theory of kingship\u201d<ref>Lingat, p.216</ref>. This coincided with the development of the doctrine of the soul\u2019s rebirth and potential release [[moksha]] from the cycle of continual rebirths known as [[samsara]], thus devaluing the brazen action and heroism of the \u201cAryan Way\u201d as exemplified by stories predating the Hindu epics, such as the story of Vidula in which the warrior is emotionally roused to fulfill his duties as a warrior in the face of unpleasant adversity <ref>Drekmeier, p.150</ref>. According to this new philosophy, rulers are to \u201caccept and fulfill [their] duty without ever desiring that which does not have enduring worth,\u201d in other words, by not attaching themselves to their actions and thinking of only the end result of their action. Enabling, and if necessary enforcing everyone to behave this way, \u201cleads finally to escape from karma\u201d <ref>Drekmeier, p.154</ref> and thus achieves the spiritual goal of brahma, escape from the cycle of samsara. As mentioned above, the best examples of this kind of detached devotion to duty by a king are seen in the smriti epics of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Ramayana]].\n\n==Kingship in Dharma Literature==\n{{See also|Raja}}\n\n===Divinity of the King===\n[[File:Aihole inscription of Ravi Kirti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Royal inscription extolling the conquests of Badami [[Chalukya]] King [[Pulakeshin II]] dated to 634 CE]]\nBy the time of the composition of the ''[[Laws of Manu|M\u0101nava Dharma\u015b\u0101stra]]'', the divinity of the king had become well established. In ''Manu'' 7.4, the king is said to be made out of divine particles of several gods, including Yama, Indra, {{IAST|Varu\u1e47a}}, and [[Kubera]]. This may be seen as closely related to the earlier belief that at his coronation, the king assumed various aspects of the gods.<ref>See Alterkar, p.78; Lingat, Robert. ''The Classical Law of India''. p. 208</ref>  At ''Manu'' 7.8, it is stated that even an infant king must never be treated with disrespect, because he is in reality a god on earth.  ''[[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti|N\u0101rada]]'' 18.49-50 echoes this sentiment, saying that the king's divinity is apparent in the force of his decrees: his words are law as soon as he utters them. This is in contrast to earlier [[Dharmasutra|Dharmas\u016btra]] texts, which seem to stress the king's subordinate status in comparison to [[Brahmin]]s and make no mention of his divinity.<ref>See, for example, ''Gautama'' 11.1-5</ref>\n\n===King as Protector===\nThe Dharmas\u016btras and [[Dharma\u015b\u0101stras]] agree that it is the special duty of the king to protect, to punish, and to preserve dharma for those in his kingdom.<ref>In the Dharmas\u016btras, see ''{{IAST|Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha}}'' 19.1; ''Gautama'' 8.1-3; in the Dharma\u015b\u0101stras, see ''Manu'' 7.2-4; ''N\u0101rada'' 18.31; ''[[Yajnavalkya Smriti|Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya]]'' 1.323</ref>  However, a new myth of the creation of kingship not found in the Dharmas\u016btras and differing from those found in previous Vedic literature is seen in the Dharma\u015b\u0101stras. At ''Manu'' 7.2, it is stated that the [[Svayambhu|Self-existent Lord]] created the king to restore order to the chaotic world which had existed without him. Then the Lord created Punishment (spoken of as a deity), because through punishment the world is subdued (''Manu'' 7.22). By performing his duty as protector and punisher, the king flourishes (''Manu'' 7.107). The weak and helpless (i.e. widows, children, the mentally ill, the destitute) were to receive royal protection.<ref>See, for example, ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 8.27-29; ''[[Visnusmrti|{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}]] 3.65</ref>  Beyond protecting his subjects against each other, the king, as a [[Kshatriya|{{IAST|k\u1e63atriya}}]], also had a duty to protect his subjects against external threats and wage war with rival kingdoms.  ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 7.87, for instance, states that a king, when challenged, must never back down from a battle; indeed, doing battle is his [[dharma]].\n\n===''{{IAST|Var\u1e47a}}'' of the King===\nAs was stated above ''Manu'' 7.2 specifically states that a {{IAST|k\u1e63atriya}} who has received vedic initiation is eligible to become a king. Elsewhere, any [[twice-born]] person is forbidden to live in a country ruled over by a \u015audra (4.61); likewise, Brahmins are forbidden to accept gifts from any king not of proper royal lineage (4.84). Yet commentators like [[Medh\u0101tithi]], Kull\u016bka, and [[Vij\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvara]] essentially overturned such rules about the king's lineage, stating that any person recognized as having power over a territory is to be understood as king, regardless of his ''{{IAST|[[var\u1e47a]]}}''.<ref>For a discussion of this, see Lingat, p. 210</ref>\n\n===Authority of the King===\nThe basis of the king's authority is a matter of some discrepancy in the Dharma literature. Some authors of dharma texts make it seem as though the king's power lies solely in his adherence to dharma and its preservation. His edicts are powerful only in that they are in accordance with the Law; his legal decisions should be based on what is stated in the \u015b\u0101stras alone, not on his own will and authority. Furthermore, the king really only enforces what his Brahmin advisers declare to be dharma.<ref>On this, see, for example, ''[[Laws of Manu|Manu]]'' 7.28-31 and ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.29; see also the discussion in Altekar, p. 156-157</ref>  The ''{{IAST|Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha Dharmas\u016btra}}'', for example, is explicit that Brahmins will state what is dharma for the three ''{{IAST|[[var\u1e47a]]s}}'', and the king will govern accordingly (1.39-41). In other texts however, or even in passages in the same texts, the authority of the king involves the application of his own reason and will. So, in contrast to ''Manu'' 7.28-31, 8.44-45 in the same text states that the king should rely on his own powers of deduction in the administration of justice. Reasoning as a means of reaching a judgment even appears as early as the ''Gautama Dharmas\u016btra'' (11.23-24). But by the time of the ''{{IAST|[[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]]}}'', royal decree had been placed above all other sources of law as the most powerful, abrogating all the rest.<ref>See ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.10</ref> The power behind royal decrees is thus located increasingly in the king himself, even though he is still urged to preserve dharma.\n\nIndeed, while certain sources do mention that the king kept a cohort of religious advisers to consult in regards to various religious matters, the king remained a power unto himself for the simple fact that he bore the results of his actions and decisions, an idea grounded in the reciprocity shared between the king and his subjects: the king's salvation \"depends on his subjects, for he suffers the consequences of their sins and profits from the merits they acquire\". Similarly, his subjects depend on him, for if he \"protects them as he should,\" his people may devote themselves \"to their duties\".<ref>Lingat, p.212</ref> Moreover, while power was increasingly located within the king, his role was maintained within a set of boundaries and the role he played within society did not extend into previously untouched areas. For example, within the matter of spiritual salvation (i.e. [[moksa]]), the king played no direct role at all; it is not his responsibility to \"propound any superstitious idea, to lay down any part of righteousness,\" or to help define \"what is or is not religion\" nor determine its practice.<ref>Derrett, p. 599</ref> On the contrary, the king was to act as the enforcer and sometimes intermediary through which the \"imperial sacrificial ceremonies\" occurred. Indeed, a special \"affinity with the gods,\" most notably Indra, resulting from his role in personally conducting special sacrifice and ensuring others likewise performed the rites is mentioned as a source of the king's authority. Examples of such sacrifices include the ''[[Rajasuya]]'' (\"the king's inauguration sacrifice\"), the ''[[Asvamedha]]'' (\"the horse sacrifice\"), and the ''Aindramahabhisheka'' (\"The Great Consecration of Indra\").<ref>Ghosal, p.24-25</ref>\n\n===Statecraft===\n\nFollowing in the tradition of the [[Artha\u015b\u0101stra]], Manu and Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, in defining ''r\u0101jadharma'' (law of or for the king) go into great detail regarding how the king is to set up his government and manage his kingdom. In ''Manu'', for example, the discussion of how the king should choose his ministers directly follows the description of qualities a king should cultivate.  ''Manu'' 7.54 advises the king to choose seven or eight counselors who are learned and of noble birth, without specifically defining their ''{{IAST|va\u1e5b\u1e47a}}''. Out of these, however, one individual should be chosen as a prime minister, and the text specifies that this individual is to be a Brahmin.<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.58;  ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.70; ''Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya'' 1.312</ref>  ''[[Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti|Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya]]'' 1.310, on the other hand, advises that all [[mantri]]ns be Brahmins.\n\nLower officials (''am\u0101tya''s) should be assigned to duties based on their personal attributes, including honesty, intelligence, and cleverness.<ref>''Manu'' 7.60-62. Artha\u015b\u0101stra 1.8 gives a description of the differences between ''mantrin''s an ''am\u0101tya''s. See also Ganguly, D. K. ''Aspects of Ancient Indian Administration''. p. 162.</ref>  Among the tasks to be overseen by the ''am\u0101tya''s were collecting taxes, supervising the royal mines, and collecting tolls for use of public transportation.<ref>See ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.16</ref>\n\nManu follows {{IAST|[[Kau\u1e6dilya]]}} in saying that [[diplomat|envoy]]s (''d\u016bta'') should be chosen based on cleverness and the ability to decipher hints and gestures, i.e., to read a rival king's appearance for clues as to his intentions and general disposition.<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.67, ''Artha\u015b\u0101stra'' 1.15.7-9</ref>  The role of the envoy was vital for both diplomacy and reconnaissance. The importance of the role of the envoy can be seen in ''[[Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti|Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya]]'' 13.328, where an involved set of preparations in made for both the dispatching and return of the d\u016bta, including the meeting of the king with all his ministers.\n\nAs to the organization of his kingdom, a king, according to Manu, should place [[constable]]s between ever second, third, and fifth village, and at the hundredth village. Superintendents with jurisdiction over one, ten, twenty, a hundred, and a thousand villages should also be appointed (''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.9-10 has one, ten, a hundred, and a whole district).<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.114-115</ref>  Any problems arising in villages are to be reported to progressively higher superintendents; {{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}} states that when a solution is not reached by a lower superintendent, the problem must be reported to the next highest superintendent and so on.<ref>See ''Manu'' 7.116-117; ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.11-15</ref>\n\n===The King and Legal Procedure===\n[[File:Oriya land grant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A facsimile of an inscription in [[Oriya script|Oriya]] script on a copper plate recording a land grant made by R\u0101ja Purushottam Deb, king of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], in the fifth year of his reign (1483).  Land grants made by royal decree were protected by law, with deeds often being recorded on metal plates]]\n\n{{main|vyavah\u0101ra}}\n\nAccording to N\u0101rada, the king is the highest venue of [[legal procedure]].<ref>See ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.7</ref>  This would indicate that only the most important of cases would be heard directly by the king, i.e. cases for which a decision had not been reachable in local community or guild courts.<ref>Richard Lariviere, in his translation of the ''{{IAST|[[N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti]]}}'', takes this to be the verse's import. See Lariviere, ''The {{IAST|N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti}}: Critically Edited with an Introduction, Annotated Translation, and Appendices''. p. 5.</ref>  Manu and {{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}} both state that the king may either try cases himself (accompanied, of course, by Brahmin jurists), or he may appoint a Brahmin judge to oversee trials for him.<ref>See ''[[Vi\u1e63\u1e47usm\u1e5bti|{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}]]'' 3.72-73; ''Manu'' 8.9; see also ''{{IAST|Vasi\u1e63\u1e6dha}}'' 16.2</ref>  Manu even allows that a non-Brahmin ''[[dvija]]'' can be appointed as a legal interpreter, but under no circumstances may a [[\u015audra]] act as one.<ref>See ''Manu'' 8.20</ref>\n\nDharma texts uniformly stress that the king be impartial in his judgments. Manu states that a king who is partial and unjust in his inflicting of punishment will himself be punished (7.27), saying at 8.128 that punishing one who does not deserve to be punished condemns the king to hell. Elsewhere, {{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}} and N\u0101rada stress that both the king and his judges be unbiased in their hearing of cases.<ref>See ''{{IAST|Vi\u1e63\u1e47u}}'' 3.74;  ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.28 and 1.58</ref>  This had religious as well as strictly legal implications; according to ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.65, a king who follows proper procedure in hearing lawsuits is ensured fame in this world and heaven in the afterlife.\n\nIn the ''{{IAST|[[B\u1e5bhaspatism\u1e5bti]]}}'', the king is advised to hear cases in the morning, dressed in his regalia after having performed morning [[Ritual purification|ablutions]].<ref>See ''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhaspati}}'' 1.21</ref>  This contradicts with ''Manu'' 8.2, which states that the king's clothing during his daily hearing of court case should be modest.\n\nMuch as an envoy is to decipher the disposition of a rival king through bodily and gestural clues, the king is advised to note a litigant's external clues while hearing cases to discern his disposition.<ref>See ''Manu'' 8.25</ref>  ''Manu'' 8.62-72 distinguishes who the king may or may not have questioned as a witness in connection with a trial; a greatly expanded list is given at ''N\u0101rada'' 1.159. Upon hearing contradictory testimony from witnesses, the king is advised at ''Manu'' 8.73 to rely on what the majority of witnesses say, or else the testimony of witnesses of superior qualities; if discrepancy persists, the testimony of Brahmins is to be relied upon.<ref>''N\u0101rada'' 1.209-210 replaces \"testimony of Brahmins\" with testimony of those witnesses with the best memories. If those with the best memories disagree, the testimony is to be disqualified.</ref>  ''N\u0101rada'' 1.142 states that the king should dismiss witnesses whose testimonies continuously contradict each other.\n\nFollowing this inquiry, the case may be decided upon.<ref>See ''N\u0101rada'' {{IAST|M\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101}} 1.30</ref>\n\n==Taxation==\nThe king's right to tax was the logical next step after the theory of absolute ownership of lands by the king. Manu describes the king as the absolute lord of the land and as such, the king was entitled to his share in the produce of the lands. The permission of the king was needed to buy, sell and donate land.<ref>Sarkar, K.R. ''Public Finance in Ancient India'', p. 55</ref> In reality, the land was the people\u2019s own, with the king only claiming absolute ownership. As long as the people worked the land and paid their taxes, they would be fine, but otherwise, the king could exercise his power and confiscate the land.<ref>Sarkar, p. 59</ref>\n\n===Bilateral contract===\nThis understanding was part of a bilateral contract made between the king and the people. The people would work the land and give taxes to the king for protection. The contract implies that the people submitted to a sovereign authority that they created, they volunteered to pay the tax, the tax rate was fixed by the people, the taxes are paid to the king as a wage for his protection and the king has to answer to the people. From this it can be concluded that the king has the right to tax, it is the duty of the people to pay taxes, and the duty is conditional on the performance of the king in his duties.<ref>Sarkar, p. 59</ref> This idea of the king\u2019s performance in protection in relationship to taxation is so important that some texts require the king to compensate for any stolen goods he failed to recover.<ref>Ghoshal, U.N. ''Contributions to the History of the Hindu Revenue System'', p. 25</ref>\n\n===Limits===\nThe king had limitations on how he could tax. He had to know when to tax as some times were better than others. The amount the person was taxed was to be determined by the nature of the person. If they had gotten rich from doing wrong, they were to be highly taxed, those who were prosperous were to be taxed little by little and those who could not pay should never be taxed. The limit people could pay in taxes should not be crossed. Only profits and surpluses should be taxed.<ref>Ghoshal, p. 26</ref> Increases should be done gradually and at the proper time. The king should use the taxes to help benefit the people.<ref>Sarkar, p. 62-67</ref><ref>Ghoshal, p. 30</ref>\n\n===Types of taxes===\n====Bali====\nIn the early Vedic period the king collected taxes regularly from his subjects. The taxes were called bali and consisted of 1/6 the agricultural produce or cattle for a given person.<ref>Ghoshal, p. 10</ref> Another form of bali was tributes extracted from conquered enemies by the king. There was a system in place to collect these taxes, but the exact details have been lost to time.<ref>Ghoshal, p. 14</ref> Even when other forms of taxes appeared in the later periods, bali was still present. It was used a special tax that was used differently by different kingdoms in order to gain additional revenue.<ref>Sarkar, p. 105</ref>\n\n====Land revenue====\nThis was the main tax in the post-Vedic period as it evolved out of bali. It was important source of income for the state and it was employed in every kingdom since its founding. This tax entailed the state receiving 1/6 of the produce of the land. This tax was of the profits made from the land, not the gross produce. People could pay the tax either in the good produced or with money. There  Also a survey would be done to assist in the proper collection of the tax.<ref>Sarkar, p. 87-88</ref>\n\n====Irrigation tax====\nThe state had to look over and protect the natural sources of water. Also they had to build and maintain irrigation devices such as canals. If water was taken from rivers, tanks, lakes or wells a rate of a fourth of the produce was taken.<ref>Sarkar, p. 90-91</ref>\n\n====Toll charges====\nDuties placed on goods imported from foreign lands, produced in country parts and within the city. The rates varied between 4% and 20%. Marriage and religious commodities were except. There were other types of toll charges including: a water ferry toll, toll to enter the city, road toll and a use of harbor toll.<ref>Sarkar, p. 92-94</ref>\n\n====Sales tax====\nThere were two types of sale taxes. One was a general tax of 10% placed on all goods. The other taxes placed on special goods such as jewels, land auctions and immovable objects. The punishment of tax evasion was the confiscation of the goods purchased.<ref>Sarkar, p. 98-99</ref>\n\n====Labor tax====\nEveryone was expected to contribute to the common good. For poor people who could not pay their taxes in kind or with money, they would have to work in state factories. Also one day of each month, each person, including Brahmins, had to work solely for the king, called Visti.<ref>Sarkar, p. 101-102</ref>\n\n====Poll tax====\nThis is a tax levied on individuals. There were two forms of the poll tax. The first was a general tax was levied on every member of a family. The second was a special tax that undesirable foreigners had to pay to enter a city.<ref>Sarkar, p. 106</ref>\n\n====Other taxes====\n*Customs duty\n*Excise tax\n*Salt tax\n*Excise profit tax\n*Trade tax\n*Professional tax\n*Income tax\n*Gambling tax\n*General property tax (Kara)<ref>Ghoshal, p.47</ref>\n*Construction tax (V\u0101stuka)\n*Survey tax (Rajju)\n*Police tax (Chorarajju)\n*Tax on villages on the water (Kl\u0157pta)\n*General tax on villages (Pi\u0146dakara)\n*Emergency tax (Pra\u0146aya)\n*Celebration tax (Utsanga)\n*War tax (Sen\u0101bhakta)<ref>Sarkar, p. 95-111</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Monarchy]]\n*[[Kingdoms of ancient India]]\n*[[Chakravartin]]\n*[[Raja]]\n*[[Maharaja]]\n*[[Buddhist kingship]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | author = Translation by Richard W.

Their goal is to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and promote a transition to a [[renewable energy]] economy through a [[market (economics)|market]]-based approach: a revenue neutral '[[carbon fee and dividend]]' approach to pricing carbon pollution from fossil fuels, and simultaneously ending subsidies to [[fossil fuel]] companies.<ref name=\"Citizens\"/> In the United States, using a market-based approach by putting a price on carbon is gaining support from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref name = \"Bornstein\"/><ref name=\"republican_case\">{{cite web|title=Ruckelshaus, William D., Thomas, Lee M., Reilly, William K. and Whitmann, Christine Todd, A Republican case for Climate Action|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=1 August 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/opinion/a-republican-case-for-climate-action.html?_r=1& }}</ref><ref name=\"inglis\">{{cite web|title=Changing the Dialogue on Energy and Climate, Bob Inglis at TEDx Jacksonville|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=10 December 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUmcnxIQU24 }}</ref><ref name=\"sheldon_whitehouse\">{{cite web|title=Time To Wake Up: Carbon Fee Options by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=27 June 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_SugBBCURs}}</ref> CCL believes that a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend is a bipartisan solution that would effectively address carbon emissions, while not relying on a complex regulation approach.\n\n== History ==\nThe Citizens' Climate lobby originated in the United States in 2007 after founder [[Marshall L Saunders|Marshall Saunders]] recognized the need for progressive climate legislation. Saunders, a successful businessman turned philanthropist, internationally recognized for his work in [[micro loans|micro-credit]], became increasingly concerned about [[climate change]]. Saunders increasingly recognized that while it was necessary for individuals to change their own behavior in the face of climate change, it would never be enough; the time had come for Congress to discontinue subsidizing the [[Fossil fuel#Industry|fossil fuel industry]]. With ever-rising energy production and increased use Saunders believed effective legislation was necessary to cut carbon emissions, by putting a price on carbon.<ref name=\"Citizens\">{{cite web|title=Citizens Climate Lobby, www.citizensclimatelobby.org|url=http://www.citizensclimatelobby.org/|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nSaunders coordinated his efforts to establish Citizens' Climate Lobby with RESULTS, an organization committed to helping volunteer organizations seeking legislative changes to become more effective.<ref name = \"Bornstein\"/> Groups of volunteers organized by electoral districts could work through local media and elected officials to build public support and political will for change. Citizens' Climate Lobby established its primary, interconnected goals \u2013 to achieve legislation at the federal level that would effectively mitigate climate change, to create widespread political will for a sustainable climate, and to empower citizens to better exercise their own political and personal will. United States leadership is widely seen as critical in international emissions reduction efforts, and particularly in carbon pricing, as this would encourage other countries to follow suit with similar legislation.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nThe Citizens' Climate Lobby held its first annual conference in 2009 in Washington D.C., bringing together representatives from around the United States as well as several Canadians. These Canadians subsequently led the establishment of the organization within Canada in 2011, with the first chapter emerging in Sudbury, Ontario.<ref name =\"CCL_Canada\"/>\n\nSince the initial development of Citizens' Climate Lobby, the group has rapidly grown and spread, from 3 local groups in 2007 to 327 groups in May 2016. They are located throughout the United States and Canada,<ref name =\"CCL_Canada\"/> and more recently branching out to other countries including [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"CCL-Sweden\">{{cite web|title=CCL-Sweden, www.cclsverige.se |url=http://www.cclsverige.se|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> [[Bangladesh]]<ref name=\"CCL-Bangladesh\">{{cite web|title=CCL-Bangladesh |url=https://plus.google.com/+CitizensclimatelobbyOrg/posts|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> (both starting in 2013), Australia, Germany, India, Nepal, Panama, United Kingdom, Burundi, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, France, Kenya, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Qatar, Poland, Romania, Portugal, Serbia, Scotland, Switzerland and the Ukraine.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nVolunteers in local chapters meet monthly for teleconference lectures by climate experts and communication with other groups, to discuss coordinated actions to be undertaken by members, to practice skills involved in lobbying politicians and dealing with media, and to plan local outreach. These activities support the ongoing goals of the organization and contribute to progress toward effective carbon pricing legislation.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Proposed US legislation==\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby proposes national legislation that would reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by placing a fee on [[carbon dioxide]] ({{co2}}) or equivalent gases. The fee would be levied against all fossil fuels at their point of entry into the economy. The revenue that would be collected would be 100% returned as a monthly or annual payment to every American household. This would protect low and middle class Americans from the rising consumer costs associated with the carbon fee. This idea is known as a [[carbon fee and dividend]].\n\nCCL's proposal would start the fee at US$15 per [[ton]] of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{co2}} equivalent]] (3/4 of a penny per pound) and rise $10 per ton each year (1/2 of a penny per pound). The fee would continue to rise until total US {{co2}} equivalent emissions have been reduced to 10% of US {{co2}} equivalent emissions in 1990. To protect US businesses from competition from other countries that do not have carbon pricing mechanisms, a border adjustment would be enacted. Similar to the [[Montreal Protocol]], goods coming from countries without a carbon price would be subjected to a fee at the border. Goods leaving the US for sale in a country without a carbon price would be reimbursed that fee at the border. In addition, all existing subsidies of fossil fuels, including tax credits, would be phased out over the 5 years following enactment.<ref name=\"proposed_legislation\">{{cite web|title=Proposed Carbon Fee and Dividend Legislation|url=http://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Carbon-Fee-and-Dividend-April-2014.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn September 1, 2016 [[California State Legislature]] passed a measure that urges the United States Congress to enact a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels. The proposal is revenue-neutral, with all money collected going to the bottom 2/3 of American households.

And if and when the damages appear it will be too late to reverse the process. Thus we are forced to look a long way ahead.\n* Emissions have been, and continue to be, driven by economic growth; yet stabilization of [[greenhouse gas]] [[concentration]] in the [[atmosphere]] is feasible and consistent with continued growth.\n* Establishing a [[carbon price]], through tax, trading or regulation, is an essential foundation for climate change policy.\n* There is still time to avoid the worst [[Effects of global warming|impacts of climate change]] if strong collective action starts now.<ref name=\"stern_2006_exec\"/>\n\n=== Energy Modeling Forum study 2012 ===\n\n{{main|Fee and dividend#Energy Modeling Forum study 2012}}\n\nIn late-2012 the [[Energy Modeling Forum]] (EMF), coordinated by [[Stanford University]], released its EMF{{nnbsp}}29 study titled \"The role of border carbon adjustment in unilateral climate policy\".<ref name=\"emf-29-website\">{{cite web | title = EMF 29: The role of border carbon adjustment in unilateral climate policy | website = Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) | location = Stanford, CA, USA | url = https://emf.stanford.edu/projects/emf-29-role-border-carbon-adjustment-unilateral-climate-policy | access-date = 2016-10-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"boehringer-etal-2012a\"><!-- note: details here based on the recommended citation in the preamble to the document -->{{cite book | last1 = B\u00f6hringer | first1 = Christoph | last2 = Rutherford | first2 = Thomas F | last3 = Balistreri | first3 = Edward J | title = The role of border carbon adjustment in unilateral climate policy: Insights from a model-comparison study \u2014 Discussion Paper 2012-54 | date = October 2012 | publisher = Harvard Project on Climate Agreements | location = Cambridge, MA, USA | url = http://live.belfercenter.org/files/bohringer_dp54_v3-final.pdf | access-date = 2016-10-22 }}</ref><ref name=\"boehringer-etal-2012b\">{{cite journal | last1 = B\u00f6hringer | first1 = Christoph | last2 = Balistreri | first2 = Edward J | last3 = Rutherford | first3 = Thomas F | title = The role of border carbon adjustment in unilateral climate policy: overview of an Energy Modeling Forum study (EMF 29) | date = December 2012 | journal = Energy Economics | volume = 34, Supplement 2 | pages = S97\u2013S110 | doi = 10.1016/j.eneco.2012.10.003 | issn = 0140-9883 }}</ref> It is well understood that unilateral [[climate policy]] can lead to [[Carbon leakage|emissions leakage]]. As one example, trade-exposed emissions-intensive industries may simply relocate to regions with laxer climate protection.

Under such a policy, tariffs are levied on the carbon embodied in imported goods from unregulated trading partners while the original climate protection payments for exported goods are rebated.<ref name=\"emf-29-website\"/> The study finds that the BCA programs evaluated can reduce [[Carbon leakage|emissions leakage]], can yield modest gains in global [[economic efficiency]], and will shift substantial costs from abating [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] counties to non-abating non-OECD countries.<ref name=\"boehringer-etal-2012b\"/> This last finding is regressive and counter to the equity principles contained in the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]].<ref name=\"emf-29-website\"/>\n\n=== Regional Economic Models study 2014 ===\n\nA private economic modeling company, Regional Economic Models, Inc (REMI), was commissioned by Citizens' Climate Lobby to conduct an objective analysis of the economic impacts of a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend in the US.

Aside from the few paid staff members, the organization is run by thousands of volunteers. Often volunteers will initiate a new group by themselves, or with just one or two others, until they find enough other people nearby to formally start a new group. When a new group is started, orientation and training is provided through the respective national office.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby is coordinated through regular email communication at all levels, monthly international teleconferences and group meetings, weekly international, national or regional group leader calls; national websites; social media communication at different levels.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nThe largest focal point each year is the Annual International Conference in June, which includes meeting with and lobbying as many members of Congress as possible in Washington D.C. Canada's Citizens' Climate Lobby has in the past coordinated its annual meeting and lobbying activities in Ottawa with other organizations but held its first Annual Conference and Lobbying Days in November 2013.\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby additionally holds a smaller, secondary conference known as the Congressional Education day each November.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Priorities and influence ==\nThe work of Citizens' Climate Lobby has an influence at the local and the national scale. At the local scale, Citizens' Climate Lobby brings concerned citizens together as a community to educate themselves and others, including through the media, and to create a voice on climate change to present to locally elected representatives of the federal government. This includes Members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senators]] in the United States and [[Members of Parliament]] and Senators (appointed) in Canada.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby believes it is important for members to meet and create a relationship with local representatives as a means of \"putting a face\" on local chapters and to provide information and state their concerns regarding climate change legislation. When there is an important climate bill being considered in the nation's capital, members of Citizens' Climate Lobby bring it to the attention of their elected representatives and lobby for their support as appropriate. The chapters also act to keep citizens informed about climate legislation and timely actions to take. Monthly local chapter meetings allow members to share information about climate change issues, to plan for upcoming events related to climate change and to provide mutual support.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nAt the national level Citizens' Climate Lobby chapters can directly influence federal legislation via the work completed at the local level. These chapters contribute to a growing network of people across the country who share the same initiative. Together these individuals and groups become a powerful voice that can capture the attention of other citizens and of municipal and federal representatives alike.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Initiatives ==\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobbyists create political will for a sustainable climate and empower others in many ways, including by:\n* Educating themselves, their friends and people of influence about the science, economics, sociology, business, denial machine, politics, communication, and many other aspects of climate change.

Its key purposes are listed as creating a political will for a sustainable climate, while empowering individuals to exercise their personal and political power.

Their goal is to cut [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and promote a transition to a [[renewable energy]] economy through a [[market (economics)|market]]-based approach: a revenue neutral '[[carbon fee and dividend]]' approach to pricing carbon pollution from fossil fuels, and simultaneously ending subsidies to [[fossil fuel]] companies.<ref name=\"Citizens\"/> In the United States, using a market-based approach by putting a price on carbon is gaining support from both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref name = \"Bornstein\"/><ref name=\"republican_case\">{{cite web|title=Ruckelshaus, William D., Thomas, Lee M., Reilly, William K. and Whitmann, Christine Todd, A Republican case for Climate Action|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=1 August 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/opinion/a-republican-case-for-climate-action.html?_r=1& }}</ref><ref name=\"inglis\">{{cite web|title=Changing the Dialogue on Energy and Climate, Bob Inglis at TEDx Jacksonville|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=10 December 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUmcnxIQU24 }}</ref><ref name=\"sheldon_whitehouse\">{{cite web|title=Time To Wake Up: Carbon Fee Options by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse|accessdate=3 February 2014|date=27 June 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_SugBBCURs}}</ref> CCL believes that a revenue neutral carbon fee and dividend is a bipartisan solution that would effectively address carbon emissions, while not relying on a complex regulation approach.\n\n== History ==\nThe Citizens' Climate lobby originated in the United States in 2007 after founder [[Marshall L Saunders|Marshall Saunders]] recognized the need for progressive climate legislation. Saunders, a successful businessman turned philanthropist, internationally recognized for his work in [[micro loans|micro-credit]], became increasingly concerned about [[climate change]]. Saunders increasingly recognized that while it was necessary for individuals to change their own behavior in the face of climate change, it would never be enough; the time had come for Congress to discontinue subsidizing the [[Fossil fuel#Industry|fossil fuel industry]]. With ever-rising energy production and increased use Saunders believed effective legislation was necessary to cut carbon emissions, by putting a price on carbon.<ref name=\"Citizens\">{{cite web|title=Citizens Climate Lobby, www.citizensclimatelobby.org|url=http://www.citizensclimatelobby.org/|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nSaunders coordinated his efforts to establish Citizens' Climate Lobby with RESULTS, an organization committed to helping volunteer organizations seeking legislative changes to become more effective.<ref name = \"Bornstein\"/> Groups of volunteers organized by electoral districts could work through local media and elected officials to build public support and political will for change. Citizens' Climate Lobby established its primary, interconnected goals \u2013 to achieve legislation at the federal level that would effectively mitigate climate change, to create widespread political will for a sustainable climate, and to empower citizens to better exercise their own political and personal will. United States leadership is widely seen as critical in international emissions reduction efforts, and particularly in carbon pricing, as this would encourage other countries to follow suit with similar legislation.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nThe Citizens' Climate Lobby held its first annual conference in 2009 in Washington D.C., bringing together representatives from around the United States as well as several Canadians. These Canadians subsequently led the establishment of the organization within Canada in 2011, with the first chapter emerging in Sudbury, Ontario.<ref name =\"CCL_Canada\"/>\n\nSince the initial development of Citizens' Climate Lobby, the group has rapidly grown and spread, from 3 local groups in 2007 to 327 groups in May 2016. They are located throughout the United States and Canada,<ref name =\"CCL_Canada\"/> and more recently branching out to other countries including [[Sweden]],<ref name=\"CCL-Sweden\">{{cite web|title=CCL-Sweden, www.cclsverige.se |url=http://www.cclsverige.se|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> [[Bangladesh]]<ref name=\"CCL-Bangladesh\">{{cite web|title=CCL-Bangladesh |url=https://plus.google.com/+CitizensclimatelobbyOrg/posts|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> (both starting in 2013), Australia, Germany, India, Nepal, Panama, United Kingdom, Burundi, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, France, Kenya, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Qatar, Poland, Romania, Portugal, Serbia, Scotland, Switzerland and the Ukraine.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nVolunteers in local chapters meet monthly for teleconference lectures by climate experts and communication with other groups, to discuss coordinated actions to be undertaken by members, to practice skills involved in lobbying politicians and dealing with media, and to plan local outreach. These activities support the ongoing goals of the organization and contribute to progress toward effective carbon pricing legislation.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Proposed US legislation==\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby proposes national legislation that would reduce US greenhouse gas emissions by placing a fee on [[carbon dioxide]] ({{co2}}) or equivalent gases. The fee would be levied against all fossil fuels at their point of entry into the economy. The revenue that would be collected would be 100% returned as a monthly or annual payment to every American household. This would protect low and middle class Americans from the rising consumer costs associated with the carbon fee. This idea is known as a [[carbon fee and dividend]].\n\nCCL's proposal would start the fee at US$15 per [[ton]] of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent|{{co2}} equivalent]] (3/4 of a penny per pound) and rise $10 per ton each year (1/2 of a penny per pound). The fee would continue to rise until total US {{co2}} equivalent emissions have been reduced to 10% of US {{co2}} equivalent emissions in 1990. To protect US businesses from competition from other countries that do not have carbon pricing mechanisms, a border adjustment would be enacted. Similar to the [[Montreal Protocol]], goods coming from countries without a carbon price would be subjected to a fee at the border. Goods leaving the US for sale in a country without a carbon price would be reimbursed that fee at the border. In addition, all existing subsidies of fossil fuels, including tax credits, would be phased out over the 5 years following enactment.<ref name=\"proposed_legislation\">{{cite web|title=Proposed Carbon Fee and Dividend Legislation|url=http://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Carbon-Fee-and-Dividend-April-2014.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn September 1, 2016 [[California State Legislature]] passed a measure that urges the United States Congress to enact a tax on carbon-based fossil fuels. The proposal is revenue-neutral, with all money collected going to the bottom 2/3 of American households.

Accessed December 28, 2019.]</ref> alongside his wife, Pamela Saunders.<ref name=\"staff_members\">{{cite web |title=Citizens' Climate Lobby Staff |url=https://citizensclimatelobby.org/about-ccl/staff/ |website=citizensclimatelobby.org |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> Mark Reynolds is the group's executive director.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Thom Hartmann Show, Will America get a Federal Carbon Tax?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E92QTvlvRmo/|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> Cathy Orlando serves as the manager for the Canadian branch of the Citizens' Climate Lobby.<ref name =\"CCL_Canada\"/>\n\nRegional coordinators in the US regularly communicate with the local group leaders in their geographical region. Aside from the few paid staff members, the organization is run by thousands of volunteers. Often volunteers will initiate a new group by themselves, or with just one or two others, until they find enough other people nearby to formally start a new group. When a new group is started, orientation and training is provided through the respective national office.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby is coordinated through regular email communication at all levels, monthly international teleconferences and group meetings, weekly international, national or regional group leader calls; national websites; social media communication at different levels.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nThe largest focal point each year is the Annual International Conference in June, which includes meeting with and lobbying as many members of Congress as possible in Washington D.C. Canada's Citizens' Climate Lobby has in the past coordinated its annual meeting and lobbying activities in Ottawa with other organizations but held its first Annual Conference and Lobbying Days in November 2013.\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby additionally holds a smaller, secondary conference known as the Congressional Education day each November.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Priorities and influence ==\nThe work of Citizens' Climate Lobby has an influence at the local and the national scale. At the local scale, Citizens' Climate Lobby brings concerned citizens together as a community to educate themselves and others, including through the media, and to create a voice on climate change to present to locally elected representatives of the federal government. This includes Members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate|Senators]] in the United States and [[Members of Parliament]] and Senators (appointed) in Canada.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobby believes it is important for members to meet and create a relationship with local representatives as a means of \"putting a face\" on local chapters and to provide information and state their concerns regarding climate change legislation. When there is an important climate bill being considered in the nation's capital, members of Citizens' Climate Lobby bring it to the attention of their elected representatives and lobby for their support as appropriate. The chapters also act to keep citizens informed about climate legislation and timely actions to take. Monthly local chapter meetings allow members to share information about climate change issues, to plan for upcoming events related to climate change and to provide mutual support.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\nAt the national level Citizens' Climate Lobby chapters can directly influence federal legislation via the work completed at the local level. These chapters contribute to a growing network of people across the country who share the same initiative. Together these individuals and groups become a powerful voice that can capture the attention of other citizens and of municipal and federal representatives alike.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Initiatives ==\n\nCitizens' Climate Lobbyists create political will for a sustainable climate and empower others in many ways, including by:\n* Educating themselves, their friends and people of influence about the science, economics, sociology, business, denial machine, politics, communication, and many other aspects of climate change. They sponsor weekly educational webinars which are nicknamed \"Citizens' Climate University (CCU)\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://community.citizensclimatelobby.org/learn/|title=Learn - CCL Community|publisher=}}</ref>\n* Writing handwritten letters to politicians, especially Members of Congress, Parliament and National Assemblies, and recruiting others to do so.\n* Lobbying politicians directly in their constituency offices and in the capital cities.\n* Participating in community events where they engage the public in climate change awareness and actions.\n* Creating awareness in the media by writing stories, blogs, media releases, letters to the editor, opinion editorials, tweets, status updates, etc., and submitting them to traditional (radio, TV, and newspapers) and 21st century sources (blogs, online magazine and social media).\n* Developing partnerships, alliances and relationships with a range of groups towards building a broad and diverse base support which will create political will for a sustainable climate<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n\n== Accomplishments ==\n* The number of local groups roughly doubled each year for many years, from 3 in 2007 to 6 in 2008, to 14 in 2009, to 24 in 2010, to 44 in 2011, to 74 in 2012, to 148 in 2013, to 228 in 2014.<ref name=\"Citizens\" /> In October 2017, there are 450 chapters.\n* Citizens' Climate Lobby has written a legislative proposal, The Carbon Fee and Dividend Act, introduced by Dr. James Hansen at an Earth Day rally on the National Mall in Washington.<ref name=\"proposed_legislation\" />\n* Published Letters to the Editor have grown from 537 in 2012 to 2,253 in 2014, to 3,034 in 2015.<ref name=\"Citizens\" />\n* Letters to Members of Congress have grown from 5,547 in 2014, to just over 40,000 in 2016, to 51,920 by October in 2017.\n* Editorial Board meetings have grown from 24 in 2012 to 52 in 2014.

However their first focus is on overhauling the [[European Union Emissions Trading System]] (EU{{nbsp}}ETS) as follows:<ref name=\"ccl-d-position-paper-summary\">{{cite book | title = Positionspapier \u2014 Kurzfassung | trans-title = Position paper \u2014 Summary | language = German | date = 5 May 2016 | publisher = B\u00fcrgerlobby Klimaschutz | location = Munich, Germany | url = https://de.citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/07/Positionspapier_Kurzfassung.pdf | access-date = 2016-09-21 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160923050409/https://de.citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/07/Positionspapier_Kurzfassung.pdf | archive-date = 23 September 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n* extend the EU{{nbsp}}ETS so that all emissions are covered and modify the annual cap so that 2030 emissions sink by at least 50% relative to 1990 levels\n* introduce a continuously increasing floor price for {{CO2}} allowances\n* introduce a [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] compliant border adjustment system to level the playing field between European companies and their global competitors\n\nAs long as there is no effective price signal at the [[European Union|EU]] level, {{nowrap|CCL-D}} call for a national [[carbon tax]] for Germany on all {{CO2}} emissions as a transitional measure.\n\nA central theme for {{nowrap|CCL-D}} is that, for an equitable and socially-compatible [[carbon price]], all revenues must be redistributed back to the population on a per-capita basis.\n\n== Connections ==\nCitizens' Climate Lobby is a non-partisan group that develops and maintains relationships with and may coordinate some activities with a broad base of organizations that share similar goals. In 2013, [[Bill McKibben]], founder of [[350.org]],<ref name=\"350.org\">{{cite web|title=350.org|url=http://350.org/|accessdate=3 February 2014}}</ref> endorsed CCL by saying \"I love working with Citizens' Climate Lobby\u2014their relentless focus on the need for a fee-and-dividend solution is helping drive the debate in precisely the right direction.

The name is from the Greek word {{lang-grc|\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2|b\u00e1trachos|frog|label=none}}.<ref>''The Merck Index''. Entry 1009. p. 167.</ref> Structurally-related chemical compounds are often referred to collectively as batrachotoxins. It is an extremely poisonous alkaloid. In certain frogs this alkaloid is present mostly on the skin. Such frogs are among those used for [[poisoned dart|poisoning darts]]. Batrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the [[sodium channels]] of nerve cells and prevents them from closing, resulting in paralysis. No antidote is known.\n\n==History==\nIt was named by scientists [[John W. Daly]] and [[Bernhard Witkop]], who separated the potent toxic alkaloids fraction and determined its chemical properties. They isolated four major toxic steroidal alkaloids including batrachotoxin, isobatrachotoxin, pseudobatrachotoxin, and batrachotoxinin A.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to the difficulty of handling such a potent toxin and the minuscule amount that could be collected, a comprehensive structure determination involved several difficulties. However, Takashi Tokuyama, who joined the investigation later, converted one of the [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] compounds, batrachotoxinin A, to a crystalline derivative and its unique steroidal structure was solved with [[x-ray diffraction]] techniques (1968).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tokuyama, T. |author2=Daly, J. |author3=Witkop, B. |author4=Karle, I.

In fact, batrachotoxin was able to be partially [[hydrolyze]]d using sodium hydroxide into a material with identical TLC and color reactions as batrachotoxinin A.<ref name=\":0\" /> The structure of batrachotoxin was established in 1969 through chemical recombination of both fragments.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |author1=Tokuyama, T. |author2=Daly, J. |author3=Witkop, B. | title = Structure of Batrachotoxin, a steroidal alkaloid from the Colombian arrow poison frog, ''Phyllobates aurotaenia'', and partial synthesis of Batrachotoxin and its analogs and homologs | journal = [[J.

When one of these frogs is agitated, feels threatened or is in pain, the toxin is reflexively released through several canals.\n\n=== Neurotoxicity ===\nAs a [[neurotoxin]], it affects the [[nervous system]]. Neurological function depends on  [[depolarization]] of nerve and muscle fibres due to increased sodium ion permeability of the [[excitable cell membrane]]. [[Lipid-soluble]] toxins such as batrachotoxin act directly on [[sodium ion channel]]s<ref name=\"pmid16354762\">{{cite journal |author1=Wang, S. Y. |author2=Mitchell, J. |author3=Tikhonov, D.

Batrachotoxin (BTX) irreversibly binds to the Na<sup>+</sup> channels which causes a conformational change in the channels that forces the sodium channels to remain open. Batrachotoxin not only keeps voltage-gated sodium channels open, but it also reduces the single-channel conductance. In other words, the toxin binds to the sodium channel and keeps the membrane permeable to sodium ions in an all or none manner.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wang, S. Y. |author2=Tikhonov, Denis B. |author3=Mitchell, Jane |author4=Zhorov, Boris S. |author5=Wang, Ging Kuo | title = Irreversible Block of Cardiac Mutant Na+ Channels by Batrachotoxin Channels | journal = Channels | year = 2007 | volume = 1 | issue= 3|pages=179\u2013188 |doi=10.4161/chan.4437 |pmid=18690024 }}</ref>\n\nThis has a direct effect on the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS). Batrachotoxin in the PNS produces increased [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] (selective and irreversible) of the resting cell membrane to sodium ions, without changing [[potassium]] or [[calcium]] concentration. This influx of sodium depolarizes the formerly polarized cell membrane. Batrachotoxin also alters the ion selectivity of the ion channel by increasing the permeability of the channel toward larger cations. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels become persistently active at the resting membrane potential. Batrachotoxin kills by permanently blocking nerve signal transmission to the muscles.\n\nBatrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells and prevent them from closing. The neuron can no longer send signals and this results in paralysis.\n\nAlthough generally classified as a [[neurotoxin]], batrachotoxin has marked effects on [[heart muscle]]s. These effects are similar to the [[cardiotoxic]] effects of [[digoxin]], a poison found in the [[foxglove]] plant. Batrachotoxin interferes with heart conduction, causing [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, [[extrasystole]]s, [[ventricular fibrillation]] and other changes which lead to [[cardiac arrest]]. Batrachotoxin induces a massive release of [[acetylcholine]] in nerves and muscles and destruction of [[synaptic vesicle]]s, as well. Batrachotoxin R is more toxic than related batrachotoxin A.\n\nStructural changes in nerves and muscles are due to a massive influx of sodium ions, which produces [[osmotic]] alterations. It has been suggested that there may also be an effect on the [[central nervous system]], although it is not currently known what such an effect may be.\n\nBatrachotoxin activity is temperature-dependent, with a maximum activity at {{convert|37|C|F}}. Its activity is also more rapid at an [[alkaline]] pH, which suggests that the unprotonated form may be more active.\n\n==Treatment==\nCurrently, no effective [[antidote]] exists for the treatment of batrachotoxin poisoning. [[Veratridine]], [[aconitine]] and [[grayanotoxin]]\u2014like batrachotoxin\u2014are [[lipid-soluble]] poisons which similarly alter the ion selectivity of the sodium channels, suggesting a common site of action. Due to these similarities, treatment for batrachotoxin poisoning might best be modeled after, or based on, treatments for one of these poisons. Treatment may also be modeled after that for [[digitalis]], which produces somewhat similar cardiotoxic effects.\n\nWhile it is not an antidote, the membrane depolarization can be prevented or reversed by either [[tetrodotoxin]] (from [[puffer fish]]), which is a [[noncompetitive inhibitor]], or [[saxitoxin]] (\"[[red tide]]\"){{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. These both have effects antagonistic to those of batrachotoxin on sodium flux. Certain [[anesthetic]]s may act as [[receptor antagonist]]s to the action of this alkaloid poison, while other local anesthetics block its action altogether by acting as competitive antagonists.\n\n==Sources==\nBatrachotoxin has been found in the four Papuan beetle species ''[[Choresine pulchra|C. pulchra]]'', ''[[Choresine semiopaca|C. semiopaca]]'', ''[[Choresine rugiceps|C. rugiceps]]'' and [[Choresine sp.

Bubbles of poison form as the frog's skin begins to blister. The dart tips are prepared by touching them to the toxin, or the toxin can be caught in a container and allowed to ferment. Poison darts made from either fresh or fermented batrachotoxin are enough to drop monkeys and birds in their tracks. Nerve paralysis is almost instantaneous. Other accounts say that a stick ''siurukida'' (\"bamboo tooth\") is put through the mouth of the frog and passed out through one of its hind legs. This causes the frog to [[Perspiration|perspire]] profusely on its back, which becomes covered with a white froth. The darts are dipped or rolled in the froth, preserving their lethal power for up to a year.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tetrodotoxin]], a toxin that works in the opposite way of batrachotoxin\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{ cite book |author1=Daly, J.

No antidote is known.\n\n==History==\nIt was named by scientists [[John W. Daly]] and [[Bernhard Witkop]], who separated the potent toxic alkaloids fraction and determined its chemical properties. They isolated four major toxic steroidal alkaloids including batrachotoxin, isobatrachotoxin, pseudobatrachotoxin, and batrachotoxinin A.<ref name=\":0\" /> Due to the difficulty of handling such a potent toxin and the minuscule amount that could be collected, a comprehensive structure determination involved several difficulties. However, Takashi Tokuyama, who joined the investigation later, converted one of the [[congener (chemistry)|congener]] compounds, batrachotoxinin A, to a crystalline derivative and its unique steroidal structure was solved with [[x-ray diffraction]] techniques (1968).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tokuyama, T. |author2=Daly, J. |author3=Witkop, B. |author4=Karle, I.

Neurological function depends on  [[depolarization]] of nerve and muscle fibres due to increased sodium ion permeability of the [[excitable cell membrane]]. [[Lipid-soluble]] toxins such as batrachotoxin act directly on [[sodium ion channel]]s<ref name=\"pmid16354762\">{{cite journal |author1=Wang, S. Y. |author2=Mitchell, J. |author3=Tikhonov, D.

Batrachotoxin (BTX) irreversibly binds to the Na<sup>+</sup> channels which causes a conformational change in the channels that forces the sodium channels to remain open. Batrachotoxin not only keeps voltage-gated sodium channels open, but it also reduces the single-channel conductance. In other words, the toxin binds to the sodium channel and keeps the membrane permeable to sodium ions in an all or none manner.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wang, S. Y. |author2=Tikhonov, Denis B. |author3=Mitchell, Jane |author4=Zhorov, Boris S. |author5=Wang, Ging Kuo | title = Irreversible Block of Cardiac Mutant Na+ Channels by Batrachotoxin Channels | journal = Channels | year = 2007 | volume = 1 | issue= 3|pages=179\u2013188 |doi=10.4161/chan.4437 |pmid=18690024 }}</ref>\n\nThis has a direct effect on the [[peripheral nervous system]] (PNS). Batrachotoxin in the PNS produces increased [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] (selective and irreversible) of the resting cell membrane to sodium ions, without changing [[potassium]] or [[calcium]] concentration. This influx of sodium depolarizes the formerly polarized cell membrane. Batrachotoxin also alters the ion selectivity of the ion channel by increasing the permeability of the channel toward larger cations. Voltage-sensitive sodium channels become persistently active at the resting membrane potential. Batrachotoxin kills by permanently blocking nerve signal transmission to the muscles.\n\nBatrachotoxin binds to and irreversibly opens the sodium channels of nerve cells and prevent them from closing. The neuron can no longer send signals and this results in paralysis.\n\nAlthough generally classified as a [[neurotoxin]], batrachotoxin has marked effects on [[heart muscle]]s. These effects are similar to the [[cardiotoxic]] effects of [[digoxin]], a poison found in the [[foxglove]] plant. Batrachotoxin interferes with heart conduction, causing [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, [[extrasystole]]s, [[ventricular fibrillation]] and other changes which lead to [[cardiac arrest]]. Batrachotoxin induces a massive release of [[acetylcholine]] in nerves and muscles and destruction of [[synaptic vesicle]]s, as well. Batrachotoxin R is more toxic than related batrachotoxin A.\n\nStructural changes in nerves and muscles are due to a massive influx of sodium ions, which produces [[osmotic]] alterations. It has been suggested that there may also be an effect on the [[central nervous system]], although it is not currently known what such an effect may be.\n\nBatrachotoxin activity is temperature-dependent, with a maximum activity at {{convert|37|C|F}}. Its activity is also more rapid at an [[alkaline]] pH, which suggests that the unprotonated form may be more active.\n\n==Treatment==\nCurrently, no effective [[antidote]] exists for the treatment of batrachotoxin poisoning. [[Veratridine]], [[aconitine]] and [[grayanotoxin]]\u2014like batrachotoxin\u2014are [[lipid-soluble]] poisons which similarly alter the ion selectivity of the sodium channels, suggesting a common site of action. Due to these similarities, treatment for batrachotoxin poisoning might best be modeled after, or based on, treatments for one of these poisons. Treatment may also be modeled after that for [[digitalis]], which produces somewhat similar cardiotoxic effects.\n\nWhile it is not an antidote, the membrane depolarization can be prevented or reversed by either [[tetrodotoxin]] (from [[puffer fish]]), which is a [[noncompetitive inhibitor]], or [[saxitoxin]] (\"[[red tide]]\"){{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}. These both have effects antagonistic to those of batrachotoxin on sodium flux. Certain [[anesthetic]]s may act as [[receptor antagonist]]s to the action of this alkaloid poison, while other local anesthetics block its action altogether by acting as competitive antagonists.\n\n==Sources==\nBatrachotoxin has been found in the four Papuan beetle species ''[[Choresine pulchra|C. pulchra]]'', ''[[Choresine semiopaca|C. semiopaca]]'', ''[[Choresine rugiceps|C. rugiceps]]'' and [[Choresine sp.

Poison darts made from either fresh or fermented batrachotoxin are enough to drop monkeys and birds in their tracks. Nerve paralysis is almost instantaneous. Other accounts say that a stick ''siurukida'' (\"bamboo tooth\") is put through the mouth of the frog and passed out through one of its hind legs.

After discovering on [[Instagram]] that an unrequited friend of hers named Charlotte did not invite her to her wedding, Ingrid crashes the reception and pepper sprays her in the face. Ingrid undergoes a brief stay at a mental hospital.\n\nAfter being released, Ingrid learns of a social media [[influencer marketing|influencer]] named Taylor Sloane from a magazine article. Beguiled by her seemingly perfect life, Ingrid comments on one of her posts and receives a response from Sloane. With an inheritance of over $60,000 from her deceased mother, Ingrid decides to move to Los Angeles to become friends with Taylor. Upon arrival, she rents a house in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] from Dan Pinto, an aspiring screenwriter. She visits Taylor's regular hangouts and restaurants, and gets a makeover in her style.\n\nAfter running into Taylor at one of her favorite bookstores, Ingrid follows her to her house and kidnaps her dog, Rothko. After Taylor puts up \"lost dog\" posters in the neighborhood, Ingrid returns Rothko, meeting Taylor and her husband Ezra. Ingrid accepts their offer to stay for dinner. The next day, Dan lends Ingrid his truck to help Taylor move some items to her home in Joshua Tree, on the condition that she return that evening to take a part in a table read of his screenplay. She tells Taylor the truck is her boyfriend's. They stay out late and party, and on the way home Ingrid damages the truck while driving under the influence. She returns it the following morning, causing Dan to cancel the table read. \n\nIngrid's friendship with Taylor grows as they begin to regularly hang out at galleries, restaurants and shops. After a while, Ingrid arrives at Taylor and Ezra's house and unexpectedly meets Taylor's brother Nicky, a recovering drug addict. Taylor dismisses her previous plans with Ingrid to attend a party with Nicky, furthering Ingrid's disdain for him. Taylor and Nicky tease Ingrid about her \"imaginary\" boyfriend Dan, whom they've never met. They invite Ingrid to a party that weekend at fashion blogger Harley Chung's house and tell her to bring Dan.\n\nIngrid apologizes to Dan for damaging his truck, promising to reimburse him and take him out to dinner. Later that night, after bonding over their past losses, the two have sex and begin a relationship. Ingrid invites Dan to Harley's party and asks him to tell everyone he's her boyfriend. Once there, Ingrid becomes envious of Taylor and Harley's friendship. She also begins to realize that several aspects of Taylor's persona are fabricated. Nicky finds Ingrid's phone with incriminating photographs that reveal her obsession with Taylor, and blackmails her for money. In retaliation, Ingrid pays a stranger to punch her in the face and tells Dan that Nicky did it. She begs him not to call the police for fear of what Nicky might do, and instead convinces him to kidnap and terrorize Nicky to keep him quiet. Nicky escapes his bindings and attacks Dan, leading Ingrid to stun Nicky with a crowbar. After Dan is hospitalized, Ingrid tries to call Taylor, but Ezra answers and tells Ingrid that Nicky has told them what happened, that Taylor does not want to hear from Ingrid again, and that she would have been arrested if Nicky had not been trying to hide his own crimes.\n\nDesperate, Ingrid moves into the small house next door to Taylor, using the last of her inheritance. Unable to pay the bills, she eventually loses power at the house. After noticing a Halloween party at Taylor's house, she dons a bed sheet and wig and crashes the party to charge her phone. When discovered, Ingrid berates Nicky, Ezra, and Taylor. Taylor responds that because of her fa\u00e7ade, the two were never truly friends, and suggests Ingrid needs professional help. Bereft, Ingrid retreats to her home surrounded by lit candles and records a video for her Instagram page, confessing her past deception before attempting suicide by overdosing on pills.\n\nIngrid survives after Dan sees the video and calls emergency services.

The film received positive reviews, with many praising the script, dark themes, humor, and performances.\n\n== Plot ==\nIngrid Thorburn is a mentally unstable young woman in Pennsylvania. After discovering on [[Instagram]] that an unrequited friend of hers named Charlotte did not invite her to her wedding, Ingrid crashes the reception and pepper sprays her in the face. Ingrid undergoes a brief stay at a mental hospital.\n\nAfter being released, Ingrid learns of a social media [[influencer marketing|influencer]] named Taylor Sloane from a magazine article. Beguiled by her seemingly perfect life, Ingrid comments on one of her posts and receives a response from Sloane. With an inheritance of over $60,000 from her deceased mother, Ingrid decides to move to Los Angeles to become friends with Taylor. Upon arrival, she rents a house in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]] from Dan Pinto, an aspiring screenwriter. She visits Taylor's regular hangouts and restaurants, and gets a makeover in her style.\n\nAfter running into Taylor at one of her favorite bookstores, Ingrid follows her to her house and kidnaps her dog, Rothko. After Taylor puts up \"lost dog\" posters in the neighborhood, Ingrid returns Rothko, meeting Taylor and her husband Ezra. Ingrid accepts their offer to stay for dinner. The next day, Dan lends Ingrid his truck to help Taylor move some items to her home in Joshua Tree, on the condition that she return that evening to take a part in a table read of his screenplay. She tells Taylor the truck is her boyfriend's. They stay out late and party, and on the way home Ingrid damages the truck while driving under the influence. She returns it the following morning, causing Dan to cancel the table read. \n\nIngrid's friendship with Taylor grows as they begin to regularly hang out at galleries, restaurants and shops. After a while, Ingrid arrives at Taylor and Ezra's house and unexpectedly meets Taylor's brother Nicky, a recovering drug addict. Taylor dismisses her previous plans with Ingrid to attend a party with Nicky, furthering Ingrid's disdain for him. Taylor and Nicky tease Ingrid about her \"imaginary\" boyfriend Dan, whom they've never met. They invite Ingrid to a party that weekend at fashion blogger Harley Chung's house and tell her to bring Dan.\n\nIngrid apologizes to Dan for damaging his truck, promising to reimburse him and take him out to dinner. Later that night, after bonding over their past losses, the two have sex and begin a relationship. Ingrid invites Dan to Harley's party and asks him to tell everyone he's her boyfriend. Once there, Ingrid becomes envious of Taylor and Harley's friendship. She also begins to realize that several aspects of Taylor's persona are fabricated. Nicky finds Ingrid's phone with incriminating photographs that reveal her obsession with Taylor, and blackmails her for money. In retaliation, Ingrid pays a stranger to punch her in the face and tells Dan that Nicky did it. She begs him not to call the police for fear of what Nicky might do, and instead convinces him to kidnap and terrorize Nicky to keep him quiet. Nicky escapes his bindings and attacks Dan, leading Ingrid to stun Nicky with a crowbar. After Dan is hospitalized, Ingrid tries to call Taylor, but Ezra answers and tells Ingrid that Nicky has told them what happened, that Taylor does not want to hear from Ingrid again, and that she would have been arrested if Nicky had not been trying to hide his own crimes.\n\nDesperate, Ingrid moves into the small house next door to Taylor, using the last of her inheritance. Unable to pay the bills, she eventually loses power at the house. After noticing a Halloween party at Taylor's house, she dons a bed sheet and wig and crashes the party to charge her phone. When discovered, Ingrid berates Nicky, Ezra, and Taylor. Taylor responds that because of her fa\u00e7ade, the two were never truly friends, and suggests Ingrid needs professional help. Bereft, Ingrid retreats to her home surrounded by lit candles and records a video for her Instagram page, confessing her past deception before attempting suicide by overdosing on pills.\n\nIngrid survives after Dan sees the video and calls emergency services. She wakes in the hospital to learn that her video has gone viral, and thousands of strangers have responded to her hashtag #iamingrid to show support. Feeling loved, Ingrid smiles.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Aubrey Plaza]] as Ingrid Thorburn, a mentally unstable woman with attachment issues, obsessed with social media.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|last=Ford |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aubrey-plaza-elizabeth-olsen-star-916233 |title=Aubrey Plaza, Elizabeth Olsen to Star in Dark Comedy 'Ingrid Goes West' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=August 1, 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Elizabeth Olsen]] as Taylor Sloane,<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last=Kroll |first=Justin|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/aubrey-plaza-elizabeth-olsen-ingrid-goes-west-1201828031/ |title=Aubrey Plaza, Elizabeth Olsen to Star in Dark Comedy 'Ingrid Goes West'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> a popular, narcissistic social media influencer with whom Ingrid becomes obsessed.\n* [[O'Shea Jackson Jr.]] as Dan Pinto,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2016/08/13/oshea-jackson-jr-joins-cast-of-ingrid-goes-west/|title=O'Shea Jackson Jr. Joins Cast Of 'Ingrid Goes West'|author=Shaina411|date=August 13, 2016|website=The Source|publisher=The Northstar Media|access-date=August 26, 2016}}</ref> an aspiring screenwriter and Ingrid's landlord who falls in love with her.\n* [[Wyatt Russell]] as Ezra O'Keefe,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://moviehole.net/2016107642ingrid-goes-west|title=O'Shea Jackson Jr, Billy Magnussen, Wyatt Russell join Ingrid Goes West|work=Moviehole|last=Ash|date=August 9, 2016|access-date=August 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810161225/http://moviehole.net/2016107642ingrid-goes-west|archive-date=August 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> a painter and Taylor's husband.\n* [[Billy Magnussen]] as Nicky Sloane,<ref name=\":2\" /> a recovering drug addict and Taylor's brother.\n* [[Pom Klementieff]] as Harley Chung,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/17/guardians-of-the-galaxy-pom-klementieff-joins-ingrid-goes-west/|title=New 'Guardian of the Galaxy' Pom Klementieff joins 'Ingrid Goes West'|last=Sneider|first=Jeff|website=[[Mashable]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|access-date=August 23, 2016|date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> a fashion blogger.\n* Hannah Utt as Nicole\n* Joseph Breen as Garth Lafayette\n* Angelica Amor as Cindy\n* [[Meredith Hagner|Meredith Kathleen Hagner]] as Charlotte Buckwald, a woman Ingrid forms a one-sided friendship with.\n* [[Charlie Wright (actor)|Charlie Wright]] as Chuck\n* Dennis Atlas as Buck\n\n== Production ==\nPrincipal photography began on July 11, 2016 in [[Los Angeles]] and wrapped August 12, 2016 in [[Joshua Tree, California]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} A focal point of the film is \"[[All My Life (K-Ci & JoJo song)|All My Life]]\" by [[K-Ci & JoJo]]; initially this song was meant to be [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]'s \"[[Kiss from a Rose]]\" (which would have tied into the Dan character's [[Batman]] obsession, as it's from the ''[[Batman Forever]]'' soundtrack), but Seal's asking price for the song was higher than the production could afford.

Mir Hazar Ramkhani, the father of [[Jumma Khan Marri]], took over the group in the 1980s. The Balochistan Liberation Army (also Baloch Liberation Army or Baluchistan Liberation army) (BLA) is a [[Baloch nationalist]] militant secessionist organization. However, [[Jumma Khan Marri]] ended his opposition and pledged allegiance to Pakistan on 17 February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1390521|title=Baloch leader distances himself from separatist movement|date=20 February 2018|work=Dawn News}}</ref> The stated goals of the organization include the establishment of an independent state of [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] separate from [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]]. The name Baloch Liberation Army first became public in summer 2000, after the organization claimed credit for a series of bomb attacks in markets and railways lines.

Some directories may prevent search engines from rating a displayed link by using redirects, [[nofollow]] attributes, or other techniques. Many human-edited directories, including [[DMOZ]], [[World Wide Web Virtual Library]], [[Business.com]] and [[Jasmine Directory]], are edited by volunteers, who are often experts in particular categories. These directories are sometimes criticized due to long delays in approving submissions, or for rigid organizational structures and disputes among volunteer editors.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, some volunteer-edited directories have adopted [[wiki]] technology, to allow broader community participation in editing the directory (at the risk of introducing lower-quality, less objective entries).\n\nAnother direction taken by some web directories is the paid for inclusion model. This method enables the directory to offer timely inclusion for submissions and generally fewer listings as a result of the paid model. They often offer additional listing options to further enhance listings, including features listings and additional links to inner pages of the listed website. These options typically have an additional fee associated but offer significant help and visibility to sites and/or their inside pages.\n\nToday submission of websites to web directories is considered a common SEO ([[search engine optimization]]) technique to get back-links for the submitted website. One distinctive feature of 'directory submission' is that it cannot be fully automated like search engine submissions. Manual directory submission is a tedious and time-consuming job and is often outsourced by [[webmasters]].\n\n==Bid for Position directories==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2019}}\n'''Bid for Position directories''', also known as bidding web directories, are paid-for-inclusion web directories where the listings of websites in the directory are ordered according to their bid amount. They are special in that the more a person pays, the higher up the list of websites in the directory they go.

These directories are sometimes criticized due to long delays in approving submissions, or for rigid organizational structures and disputes among volunteer editors.\n\nIn response to these criticisms, some volunteer-edited directories have adopted [[wiki]] technology, to allow broader community participation in editing the directory (at the risk of introducing lower-quality, less objective entries).\n\nAnother direction taken by some web directories is the paid for inclusion model. This method enables the directory to offer timely inclusion for submissions and generally fewer listings as a result of the paid model. They often offer additional listing options to further enhance listings, including features listings and additional links to inner pages of the listed website. These options typically have an additional fee associated but offer significant help and visibility to sites and/or their inside pages.\n\nToday submission of websites to web directories is considered a common SEO ([[search engine optimization]]) technique to get back-links for the submitted website. One distinctive feature of 'directory submission' is that it cannot be fully automated like search engine submissions. Manual directory submission is a tedious and time-consuming job and is often outsourced by [[webmasters]].\n\n==Bid for Position directories==\n{{unref|section|date=April 2019}}\n'''Bid for Position directories''', also known as bidding web directories, are paid-for-inclusion web directories where the listings of websites in the directory are ordered according to their bid amount. They are special in that the more a person pays, the higher up the list of websites in the directory they go. With the higher listing, the website becomes more visible and increases the chances that visitors who browse the directory will click on the listing.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of web directories]]\n* [[Article directory]]\n* [[Business directory]]\n* [[Webography]]\n* [[Webring]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{DMOZ|Computers/Internet/Searching/Directories/|Web directories}}\n\n{{Web syndication}}\n\n[[Category:Web directories| ]]\n[[Category:Search engine optimization]]\n", "name_user": "Pk222", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(http://gitasita.in/)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_directory"}
