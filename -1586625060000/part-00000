Simulations can be held in the classroom, in situational environments, or in spaces built specifically for simulation practice.<ref name=Fanning2007 /> It can involve simulated human patients - artificial, human or a combination of the two, educational documents with detailed simulated animations, casualty assessment in [[homeland security]] and military situations, [[emergency response]], and support virtual health functions with holographic simulation. In the past, its main purpose was to train medical professionals to reduce error during surgery, prescription, crisis interventions, and general practice. Combined with methods in debriefing, it is now also used to train students in anatomy, physiology, and communication during their schooling.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Link-trainer-ts.jpg|thumb|Link Trainer.]]\n\nModern day simulation for training was first utilized by [[anesthesia]] physicians in order to reduce accidents.<ref name=\"academicResident\" /> When simulation skyrocketed in popularity during the 1930s due to the invention of the [[Link Trainer]] for flight and military applications, many different field experts attempted to adapt simulation to their own needs. Due to limitations in technology and overall medical knowledge to a specific degree at the time, medical simulation did not take off as acceptable training until much later.<ref name=\"academicResident\">Chakravarthy, Bharath.

Using AI eliminates the tone of judgment as well as the \u201cguess what I\u2019m thinking\u201d which can occur when asking questions.\n\n===== ''Application'' =====\nThe third and final phase of three-phase debriefing structures is most commonly referred to as \u201capplication,\"<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /> or \"summary\".<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Phrampus2013 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /> Participants are asked to move any newly acquired insights and/or knowledge gained throughout the simulation experience forward to their daily activities or thought processes.<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Lederman1992 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Sawyer2016 /> This includes learning which may have occurred during the previous phases in the debriefing process. Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:\n*\t\u201cWhat are you going to do differently in your practice tomorrow?\u201d<ref name=Jaye2015 />\n*\t\u201cWhat new insights have you gained?\u201d\n*\t\u201cWhat one thing will you commit to doing differently after this?\u201d\nNote that the summary here is not always in terms of re-stating the major points which were visited throughout the simulation & debrief, but more so emphasize the greatest impact of learning. The summary may be done by either the facilitator or the participants \u2013 debriefing models differ in which they suggest. In the latter, the participants summarize what was of most value for them.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 /> A summary by the facilitator consists of re-stating key learning points which occurred throughout the debrief.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 />\n\n==== Multi-Phase Debriefing Structure ====\nWhile all debriefing models include the phases of the three-part debriefing structure, there are several with additional phases. These additions either explicitly call out specific features which may be included in the three-part debriefing model, such as reviewing learning objectives, or provide additional process recommendations, such as immediately re-practicing any skills involved in the original simulation scenario.<ref name=Sawyer2013 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /> Examples of multi-phase debriefing structures include the Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS) framework,<ref name=Eppich2015 /> TeamGAINS,<ref name=Kolbe2013 /> and Healthcare Simulation After-Action Review (AAR).<ref name=Sawyer2013 />\n\n=== Learning Objectives ===\nAs with any other educational initiative, [[learning objective]]s are of paramount importance in simulation and debriefing. Without learning objectives, simulations themselves and the subsequent debriefs are aimless, disorganized, and often dysfunctional. Most debriefing models explicitly make mention of stating learning objectives.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 />\n\nThe exploration of learning objectives ought to answer at least two questions: What competencies \u2013 knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes \u2013 are to be learned, and what specifically should be learned about them?<ref name=Fanning2007 /> The method of debriefing chosen should align with learning objectives through evaluation of three points: performance domain \u2013 cognitive, technical, or behavioural; evidence for rationale \u2013 yes/no; and estimated length of time to address \u2013 short, moderate, or long.<ref name=Eppich2015 />\n\nLearning objectives may be predetermined and included in the development of a simulation scenario, or they may be emergent as the scenario unfolds.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Fanning2007 /> It can be challenging for the novice facilitator to adapt to emergent learning objectives, as the subsequent discussion may be purely exploratory in nature with no defined outcome. Conversely, the discussion may lead to a specific area of expertise which neither the facilitator nor participants are familiar with. In such situations, the facilitator and participants must be flexible and move on to the next objective, and follow-up with the debriefing of the emergent outcome at a later time.\n\n=== Environment ===\nThe debriefing environment consists of two main features: the physical setting, as well as the psychological environment.\n\n==== Physical setting ====\nWhen choosing a space in which to debrief, one must consider whether the scenario which unfolded was a complex case. Complex cases usually involve heightened emotions, interdependent processes, and require more time spent debriefing. As such, it is recommended that these types of debriefings occur in a separate room from where the simulation scenario took place. This allows for a release of tension as participants move from one place to another and encounter new surroundings.<ref name=Fanning2007 /> Note, however, that it is important to remind participants not to begin debriefing during the walk to the new room. The momentum of the simulation leads participants to begin debriefing with one another as soon the scenario has finished.<ref name=Steinwachs1992>{{cite journal | author = Steinwachs B | year = 1992 | title = How to facilitate a debriefing | url = | journal = Simulation & Gaming | volume = 23 | issue = 2| pages = 186\u2013195 }}</ref> However, in order to establish a shared mental model with all participants, debriefing must occur in a fashion whereby all participants can hear one another and have a chance to respond. This is difficult to accomplish while walking down a hallway, or in any disorganized fashion.\n\nThe location of the debriefing is ideally somewhere comfortable and conducive to conversation and reflection, where chairs can be maneuvered and manipulated.<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 /> It is recommended that, during the debriefing, the facilitator(s) and/or participants be seated in a circle.<ref name=Steinwachs1992 /> This is done so that everyone can see each other and increase group cohesion. Furthermore, the use of a circle implies equality amongst the group, and decreases any sense of hierarchy which may be present.\n\n==== Psychological environment ====\nEstablishing psychological safety and a safe learning environment is of utmost importance within both the simulation and the debriefing period.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Rudolph2014>{{cite journal | author = Rudolph J.W., Raemer D.B., Simon R. | year = 2014 | title = Establishing a Safe Container for Learning in Simulation: The Role of Presimulation Briefing | url = | journal = Simulation in Healthcare | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 339\u2013349 }}</ref><ref name=Sawyer2016 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 /> As simulation participants often find the experience stressful and intimidating, worried about judgment from their peers and facilitator(s), establishing safety must be done from the outset of the simulation event.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF03022056|pmid = 16251560|title = Barriers to use of simulation-based education|journal = Canadian Journal of Anesthesia/Journal Canadien d'Anesth\u00e9sie|volume = 52|issue = 9|pages = 944\u2013950|year = 2005|last1 = Savoldelli|first1 = Georges L.|last2 = Naik|first2 = Viren N.|last3 = Hamstra|first3 = Stanley J.|last4 = Morgan|first4 = Pamela J.}}</ref> Note that psychological safety does not necessarily equate to comfort, but rather that participants \u201cfeel safe enough to embrace being uncomfortable\u2026without the burden of feeling that they will be shamed, humiliated, or belittled\u201d.<ref name=Rudolph2014 />{{rp|340}}\n\nIt is recommended that establishing safety begin in the pre-brief phase<ref name=Rudolph2014 /> by alerting participants to the \u201cbasic assumption.\u201d The basic assumption, derived from the Centre for Medical Simulation at Harvard University (n.d.), is an agreed upon, predetermined mental model whereby everyone involved in the simulation & debrief believe that all participants are intelligent, well-trained, want to do their best, and are participating to learn and promote development.<ref name=Rudolph2008>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00248.x|pmid = 18945231|title = Debriefing as Formative Assessment: Closing Performance Gaps in Medical Education|journal = Academic Emergency Medicine|volume = 15|issue = 11|pages = 1010\u20131016|year = 2008|last1 = Rudolph|first1 = Jenny W.|last2 = Simon|first2 = Robert|last3 = Raemer|first3 = Daniel B.|last4 = Eppich|first4 = Walter J.}}</ref><ref name=Sawyer2016 /> Additionally, Rudolph et al. (2014) have identified four principles to guide the formulation of a psychologically safe environment:\n#\tCommunicate clear expectations\n#\tEstablish a \u201cfiction contract\u201d\n#\tAttend to logistic details\n#\tDeclare & enact a commitment to respecting learners & concern for their psychological safety<ref name=Rudolph2014 />\n\nIncluded in these principles is the notion of [[confidentiality]]. Explicitly reminding participants that their individual performance and debriefing reflections are not meant to be shared outside of the simulation event can help foster participation. Confidentiality builds trust by increasing transparency and allowing participants to practice without fear.<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Rudolph2014 />\n\n===Evidence & Further Study===\nThere exists a paucity of quantitative data regarding the effectiveness of debriefing in medical simulation,<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=\"Cheng2014\"/><ref name=Raemer2011>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e31822724d0| pmid=21817862| title=Research Regarding Debriefing as Part of the Learning Process| journal=Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare| volume=6| pages=S52\u2013S57| year=2011| last1=Raemer| first1=Daniel| last2=Anderson| first2=Mindi| last3=Cheng| first3=Adam| last4=Fanning| first4=Ruth| last5=Nadkarni| first5=Vinay| last6=Savoldelli| first6=Georges}}</ref> despite Lederman\u2019s 1992 seminal Model for the Systematic Assessment of Debriefing.<ref name=Lederman1992 /> Nearly every article reviewed had a cry for objective studies regarding the effectiveness of debriefing, whether it be comparing: the myriad options of conversational structures,<ref name=Sawyer2016 /> debriefing models,<ref name=Kolbe2013 />  or the comprehensive 5 W\u2019s of Who \u2013 debriefer, What \u2013 content & methods, When \u2013 timing, Where \u2013 environment, and Why \u2013 theory.<ref name=Raemer2011 />\n\nCurrently, there are critical limitations in the presentation of existing studies, a sparsity of research related to debriefing topics of importance, and debriefing characteristics are incompletely reported.<ref name=Raemer2011 /><ref name=Cheng2014 />  Recommendations for future debriefing studies include:\n* Duration of debriefing\n* Educator presence\n* Educator characteristics\n* Content of debriefing\n* Structure & method of debriefing\n* Timing of debriefing<ref name=Cheng2014 /> \nand/or:\n* Who: debriefer number & characteristics\n* What: the purpose of the debrief, formative vs summative assessment, individual vs team debriefing, method of debriefing, content covered, mechanics, etc.\n* When: duration, post-event vs during-event vs delayed, etc.\n* Where: in-situ, separate room, hospital, learning centre, etc.\n* Why: theoretical underpinning of the debriefing model chosen & rationale\n* PICO: population, intervention, comparator, outcome<ref name=Raemer2011 />\n\nCurrent research has found that simulation training with debriefing, when compared with no intervention, had favourable, statistically significant effects for nearly all outcomes: knowledge, process skill, time skills, product skills, behaviour process, behaviour time, and patient effects.

Some of the most known are the use of mannequins (referred to by the simulation company METI as Human Patient Simulators, or HPS for short) and standardized patients.\n\nAs seen in the chart titled \"Types of Simulation Used in Medical Education\" retrieved from the AAMC article, medical schools are leading the way when it comes to the use of standardized patients, but teaching hospitals and medical schools are close when it comes to full-scale mannequins and partial task trainers.\n\n=== Examples of Full-scale Mannequins.

One camp believes that the descriptive phase should allow an opportunity for participants to \u201cblow off steam,\u201d and release any tension which may have accumulated during the simulation scenario in order for learners to continue the debrief and subsequent reflection without pent-up emotion.<ref name=Sawyer2016 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 /> Others believe that the \u201cventing\u201d phase is not necessary and may explicitly make this statement in their debriefing models, or simply omit any reference to emotions or feelings at all.<ref name=Jaye2015 />\n\n===== ''Analysis'' =====\nThe second phase of debriefing is often referred to as \u201canalysis,\u201d<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Lederman1992 /><ref name=Phrampus2013 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Sawyer2016 /> \"description,\"<ref name=Eppich2015 /> or \"discovering\".<ref name=Zigmont2011 /> This is the phase in which the bulk of the time of debriefing is spent, with a focus on participant performance, rationales, & frames.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 />  It is meant to be a time of reflective practice on what actually occurred during the scenario, and the reasons why events unfolded as they did.<ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Sawyer2016 /> The analysis phase uncovers the decision-making process behind observed actions.<ref name=Zigmont2011 /> Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:\n*\t\u201cTell me about [insert performance/event here, i.e. teamwork] during the scenario.\u201d<ref name=Sawyer2016 />\n*\t\u201cWhat went well? Why?\u201d\n*\t\u201cWhat made things challenging?\u201d\n*\t\u201cWhy do you think that happened?\u201d\nParticipant performance is a key component during the analysis phase. However, performance can often be a difficult topic to broach with participants, as criticism or constructive feedback often incur negative feelings. There exists a framework for questioning named \u201cAdvocacy-Inquiry,\u201d or the \u201cdebriefing with good judgment\u201d approach, which aims to reduce negative experiences in medical simulation debriefing.<ref name=Rudolph2006 />\n\n'''Advocacy Inquiry.''' The use of advocacy-inquiry (AI) questioning is highly encouraged by nearly all authors of debriefing models.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 /> Advocacy-inquiry consists of pairing \u201can assertion, observation, or statement\u201d (advocacy), together with a question (inquiry), in order to elicit the mental frameworks \u2013 or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] \u2013 of both the facilitator and the participants.<ref name=Rudolph2006 />{{rp|53}} In phrasing questions this way, participants are made aware of the facilitator\u2019s own point of view in relation to the question being posed. Note that the use of AI is most encouraged when a facilitator has a judgment about something which was observed during the simulation scenario. Using AI eliminates the tone of judgment as well as the \u201cguess what I\u2019m thinking\u201d which can occur when asking questions.\n\n===== ''Application'' =====\nThe third and final phase of three-phase debriefing structures is most commonly referred to as \u201capplication,\"<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /> or \"summary\".<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Phrampus2013 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /> Participants are asked to move any newly acquired insights and/or knowledge gained throughout the simulation experience forward to their daily activities or thought processes.<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Lederman1992 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Sawyer2016 /> This includes learning which may have occurred during the previous phases in the debriefing process. Common questions posed, or statements made, by a facilitator during this phase include:\n*\t\u201cWhat are you going to do differently in your practice tomorrow?\u201d<ref name=Jaye2015 />\n*\t\u201cWhat new insights have you gained?\u201d\n*\t\u201cWhat one thing will you commit to doing differently after this?\u201d\nNote that the summary here is not always in terms of re-stating the major points which were visited throughout the simulation & debrief, but more so emphasize the greatest impact of learning. The summary may be done by either the facilitator or the participants \u2013 debriefing models differ in which they suggest. In the latter, the participants summarize what was of most value for them.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 /> A summary by the facilitator consists of re-stating key learning points which occurred throughout the debrief.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 />\n\n==== Multi-Phase Debriefing Structure ====\nWhile all debriefing models include the phases of the three-part debriefing structure, there are several with additional phases. These additions either explicitly call out specific features which may be included in the three-part debriefing model, such as reviewing learning objectives, or provide additional process recommendations, such as immediately re-practicing any skills involved in the original simulation scenario.<ref name=Sawyer2013 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /> Examples of multi-phase debriefing structures include the Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation (PEARLS) framework,<ref name=Eppich2015 /> TeamGAINS,<ref name=Kolbe2013 /> and Healthcare Simulation After-Action Review (AAR).<ref name=Sawyer2013 />\n\n=== Learning Objectives ===\nAs with any other educational initiative, [[learning objective]]s are of paramount importance in simulation and debriefing. Without learning objectives, simulations themselves and the subsequent debriefs are aimless, disorganized, and often dysfunctional. Most debriefing models explicitly make mention of stating learning objectives.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Jaye2015 /><ref name=Kolbe2013 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 />\n\nThe exploration of learning objectives ought to answer at least two questions: What competencies \u2013 knowledge, skills, and/or attitudes \u2013 are to be learned, and what specifically should be learned about them?<ref name=Fanning2007 /> The method of debriefing chosen should align with learning objectives through evaluation of three points: performance domain \u2013 cognitive, technical, or behavioural; evidence for rationale \u2013 yes/no; and estimated length of time to address \u2013 short, moderate, or long.<ref name=Eppich2015 />\n\nLearning objectives may be predetermined and included in the development of a simulation scenario, or they may be emergent as the scenario unfolds.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Fanning2007 /> It can be challenging for the novice facilitator to adapt to emergent learning objectives, as the subsequent discussion may be purely exploratory in nature with no defined outcome. Conversely, the discussion may lead to a specific area of expertise which neither the facilitator nor participants are familiar with. In such situations, the facilitator and participants must be flexible and move on to the next objective, and follow-up with the debriefing of the emergent outcome at a later time.\n\n=== Environment ===\nThe debriefing environment consists of two main features: the physical setting, as well as the psychological environment.\n\n==== Physical setting ====\nWhen choosing a space in which to debrief, one must consider whether the scenario which unfolded was a complex case. Complex cases usually involve heightened emotions, interdependent processes, and require more time spent debriefing. As such, it is recommended that these types of debriefings occur in a separate room from where the simulation scenario took place. This allows for a release of tension as participants move from one place to another and encounter new surroundings.<ref name=Fanning2007 /> Note, however, that it is important to remind participants not to begin debriefing during the walk to the new room. The momentum of the simulation leads participants to begin debriefing with one another as soon the scenario has finished.<ref name=Steinwachs1992>Steinwachs, B. (1992). How to facilitate a debriefing. ''Simulation & Gaming'', 23(2), 186-195.</ref> However, in order to establish a shared mental model with all participants, debriefing must occur in a fashion whereby all participants can hear one another and have a chance to respond. This is difficult to accomplish while walking down a hallway, or in any disorganized fashion.\n\nThe location of the debriefing is ideally somewhere comfortable and conducive to conversation and reflection, where chairs can be maneuvered and manipulated.<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Sawyer2013 /> It is recommended that, during the debriefing, the facilitator(s) and/or participants be seated in a circle.<ref name=Steinwachs1992 /> This is done so that everyone can see each other and increase group cohesion. Furthermore, the use of a circle implies equality amongst the group, and decreases any sense of hierarchy which may be present.\n\n==== Psychological environment ====\nEstablishing psychological safety and a safe learning environment is of utmost importance within both the simulation and the debriefing period.<ref name=Eppich2015 /><ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Rudolph2006 /><ref name=Rudolph2014>Rudolph, J.W., Raemer, D.B., & Simon, R. (2014). Establishing a Safe Container for Learning in Simulation: The Role of Presimulation Briefing. ''Simulation in Healthcare'', 9, 339-349.</ref><ref name=Sawyer2016 /><ref name=Zigmont2011 /> As simulation participants often find the experience stressful and intimidating, worried about judgment from their peers and facilitator(s), establishing safety must be done from the outset of the simulation event.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF03022056|pmid = 16251560|title = Barriers to use of simulation-based education|journal = Canadian Journal of Anesthesia/Journal Canadien d'Anesth\u00e9sie|volume = 52|issue = 9|pages = 944\u2013950|year = 2005|last1 = Savoldelli|first1 = Georges L.|last2 = Naik|first2 = Viren N.|last3 = Hamstra|first3 = Stanley J.|last4 = Morgan|first4 = Pamela J.}}</ref> Note that psychological safety does not necessarily equate to comfort, but rather that participants \u201cfeel safe enough to embrace being uncomfortable\u2026without the burden of feeling that they will be shamed, humiliated, or belittled\u201d.<ref name=Rudolph2014 />{{rp|340}}\n\nIt is recommended that establishing safety begin in the pre-brief phase<ref name=Rudolph2014 /> by alerting participants to the \u201cbasic assumption.\u201d The basic assumption, derived from the Centre for Medical Simulation at Harvard University (n.d.), is an agreed upon, predetermined mental model whereby everyone involved in the simulation & debrief believe that all participants are intelligent, well-trained, want to do their best, and are participating to learn and promote development.<ref name=Rudolph2008>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2008.00248.x|pmid = 18945231|title = Debriefing as Formative Assessment: Closing Performance Gaps in Medical Education|journal = Academic Emergency Medicine|volume = 15|issue = 11|pages = 1010\u20131016|year = 2008|last1 = Rudolph|first1 = Jenny W.|last2 = Simon|first2 = Robert|last3 = Raemer|first3 = Daniel B.|last4 = Eppich|first4 = Walter J.}}</ref><ref name=Sawyer2016 /> Additionally, Rudolph et al. (2014) have identified four principles to guide the formulation of a psychologically safe environment:\n#\tCommunicate clear expectations\n#\tEstablish a \u201cfiction contract\u201d\n#\tAttend to logistic details\n#\tDeclare & enact a commitment to respecting learners & concern for their psychological safety<ref name=Rudolph2014 />\n\nIncluded in these principles is the notion of [[confidentiality]]. Explicitly reminding participants that their individual performance and debriefing reflections are not meant to be shared outside of the simulation event can help foster participation. Confidentiality builds trust by increasing transparency and allowing participants to practice without fear.<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=Rudolph2014 />\n\n===Evidence & Further Study===\nThere exists a paucity of quantitative data regarding the effectiveness of debriefing in medical simulation,<ref name=Fanning2007 /><ref name=\"Cheng2014\"/><ref name=Raemer2011>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e31822724d0| pmid=21817862| title=Research Regarding Debriefing as Part of the Learning Process| journal=Simulation in Healthcare: The Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare| volume=6| pages=S52\u2013S57| year=2011| last1=Raemer| first1=Daniel| last2=Anderson| first2=Mindi| last3=Cheng| first3=Adam| last4=Fanning| first4=Ruth| last5=Nadkarni| first5=Vinay| last6=Savoldelli| first6=Georges}}</ref> despite Lederman\u2019s 1992 seminal Model for the Systematic Assessment of Debriefing.<ref name=Lederman1992 /> Nearly every article reviewed had a cry for objective studies regarding the effectiveness of debriefing, whether it be comparing: the myriad options of conversational structures,<ref name=Sawyer2016 /> debriefing models,<ref name=Kolbe2013 />  or the comprehensive 5 W\u2019s of Who \u2013 debriefer, What \u2013 content & methods, When \u2013 timing, Where \u2013 environment, and Why \u2013 theory.<ref name=Raemer2011 />\n\nCurrently, there are critical limitations in the presentation of existing studies, a sparsity of research related to debriefing topics of importance, and debriefing characteristics are incompletely reported.<ref name=Raemer2011 /><ref name=Cheng2014 />  Recommendations for future debriefing studies include:\n* Duration of debriefing\n* Educator presence\n* Educator characteristics\n* Content of debriefing\n* Structure & method of debriefing\n* Timing of debriefing<ref name=Cheng2014 /> \nand/or:\n* Who: debriefer number & characteristics\n* What: the purpose of the debrief, formative vs summative assessment, individual vs team debriefing, method of debriefing, content covered, mechanics, etc.\n* When: duration, post-event vs during-event vs delayed, etc.\n* Where: in-situ, separate room, hospital, learning centre, etc.\n* Why: theoretical underpinning of the debriefing model chosen & rationale\n* PICO: population, intervention, comparator, outcome<ref name=Raemer2011 />\n\nCurrent research has found that simulation training with debriefing, when compared with no intervention, had favourable, statistically significant effects for nearly all outcomes: knowledge, process skill, time skills, product skills, behaviour process, behaviour time, and patient effects. When compared with other forms of instruction, simulation and debriefing showed small favourable effects for knowledge, time & process outcomes, and moderate effects for satisfaction.<ref name=Cheng2014 />\n\n== Types of Simulations used in Medical Schools and Teaching Hospitals ==\n\nThere many different types of simulations that are used for training purposes. Some of the most known are the use of mannequins (referred to by the simulation company METI as Human Patient Simulators, or HPS for short) and standardized patients.\n\nAs seen in the chart titled \"Types of Simulation Used in Medical Education\" retrieved from the AAMC article, medical schools are leading the way when it comes to the use of standardized patients, but teaching hospitals and medical schools are close when it comes to full-scale mannequins and partial task trainers.\n\n=== Examples of Full-scale Mannequins.

{"title_page": "Thin-film bulk acoustic resonator", "text_new": "A '''thin-film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR or TFBAR)''' is a device consisting of a [[piezoelectric]] material manufactured by [[thin film]] methods sandwiched between two [[electrode]]s and acoustically isolated from the surrounding medium. FBAR devices using piezoelectric films with thicknesses ranging from several micrometres down to tenth of micrometres resonate in the frequency range of roughly 100&nbsp;MHz to 10&nbsp;GHz. [[aluminium nitride]] and [[zinc oxide]] are two common piezoelectric materials used in FBARs for applications. In theory any material like [[lead zirconate titanate]] or [[barium titanate]] from the [[list of piezoelectric materials]] could be used as an active material in an FBAR resonator. However as two compound material aluminium nitride (AlN) has become the most widely used in commercial volume manufacturing of FBAR resonator based products.\n\nDuring early experimentation phase in 1967 cadmium sulfide was evaporated on a resonant piece of bulk quartz crystal which served as a transducer providing a quality factor of 5000 at the resonance frequency, which was an enabler for tightening requirements of frequency control in telecommunication applications and increasing accuracy in sensoring <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sliker  |first1=T.R. |last2=Roberts |first2=D.A |date=1967 |title=A thin-film CdS-quartz composite resonator |url= |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=2350\u20132358 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> .\n\n== Structures ==\nCurrently there are two known structures of thin-film bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators: free-standing <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ruby  |first1=R. |last2=Merchant |first2=P. |date=1994 |title=Micromachined thin film bulk acoustic resonators |url= |journal=IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium |pages=135\u2013138 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> and solidly mounted (SMR) resonators <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lakin  |first1=K.M. |last2=McCarron |first2=K.T.|date=1995 |title=Solidly Mounted Resonators and Filters |url= |journal=IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium |pages=905\u2013908 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> . In a free-standing resonator structure air is used to free the resonator from the substrate/surrounding. Manufacturing of a free-standing resonator structure uses some typical [[MEMS]] manufacturing steps. In an SMR structure an acoustic mirror providing an acoustic isolation is constructed between the resonator and the surrounding like the substrate. The acoustic mirror typically consists of odd total number of materials with alternating a high and low acoustic impedance. The thickness of mirror materials must also be optimised for maximum acoustic reflectivity. \n\nBecause realising FBAR structures needs many precise steps simulation is actively used during the design phase to predict purity of resonance frequency and other performance. At early phase of the development basic FEM modeling techniques used for crystals were also applied in FBARs <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Makkonen  |first1=T. |last2=Holappa |first2=A. |last3=Salomaa |first3=M.M. |date=1988 |title=Improvements in 2D FEM modeling software for crystal resonators |url= |journal=Proceedings of IEEE Ultrasonic Symposium |pages=935\u2013838 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref>.  \n\n== Applications ==\nIn many applications temperature behavior, stability, strength and purity of the wanted resonance frequency are forming the base for the performance of the applications based of FBAR resonators. Material choices and design of resonator structures are contributing to the resonator and application final performance. Mechanical and reliability are highly determined by packaging of the resonators in the final applications. \n\nA common application of FBARs is radio frequency (RF) filters <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lakin  |first1=K.M. |last2=Wang |first2=J.S |date=1980 |title=UHF composite bulk wave resonators |url= |journal=Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings |pages=834\u2013837 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> for use in [[cell phone]]s and other wireless applications like positioning ([[GPS]], [[Glonass]], [[BeiDou]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] etc.) systems and modules. Such filters are made from a network of resonators (either in half-ladder, full-ladder, lattice or stacked topologies) and are designed to remove unwanted frequencies from being transmitted in such devices, while allowing other specific frequencies to be received and transmitted. FBAR filters can also be found in [[duplexer]]s. FBAR filters are complementing [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) filters in areas where increased power handling capability, and ESD tolerance is needed. Frequencies more than 1.5 GHz are well suited for FBAR devices. Because FBARs can be manufactured on a silicon substrate they are well suited in high volume manufacturing supported by all development of [[semiconductor device fabrication]] methods.\n\nFBARs can be used by microwave oscillators.\n\nFBARs can be used in sensor applications. For instance, when a FBAR device is put under mechanical pressure its resonance frequency will shift. A tactile sensor array may also consist of FBAR devices.\n\nFBARs can also be integrated with power amplifiers (PA) or low noise amplifiers (LNA) to form either a module solution or a monolithic integrated solution on the same substrate with the related electronic circuitry. Typical module solutions are a power amplifier-[[duplexer]] module (PAD), or a low noise amplifier-filter module where FBAR(s) and the related circuitry are packaged in the same package possibly on a separate module substrate. \n\nFBARs can also be integrated in complex communication like SimpleLink modules for avoiding area/space requirements of an external, packaged crystal. Therefore FBAR technology has increasing role in electronics [[miniaturisation]].\n\n== Historical and Industrial Landscape ==\nThe use of piezoelectric materials for different applications begins in the early 1960\u2019s at Bell Telephone Laboratories/[[Bell Labs]], where piezoelectric crystals were developed and used as resonators in applications like oscillators with frequencies up to 100 MHz. Thinning was applied for increasing the resonance frequency of the crystals. However there were limitations of the thinning of crystals and new methods of thin film manufacturing were applied in the early 1970's for increasing accuracy of resonance frequency and targeting increasing manufacturing volumes.\n\nTFR Technologies Inc founded in 1989 was one of the pioneering company in the field of FBAR resonators and filters mostly for space and military applications.

FBAR devices using piezoelectric films with thicknesses ranging from several micrometres down to tenth of micrometres resonate in the frequency range of roughly 100&nbsp;MHz to 10&nbsp;GHz. [[aluminium nitride]] and [[zinc oxide]] are two common piezoelectric materials used in FBARs for applications. In theory any material like [[lead zirconate titanate]] or [[barium titanate]] from the [[list of piezoelectric materials]] could be used as an active material in an FBAR resonator. However as two compound material aluminium nitride (AlN) has become the most widely used in commercial volume manufacturing of FBAR resonator based products.\n\nDuring early experimentation phase in 1967 cadmium sulfide was evaporated on a resonant piece of bulk quartz crystal which served as a transducer providing a quality factor of 5000 at the resonance frequency, which was an enabler for tightening requirements of frequency control in telecommunication applications and increasing accuracy in sensoring <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sliker  |first1=T.R. |last2=Roberts |first2=D.A |date=1967 |title=A thin-film CdS-quartz composite resonator |url= |journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=2350\u20132358 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> .\n\n== Structures ==\nCurrently there are two known structures of thin-film bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators: free-standing <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ruby  |first1=R. |last2=Merchant |first2=P. |date=1994 |title=Micromachined thin film bulk acoustic resonators |url= |journal=IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium |pages=135\u2013138 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> and solidly mounted (SMR) resonators <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lakin  |first1=K.M. |last2=McCarron |first2=K.T.|date=1995 |title=Solidly Mounted Resonators and Filters |url= |journal=IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium |pages=905\u2013908 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> . In a free-standing resonator structure air is used to free the resonator from the substrate/surrounding. Manufacturing of a free-standing resonator structure uses some typical [[MEMS]] manufacturing steps. In an SMR structure an acoustic mirror providing an acoustic isolation is constructed between the resonator and the surrounding like the substrate. The acoustic mirror typically consists of odd total number of materials with alternating a high and low acoustic impedance. The thickness of mirror materials must also be optimised for maximum acoustic reflectivity. \n\nBecause realising FBAR structures needs many precise steps simulation is actively used during the design phase to predict purity of resonance frequency and other performance. At early phase of the development basic FEM modeling techniques used for crystals were also applied in FBARs <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Makkonen  |first1=T. |last2=Holappa |first2=A. |last3=Salomaa |first3=M.M. |date=1988 |title=Improvements in 2D FEM modeling software for crystal resonators |url= |journal=Proceedings of IEEE Ultrasonic Symposium |pages=935\u2013838 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref>.  \n\n== Applications ==\nIn many applications temperature behavior, stability, strength and purity of the wanted resonance frequency are forming the base for the performance of the applications based of FBAR resonators. Material choices and design of resonator structures are contributing to the resonator and application final performance. Mechanical and reliability are highly determined by packaging of the resonators in the final applications. \n\nA common application of FBARs is radio frequency (RF) filters <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lakin  |first1=K.M. |last2=Wang |first2=J.S |date=1980 |title=UHF composite bulk wave resonators |url= |journal=Ultrasonics Symposium Proceedings |pages=834\u2013837 |doi= |access-date=}}</ref> for use in [[cell phone]]s and other wireless applications like positioning ([[GPS]], [[Glonass]], [[BeiDou]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)]] etc.) systems and modules.

In the Miesian tradition were the Pineham Sewage Works, which Derek Walker regarded as his finest achievement, and the Shopping Building designed by Stuart Mosscrop and Christopher Woodward. The contextual tradition that ran alongside it is exemplified by the Corporation's infill scheme at Cofferidge Close, Stony Stratford, designed by [[Wayland Tunley]], which inserts into a historic stretch of High Street a modern retail facility, offices and car park.\n\n;\"City in the forest\"\n{{Commons|Milton Keynes}}\nThe original Development Corporation design concept aimed for a 'forest city' and its foresters planted millions of trees from its own nursery in Newlands in the following years.{{sfn|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1968}} As of 2006, the urban area had 20 million trees. Following the winding up of the Development Corporation, the lavish landscapes of the Grid Roads and of the major parks were transferred to the [[Milton Keynes Parks Trust]], an independent non-for-profit charity which is separate from the municipal authority and which was thus intended to resist pressures to build on the parks over time.

It operates as an independent, nonprofit [[academic organization]] that offers [[field research]] courses (field schools) at various sites around the world.\n\nThe IFR signed an affiliation agreement with [[Connecticut College]] in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Field Schools - Connecticut College, Department of Anthropology|url=http://www.conncoll.edu/academics/majors-departments-programs/departments/anthropology/field-schools/|publisher=Connecticut College}}</ref>  Through this agreement, students receive 8 semester credit units (equivalent to 12 quarter units) for attending any of the field schools offered by the IFR.

The first report alleged that Enmanuel Gomez Choque (a Peruvian archaeologist and the executive director of the Andahuaylas Museum) had sexually harassed students working under his supervision at an archaeological field school led by him and his wife, Danielle Kurin (an anthropological [[bioarchaeologist]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://michael-balter.blogspot.com/2020/02/at-uc-santa-barbara-and-in-peru.html|title=Balter's Blog: At UC Santa Barbara and in Peru, an archaeological couple accused of engaging in sexual misconduct and retaliation against victims |last=Balter|first=Michael|date=2020-02-28|website=Balter's Blog|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. The report found that during the 2015 field season, Gomez had: engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior with a female student at a dance club, including forcibly kissing her; that he had made inappropriate sexual jokes in front of the students; and that he had engaged in sexually hostile behavior against a female student during a trip to a pilgrimage site. The allegations also included charges that Gomez had tried to get the female students to adopt \"sexy poses\" so that he could photograph them. It is also alleged that Kurin, retaliated against the students who had filed Title IX complaints against Gomez. \n\nOn June 14, 2016, UCSB's Title IX office found, based on the standard of a preponderance of the evidence, that Gomez had sexually harassed students working with the couple at the field school they ran in the Andahuaylas region. On the same day, Kurin was found guilty, under the same burden of proof, of retaliating against students who had filed Title IX complaints against Gomez. She had been placed on administrative leave the previous April, and remained on leave for a total of three years, according to sources inside and outside the UCSB anthropology department.\n\nThe summer 2015 field school which was the subject of the 2016 Title IX investigation, was offered by UCSB. In 2016 Kurin requested that the field school would be offered through IFR. The request was reviewed by the IFR\u2019s executive director, Ran Boytner and the academic board and approved. The course was scheduled to run from Jun 25-Jul 23, 2016 with Dr. Danielle S. Kurin, Mr. Enmanuel Gomez Choque listed as the only instructors. The school was put on the IFR\u2019s website and began accepting students<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810134241/https://ifrglobal.org/programs/south-america/peru-sondor-2016|title=Peru - Sondor - Institute for Field Research Field Schools|date=2016-08-10|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. At that time UCLA extension was the school of record providing academic credit for IFR field schools. Ten days before the 2016 field school was supposed to start, UCLA extension cancelled the field school. \n\nThe course was once again offered in 2017 and 2018. According to Willeke Wendrich, \"In preparation of IFR's 2017 field school season we asked UCLA and UCSB to give some information on what the reason of the 2016 cancellation was to determine whether IFR would offer the Peru field school. We only received information that this was an 'administrative leave'. We decided after a long discussion to offer the field school (without UCLA extension credit, which was withheld by UCLA for reasons they would not share). During that year two IFR academics visited the site to check on the quality of the living circumstances and the education, as we do with all our field schools from time to time. The reports were good. In 2018 the field school was, therefore, offered again.\"\n\nIt is unclear if IFR officials knew of the 2016 Title IX report or the reasons for why Kurin was placed on administrative leave. Balter\u2019s reporting alleges that the IFR \u201calmost certainly did know about the 2016 Title IX allegations\u201d. Kevin Vaughn, an Andean archaeologist and dean at the [[University of California, Riverside]], was tipped off about the accusations at the time (he was then a dean at UCLA Extension, the agency that abruptly cancelled Kurin\u2019s 2016 field school). In 2018, Kurin was listed as an instructor at two of the IFR\u2019s Peru field schools (Sondor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020071648/http://ifrglobal.org/program/peru-wari/|title=Peru: Wari - Institute for Field Research|date=2018-10-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> and Wari<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020071648/http://ifrglobal.org/program/peru-wari/|title=Peru: Wari - Institute for Field Research|date=2018-10-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>).\n\nThe 2018 field school at Wari, Peru: Multiple incidents of sexual harassment and assault by Gomez<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020071648/http://ifrglobal.org/program/peru-wari/|title=Peru: Wari - Institute for Field Research|date=2018-10-20|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>. The some details of the report and the complaints are listed below: <blockquote>'''Student No. 1''': \"Hi Michael, I've thought a lot about reaching out after I saw your article about Danielle Kurin and Manuel Gomez. I was on their project in Andahuaylas in 2011 and Manuel forcibly kissed me in a club on that trip. There were also several witnesses, whose names I've blurred [on a contemporaneous messenger thread she attached] since I don't know how they feel about being involved.\"\n\n'''Student No. 2''': This student describes going to a club with Gomez and a group of students during the field school in 2017 (the year after the Title IX findings.) \"We were dancing in a group when Enmanuel came over and started dancing with me, pretty close up onto me. I thought he was showing me how to dance a particular dance, but he was way too close and touchy...I felt uncomfortable and asked another woman from the program if I could dance with her because he kept pushing himself at me....The rest of the program I felt very uncomfortable being alone with Enmanuel and tried to avoid being alone with him as much as possible.\"\n\nThese are just some examples of the kind of behavior which I have tracked between 2011 and 2018, thanks to witnesses who nevertheless fear retaliation by Kurin and want to keep their identities as hidden as possible. But during the 2018 field school, now two years after the Title IX findings, things seem to have hit a new level of misconduct, and some students finally took a stand.\n\n'''Taylor Johnston''' is a student at Mount Royal University in Calgary, Alberta. She told me that early in the 2018 field school, which began in June of that year, she had a lot of contact with Gomez. \"Manuel was always around me and trying to get me alone,\" she recalls. At first she thought it was because she speaks Spanish well, and Gomez speaks English very poorly. About 10 days into the field season, Johnston says, Gomez took a group of students to an archaeological site called Tukri. \"None of us brought alcohol,\" Johnston says, but \"Manuel was pushing that we needed to go into town and buy beer. He was pushing all of us to drink.\" Johnston says that Gomez told them it was disrespectful to refuse, just as he did during the 2015 field season.\n\nJohnston says that they were accompanied by another academic from a university in Peru, and that both of them behaved towards her in ways that were \"totally inappropriate,\" including \"grabbing my ass.\" After they returned to Andahuaylas, Johnston says, Gomez would drunkenly try to get into the house where the students were staying, banging on the door and asking for her early in the morning. After that she began to distance herself from Gomez, she says.\n\nJohnston also told me about a day trip the group took to some nearly ponds, where the students went bathing despite the cold of the Peruvian winter (which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere.) In an incident reminiscent of one described by the 2015 students, Johnston says she was wearing a sweater over her bathing suit to keep warm. \"Take off your sweater, I want to see your body in your bathing suit,\" Johnston recalls Gomez saying.\n\nAfter Johnston began to keep her distance from Gomez, she and other witnesses say, Gomez began to take an interest in another young researcher I will call '''Student No. 3'''. On the night of July 13/14, shortly before the end of the field season, the students and Gomez went out to a club (Kurin normally did not join these outings.) According to several witnesses, Gomez began plying the students with drinks, especially Student No. 3. \"He was bringing us shots every twenty minutes,\" Johnston says. \"He kept pushing them on [Student No. 3.] He was with her all night at the club, dancing with her.\" Suddenly, around 1:30 am, the students realized that Gomez and Student No. 3 were no longer there. They began a frantic search for her, calling Gomez's cell phone and leaving messages but getting no answer.\n\nAt 5:30 am, Gomez returned to the field house with Student No. 3 in a taxi.</blockquote><br />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 2011]]\n[[Category:Archaeological organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Notability|Organizations|date=January 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox non-profit\n| name            = Institute for Field Research (IFR)\n| caption         = Institute for Field Research Field Schools Logo\n| type            = Educational [[Public charity#United States|Operating public charity]]\n| founded_date    = 2011\n| location        = 2999 Overland Ave. #103, Los Angeles CA. 90064\n| key_people      = '''Chair of the Board''' <br/>[http://linear-city.com/ Yuval Bar Zemer], <br/> '''Chair of the Academic Board:'' <br/>[http://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/anthony-graesch/ Anthony Graesch],<br/>'''Other Board Members:''' <br/> [http://www.ioa.ucla.edu/people/willeke-z-wendrich/ Willeke Wendrich],<br/>[https://anthropology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/vaughn/index.html Kevin Vaughn], <br/>[http://www.cast.uark.edu/home/about/staff-web-pages/fred-limp.html Fred Limp], <br/>[http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1008060&CFID=778747&CFTOKEN=65405816 Lynn Swartz Dodd], <br/>[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/anthro/people/faculty/ci.delenjason_ci.detail Jason de Leon], <br/>[http://www.emilylindsey.org/ Emily Lindsey], <br/>[http://research.ucc.ie/profiles/A009/barraod/ Barra O'Donnabhain], <br/>[Mallika Sankaran], <br/>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/people/staff/williams Tim Williams], <br/>[http://nes.berkeley.edu/Web_Porter/Welcome.html Benjamin Porter], <br/>[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~anthro/flad/research.htm Rowan Flad], <br/>[http://www.johngivenlaw.com/index.html John Given], <br/>[https://anthropology.washington.edu/people/julie-k-stein Julie K.

It was released on January 12, 1999 through [[Jive Records]]. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with her manager at the time, [[Lou Pearlman]], to join female pop group [[Innosense]], her mother, [[Lynne Spears]], asked a family friend and entertainment lawyer, [[Larry Rudolph]], for his opinion. Rudolph took interest and decided to pitch her to record labels. Rudolph submitted a tape of Britney Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] [[karaoke]] song, along with a demo tape of an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]. Jive Records was interested and appointed the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.\n\nSpears traveled to Sweden to work with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]], and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others. Martin presented a track titled \"Hit Me Baby (One More Time)\" to Spears and her management, which had been rejected by the girl group [[TLC (band)|TLC]]. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. Her debut album was completed in June 1998, and the song was released as \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" as Spears' debut single in October. The single became a global success, reaching number one in every country it charted in, became the best-selling song of 1999 in the UK, and has since become one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all-time]], selling over 10 million copies.\n\nUpon release, the album received mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], with many labeling it silly and premature. ''...Baby One More Time'' was a large commercial success, debuting atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and [[Canadian Albums Chart]], and reached the top 5 in several countries. It received worldwide certifications, including a [[RIAA certification|14\u00d7 platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of over 14 million copies in the US, of which [[Nielsen SoundScan]] recognizes 10.6 million copies sold.<ref name=billboard2015/> ''...Baby One More Time'' is Spears' most successful album with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide,<ref name=\"bomtsales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/content/curious-case-britney-spears-5-reasons-why-princess-pop-rules-0 |title=The Curious Case Of Britney Spears: 5 Reasons Why The Princess of Pop Rules |website=VIBE |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all-time]].\n\nFour additional singles were released from the album and Spears heavily promoted it through interviews and performances on national television. Furthermore, Spears embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in 1999, and later continued on a second leg title the [[(You Drive Me) Crazy Tour]]. ''...Baby One More Time'' earned Spears [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"...Baby One More Time\" at the [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2000.\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFC7E9|width=30%|align=left|quote=\"I had been in the studio for about six months listening and recording material, but I hadn't really heard a hit yet.

It was released on January 12, 1999 through [[Jive Records]]. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with her manager at the time, [[Lou Pearlman]], to join female pop group [[Innosense]], her mother, [[Lynne Spears]], asked a family friend and entertainment lawyer, [[Larry Rudolph]], for his opinion. Rudolph took interest and decided to pitch her to record labels. Rudolph submitted a tape of Britney Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] [[karaoke]] song, along with a demo tape of an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]. Jive Records was interested and appointed the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.\n\nSpears traveled to Sweden to work with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]], and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others. Martin presented a track titled \"Hit Me Baby (One More Time)\" to Spears and her management, which had been rejected by the girl group [[TLC (band)|TLC]]. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. Her debut album was completed in June 1998, and the song was released as \"[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]\" as Spears' debut single in October. The single became a global success, reaching number one in every country it charted in, became the best-selling song of 1999 in the UK, and has since become one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all-time]], selling over 10 million copies.\n\nUpon release, the album received mixed reviews from [[music journalism|music critics]], with many labeling it silly and premature. ''...Baby One More Time'' was a large commercial success, debuting atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and [[Canadian Albums Chart]], and reached the top 5 in several countries. It received worldwide certifications, including a [[RIAA certification|14\u00d7 platinum certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of over 14 million copies in the US, of which [[Nielsen SoundScan]] recognizes 10.6 million copies sold.<ref name=billboard2015/> ''...Baby One More Time'' is Spears' most successful album with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide,<ref name=\"bomtsales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/content/curious-case-britney-spears-5-reasons-why-princess-pop-rules-0 |title=The Curious Case Of Britney Spears: 5 Reasons Why The Princess of Pop Rules |website=VIBE |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-03-05}}</ref> making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all-time]].\n\nFour additional singles were released from the album and Spears heavily promoted it through interviews and performances on national television. Furthermore, Spears embarked on her first headlining concert tour, entitled the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in 1999, and later continued on a second leg title the [[(You Drive Me) Crazy Tour]]. ''...Baby One More Time'' earned Spears [[Grammy Award]] nominations for [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for \"...Baby One More Time\" at the [[42nd Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2000.\n\n==Background and development==\n{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFC7E9|width=30%|align=left|quote=\"I had been in the studio for about six months listening and recording material, but I hadn't really heard a hit yet.

Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day.
