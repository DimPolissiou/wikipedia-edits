buys more drugs from her friend and drug dealer Fezco. Jules is a new girl in town taking summer school. Her classmate Kat invites her to a house party hosted by a popular college football player, Christopher McKay. Jules initially declines, opting instead to meet up with an older man from a hookup app. Rue gets home late one night and her mother forces her to take a drug test. In order to pass it, Rue acquires clean urine by asking her childhood friend Lexi for some of hers. Lexi's sister Cassie is dating McKay, who discusses Cassie's sexual past with his friend Nate. Jules arrives at the motel where the older man told her to meet him. She lies about her age and the two have sex, after which she makes her way to the party.

After a successful incursion as far as [[Eshowe]] (then also known as '''Fort Ekowe''' or '''kwaMondi'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=THD18790714.2.19|title=Life in Ekowe Fort|work=natlib.govt.nz|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.battlefieldsroute.co.za/place/the-siege-of-fort-kwamondi The Siege of Fort KwaMondi],  Battlefields Route</ref>), Colonel [[Charles Pearson (soldier)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged there for two months by the Zulus.\n\n==Prelude: Inyezane==\n\nNo.1 Column of the British invasion force, under Colonel Charles Pearson, had been ordered to establish an advanced base at Eshowe before continuing the advance upon [[Ulundi]]. The force crossed the [[Tugela River]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]] into [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] on 12 January 1879. The advance was smooth and steady until 22 January, when a Zulu force attempted to bar their way. The British were camped about 4 miles south of the [[Inyezane River]], which they had crossed the previous day, beneath a steep ridge with three spurs leading down towards the river, and surrounded by scrub. A prominent knoll sat about halfway, and a small [[kraal]] near the left of the crest.\n\nShortly after 08:00 a small number of Zulus appeared near the knoll on the ridge, and a company of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] (NNC), under Lieutenant Hart, were sent up the spur after them. While this company gave chase a mass of Zulus appeared over the crest of the ridge and began pouring downwards. These men were the left \"horn\" of a 6,000 strong force, dispatched at the same time as the army that engaged the British at Isandlwana, who were preparing just over the crest, to attack the British camp. This left horn had been prompted into a premature attack by the advance of Lieutenant Hart's company, and in the face of this advance the NNC fled, leaving their European officers and NCOs to make a fruitless stand before being swept aside. As soon as Hart and his men began firing, the camp prepared for defence, forming a hasty firing line. A naval company and two companies of [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] with a [[Gatling gun]] and 7-pounders moved up to the knoll, opening up across the advancing Zulu column. Thus, when the Zulus emerged from scrub and began their assault on the camp, they were taking heavy fire on both their flank and front of their force. The Zulus wavered and then withdrew the way they had come. \n\nWhile the left horn was being repulsed, the rest of the Zulu [[impi]] appeared over the crest. The kraal was taken, and switching their guns to focus on it, the force previously attacking the left horn's flank advanced up the slope and captured the kraal. This position allowed the British to move the Gatling gun onto the crest where its rapid fire soon drove the Zulus off the centre and left end of the ridge, as the British mounted troops came up the right-hand spur to complete the action. The successful counter-attack resulted in 10 British killed and 16 wounded. The Zulu impi withdrew with 350 killed.\n\n==Arrival at Eshowe==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Crossingtugela.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Troops crossing the Tugela River.]] -->\nPearson continued his march unhindered and the following day reached the mission fort near Eshowe at {{coord|28|54|28.7|S|31|27|41|E|type:landmark|name=Fort Nongqwayi}}, 2,000 feet above sea level. Eshowe consisted of a deserted church, school and the house of a [[Norway|Norwegian]] missionary. Low hills surrounded it about a quarter of a mile away to the north, east and west, but to the south the Indian Ocean could be seen. Pearson sent a group of empty wagons, with escorts, to collect fresh supplies from the Lower Drift while the rest of his force began entrenching themselves. The next day, 24 January, bore a disturbing message for Pearson: Col. [[Anthony Durnford]]'s No. 2 column had been wiped out in the Middle Drift, leaving the Lower Drift behind Eshowe in grave danger. If the Zulus took the lower drift, Eshowe would be cut off and there would be nothing between the Zulu Army and Natal.\n\nTwo days later, [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] contacted Pearson. Without giving any details of the disaster at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]] he informed him that all previous orders were cancelled, and that he was to take such as action as he thought fit to preserve his column, including withdrawal from Eshowe if necessary. If he withdrew, he was to hold the bridgehead at the Lower Drift, but he might be attacked by the whole Zulu Army. Pearson had no precise information on the whereabouts of the enemy, and although his defences around the mission would soon be complete, it was not an ideal position to defend. His force was good for ammunition, but other supplies were insufficient and the general consensus of his subordinates was to pull back to the Lower Drift. The decision to stay was settled on when news arrived of the return of the supply wagons, with five further companies as reinforcement from the Lower Drift.\n\n==Eshowe besieged==\n\nThe fort enclosing the mission was roughly rectangular, 200 yards long and 50 yards wide, with loopholed walls 6 feet high, and was surrounded by a broad ditch in which sharpened sticks were embedded. A second line of defence, should the outer rampart fall, was formed by [[laager]]ing the wagons inside the walls. A horse and cattle kraal was constructed, as was an [[abattis]], and a field of fire was cleared all round out to 800 yards. The garrison numbered 1,300 soldiers and sailors, plus 400 wagoners.\n\nThe appearance of large bodies of Zulu on the surrounding hills on 2 February, although they retreated under shelling from the 7-pounders, compelled Pearson to request reinforcements. A week later, he learned for the first time the full extent of the centre column's defeat at Isandlwana and was told that no reinforcements could be made. Pearson was on his own, but could still withdraw. Pearson considered withdrawing part of his garrison, if Chelmsford agreed, but receiving no response and no further runners, it became clear that Eshowe was now completely cut off. The garrison would run out of provisions by the beginning of April.<ref>Thompson, Paul Singer. ''Black soldiers of the queen: the Natal native contingent in the Anglo-Zulu War'', University of Alabama Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8173-5368-2}}, p.47, p. 92.</ref>\n\nFebruary passed with no Zulu attack, save for sniping attacks and skirmishes between patrols. The beginning of March led Pearson to attack a kraal 7 miles away, to keep the soldiers from idling. The next day a [[heliostat]] was spotted signalling from [[Fort Tenedos]] and a makeshift apparatus allowed Eshowe to reply. The garrison learnt that a relief force would depart the Lower Drift on 13 March and that they were to advance to the Inyezane to meet it. This was cheering news for the garrison, with rations running low and sickness having killed 20 men. A few days later another message advised a delay in the arrival of the relief column until 1 April.\n\n==The Relief Column==\n{{main|Battle of Gingindlovu}}\n\n[[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] led this column, consisting of 3,390 Europeans and 2,280 Africans to relieve the forces at [[Eshowe]]. The force had a range of artillery, including two 9-pounders, four 24-pounder rocket tubes and two [[Gatling gun]]s. The progress was slow, as in addition to taking a roundabout route to avoid ambush, the rivers they had to traverse were swollen by heavy rains. By the evening of 1 April, Pearson's observers at Eshowe could see the relief column laagering on the south bank of the Inyezane. The laager was sited on a 300-foot ridge running roughly west\u2013east. West of the ridge, the ground dipped, only to rise again to the 470-foot [[Umisi Hill]]. The ground sloped away in all directions, allowing a good field of fire. A trench surrounded a waist high wall of earth, which itself encompassed 120 wagons formed a square with sides of 130 yards in length. Here the relief column fought the [[Battle of Gingindlovu]], a British victory, before continuing on to Eshowe.\n\n==Eshowe relieved==\n\nOn 3 April, the relief column entered Eshowe, led by the pipers of the [[91st Highlanders]]. The two-month siege had been lifted. Chelmsford concluded that Eshowe did not need to be retained, and the laboriously constructed defences were demolished. Bivouacking on the first night after their departure from it on 6 April, Pearson's men could see that the Zulus had set Eshowe alight.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Military history of South Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* {{cite book|last=Barthorp|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Barthorp|title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi|year=2002|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brookes|first1=Edgar H|authorlink=|last2=Webb |first2=Colin de B. |title=A History of Natal|publisher=[[University of Natal Press]]|year=1965|location=[[Brooklyn]]|isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances E.|first2=Edward |last2=Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and its Origin|location=London|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* {{cite news|last=David|first=Saul|author-link=Saul David|title=The Forgotten Battles of the Zulu War|newspaper=[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]|volume=10|issue=2|pages=26&ndash;33|date=February 2009|url = }}\n* {{cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

It stars [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Toby Kebbell]], [[Tatiana Maslany]], [[Scoot McNairy]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Sebastian Stan]], and follows a former undercover police officer who takes revenge against members of a gang, years after her case was blown. \n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 31, 2018 and was released in the United States on December 25, 2018, by [[Annapurna Pictures]]. At the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], Kidman was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nLAPD detective Erin Bell arrives on the scene of a John Doe murder and informs the responding officers that she knows the identity of the murderer. \n\nAt the police station, Erin receives a $100 bill stained from a [[dye pack]] in an unmarked envelope. Using a contact at the [[FBI]], she confirms that the bill is from a bank robbery committed by a California gang sixteen years prior that she and her former partner, FBI agent Chris, were embedded in as undercover officers. She tells her superiors that she believes the bill to be proof that the gang's leader, Silas, is once again active.\n\nErin works her way through the remaining members of the gang in order to find Silas. She begins with Toby, who was in prison but is now gravely ill and living with his mother on [[compassionate release]]. She gives him a [[handjob]] in exchange for the location of Arturo, a member of the gang atoning for his past crimes by offering [[pro bono]] legal services to immigrants. Arturo provides Erin with the location of Dennis DiFranco, a lawyer who launders the multi-million dollar haul from the original robbery and from whom Erin deduces that Silas is active again because the money from that heist is almost gone. After threatening him, DiFranco gives Erin the location of the next money drop, which is performed by Silas' girlfriend Petra, who has developed a severe drug addiction. Erin tracks Petra, eventually intervening in a bank robbery committed by Silas' new gang. She and Petra brutally injure each other in a fight, ending with Erin abducting Petra.\n\n[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] reveal that Erin and Chris developed a romantic relationship while undercover, with Erin eventually becoming pregnant, later having their daughter, Shelby. At Erin's behest, they decided to become legitimate participants in a bank robbery and planned to take their shares of the heist, report to their superiors that they lost contact with the gang, and eventually quit the force. The robbery was botched when a dye pack exploded in one of the bags, and Silas killed the bank teller who accidentally placed it. When Chris attempted to intervene, he was shot and killed by Silas. After crashing the van in a dumpster and seriously injuring Toby, Erin hid her share of the heist and returned to policing, disclosing neither her original plan nor her share of the heist.\n\nIn the present, Erin visits Ethan, Shelby's adoptive father, and later talks with Shelby. Erin visits a [[self storage]] unit to retrieve her $300,000+ share of the stolen money, but finds that all but $11,000 is stained with dye. Silas sends a text message to Petra's phone, instructing her to meet him at the [[Sixth Street Viaduct]], where Erin confronts and shoots him, avenging Chris. She returns the next morning to find the police investigating the crime scene: the John Doe murder investigation depicted in the first scene of the film. With Silas dead, Erin gives evidence of her guilt{{snd}}where he can find Petra, a stained bill, and the key to her storage unit{{snd}}to her partner, Antonio. Erin has been bleeding internally for hours, from the injuries she sustained during her fight with Petra, and she dies while sitting in her car.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, single names Whitford and Stan before paired name entries, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Erin Bell\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Silas\n* [[Tatiana Maslany]] as Petra\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as Ethan\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as DiFranco\n* [[Sebastian Stan]] as Chris\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Jay\n* [[Jade Pettyjohn]] as Shelby\n* [[James Jordan (actor)|James Jordan]] as Toby\n* [[Toby Huss]] as Gil Lawson\n* [[Zach Villa]] as Arturo\n* [[Shamier Anderson]] as Antonio\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn August 2017,  [[Nicole Kidman]] entered into talks to star in the film with [[Karyn Kusama]] directing, with the casting confirmed in October.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theplaylist.net/nicole-kidman-star-karyn-kusamas-destroyer-20170808/|title=Nicole Kidman To Star In Karyn Kusama's 'Destroyer'|date=2017-08-08|work=The Playlist|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/nicole-kidman-destroyer-movie-karyn-kusama-crime-thrille-1202181915/|title=Nicole Kidman To Star In Karyn Kusama L.A.

It stars [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Toby Kebbell]], [[Tatiana Maslany]], [[Scoot McNairy]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Sebastian Stan]], and follows a former undercover police officer who takes revenge against members of a gang, years after her case was blown. \n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Telluride Film Festival]] on August 31, 2018 and was released in the United States on December 25, 2018, by [[Annapurna Pictures]]. At the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]], Kidman was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama]].\n\n==Plot==\nLAPD detective Erin Bell arrives on the scene of a John Doe murder and informs the responding officers that she knows the identity of the murderer. \n\nAt the police station, Erin receives a $100 bill stained from a [[dye pack]] in an unmarked envelope. Using a contact at the [[FBI]], she confirms that the bill is from a bank robbery committed by a California gang sixteen years prior that she and her former partner, FBI agent Chris, were embedded in as undercover officers. She tells her superiors that she believes the bill to be proof that the gang's leader, Silas, is once again active.\n\nErin works her way through the remaining members of the gang in order to find Silas. She begins with Toby, who was in prison but is now gravely ill and living with his mother on [[compassionate release]]. She gives him a [[handjob]] in exchange for the location of Arturo, a member of the gang atoning for his past crimes by offering [[pro bono]] legal services to immigrants. Arturo provides Erin with the location of Dennis DiFranco, a lawyer who launders the multi-million dollar haul from the original robbery and from whom Erin deduces that Silas is active again because the money from that heist is almost gone. After threatening him, DiFranco gives Erin the location of the next money drop, which is performed by Silas' girlfriend Petra, who has developed a severe drug addiction. Erin tracks Petra, eventually intervening in a bank robbery committed by Silas' new gang. She and Petra brutally injure each other in a fight, ending with Erin abducting Petra.\n\n[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]] reveal that Erin and Chris developed a romantic relationship while undercover, with Erin eventually becoming pregnant, later having their daughter, Shelby. At Erin's behest, they decided to become legitimate participants in a bank robbery and planned to take their shares of the heist, report to their superiors that they lost contact with the gang, and eventually quit the force. The robbery was botched when a dye pack exploded in one of the bags, and Silas killed the bank teller who accidentally placed it. When Chris attempted to intervene, he was shot and killed by Silas. After crashing the van in a dumpster and seriously injuring Toby, Erin hid her share of the heist and returned to policing, disclosing neither her original plan nor her share of the heist.\n\nIn the present, Erin visits Ethan, Shelby's adoptive father, and later talks with Shelby. Erin visits a [[self storage]] unit to retrieve her $300,000+ share of the stolen money, but finds that all but $11,000 is stained with dye. Silas sends a text message to Petra's phone, instructing her to meet him at the [[Sixth Street Viaduct]], where Erin confronts and shoots him, avenging Chris. She returns the next morning to find the police investigating the crime scene: the John Doe murder investigation depicted in the first scene of the film. With Silas dead, Erin gives evidence of her guilt{{snd}}where he can find Petra, a stained bill, and the key to her storage unit{{snd}}to her partner, Antonio.

{"title_page": "Subdivisions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo", "text_new": "[[Image:Provinces_et_Territoires_du_Republique_Democratique_du_Congo.png|thumb|DR Congo provinces, territories, and a few cities.|upright=1.18]]\n{{Politics of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}\nThe Third Republic of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is a [[unitary state]] with a five-level heirarchy of types of [[Administrative division]].  There are nine different types of subdivision in a new hierarchy with no new types but with two from the previous one abolished.\n\nUnder the Third Republic, established in 2006, the number of provinces has gone from ten to twenty-five.  By fits and starts the number of towns that have been, or are in the process of being, upgraded to cities has also increased greatly.\n\n==Territorial organization==\nThe hierarchy of types of administrative division in the Congo is as follows:{{Sfn|Organic Law No. 08/016|loc=article 4}}\n<br/>\n<small>''(French names in italics.)''</small>\n\n* [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Province]]\n** [[List of territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Territory]] (''territoire'')\n***Sector or Chiefdom (''secteur'' or ''chefferie'')\n**** Grouping (''groupement'')\n***** Village\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\n** City (''ville'')\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\nSo a Province is divided into territories and cities; a territory into sectors, chiefdoms, and communes; a sector or chiefdom into groupings; and so on.\n\n===Remarks===\n* [[Kinshasa]], as the capital city, has the status of a province with the subdivisions of a city.  It is often referred to as a city-province.\n* The district and the ''cit\u00e9'', previously a division of a province and territory respectively, have been abolished.  The ''cit\u00e9'' has been replaced by the commune.\n* In the Congo a commune can now be an urban subdivision of a city, a country town, or in some cases a mostly rural area attached to a city.\n* An older term, collectivity (fr. ''collectivit\u00e9''), is sometimes used for convenience to refer to both a sector and a chiefdom.\n* Some collectivities are not a contiguous area of land but are made up of more than one unconnected area.\n* The grouping (of villages) and, at a higher level, the chiefdom are subdivisions led by customary leaders of traditional [[polity|polities]].\n* An embedded grouping is a grouping that has been absorbed into a commune.\n* There are uninhabited areas that are not part of any subdivision below a territory.\n\n==New subdivisions==\n\n===Provinces===\nThe constitution increased the number of provinces from ten to twenty-five.  In the summer of 2015 the six largest provinces\u2014[[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], [[\u00c9quateur (former province)|\u00c9quateur]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Occidental]], [[Kasai-Oriental (former province)|Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], and [[Orientale Province|Orientale]]\u2014were split up into twenty-one new provinces: [[Bas-Uele]], a new [[Province of \u00c9quateur|\u00c9quateur]], [[Haut-Lomami]], [[Haut-Katanga]], [[Haut-Uele]], [[Ituri Province|Ituri]], [[Kasa\u00ef Province|Kasa\u00ef]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Central]], a new [[Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Kwango]], [[Kwilu Province|Kwilu]], [[Lomami Province|Lomami]], [[Lualaba Province|Lualaba]], [[Mai-Ndombe Province|Mai-Ndombe]], [[Mongala]], [[Nord-Ubangi]], [[Sankuru]], [[Sud-Ubangi]], [[Tanganyika Province|Tanganyika]], [[Tshopo]], and [[Tshuapa]].  Each new province corresponded to a former district except for Lualaba and Mai-Ndombe which were each formed from two districts.  Together with the four unsplit provinces\u2014[[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo]] (renamed Kongo Central), [[Maniema]], [[Nord-Kivu]], and [[Sud-Kivu]]\u2014they make up the twenty-five provinces listed in article two of the constitution.{{Sfn|Radio Okapi 4 Mar 2015}}{{Sfn|Bouvier|Omasombo Tshonda|2016|pp=47\u201349}}\n\n=== Cities and communes ===\nIn June 2013 a batch of prime ministerial decrees was issued giving city and commune status to, and setting the boundaries for, a large number of former ''cit\u00e9s'' and other populated places.{{Sfn|Journal Officiel|2013|loc=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 13/020\u201313/030 du 13 juin 2013}}  According to the government's 2014 statistical yearbook the Congo would go from 21 cities and 227 ''cit\u00e9s'' in 2008 to 99 cities and 289 territorial communes in the reorganization.{{Sfn|2014 Statistical Yearbook|loc=Tableau 1.2 and 1.3|pp=28\u201329}}  However, in July 2015 the implementation of many of the decrees' articles were suspended following the failure in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]] of an electoral bill based on the boundaries in the decrees.{{Sfn|le Phare 23 Jul 2015}}\n\nIn order to pass a modified bill allocating seats for upcoming local elections, it was decided to suspend those articles that were contentious and to revert the affected communities to their 2006 administrative configurations.  The articles granting city status to new provincial capitals\u2014[[Boende]], [[Bunia]], [[Buta, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Buta]], [[Gemena]], [[Inongo]], [[Isiro]], [[Kabinda]], [[Kalemie]], [[Kamina]], [[Kenge, Kwango|Kenge]], [[Lisala]], and [[Lusambo]]\u2014were not suspended and neither were those granting commune status to the administrative centers of the territories.{{Sfn|Matotu|2015}}\n\nUltimately the planned for local elections never occurred, but the suspensions were not lifted until mid-2018 just months before the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|general election]].  The National Alliance of Traditional Authorities of the Congo protested this reinstatement as diminishing traditional authority and as a threat to national security.{{Sfn|Le Potentiel|2018}}  In addition to reinstating the articles the government decided that disputes over boundaries would be resolved by an ad-hoc committee and that the setting up of cities and communes would be prioritized with 18 cities in the initial phase.{{Sfnm|1a1= D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 18/020 |2a1=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Interministeriel n\u00b0 25/\u2026/2018}}  \n\nIn 2019 mayors for the new cities of [[Uvira]], [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]], [[Kamituga]], and [[Kasumbalesa, Democratic Republic of the Congo| Kasumbalesa]] were appointed.{{Sfn|Balongelwa|2019 }}{{Sfn|Nzadi News|2019}}  The setting up of a city administration and those of its subdivisions can take years given the lack of local resources.  For instance the town of Buta gained city status when it became a provincial capital in 2015, had its first mayor appointed in 2018, and by June 2019 its four communes where still not operational.{{Sfn|Okonda|2019}}\n\n== Subdivision count ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2018 Subdivision count by administrative level<ref>Level 1\u20134 tabulated from data found at [[#{{SfnRef|CENI maps}}|CENI maps]]; level 5 from [[#{{SfnRef|CENI 2017}}|CENI 2017]], p. 55, Tableau 10</ref>\n|-\n!

The count of cities only includes those currently represented in the national and provincial assemblies and not those that became cities after the organization of the elections.  Thus, for example, the new city of Uvira is not counted as a city but as a commune in the table.  This of course also effects the counts of city subdivisions such as communes and quarters.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n*[[List of provinces of the

Congo}}\nThe Third Republic of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] is a [[unitary state]] with a five-level heirarchy of types of [[Administrative division|administrative division]].  There are nine different types of subdivision in a new hierarchy with no new types but with two from the previous one abolished.\n\nUnder the Third Republic, established in 2006, the number of provinces has gone from ten to twenty-five.  By fits and starts the number of towns that have been, or are in the process of being, upgraded to cities has also increased greatly.\n\n==Territorial organization==\nThe hierarchy of types of administrative division in the Congo is as follows:{{Sfn|Organic Law No. 08/016|loc=article 4}}\n<br/>\n<small>''(French names in italics.)''</small>\n\n* [[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Province]]\n** [[List of territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Territory]] (''territoire'')\n***Sector or Chiefdom (''secteur'' or ''chefferie'')\n**** Grouping (''groupement'')\n***** Village\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\n** City (''ville'')\n*** Commune\n**** Quarter (''quartier'')\n**** Embedded Grouping (''groupement incorpor\u00e9'')\n***** Village\nSo a Province is divided into territories and cities; a territory into sectors, chiefdoms, and communes; a sector or chiefdom into groupings; and so on.\n\n===Remarks===\n* [[Kinshasa]], as the capital city, has the status of a province with the subdivisions of a city.  It is often referred to as a city-province.\n* The district and the ''cit\u00e9'', previously a division of a province and territory respectively, have been abolished.  The ''cit\u00e9'' has been replaced by the commune.\n* In the Congo a commune can now be an urban subdivision of a city, a country town, or in some cases a mostly rural area attached to a city.\n* An older term, collectivity (fr. ''collectivit\u00e9''), is sometimes used for convenience to refer to both a sector and a chiefdom.\n* Some collectivities are not a contiguous area of land but are made up of more than one unconnected area.\n* The grouping (of villages) and, at a higher level, the chiefdom are subdivisions led by customary leaders of traditional [[polity|polities]].\n* An embedded grouping is a grouping that has been absorbed into a commune.\n* There are uninhabited areas that are not part of any subdivision below a territory.\n\n==New subdivisions==\n\n===Provinces===\nThe constitution increased the number of provinces from ten to twenty-five.  In the summer of 2015 the six largest provinces\u2014[[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]], [[\u00c9quateur (former province)|\u00c9quateur]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Occidental]], [[Kasai-Oriental (former province)|Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], and [[Orientale Province|Orientale]]\u2014were split up into twenty-one new provinces: [[Bas-Uele]], a new [[Province of \u00c9quateur|\u00c9quateur]], [[Haut-Lomami]], [[Haut-Katanga]], [[Haut-Uele]], [[Ituri Province|Ituri]], [[Kasa\u00ef Province|Kasa\u00ef]], [[Kasa\u00ef-Central]], a new [[Kasa\u00ef-Oriental]], [[Kwango]], [[Kwilu Province|Kwilu]], [[Lomami Province|Lomami]], [[Lualaba Province|Lualaba]], [[Mai-Ndombe Province|Mai-Ndombe]], [[Mongala]], [[Nord-Ubangi]], [[Sankuru]], [[Sud-Ubangi]], [[Tanganyika Province|Tanganyika]], [[Tshopo]], and [[Tshuapa]].  Each new province corresponded to a former district except for Lualaba and Mai-Ndombe which were each formed from two districts.  Together with the four unsplit provinces\u2014[[Kongo Central|Bas-Congo]] (renamed Kongo Central), [[Maniema]], [[Nord-Kivu]], and [[Sud-Kivu]]\u2014they make up the twenty-five provinces listed in article two of the constitution{{Sfn|Radio Okapi 4 Mar 2015}}{{Sfn|Bouvier|Omasombo Tshonda|2016|pp=47\u201349}}.\n\n=== Cities and communes ===\nIn June 2013 a batch of prime ministerial decrees was issued giving city and commune status to, and setting the boundaries for, a large number of former ''cit\u00e9s'' and other populated places.{{Sfn|Journal Officiel|2013|loc=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 13/020\u201313/030 du 13 juin 2013}}  According to the government's 2014 statistical yearbook the Congo would go from 21 cities and 227 ''cit\u00e9s'' in 2008 to 99 cities and 289 territorial communes in the reorganization.{{Sfn|2014 Statistical Yearbook|loc=Tableau 1.2 and 1.3|pp=28\u201329}}  However, in July 2015 the implementation of many of the decrees' articles were suspended following the failure in the [[National Assembly (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|National Assembly]] of an electoral bill based on the boundaries in the decrees.{{Sfn|le Phare 23 Jul 2015}}\n\nIn order to pass a modified bill allocating seats for upcoming local elections, it was decided to suspend those articles that were contentious and to revert the affected communities to their 2006 administrative configurations.  The articles granting city status to new provincial capitals\u2014[[Boende]], [[Bunia]], [[Buta, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Buta]], [[Gemena]], [[Inongo]], [[Isiro]], [[Kabinda]], [[Kalemie]], [[Kamina]], [[Kenge, Kwango|Kenge]], [[Lisala]], and [[Lusambo]]\u2014were not suspended and neither were those granting commune status to the administrative centers of the territories.{{Sfn|Matotu|2015}}\n\nUltimately the planned for local elections never occurred, but the suspensions were not lifted until mid-2018 just months before the [[2018 Democratic Republic of the Congo general election|general election]].  The National Alliance of Traditional Authorities of the Congo protested this reinstatement as diminishing traditional authority and as a threat to national security.{{Sfn|Le Potentiel|2018}}  In addition to reinstating the articles the government decided that disputes over boundaries would be resolved by an ad-hoc committee and that the setting up of cities and communes would be prioritized with 18 cities in the initial phase.{{Sfnm|1a1= D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 18/020 |2a1=Arr\u00eat\u00e9 Interministeriel n\u00b0 25/\u2026/2018}}  \n\nIn 2019 mayors for the new cities of [[Uvira]], [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]], [[Kamituga]], and [[Kasumbalesa, Democratic Republic of the Congo| Kasumbalesa]] were appointed.{{Sfn|Balongelwa|2019 }}{{Sfn|Nzadi News|2019}}  The setting up of a city administration and those of its subdivisions can take years given the lack of local resources.  For instance the town of Buta gained city status when it became a provincial capital in 2015, had its first mayor appointed in 2018, and by June 2019 its four communes where still not operational.{{Sfn|Okonda|2019}}\n\n== Subdivision count ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ 2018 Subdivision count by administrative level<ref>Level 1\u20134 tabulated from data found at [[#{{SfnRef|CENI maps}}|CENI maps]]; level 5 from [[#{{SfnRef|CENI 2017}}|CENI 2017]], p. 55, Tableau 10</ref>\n|-\n!

The count of cities only includes those currently represented in the national and provincial assemblies and not those that became cities after the organization of the elections.  Thus, for example, the new city of Uvira is not counted as a city but as a commune in the table.  This of course also effects the counts of city subdivisions such as communes and quarters.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]]\n*[[List of provinces of the

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

As with all radio, this is done by the [[modem|modulating and demodulation]] of [[carrier wave]]s. Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314).

In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth.

These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]].

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices. In general, the maximum amount of power that a Wi-Fi device can transmit is limited by local regulations, such as [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]] in the US. [[Equivalent isotropically radiated power]] (EIRP) in the European Union is limited to 20 [[dBm]] (100&nbsp;mW).\n\nTo reach requirements for wireless LAN applications, Wi-Fi has higher power consumption compared to some other standards designed to support wireless personal area network (PAN) applications.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW. Note that this assumes that radiation in the vertical is lost; this may not be the case in some situations, especially in large buildings or within a [[waveguide]]. In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band. Interference can be caused by overlapping channels. Any two channel numbers that differ by five or more, such as 2 and 7, do not overlap (no [[adjacent-channel interference]]). The oft-repeated adage that channels 1, 6, and 11 are the ''only'' non-overlapping channels is, therefore, not accurate. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing. Channels that are four apart interfere a negligible amount-much less than reusing channels (which causes [[co-channel interference]])-if transmitters are at least a few metres apart.<ref name=\"vilegas\">Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs - Eduard Garcia Villegas, Elena Lopez-Aguilera, Rafael Vidal, Josep Paradells (2007) {{DOI|10.1109/CROWNCOM.2007.4549783}}</ref> In Europe and Japan where channel 13 is available, using Channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 for [[IEEE 802.11#802.11g|802.11g]] and [[IEEE 802.11#802.11n|802.11n]] is [[IEEE 802.11#Channels and international compatibility|recommended]].\n\nHowever, many 2.4 GHz 802.11b and 802.11g access-points default to the same channel on initial startup, contributing to congestion on certain channels. Wi-Fi pollution, or an excessive number of access points in the area, can prevent access and interfere with other devices' use of other access points as well as with decreased [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR) between access points.

Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements.

An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices. Adrian la chupa.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

While effective against the casual user, it is ineffective as a security method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear in response to a client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known [[MAC address]]es to join the network,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n |title       = Hacking Techniques in Wireless Networks\n |last        = Mateti\n |first       = Prabhaker\n |year        = 2005\n |publisher   = [[Wright State University]] Department of Computer Science and Engineering\n |location    = Dayton, Ohio\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100305180937/http://www.cs.wright.edu/~pmateti/InternetSecurity/Lectures/WirelessHacks/Mateti-WirelessHacks.htm#_Toc77524658\n |archivedate = 2010-03-05\n |url-status  = live\n |accessdate  = 2010-02-28\n}}</ref> but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by [[MAC spoofing|spoofing]] an authorized address.\n\n[[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP) encryption was designed to protect against casual snooping but it is no longer considered secure.

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used. In 2018, [[WPA3]] was announced as a replacement for WPA2, increasing security;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|title=WPA3 protocol will make public Wi-Fi hotspots a lot more secure|last=Thubron|first=Rob|date=2018-01-09|website=Techspot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116023123/https://www.techspot.com/news/72656-wpa3-protocol-make-public-wi-fi-hotspots-lot.html|archive-date=2018-11-16|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> it rolled out on June 26.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|title=Wi-Fi security is starting to get its biggest upgrade in over a decade|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2018-06-26|website=[[The Verge]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220012909/https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/6/26/17501594/wpa3-wifi-security-certification|archive-date=2019-02-20|url-status=live|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Piggybacking ===\n{{Main|Piggybacking (Internet access)}}\n{{Further|Legality of piggybacking}}\n{{Further|Wi-Fi Protected Setup#Physical security issues}}\nPiggybacking refers to access to a wireless Internet connection by bringing one's own computer within the range of another's wireless connection, and using that service without the subscriber's explicit permission or knowledge.\n\nDuring the early popular adoption of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]], providing open access points for anyone within range to use was encouraged{{By whom|date=March 2010}} to cultivate [[wireless community network]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nocat.net/ |title=NoCat's goal is to bring you Infinite Bandwidth Everywhere for Free |publisher=Nocat.net |accessdate=2011-10-14}}</ref> particularly since people on average use only a fraction of their downstream bandwidth at any given time.\n\nRecreational logging and mapping of other people's access points has become known as [[wardriving]]. Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health

Compatible devices can network through [[wireless access point]]s to each other as well as to wired devices and the Internet. The different versions of Wi-Fi are specified by various IEEE 802.11 protocol standards, with the different radio technologies determining radio bands, and the maximum ranges, and speeds that may be achieved. Wi-Fi most commonly uses the {{convert|2.4|GHz|mm}} [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and {{convert|5|GHz|mm|sigfig=1}} [[Super high frequency|SHF]] [[ISM band|ISM]] radio bands; these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Channels can be shared between networks but only one transmitter can locally transmit on a channel at any moment in time.\n\nWi-Fi's wavebands have relatively high absorption and work best for [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] use. Many common obstructions such as walls, pillars, home appliances etc. may greatly reduce range, but this also helps minimize interference between different networks in crowded environments. An access point (or [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]]) often has a range of about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} indoors while some modern access points claim up to a {{convert|150|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers using many overlapping access points with [[roaming]] permitted between them. Over time the speed and spectral efficiency of Wi-Fi has increased. As of 2019, at close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware, can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbit/s ([[gigabit]] per second).\n\nWi-Fi is potentially more vulnerable to attack than wired networks because anyone within range of a network with a [[wireless network interface controller]] can attempt access. To connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user typically needs the network name (the ''SSID'') and a password. The password is used to encrypt Wi-Fi packets so as to block eavesdroppers. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is intended to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes versions for personal and enterprise networks. Developing security features of WPA have included stronger protections and new security practices.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|IEEE 802.11#History}}\n\nIn 1971, [[ALOHAnet]] connected the Great Hawaiian Islands with a UHF wireless packet network.

To communicate, devices must use a common Wi-Fi version. The versions differ between the radio wavebands they operate on, the radio bandwidth they occupy, the maximum data rates they can support and other details. Some versions permit the use of multiple antennas, which permits greater speeds as well as reduced interference.\n\nHistorically, equipment has simply listed the versions of Wi-Fi using the name of the IEEE standard that it supports. In 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|title=Wi-Fi Alliance\u00ae introduces Wi-Fi 6 {{!}} Wi-Fi Alliance|website=www.wi-fi.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref> the Wi-Fi alliance standardized generational numbering so that equipment can indicate that it supports Wi-Fi 4 (if the equipment supports 802.11n), Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax). These generations have a high degree of backward compatibility with previous versions. The alliance have stated that the generational level 4, 5, or 6 can be indicated in the user interface when connected, along with the signal strength.<ref name=generational/>\n\nThe full list of versions of Wi-Fi is: 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n ('''Wi-Fi 4'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11h, 802.11i, 802.11-2007, 802.11-2012, 802.11ac ('''Wi-Fi 5'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ad, 802.11af, 802.11-2016, 802.11ah, 802.11ai, 802.11aj, 802.11aq, 802.11ax ('''Wi-Fi 6'''<ref name=generational/>), 802.11ay.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Internet ===\nWi-Fi technology may be used to provide local network and [[Internet access]] to devices that are within Wi-Fi range of one or more routers that are connected to the Internet. The coverage of one or more interconnected [[Wireless access point|access points]] (''hotspots'') can extend from an area as small as a few rooms to as large as many square kilometres. Coverage in the larger area may require a group of access points with overlapping coverage. For example, public outdoor Wi-Fi technology has been used successfully in [[wireless mesh network]]s in London. An international example is [[Fon (company)|Fon]].\n\nWi-Fi provides service in private homes, businesses, as well as in public spaces. Wi-Fi hotspots may be set up either free-of-charge or commercially, often using a [[captive portal]] webpage for access. Organizations, enthusiasts, authorities  and [[business]]es, such as airports, hotels, and restaurants, often provide free or paid-use hotspots to attract customers, to provide services to promote business in selected areas.\n\n[[Router (computing)|Routers]] often incorporate a [[digital subscriber line]] modem or a [[cable modem]] and a Wi-Fi access point, are frequently set up in homes and other buildings, to provide Internet access and [[internetworking]] for the structure.\n\nSimilarly, battery-powered routers may include a cellular Internet [[radio modem]] and Wi-Fi access point. When subscribed to a cellular data carrier, they allow nearby Wi-Fi stations to access the Internet over 2G, 3G, or 4G networks using the [[tethering]] technique. Many smartphones have a built-in capability of this sort, including those based on [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[BlackBerry]], [[Bada]], [[iOS]] ([[iPhone]]), [[Windows Phone]], and [[Symbian]], though carriers often disable the feature, or charge a separate fee to enable it, especially for customers with unlimited data plans. \"Internet packs\" provide standalone facilities of this type as well, without use of a smartphone; examples include the [[MiFi]]- and [[WiBro]]-branded devices. Some laptops that have a cellular modem card can also act as mobile Internet Wi-Fi access points.\n\nMany traditional university campuses in the developed world provide at least partial Wi-Fi coverage. [[Carnegie Mellon University]] built the first campus-wide wireless Internet network, called [[Wireless Andrew]], at its [[Pittsburgh]] campus in 1993 before Wi-Fi branding originated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|title=How Wi-Fi got its start on the campus of CMU, a true story|last=Smit|first=Deb|date=October 5, 2011|website=[[Pop City]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007191316/http://www.popcitymedia.com/innovationnews/wifi100511.aspx|archivedate=October 7, 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Wireless Andrew: Creating the World's First Wireless Campus | publisher=Carnegie Mellon University | year=2007 | url=http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | accessdate=October 6, 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901202026/http://www.cmu.edu/corporate/news/2007/features/wireless_andrew.shtml | archivedate=September 1, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|title=The Innovation Journey of Wi-Fi: The Road to Global Success|author1=Lemstra|first=Wolter|last2=Hayes|first2=Vic|last3=Groenewegen|first3=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-19971-1|location=|page=121|author-link2=Vic Hayes|accessdate=October 6, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175135/http://books.google.com/books?id=-OMoL5Irm08C&pg=PA121|archivedate=November 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> By February 1997, the CMU Wi-Fi zone was fully operational.

Different versions of Wi-Fi use different techniques, 802.11b uses [[DSSS]] on a single carrier, whereas 802.11a, Wi-Fi 4, 5 and 6 use multiple carriers on slightly different frequencies within the channel ([[OFDM]]).<ref>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Wi-Fi establishes link-level connections, which can be defined using both the destination and source addresses. On the reception of a transmission, the receiver uses the destination address to determine whether the transmission is relevant to the station or should be ignored. A network interface normally does not accept packets addressed to other Wi-Fi stations.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}}\n\nDue to the ubiquity of Wi-Fi and the ever-decreasing cost of the hardware needed to support it, most manufacturers now build Wi-Fi interfaces directly into [[PC motherboard]]s, eliminating the need for installation of a separate network card.\n\nChannels are used [[half duplex]] and can be [[Time-division multiple access|time-shared]] by multiple networks. When communication happens on the same channel, any information sent by one computer is locally received by all, even if that information is intended for just one destination.{{Efn|This \"one speaks, all listen\" property is a security weakness of shared-medium Wi-Fi since a node on a Wi-Fi network can eavesdrop on all traffic on the wire if it so chooses.}} The network interface card interrupts the [[central processing unit|CPU]] only when applicable packets are received: the card ignores information not addressed to it.{{Efn|Unless it is put into [[promiscuous mode]].}} Use of the same channel also means that the data bandwidth is shared, such that, for example, available data bandwidth to each device is halved when two stations are actively transmitting.\n\nA collision happens when two stations attempt to transmit at the same time. They corrupt transmitted data and require stations to re-transmit. The lost data and re-transmission reduce throughput. In the worst case, where multiple active hosts connected with maximum allowed cable length attempt to transmit many short frames, excessive collisions can reduce throughput dramatically. A scheme known as [[carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA) governs the way the computers share the channel.\n\n=== Waveband ===\n{{Main|List of WLAN channels}}\n[[File:Co-Channel Wi-Fi Interference 01.png|thumb|In the 2.4 GHz wavebands as well as others, transmitters straddle multiple channels.

In this frequency band equipment may occasionally suffer [[Interference (communication)|interference]] from [[microwave oven]]s, [[cordless telephone]]s, [[USB 3.0]] hubs, and [[Bluetooth]] devices.\n\nSpectrum assignments and operational limitations are not consistent worldwide: Australia and Europe allow for an additional two channels (12, 13) beyond the 11 permitted in the United States for the 2.4&nbsp; GHz band, while Japan has three more (12\u201314). In the US and other countries, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations.\n\n802.11a/h/j/n/ac/ax can use the [[U-NII|5&nbsp; GHz U-NII band]], which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping 20&nbsp; MHz channels rather than the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency band, where the channels are only 5 MHz wide. In general, lower frequencies have better range but have less capacity. The 5 GHz bands are absorbed to a greater degree by common building materials than the 2.4 GHz bands and usually give a shorter range.\n\nAs 802.11 specifications evolved to support higher throughput, the protocols have become much more efficient in their use of bandwidth. Additionally, they have gained the ability to [[Link aggregation|aggregate]] (or 'bond') channels together to gain still more throughput where the bandwidth is available. 802.11n allows for double radio spectrum/bandwidth (40 MHz- 8 channels) compared to [[IEEE 802.11a-1999|802.11a]] or 802.11g (20&nbsp;MHz). 802.11n can also be set to limit itself to 20 MHz bandwidth to prevent interference in dense communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|title=802.11n Data Rates Dependability and scalability|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Cisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705034144/http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/Aironet-1250-series/design_guide_c07-693245.html#_Toc309331071|archive-date=2017-07-05|url-status=live|access-date=2017-11-20}}</ref> In the 5 GHz band, 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and 160 MHz bandwidth signals are permitted with some restrictions, giving much faster connections.\n\n=== Communication stack ===\n[[File:802.11_frame.png|alt=|right|frameless|622x622px|Generic 802.11 Frame]]\n{{Main|IEEE 802|IEEE 802.11}}\nWi-Fi is part of the IEEE 802 protocol family.

They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/[[Metropolitan area network|MAN]] Standards Committee ([[IEEE 802]]). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had many subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|title=What Does WiFi Stand For and How Does Wifi Work?|last=Stobing|first=Chris|date=2015-11-17|website=GadgetReview|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201045951/http://www.gadgetreview.com/what-is-wifi-what-does-wifi-stand-for-how-does-it-work|archivedate=December 1, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 18, 2015}}</ref> As a result, in the market place, each revision tends to become its own standard.\n\nIn addition to 802.11 the IEEE 802 protocol family has specific provisions for Wi-Fi. These are required because Ethernet's cable-based media are not usually shared, whereas with wireless all transmissions are received by all stations within range that employ that radio channel. While Ethernet has essentially negligible error rates, wireless communication media are subject to significant interference. Therefore, accurate transmission is not guaranteed so delivery is therefore a [[best-effort delivery]] mechanism. Because of this, for Wi-Fi, the [[logical link control|Logical Link Control]] (LLC) specified by [[IEEE 802.2]] employs Wi-Fi's [[media access control]] (MAC) protocols to manage retries without relying on higher levels of the protocol stack.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Jim|title=Overview of the IEEE 802.11 Standard|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|publisher=InformIT|accessdate=8 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420043213/http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=24411&seqNum=7|archivedate=20 April 2016|date=2001-12-06}}</ref>\n\nFor internetworking purposes Wi-Fi is usually [[protocol layering|layered]] as a [[link layer]] (equivalent to the physical and data link layers of the [[OSI model]]) below the [[internet layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol]]. This means that nodes have an associated [[internet address]] and, with suitable connectivity, this allows full Internet access.\n\n===Modes===\n\n====Infrastructure====\n[[File:Wi-Fi.gif|thumb|Depiction of a Wi-Fi network in infrastructure mode. The device sends information wirelessly to another device, both connected to the local network, in order to print a document]]\nIn infrastructure mode, which is the most common mode used, all communications goes through a base station. For communications within the network, this introduces an extra use of the airwaves, but has the advantage that any two stations that can communicate with the base station can also communicate through the base station, which enormously simplifies the protocols.\n\n==== Ad hoc and Wi-Fi direct ====\nWi-Fi also allows communications directly from one computer to another without an access point intermediary. This is called [[wireless ad hoc network|''ad hoc'' Wi-Fi transmission]]. Different types of ad hoc network exist. In the simplest case network nodes must talk directly to each other.

In addition, propagation characteristics of the signals can have a big impact.\n\nAt longer distances, and with greater signal absorption, speed is usually reduced.\n\n=== Transmitter power ===\nCompared to cell phones and similar technology, Wi-Fi transmitters are low power devices.

The same radio with an external semi parabolic antenna (15&nbsp;dB gain) with a similarly equipped receiver at the far end might have a range over 20 miles.\n\nHigher gain rating (dBi) indicates further deviation (generally toward the horizontal) from a theoretical, perfect [[isotropic radiator]], and therefore the antenna can project or accept a usable signal further in particular directions, as compared to a similar output power on a more isotropic antenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|title=Somebody explain dBi \u2013 Wireless Networking \u2013 DSLReports Forums|work=DSL Reports|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809101928/http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r15405199-Somebody-explain-dBi|archivedate=2014-08-09}}</ref> For example, an 8 dBi antenna used with a 100&nbsp;mW driver has a similar horizontal range to a 6 dBi antenna being driven at 500&nbsp;mW.

In the above example, a directional waveguide could cause the low power 6 dBi antenna to project much further in a single direction than the 8 dBi antenna, which is not in a waveguide, even if they are both driven at 100&nbsp;mW.\n\nOn wireless routers with detachable antennas, it is possible to improve range by fitting upgraded antennas that provide higher gain in particular directions.

Wi-Fi protocols are designed to share the wavebands reasonably fairly, and this often works with little to no disruption. To minimize collisions with Wi-Fi and non Wi-Fi devices, Wi-Fi employs [[Carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance]] (CSMA/CA), where transmitters listen before transmitting, and delay transmission of packets if they detect that other devices are active on the channel, or if noise is detected from adjacent channels or from non Wi-Fi sources. Nevertheless, Wi-Fi networks are still susceptible to the [[hidden node]] and [[exposed node problem]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Sandip|last2=Nandi|first2=Sukumar|last3=Chattopadhyay|first3=Subhrendu|date=2015-09-22|title=Alleviating Hidden and Exposed Nodes in High-Throughput Wireless Mesh Networks|url=|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications]]|volume=15|issue=2|pages=928\u2013937|doi=10.1109/TWC.2015.2480398}}</ref>\n\nA standard speed Wi-Fi signal occupies five channels in the 2.4 GHz band.

Channels 1, 6, and 11 are the only ''group of three'' non-overlapping channels in North America. However, whether the overlap is significant depends on physical spacing.

On some 5 GHz bands interference from radar systems can occur in some places. For base stations that support those bands they employ Dynamic Frequency Selection which listens for radar, and if it is found, will not permit a network on that band.\n\nThese bands can be used by low power transmitters without a license, and with few restrictions. However, while unintended interference is common, users that have been found to cause deliberate interference (particularly for attempting to locally monopolize these bands for commercial purposes) have been issued large fines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/mobile-wireless/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|title=Wi-Fi hotspot blocking persists despite FCC crackdown|last=Brown|first=Bob|date=2016-03-10|website=[[Network World]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227033935/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3042454/wi-fi-hotspot-blocking-persists-despite-fcc-crackdown.html|archive-date=2019-02-27|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Throughput ===\n[[File:Throughputenvelope80211g.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11g]]\n[[File:ThroughputEnvelope11n.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific (UDP) performance envelope {{nowrap|2.4 GHz}} band, with 802.11n with 40 MHz]]\n\nVarious layer 2 variants of IEEE 802.11 have different characteristics. Across all flavours of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are either given based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer 2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data are transferred between two endpoints of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure, and the other is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link.\n\nThis means that typically data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium and are being converted to 802.3 (Ethernet) or vice versa.\n\nDue to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the packet size of an application determines the speed of the data transfer. This means that an application that uses small packets (e.g., VoIP) creates a data flow with a high overhead traffic (low [[goodput]]).\n\nOther factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices.<ref>{{cite web |title= Towards Energy-Awareness in Managing Wireless LAN Applications |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241631429 |publisher=IEEE/IFIP NOMS 2012: IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Application Level Energy and Performance Measurements in a Wireless LAN |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224264522 |publisher=The 2011 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Green Computing and Communications |accessdate=2014-08-11}}</ref>\n\nThe same references apply to the attached throughput graphs, which show measurements of [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] throughput measurements. Each represents an average throughput of 25 measurements (the error bars are there, but barely visible due to the small variation), is with a specific packet size (small or large), and with a specific data rate (10 kbit/s \u2013 100 Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. This text and measurements do not cover packet errors but information about this can be found at the above references.

Also, spaces where cables cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and historical buildings, can host wireless LANs. However, building walls of certain materials, such as stone with high metal content, can block Wi-Fi signals.\n\nA Wi-Fi device is a [[short-range device|short-range]] [[wireless]] device. Wi-Fi devices are [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on [[RF CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]] ([[RF circuit]]) chips.<ref name=\"Happich\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Veendrick |first1=Harry J.

The price of [[chipset]]s for Wi-Fi continues to drop, making it an economical networking option included in ever more devices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|title=Free WiFi Analyzer-Best Channel Analyzer Apps For Wireless Networks|last=|first=|date=2017-06-08|website=The Digital Worm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808000116/https://www.thedigitalworm.com/free-wifi-analyzer-apps/|archivedate=2017-08-08|url-status=dead|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDifferent competitive brands of access points and client network-interfaces can inter-operate at a basic level of service. Products designated as \"Wi-Fi Certified\" by the Wi-Fi Alliance are [[backward compatible]]. Unlike [[mobile phone]]s, any standard Wi-Fi device works anywhere in the world.\n\n=== Access point ===\n[[File:Apple-Airport-Extreme-80211g-WiFi-Card.jpg|thumb|An [[AirPort]] wireless G Wi-Fi adapter from an Apple [[MacBook]].]]\n\nA wireless access point (WAP) connects a group of wireless devices to an adjacent wired LAN. An access point resembles a [[Ethernet hub|network hub]], relaying [[data (computing)|data]] between connected wireless devices in addition to a (usually) single connected wired device, most often an Ethernet hub or switch, allowing wireless devices to communicate with other wired devices.\n\n=== Wireless adapter ===\n[[File:Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I - front and back - 2018-05-15.jpg|thumb|Wireless network interface controller Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I.]]\nWireless adapters allow devices to connect to a wireless network. These adapters connect to devices using various external or internal interconnects such as PCI, miniPCI, USB, [[ExpressCard]], Cardbus, and [[PC Card]]. As of 2010, most newer laptop computers come equipped with built in internal adapters.\n\n=== Router ===\n\n[[Wireless router]]s integrate a Wireless Access Point, Ethernet [[network switch|switch]], and internal router firmware application that provides [[Internet Protocol|IP]] [[routing]], [[Network address translation|NAT]], and [[Domain Name System|DNS]] forwarding through an integrated WAN-interface. A wireless router allows wired and wireless Ethernet LAN devices to connect to a (usually) single WAN device such as a cable modem, [[DSL modem]] or [[optical modem]]. A wireless router allows all three devices, mainly the access point and router, to be configured through one central utility. This utility is usually an integrated [[web server]] that is accessible to wired and wireless LAN clients and often optionally to WAN clients. This utility may also be an application that is run on a computer, as is the case with as Apple's AirPort, which is managed with the [[AirPort Utility]] on [[macOS]] and [[iOS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|title=Apple.com Airport Utility Product Page|publisher=Apple, Inc.|accessdate=2011-06-14|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608183330/http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/utility.html|archivedate=2011-06-08}}</ref>\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nWireless [[Bridging (networking)|network bridges]] can act to connect two networks to form a single network  at the [[OSI model#Layer 2: data link layer|data-link layer]] over Wi-Fi. The main standard is the [[wireless distribution system]] (WDS).\n\nWireless bridging can connect a wired network to a wireless network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point typically connects wireless devices to one wired network. Two wireless bridge devices may be used to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices that have no wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as [[consumer entertainment device]]s; alternatively, a wireless bridge can be used to enable a device that supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard that is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g., enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device that only supports Wireless-G).\nA dual-band wireless bridge can also be used to enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device that only supports 2.4 GHz wireless and has a wired Ethernet port.\n\nWireless range-extenders or wireless repeaters can extend the range of an existing wireless network. Strategically placed range-extenders can elongate a signal area or allow for the signal area to reach around barriers such as those pertaining in L-shaped corridors. Wireless devices connected through repeaters suffer from an increased latency for each hop, and there may be a reduction in the maximum available data throughput. In addition, the effect of additional users using a network employing wireless range-extenders is to consume the available bandwidth faster than would be the case whereby a single user migrates around a network employing extenders. For this reason, wireless range-extenders work best in networks supporting low traffic throughput requirements, such as for cases whereby a single user with a Wi-Fi equipped tablet migrates around the combined extended and non-extended portions of the total connected network. Also, a wireless device connected to any of the repeaters in the chain has data throughput limited by the \"weakest link\" in the chain between the connection origin and connection end. Networks using wireless extenders are more prone to degradation from interference from neighboring access points that border portions of the extended network and that happen to occupy the same channel as the extended network.\n\n=== Embedded systems ===\n[[File:Ezurio wism2 small.jpg|thumb|Embedded serial-to-Wi-Fi module]]\nThe security standard, [[Wi-Fi Protected Setup]], allows embedded devices with limited graphical user interface to connect to the Internet with ease. Wi-Fi Protected Setup has 2 configurations: The Push Button configuration and the PIN configuration. These embedded devices are also called The [[Internet of Things]] and are low-power, battery-operated embedded systems. A number of Wi-Fi manufacturers design chips and modules for embedded Wi-Fi, such as GainSpan.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|title=GainSpan low-power, embedded Wi-Fi\n|publisher=www.gainspan.com\n|accessdate=2017-06-17\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630050952/http://www.gainspan.com/technology/technology_overview.php\n|archive-date=2010-06-30\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref>\n\nIncreasingly in the last few years (particularly {{As of| 2007 | lc = on}}), embedded Wi-Fi modules have become available that incorporate a real-time operating system and provide a simple means of wirelessly enabling any device that can communicate via a serial port.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |title       = Quatech Rolls Out Airborne Embedded 802.11 Radio for M2M Market\n |accessdate  = 2008-04-29\n |url-status  = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080428103306/http://edageek.com/2008/04/18/embedded-wifi-radio/\n |archivedate = 2008-04-28\n}}</ref> This allows the design of simple monitoring devices.

It makes embedded systems with Wi-Fi connectivity possible to build as single-chip devices, which reduces their cost and minimum size, making it more practical to build wireless-networked controllers into inexpensive ordinary objects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macinstallations.com/wifi-connectivity-explained/|title=Wifi Connectivity Explained {{!}} MAC Installations & Consulting|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Network security ==\n{{Main|Wireless security}}\nThe main issue with wireless [[network security]] is its simplified access to the network compared to traditional wired networks such as Ethernet. With wired networking, one must either gain access to a building (physically connecting into the internal network), or break through an external [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]]. To access Wi-Fi, one must merely be within the range of the Wi-Fi network. Most business networks protect sensitive data and systems by attempting to disallow external access. Enabling wireless connectivity reduces security if the network uses inadequate or no encryption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|title=802.11 X Wireless Network in a Business Environment \u2013 Pros and Cons.|last=Jensen|first=Joe|date=2007-10-26|website=Networkbits|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305075900/http://networkbits.net/wireless-printing/80211-g-pros-cons-of-a-wireless-network-in-a-business-environment/|archivedate=2008-03-05|url-status=live|accessdate=2008-04-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.app.com/article/20130701/NJNEWS/307010010/Free-Wi-Fi-User-beware-Open-connections-Internet-full-security-dangers|title=Free Wi-Fi?

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) encryption, which became available in devices in 2003, aimed to solve this problem. Wi-Fi access points typically default to an encryption-free (''open'') mode. Novice users benefit from a zero-configuration device that works out-of-the-box, but this default does not enable any [[wireless security#Counteracting risks|wireless security]], providing open wireless access to a LAN. To turn security on requires the user to configure the device, usually via a software [[graphical user interface]] (GUI). On unencrypted Wi-Fi networks connecting devices can monitor and record data (including personal information). Such networks can only be secured by using other means of protection, such as a [[virtual private network|VPN]] or secure [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] over [[Transport Layer Security]] ([[HTTPS]]).\n\nWi-Fi Protected Access encryption (WPA2) is considered secure, provided a strong [[passphrase]] is used.

Indeed, many access points are intentionally installed without security turned on so that they can be used as a free service. Providing access to one's Internet connection in this fashion may breach the Terms of Service or contract with the [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. These activities do not result in sanctions in most jurisdictions; however, legislation and [[case law]] differ considerably across the world. A proposal to leave [[graffiti]] describing available services was called [[warchalking]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|title=Let's Warchalk|last=Jones|first=Matt|date=2002-06-24|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705034313/http://www.blackbeltjones.com/warchalking/warchalking0_9.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-05|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-10-09}}</ref>\n\nPiggybacking often occurs unintentionally&nbsp;\u2013 a technically unfamiliar user might not change the default \"unsecured\" settings to their access point and operating systems can be configured to connect automatically to any available wireless network. A user who happens to start up a laptop in the vicinity of an access point may find the computer has joined the network without any visible indication. Moreover, a user intending to join one network may instead end up on another one if the latter has a stronger signal. In combination with automatic discovery of other network resources (see [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] and [[Zero configuration networking|Zeroconf]]) this could possibly lead wireless users to send sensitive data to the wrong middle-man when seeking a destination (see [[man-in-the-middle attack]]). For example, a user could inadvertently use an unsecure network to log into a [[website]], thereby making the login credentials available to anyone listening, if the website uses an unsecure protocol such as plain [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] without [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]].\n\nAn unauthorized user can obtain security information (factory preset passphrase and/or Wi-Fi Protected Setup PIN) from a label on a wireless access point can use this information (or connect by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup pushbutton method) to commit unauthorized and/or unlawful activities.\n\n== Health concerns ==\n{{Further|Wireless electronic devices and health}}\nThe [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) says, \"no health effects are expected from exposure to RF fields from base stations and wireless networks\", but notes that they promote research into effects from other RF sources.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs304/en/\n |title       = Electromagnetic fields and public health -
