It was designed and built by Sonoma County luthier Doug Irwin. After the instrument was commissioned by Garcia in 1973 following delivery of Wolf (his first major Irwin guitar),  Throughout the design and construction process, it was provisionally designated \"the Garcia\". Upon commissioning the instrument, Garcia enjoined Irwin to \"make it the way he thought was best, and don't hold back.\"<ref>http://jerrygarcia.com/guitars/</ref>\n\nThe Tiger is named after the [[tiger]] inlaid on the preamp cover located on the guitar's top, just behind the tailpiece. The body features several layers of wood laminated together face-to-face in a configuration referred to as a \"hippie sandwich\" by employees of [[Alembic Inc]]., where Irwin worked for a brief period in the early 1970s. The combination of several heavy varieties of wood, plus solid brass binding and hardware resulted in an unusually heavy instrument, weighing {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. After Garcia began using a new Irwin guitar (known as Rosebud) in December 1989, Tiger became his backup guitar. Due to a problem with Rosebud during the [[Grateful Dead]] concert on July 9, 1995, Tiger was the last guitar Garcia played publicly.\n<div style=\"float:right;\">\n[[File:Jerry Garcia's Rosebud.jpg|thumb|120px|'''Rosebud''', a guitar similar to '''Tiger''']]</div>\n\n==Electronics==\nThe electronics of Garcia's Irwin guitars are unique, and feature an onboard preamp and effects loop. Much like a [[Stratocaster]], the three pickups are selected with a five-way switch.  Signal from the pickups passes through the tone controls, followed by an op-amp based buffer preamp, or unity gain buffer, which is designed to prevent signal loss due to capacitance when long cables are used. From the preamp, the signal could be routed via a mini-toggle on the guitar's face to pass through a Y-cable to Garcia's effects rack, and then back into the guitar.  This onboard effects loop serves to send the full output of Tiger's pickups to the effects while allowing the guitar's volume control to vary the final output.\n\nThe effects loop could be bypassed by the aforementioned switch, sending the guitar's signal from the preamp to the volume control, and then out to Garcia's preamped (and heavily modified) [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Twin Reverb]] into a [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]] MC2300 solid state power amplifier. Tiger started with [[DiMarzio]] Dual Sound [[humbucker]]s in the middle and bridge positions with a DiMarzio SDS-1 [[single coil]] at the neck. The humbuckers were switched to Dimarzio Super II's in 1982. Each of the humbuckers is equipped with a coil cut switch.\n\nIn summation, there is one 5 way pickup selector, one master volume control, one tone control which affects the neck and bridge pickups, and one which affects the middle pickup as well as three mini toggles, two for the coil-cut of the bridge and middle pickups respectively and one for the on-board effects loop on/off.\n\n==Disposition==\nAfter Garcia's death, a dispute arose between Irwin and the Grateful Dead regarding ownership of Garcia's Irwin guitars. In his will, Garcia gave possession of these instruments to Irwin; the Grateful Dead challenged whether Garcia had the right to convey title and insisted that the band owned the instruments. The parties reached a settlement where Irwin was awarded Garcia's more famous instruments, and the Grateful Dead took possession of the majority of the guitars.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Selvin |date=November 6, 2001 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Strings-of-gold-There-was-something-special-2860635.php |title=Strings of Gold: There Was Something Special about Doug Irwin's Guitars, and Jerry Garcia Knew What It Was |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> Irwin sold his most enduring guitars, Tiger and Wolf, at auction on May 8, 2002.

It was designed and built by Sonoma County luthier Doug Irwin. After the instrument was commissioned by Garcia in 1973 following delivery of Wolf (his first major Irwin guitar),  Throughout the design and construction process, it was provisionally designated \"the Garcia\". Upon commissioning the instrument, Garcia enjoined Irwin to \"make it the way he thought was best, and don't hold back.\"<ref>http://jerrygarcia.com/guitars/</ref>\n\nThe Tiger is named after the [[tiger]] inlaid on the preamp cover located on the guitar's top, just behind the tailpiece. The body features several layers of wood laminated together face-to-face in a configuration referred to as a \"hippie sandwich\" by employees of [[Alembic Inc]]., where Irwin worked for a brief period in the early 1970s. The combination of several heavy varieties of wood, plus solid brass binding and hardware resulted in an unusually heavy instrument, weighing {{convert|13+1/2|lb|kg}}. After Garcia began using a new Irwin guitar (known as Rosebud) in December 1989, Tiger became his backup guitar. Due to a problem with Rosebud during the [[Grateful Dead]] concert on July 9, 1995, Tiger was the last guitar Garcia played publicly.\n<div style=\"float:right;\">\n[[File:Jerry Garcia's Rosebud.jpg|thumb|120px|'''Rosebud''', a guitar similar to '''Tiger''']]</div>\n\n==Electronics==\nThe electronics of Garcia's Irwin guitars are unique, and feature an onboard preamp and effects loop. Much like a [[Stratocaster]], the three pickups are selected with a five-way switch.  Signal from the pickups passes through the tone controls, followed by an op-amp based buffer preamp, or unity gain buffer, which is designed to prevent signal loss due to capacitance when long cables are used. From the preamp, the signal could be routed via a mini-toggle on the guitar's face to pass through a Y-cable to Garcia's effects rack, and then back into the guitar.  This onboard effects loop serves to send the full output of Tiger's pickups to the effects while allowing the guitar's volume control to vary the final output. The effects loop could be bypassed by the aforementioned switch, sending the guitar's signal from the preamp to the volume control, and then out to Garcia's preamped (and heavily modified) [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Twin Reverb]] into a [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]] MC2300 solid state power amplifier. Tiger started with [[DiMarzio]] Dual Sound [[humbucker]]s in the middle and bridge positions with a DiMarzio SDS-1 [[single coil]] at the neck. The humbuckers were switched to Dimarzio Super II's in 1982. Each of the humbuckers is equipped with a coil cut switch. In summation, there is one 5 way pickup selector, one master volume control, one tone control which affects the neck and bridge pickups, and one which affects the middle pickup as well as three mini toggles, two for the coil-cut of the bridge and middle pickups respectively and one for the on-board effects loop on/off.\n\n==Disposition==\nAfter Garcia's death, a dispute arose between Irwin and the Grateful Dead regarding ownership of Garcia's Irwin guitars. In his will, Garcia gave possession of these instruments to Irwin; the Grateful Dead challenged whether Garcia had the right to convey title and insisted that the band owned the instruments. The parties reached a settlement where Irwin was awarded Garcia's more famous instruments, and the Grateful Dead took possession of the majority of the guitars.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Selvin |date=November 6, 2001 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Strings-of-gold-There-was-something-special-2860635.php |title=Strings of Gold: There Was Something Special about Doug Irwin's Guitars, and Jerry Garcia Knew What It Was |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=June 4, 2017}}</ref> Irwin sold his most enduring guitars, Tiger and Wolf, at auction on May 8, 2002.

These dialects are taught in Manipur schools, however, those outside the school, such as elders, are less familiar with them. The Saimar dialect<ref>Albrecht Klose, 2001.

The Thadou people were settled in dense jungle sites. The Thadou villages mostly cultivated agriculture and domesticated animals. A unique aspect of the Thadou culture is that men and women shared these cultivation and domestication responsibilities.\n\nKnowing a language connects one to the culture and traditions of the speakers of the language. This was especially the case with the Thadou language. Four important words in this language: ''chongmou, sahapsat, jol-lha','' and ''kijam mang.'' These terms represent four different forms of marriage. ''Chongmou'' represents the form of marriage where there is a negotiation price of the bride between the parents of the groom as well as the parents of the bride, along with feasting and wrestling. The ''sahapsat'' is a form of marriage where just the negotiation between the parents of the bride and groom take place. The ''jol-Iha' and kijam mang'' both are similar forms of marriage, equivalent to eloping. Divorce is allowed and happens often within this culture. Children have a lot of independence in this culture and are encouraged to learn through experience including parental guidance as a stepping stone.\n\nThadou people consider Pathen the god who has created everything and is thus, the ruler of the universe. They pray to him in times of need and trouble. This culture is very into religious ceremonies. Many of their ceremonies are specific to individual groups or genders. In earlier times, the Thadou also believe in spirits moving on to Mithikho, which is the village of the dead. As time passed by most of the Thadou people embraced Christianity.\n\n==Geographical distribution  ==\n\nThadou is spoken in the following locations (''[[Ethnologue]]'').\n\n*[[Northeast India]]\n**[[Manipur]]\n***[[Chandel district]]\n***[[Churachandpur district]]\n***[[Senapati district]]\n**[[Assam]]\n**[[Karbi Anglong district|Karbi Anglong]] (Mikil Hills)\n**NC hills ([[Dima Hasao district|Dima Hasoa]])\n**Northeastern [[Mizoram]]\n**Metnathol Sielphai\n**[[Nagaland]]\n***[[Peren district]]\n***[[Dimapur district]]\n**[[Tripura]]\n*[[Myanmar]]\n**[[Sagaing Division]] (including [[Tamu, Myanmar|Tamu]])\n**[[Chin State]]\n\n==Dialects==\n''Ethnologue'' lists the following dialects of Thadou, the names of which mostly correspond to clan names.

Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''' of real or complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally  identified with the set of all possible [[infinite sequence]]s with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].\n\nThe most important sequence spaces in analysis are the \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like [[convergent sequence]]s or [[Sequence space#c, c0 and c00|null sequences]] form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''<sub>0</sub>, with the [[Supremum norm|sup norm]]. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] called [[FK-space]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nLet '''K''' denote the field either of real or complex numbers.  Denote by '''K'''<sup>'''N'''</sup> the set of all sequences of scalars\n:<math>(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}},\\quad x_n\\in\\mathbf{K}.</math>\nThis can be turned into a [[vector space]] by defining [[vector addition]] as\n:<math>(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}} + (y_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}} \\stackrel{\\rm{def}}{=} (x_n + y_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}}</math>\nand the [[scalar multiplication]] as\n:<math>\\alpha(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}} := (\\alpha x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}}.</math>\nA '''sequence space''' is any linear subspace of '''K'''<sup>'''N'''</sup>.\n\n=== \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> spaces===\n{{see also|Lp space{{!}}L<sup>p</sup> space|L-infinity}}\nFor 0 < ''p'' < \u221e, \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is the subspace of '''K'''<sup>'''N'''</sup> consisting of all sequences ''x'' = ('''x'''<sub>''n''</sub>) satisfying\n:<math>\\sum_n |x_n|^p < \\infty.</math>\nIf ''p'' \u2265 1, then the real-valued operation <math>\\|\\cdot\\|_p</math> defined by\n:<math>\\|x\\|_p = \\left(\\sum_n|x_n|^p\\right)^{1/p}</math>\ndefines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on \u2113<sup>''p''</sup>.  In fact, \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is a [[complete metric space]] with respect to this norm, and therefore is a [[Banach space]].\n\nIf 0 < ''p'' < 1, then \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> does not carry a norm, but rather a [[metric space|metric]] defined by\n:<math>d(x,y) = \\sum_n |x_n-y_n|^p.\\,</math>\n\nIf ''p'' = \u221e, then \u2113<sup>\u221e</sup> is defined to be the space of all bounded sequences.  With respect to the norm\n:<math>\\|x\\|_\\infty = \\sup_n |x_n|,</math>\n\u2113<sup>\u221e</sup> is also a Banach space.\n\n===''c'', ''c''<sub>0</sub> and  ''c''<sub>00</sub>===\nThe space of [[Limit of a sequence|convergent sequence]]s ''c'' is a sequence space.  This consists of all ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''K'''<sup>'''N'''</sup> such that lim<sub>''n''\u2192\u221e</sub>''x''<sub>''n''</sub> exists.  Since every convergent sequence is bounded, ''c'' is a linear subspace of \u2113<sup>\u221e</sup>.  It is, moreover, a closed subspace with respect to the infinity norm, and so a Banach space in its own right.\n\nThe subspace of null sequences ''c''<sub>0</sub> consists of all sequences whose limit is zero.  This is a closed subspace of ''c'', and so again a Banach space.\n\nThe subspace of eventually zero sequences ''c''<sub>00</sub> consists of all sequences which have only finitely many nonzero elements. This is not a closed subspace and therefore is not a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. For example, the sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) where ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> has 1/''k'' for the first ''n'' entries and is zero everywhere else (i.e. ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = (1, 1/2, ..., 1/''n'', 0, ...)) is Cauchy w.r.t. infinity norm but not convergent (to a sequence in ''c''<sub>00</sub>).\n\n===Other sequence spaces===\nThe space of bounded [[series (mathematics)|series]], denote by [[Bs_space|bs]], is the space of sequences ''x'' for which\n:<math>\\sup_n \\left\\vert \\sum_{i=0}^n x_i \\right\\vert < \\infty.</math>\nThis space, when equipped with the norm\n:<math>\\|x\\|_{bs} = \\sup_n \\left\\vert \\sum_{i=0}^n x_i \\right\\vert,</math>\nis a Banach space isometrically isomorphic to \u2113<sup>\u221e</sup>, via the linear mapping\n:<math>(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}} \\mapsto \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^n x_i\\right)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}}.</math>\nThe subspace ''cs'' consisting of all convergent series is a subspace that goes over to the space ''c'' under this isomorphism.\n\nThe space \u03a6 or <math>c_{00}</math> is defined to be the space of all infinite sequences with only a finite number of non-zero terms (sequences with [[finite support]]).  This set is [[dense set|dense]] in many sequence spaces.\n\n== Properties of \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> spaces and the space ''c''<sub>0</sub> ==\n{{see also|c space}}\nThe space \u2113<sup>2</sup> is the only \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> space that is a [[Hilbert space]], since any norm that is induced by an inner product should satisfy the [[parallelogram law]]\n\n:<math>\\|x+y\\|_p^2 + \\|x-y\\|_p^2= 2\\|x\\|_p^2 + 2\\|y\\|_p^2.</math>\n\nSubstituting two distinct unit vectors for ''x'' and ''y'' directly shows that the identity is not true unless ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.\n\nEach \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is distinct, in that \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is a strict subset of \u2113<sup>''s''</sup> whenever ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''s''; furthermore, \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is not linearly [[isomorphic]] to \u2113<sup>''s''</sup> when&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''s''.  In fact, by Pitt's theorem {{harv|Pitt|1936}}, every bounded linear operator from \u2113<sup>''s''</sup> to \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is [[Compact operator|compact]] when ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''s''.  No such operator can be an isomorphism; and further, it cannot be an isomorphism on any infinite-dimensional subspace of \u2113<sup>''s''</sup>, and is thus said to be [[strictly singular]].\n\nIf 1&nbsp;< ''p''&nbsp;< \u221e, then the [[dual space|(continuous) dual space]] of \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> is isometrically isomorphic to \u2113<sup>''q''</sup>, where ''q'' is the [[H\u00f6lder conjugate]] of ''p'': 1/''p''&nbsp;+ 1/''q''&nbsp;= 1.  The specific isomorphism associates to an element ''x'' of \u2113<sup>''q''</sup> the functional\n:<math>L_x(y) = \\sum_n x_ny_n</math>\nfor ''y'' in \u2113<sup>''p''</sup>.  [[H\u00f6lder's inequality]] implies that ''L''<sub>''x''</sub> is a bounded linear functional on \u2113<sup>''p''</sup>, and in fact\n:<math>|L_x(y)| \\le \\|x\\|_q\\,\\|y\\|_p</math>\nso that the operator norm satisfies\n:<math>\\|L_x\\|_{(\\ell^p)^*} \\stackrel{\\rm{def}}{=}\\sup_{y\\in\\ell^p, y\\not=0} \\frac{|L_x(y)|}{\\|y\\|_p} \\le \\|x\\|_q.</math>\nIn fact, taking ''y'' to be the element of \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> with\n:<math>y_n = \\begin{cases}0&\\rm{if}\\ x_n=0\\\\\nx_n^{-1}|x_n|^q &\\rm{if}\\ x_n\\not=0\n\\end{cases}</math>\ngives ''L''<sub>''x''</sub>(''y'') = ||''x''||<sub>''q''</sub>, so that in fact\n:<math>\\|L_x\\|_{(\\ell^p)^*} = \\|x\\|_q.</math>\nConversely, given a bounded linear functional ''L'' on \u2113<sup>''p''</sup>, the sequence defined by ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= ''L''(''e''<sub>''n''</sub>) lies in \u2113<sup>''q''</sup>.  Thus the mapping <math>x\\mapsto L_x</math> gives an isometry\n:<math>\\kappa_q : \\ell^q \\to (\\ell^p)^*.</math>\n\nThe map\n:<math>\\ell^q\\xrightarrow{\\kappa_q}(\\ell^p)^*\\xrightarrow{(\\kappa_q^*)^{-1}}</math>\nobtained by composing \u03ba<sub>''p''</sub> with the inverse of its [[Dual space#Transpose of a continuous linear map|transpose]] coincides with the [[Reflexive space#Definitions|canonical injection]] of \u2113<sup>''q''</sup> into its [[double dual]].  As a consequence \u2113<sup>''q''</sup> is a [[reflexive space]].

Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''' of real or complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally  identified with the set of all possible [[infinite sequence]]s with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].\n\nThe most important sequence spaces in analysis are the \u2113<sup>''p''</sup> spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like [[convergent sequence]]s or [[Sequence space#c, c0 and c00|null sequences]] form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''<sub>0</sub>, with the [[Supremum norm|sup norm]]. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fr\u00e9chet space]] called [[FK-space]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nLet '''K''' denote the field either of real or complex numbers.

This consists of all ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;'''K'''<sup>'''N'''</sup> such that lim<sub>''n''\u2192\u221e</sub>''x''<sub>''n''</sub> exists.  Since every convergent sequence is bounded, ''c'' is a linear subspace of \u2113<sup>\u221e</sup>.  It is, moreover, a closed subspace with respect to the infinity norm, and so a Banach space in its own right.\n\nThe subspace of null sequences ''c''<sub>0</sub> consists of all sequences whose limit is zero.  This is a closed subspace of ''c'', and so again a Banach space.\n\nThe subspace of eventually zero sequences ''c''<sub>00</sub> consists of all sequences which have only finitely many nonzero elements. This is not a closed subspace and therefore is not a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. For example, the sequence (''x''<sub>n</sub>) where ''x''<sub>n</sub> has 1/k for the first n entries and is zero everywhere else (i.e. ''x''<sub>n</sub> = (1, 1/2, ..., 1/n, 0, ...)) is Cauchy w.r.t. infinity norm but not convergent (to a sequence in ''c''<sub>00</sub>).\n\n===Other sequence spaces===\nThe space of bounded [[series (mathematics)|series]], denote by [[Bs_space|bs]], is the space of sequences ''x'' for which\n:<math>\\sup_n \\left\\vert \\sum_{i=0}^n x_i \\right\\vert < \\infty.</math>\nThis space, when equipped with the norm\n:<math>\\|x\\|_{bs} = \\sup_n \\left\\vert \\sum_{i=0}^n x_i \\right\\vert,</math>\nis a Banach space isometrically isomorphic to \u2113<sup>\u221e</sup>, via the linear mapping\n:<math>(x_n)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}} \\mapsto \\left(\\sum_{i=0}^n x_i\\right)_{n\\in\\mathbf{N}}.</math>\nThe subspace ''cs'' consisting of all convergent series is a subspace that goes over to the space ''c'' under this isomorphism.\n\nThe space \u03a6 or <math>c_{00}</math> is defined to be the space of all infinite sequences with only a finite number of non-zero terms (sequences with [[finite support]]).

The authors of the JD-R model argue that these models \"have been restricted to a given and limited set of predictor variables that may not be relevant for all job positions\" (p.&nbsp;309)<ref name=\"auto\"/> Therefore, the JD-R incorporates a wide range of working conditions into the analyses of organizations and employees. Furthermore, instead of focusing solely on negative outcome variables (e.g., burnout, ill health, and repetitive strain) the JD-R model includes both negative and positive indicators and outcomes of employee well-being.\n\n== Basic assumptions ==\nThe JD-R model can be summarized with a short list of assumptions/premises:<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = A.B. | last2 = Demerouti | first2 = E. | last3 = De Boer | first3 = E. | last4 = Schaufeli | first4 = W.B. | year = 2003b | title = Job demands and job resources as predictors of absence duration and frequency | url = | journal = Journal of Vocational Behavior | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 341\u201356 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = A.B. | last2 = Demerouti | first2 = E. | last3 = Taris | first3 = T. | last4 = Schaufeli | first4 = W.B. | last5 = Schreurs | first5 = P. | year = 2003c | title = A multi-group analysis of the Job Demands-Resources model in four home care organizations | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 16\u201338 }}</ref>\n\n* Whereas every occupation may have its own specific risk factors associated with job stress, these factors can be classified in two general categories: job demands and job resources.\n** '''Job demands''': physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job, that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills. Therefore, they are associated with certain physiological and/or psychological costs. Examples are, work pressure, emotional demands.\n** '''Job resources:''' physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either or: functional in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological cost; stimulate personal growth, learning, and development. Examples are, career opportunities, supervisor coaching, role-clarity, and autonomy.\n*** '''Workplace Resources vs. Personal Resources:''' The authors of the JD-R make a distinction between workplace resources and personal resources\n* Two different underlying psychological processes play a role in the development of job strain and motivation.<ref name=\"Huang 562\u2013569\">{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jie|last2=Wang|first2=Yansong|last3=You|first3=Xuqun|date=2016-12-01|title=The Job Demands-Resources Model and Job Burnout: The Mediating Role of Personal Resources|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=562\u2013569|doi=10.1007/s12144-015-9321-2|issn=1046-1310}}</ref> The first are physical and social resources available in the workplace setting. The latter, personal resources, are those the employee brings with them. These consist of specific personality traits: self-efficacy and optimism.<ref name=\"Huang 562\u2013569\"/> Both types of resources are powerful mediators of employee well-being (e.g. engagement).<ref name=\"Huang 562\u2013569\"/>\n* '''Outcomes of Continued Job Strain'''\n** Health impairment process: through this process, poorly designed jobs or chronic job demands exhaust employees' mental and physical resources. In turn, this might lead to the depletion of energy and to health problems.\n* '''Outcomes of Abundant Job and Personal Resources'''\n** Motivational process: through this process, job resources exert their motivating potential and lead to high work engagement, low cynicism, and excellent performance. Job resources may play either an intrinsic or an extrinsic motivational role.\n* The interaction between job demands and job resources is important for the development of job strain and motivation as well. According to the JD-R model, job resources may buffer the effect of job demands on job strain, including burnout.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Which specific job resources buffer the effect of different job demands, depends on the particular work environment. Thus, different types of job demands and job resources may interact in predicting job strain. Good examples of job resources that have the potential of buffering job demands are performance feedback and social support (e.g.,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Haines | first1 = V.A. | last2 = Hurlbert | first2 = J.S. | last3 = Zimmer | first3 = C. | year = 1991 | title = Occupational stress, social support, and the buffer hypothesis | url = | journal = Work and Occupations | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 212\u201335 }}</ref>).\n* Job resources particularly influence motivation or work engagement when job demands are high. This assumption is based on the premises of the conservation of resources (COR) theory.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hobfoll | first1 = S.E. | year = 2001 | title = The influence of culture, community, and the nested-self in the stress process: advancing conservation of resources theory | url = | journal = Applied Psychology: An International Review | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 337\u201370 }}</ref> According to this theory, people are motivated to obtain, retain and protect their resources, because they are valuable. Hobfoll (<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hobfoll | first1 = S.E. | year = 2002 | title = Social and psychological resources and adaptation | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 307\u201324 }}</ref>) argues that resource gain acquires its saliency in the context of resource loss. This implies that job resources gain their motivational potential particularly when employees are confronted with high job demands. For example, when employees are faced with high emotional demands, the social support of colleagues might become more visible and more instrumental.\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n*Evidence for the dual process: a number of studies have supported the dual pathways to employee well being proposed by the JD-R model. It has been shown that the model can predict important organizational outcomes (e.g.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = A.B. | last2 = Demerouti | first2 = E. | last3 = Schaufeli | first3 = W.B. | year = 2003a | title = Dual processes at work in a call centre: an application of the Job Demands-Resources model | url = | journal = European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 393\u2013417 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hakanen | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Schaufeli | first3 = W.B. | year = 2006 | title = Burnout and work engagement among teachers | url = | journal = Journal of School Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 495\u2013513 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> Taken together, research findings support the JD-R model's claim that job demands and job resources initiate two different psychological processes, which eventually affect important organizational outcomes (see also,<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schaufeli | first1 = W.B. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.B. | year = 2004 | title = Job demands, job resources, and their relationship with burnout and engagement: a multi-sample study | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 293\u2013315 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schaufeli | first1 = W.B. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Van Rhenen | first3 = W. | year = 2009 | title = How changes in job demands and resources predict burnout, work engagement, and sickness absenteeism | url = | journal = Journal of Organizational Behavior | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 893\u2013917 }}</ref>). When both job demands and resources are high, high strain and motivation is to be expected. When both are low, absence of strain and motivation is to be expected. Consequently, the high demands-low resources condition should result in high strain and low motivation while the low demands-high resources condition should have as a consequence low strain and high motivation.\n*Evidence for the buffer effect of job resources: some support has been obtained for the proposed interaction between job demands and job resources in their relationship with employee well being (see,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = A.B. | last2 = Demerouti | first2 = E. | last3 = Euwema | first3 = M.C. | year = 2005 | title = Job resources buffer the effect of job demands on burnout | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 170\u201380 }}</ref><ref>Xanthopoulou, D., Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2006), \"The role of personal resources in the job demands-resources model\", manuscript submitted for publication.</ref>). However, most published studies on the model did either not examine or not report such interactions, whereas the practical relevance of this interaction \u2013 if present \u2013 is usually small. In a large-scale study, it was found that this interaction accounted for on average only 0.5% of the differences among workers in task enjoyment and work commitment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = A.B. | last2 = Van Veldhoven | first2 = M. | last3 = Xanthopoulou | first3 = D. | year = 2010 | title = Beyond the Demand-Control model: Thriving on high job demands and resources | url = | journal = Journal of Personnel Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3\u201316 }}</ref>\n*Evidence for the salience of job resources in the context of high job demands: one previous study outside the framework of the JD-R model has supported the hypothesis that resources gain their salience in the context of high demands (see.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Billings | first1 = D.W. | last2 = Folkman | first2 = S. | last3 = Acree | first3 = M. | last4 = Moskowitz | first4 = J.T. | year = 2000 | title = Coping and physical health during care-giving: the roles of positive and negative affect | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 131\u201342 }}</ref>) Studies using the JD-R model have shown that job resources particularly affect work engagement when job demands are high (see <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hakanen | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Bakker | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Demerouti | first3 = E. | year = 2005 | title = How dentists cope with their job demands and stay engaged: the moderating role of job resources | url = | journal = European Journal of Oral Sciences | volume = 113 | issue = | pages = 479\u201387 }}</ref>); and <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bakker | first1 = A.B. | last2 = Hakanen | first2 = J.J. | last3 = Demerouti | first3 = E. | last4 = Xanthopoulou | first4 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Job resources boost work engagement, particularly when job demands are high | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 274\u2013284 }}</ref>).\n\n== Practical implications ==\nThe JD-R model assumes that whereas every occupation may have its own specific working characteristics, these characteristics can be classified in two general categories (i.e. job demands and job resources), thus constituting an overarching model that may be applied to various occupational settings, irrespective of the particular demands and resources involved. The central assumption of the JD-R model is that job strain develops \u2013 irrespective of the type of job or occupation \u2013 when (certain) job demands are high and when (certain) job resources are limited. In contrast, work engagement is most likely when job resources are high (also in the face of high job demands). This implies that the JD-R model can be used as a tool for human resource management.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Continuing Research ==\nThe most recent article written by the authors of the original JD-R paper proposes that the interactions of demands and resources are nuanced and not clearly understood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Arnold|date=10 October 2016|title=Job Demands\u2013Resources Theory: Taking Stock and Looking Forward|journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|volume=|pages=|id={{ProQuest|1826808940}}}}</ref> Here Bakker and Demerouti suggest that demands may sometimes actually have a positive influence on the employee, by providing a challenge to be overcome rather than an insurmountable obstacle.

(2001a), \"The job demands-resources model of burnout\", Journal of Applied Psychology, Vol. 86, pp. 499\u2013512.</ref>\n\nThe JD-R was introduced as an alternative to other models of employee well-being, such as the [[Occupational health psychology#Demand-control model|demand-control model]] and the [[Occupational health psychology#Effort-reward imbalance model|effort-reward imbalance model]]. The authors of the JD-R model argue that these models \"have been restricted to a given and limited set of predictor variables that may not be relevant for all job positions\" (p.&nbsp;309)<ref name=\"auto\"/> Therefore, the JD-R incorporates a wide range of working conditions into the analyses of organizations and employees. Furthermore, instead of focusing solely on negative outcome variables (e.g., burnout, ill health, and repetitive strain) the JD-R model includes both negative and positive indicators and outcomes of employee well-being.\n\n== Basic assumptions ==\nThe JD-R model can be summarized with a short list of assumptions/premises:<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., De Boer, E. and Schaufeli, W.B. (2003b), \"Job demands and job resources as predictors of absence duration and frequency\", Journal of Vocational Behavior, Vol. 62, pp. 341\u201356</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., Taris, T., Schaufeli, W.B. and Schreurs, P. (2003c), \"A multi-group analysis of the Job Demands-Resources model in four home care organizations\", International Journal of Stress Management, Vol. 10, pp. 16\u201338</ref>\n\n* Whereas every occupation may have its own specific risk factors associated with job stress, these factors can be classified in two general categories: job demands and job resources.\n** '''Job demands''': physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job, that require sustained physical and/or psychological effort or skills. Therefore, they are associated with certain physiological and/or psychological costs. Examples are, work pressure, emotional demands.\n** '''Job resources:''' physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects of the job that are either or: functional in achieving work goals; reduce job demands and the associated physiological and psychological cost; stimulate personal growth, learning, and development. Examples are, career opportunities, supervisor coaching, role-clarity, and autonomy.\n*** '''Workplace Resources vs. Personal Resources:''' The authors of the JD-R make a distinction between workplace resources and personal resources\n* Two different underlying psychological processes play a role in the development of job strain and motivation.<ref name=\"Huang 562\u2013569\">{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jie|last2=Wang|first2=Yansong|last3=You|first3=Xuqun|date=2016-12-01|title=The Job Demands-Resources Model and Job Burnout: The Mediating Role of Personal Resources|journal=Current Psychology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=562\u2013569|doi=10.1007/s12144-015-9321-2|issn=1046-1310}}</ref> The first are physical and social resources available in the workplace setting. The latter, personal resources, are those the employee brings with them. These consist of specific personality traits: self-efficacy and optimism.<ref name=\"Huang 562\u2013569\"/> Both types of resources are powerful mediators of employee well-being (e.g. engagement).<ref name=\"Huang 562\u2013569\"/>\n* '''Outcomes of Continued Job Strain'''\n** Health impairment process: through this process, poorly designed jobs or chronic job demands exhaust employees' mental and physical resources. In turn, this might lead to the depletion of energy and to health problems.\n* '''Outcomes of Abundant Job and Personal Resources'''\n** Motivational process: through this process, job resources exert their motivating potential and lead to high work engagement, low cynicism, and excellent performance. Job resources may play either an intrinsic or an extrinsic motivational role.\n* The interaction between job demands and job resources is important for the development of job strain and motivation as well. According to the JD-R model, job resources may buffer the effect of job demands on job strain, including burnout.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Which specific job resources buffer the effect of different job demands, depends on the particular work environment. Thus, different types of job demands and job resources may interact in predicting job strain. Good examples of job resources that have the potential of buffering job demands are performance feedback and social support (e.g.,<ref>Haines, V.A., Hurlbert, J.S. and Zimmer, C. (1991), \"Occupational stress, social support, and the buffer hypothesis\", Work and Occupations, Vol. 18, pp. 212\u201335.</ref>).\n* Job resources particularly influence motivation or work engagement when job demands are high. This assumption is based on the premises of the conservation of resources (COR) theory.<ref>Hobfoll, S.E. (2001), \"The influence of culture, community, and the nested-self in the stress process: advancing conservation of resources theory\", Applied Psychology: An International Review, Vol. 50, pp. 337\u201370</ref> According to this theory, people are motivated to obtain, retain and protect their resources, because they are valuable. Hobfoll (<ref>Hobfoll, S.E. (2002), \"Social and psychological resources and adaptation\", Review of General Psychology, Vol. 6, pp. 307\u201324.</ref>) argues that resource gain acquires its saliency in the context of resource loss. This implies that job resources gain their motivational potential particularly when employees are confronted with high job demands. For example, when employees are faced with high emotional demands, the social support of colleagues might become more visible and more instrumental.\n\n== Evidence ==\n\n*Evidence for the dual process: a number of studies have supported the dual pathways to employee well being proposed by the JD-R model.

(2006), \"Burnout and work engagement among teachers\", Journal of School Psychology, Vol. 43, pp. 495\u2013513</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/> Taken together, research findings support the JD-R model's claim that job demands and job resources initiate two different psychological processes, which eventually affect important organizational outcomes (see also,<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref>Schaufeli, W.B. and Bakker, A.B.

The abbey moved to the site now occupied by Syon House in 1431. It was one of the wealthiest nunneries in the country and a local legend recites that the monks of [[Sheen Priory|Sheen]] had a [[ley tunnel]] running to the nunnery at Syon.<ref name=\"Westwood6\">Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books, London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. p. 126.</ref> In 1539, the abbey was closed by royal agents during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and the monastic community was expelled.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Syon Park:History |series=Syon Park:The London Home of the Duke of Northumberland |postscript= <!--None--> }}</ref>\n\nOn the closure of the abbey on the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] Syon became the property of the Crown for a short time before long lease to the [[1st Duke of Somerset]], who had the site rebuilt as Syon House in the Italian Renaissance style before his death in 1552. In 1541 and part of the following year Henry VIII's fifth wife [[Catherine Howard]] faced her long imprisonment at Syon. In February 1542, the King's men took her to the [[Tower of London]] and executed her on charges of adultery. Five years later when King Henry VIII died, his coffin surmounted by jewelled effigy rested at Syon House for its one night rest before the procession reached his burial place in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]].\n\nIn 1557 it was proposed to convert the new building to the earlier Catholic use but [[Elizabeth I of England]] acceded to the throne before this change was effected. Syon was acquired in 1594 by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] (1564\u20131632) since when it has remained in his family.<ref name=\"Holmes 1991 181\u2013208\">{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Nancy|title=Noble House: Three Generations of Percys Enjoy Robert Adam's Neoclassical Grandeur|journal=House and Garden|year=1991|volume=163|issue=4|pages=181\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 17th century, Syon was in the possession of [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset]], through his wife, [[Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Elizabeth Seymour (n\u00e9e Percy)]]. After the future [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] had a disagreement with her sister, Mary II (wife of William III, also known as William of Orange), over her friendship with [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill, Countess of Marlborough]], Queen Mary [[Eviction|evicted]] Princess Anne from her court residence at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] and [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]].  Princess Anne came to live at Syon with her close friends, the Somersets, in 1692. Anne gave birth to a stillborn child there. Shortly after the birth, Queen Mary came to visit her, again demanding that Anne dismiss the Countess of Marlborough and stormed out again when Anne flatly refused.\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], commissioned architect and [[interior design]]er [[Robert Adam]] and landscape designer [[Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown]] to redesign the house and estate. Work began on the interior reconstruction project in 1762. Five large rooms on the west, south and east sides of the House, were completed before work ceased in 1769. A central rotunda, which Adam had intended for the interior courtyard space, was not implemented, due to cost.<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=D. M. |title=The World's Greatest Architecture Past & Present |page=207}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Syon House was opened to the public for the first time under the 10th Duke and Duchess.  Later, in 1995 under the 12th Duke, the family rooms became open to the public as well.  As the Percy family continues to live there, they continue to enhance the house. Most recently the Duchess added a new central courtyard with the design of Marchioness of Salisbury.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\">{{cite journal|last=Musson|first=Jeremy|title=Syon House, Middlesex: A Seat of the Duke of Northumberland|journal=Country Life|date=2 November 2000|pages=94\u201399}}</ref>\n\nA \u00a3600K restoration was undertaken in late 2007, primarily involving work to the roof area.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Syon House Restoration |url=http://www.hprltd.co.uk/news.aspx?id=4 |date=12 November 2007 |publisher=Historic Property Restoration Ltd |access-date=21 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082552/http://www.hprltd.co.uk/news.aspx?id=4 |archive-date=25 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=McDonnell |first=Colleen |date=13 April 2008 |title=Historic Syon House open again after major works |url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/thechiswick/chiswicknews/2190171.historic_syon_house_open_again_after_major_works/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404163012/http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/thechiswick/chiswicknews/2190171.historic_syon_house_open_again_after_major_works/ |archive-date=4 April 2012 |work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] |location=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], UK |access-date=21 October 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>  In 2008 restoration work commenced on the Great Hall and a current long-term project is to restore the Adam Rooms.<ref name=\"Syon Park House 2011\">''Syon Park House & Gardens'' leaflet (2011)</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Syon Gateway and porters' lodges 1769 edited.jpg|thumb|300px|A design for a gateway and porters' lodges at Syon House by [[Robert Adam]], c. 1769]]\n[[File:Syon - proposal for a bridge.jpg|thumb|300px|Another design by Adam for a Bridge at Syon Park]]\nSyon House's exterior was erected in 1547 while under the ownership of the 1st Duke of Somerset.  Syon's current interior was designed by Robert Adam in 1762 under the commission of the 1st Duke and Duchess of Northumberland.\n\nThe well known \"Adam style\" is said to have begun with Syon House. It was commissioned to be built in the Neo-classical style, which was fulfilled, but Adam's eclectic style doesn't end there. Syon is filled with multiple styles and inspirations including a huge influence of Roman antiquity, highly visible Romantic, Picturesque, Baroque and Mannerist styles and a dash of Gothic. There is also evidence in his decorative motifs of his influence by Pompeii that he received while studying in Italy.<ref name=\"O'Connor 1987 183\u2013218\"/>  Adam's plan of Syon House included a complete set of rooms on the main floor, a domed rotunda with a circular inner colonnade meant for the main courtyard ('meant for' meaning that this rotunda was not built due to a lack of funds), five main rooms on the west, east and south side of the building, a pillared ante-room famous for its colour,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Syon House|journal=Country Life|date=21 May 1927|pages=795}}</ref> a Great Hall, a grand staircase (though not built as grand as originally designed) and a Long Gallery stretching 136 feet long.  Adam's most famous addition is the suite of state rooms and as such they remain exactly as they were built.\n\nMore specific to the interior of Adam's rooms is where the elaborate detail and colour shines through.  Adam added detailed marble chimneypieces, shuttering doors and doorways in the Drawing Room, along with fluted columns with Corinthian capitals.  The long gallery, which is about 14 feet high and 14 feet wide, contains many recesses and niches into the thick wall for books along with rich and light decoration and stucco-covered walls and ceiling.  At the end of the gallery is a closet with a domed circle supported by eight columns; halfway through the columns is a doorway imitating a niche.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\"/>\n\nIn the 1820s the north range of the house that was not completed by Adam was redesigned by the 3rd Duke. At this time the house was also refaced in Bath stone and the porch rebuilt.  This remodelling is thought to have been done by the architect Thomas Cady, who had worked on other estates belonging to the Percy family.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\"/>\n\nSyon House was refurbished again in the 1860s.  The 4th Duke had Renaissance-style plaster ceilings put into the Family Drawing Room, Family Dining Room and Print Room.<ref name=\"Holmes 1991 181\u2013208\"/>\n\nThe final plan of Syon House includes an entrance hall, ante-room, State Dining Room, State Drawing Room, Long Gallery, study, sitting room, Print Room, Family Drawing Room, Family Dining Room, private apartments on the top floor for the family to live in and a grand staircase.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\"/>\n\n== Syon Park ==\n{{main|Syon Park}}\n'''Syon Park''' borders the [[Thames]], looking across the river to [[Kew Gardens]] and near its banks is a tidal meadow flooded twice a day by the river. It contains more than 200 species of rare trees. Although the park and lake were designed by Capability Brown in 1760, their character today is nineteenth century. The circular pool has a copy of [[Giambologna]]'s Mercury.  The park and the house in the background  were painted from across the [[River Thames|Thames]] by [[J. M. W. Turner]] c. 1802\u20131810 in the painting ''Zion House, Isleworth'' and in two [[capriccio (art)|capriccio]]s in 1805.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-zion-house-isleworth-d08269 Tate Gallery ''Turner: Zion House, Isleworth''] Work reference:  D08269 Turner bequest CXXI M.

The conservatory appeared (as Heaven) in the original 1967 [[Dudley Moore]]\u2013[[Peter Cook]] version of ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'', having already featured prominently in [[John Boorman]]'s first feature film ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'' (1965, ostensibly a vehicle for the [[Dave Clark Five]]), was shown in a dream sequence in [[Meera Syal]]'s 1993 film ''[[Bhaji on the Beach]]'' and was also the setting for the music video to [[The Cure]]'s 1984 single \"[[The Caterpillar (song)|The Caterpillar]]\", directed by [[Tim Pope]]. Also for the music video of David Cassidy's 1973 single \"Daydreamer\".\n\n[[Henry Percy, 11th Duke of Northumberland]], who was head of the family from 1988 to 1995, was noted for planting many trees in the grounds of Syon.\n\nIn 2002, the English poet [[Geoffrey Hill]] released a booklength poem, ''The Orchards of Syon'', to much acclaim. ''The Orchards of Syon'' focuses on the history of the region and in particular on the orchard of rare trees first planted in Syon Abbey.\n\nThe [[London Butterfly House]] was based in the grounds of Syon Park from 1981 until its closure on 28 October 2007 due to the [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]]'s plans to build a hotel complex on the land. In 2004, planning permission was granted for the deluxe \u00a335-million Radisson Edwardian Hotel. In 2011, the Syon Park Waldorf Astoria hotel opened on the site. The hotel was renamed to the Hilton London Syon Park in 2013.<ref name=\"edbrown\">{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Ed | author2 = McGrath, Martin | author3 = Davis, Matt | title = So Crosse As Butterflies Head North | publisher = News Associates | url = http://www.journalism-courses.com/Archive.aspx?Type=&ID=ebd7f936-446d-494f-ac99-2794462e4179 | access-date = 18 July 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090102025359/http://www.journalism-courses.com/Archive.aspx?Type=&ID=ebd7f936-446d-494f-ac99-2794462e4179 | archive-date = 2 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Malvern | first = Jack | title = Duke's hotel is a threat to butterflies' historic home | newspaper = The Times | date = 5 January 2005 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article407450.ece | accessdate = 18 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Graham | title = London Syon Park no longer a Waldorf Astoria hotel | work = Business Traveller | publisher = Panacea Publishing | date = 20 May 2013 | url = https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2013/05/20/london-syon-park-no-longer-a-waldorf-astoria-hotel/ | accessdate = 10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlso based in the grounds of Syon Park was the Heritage Motor Museum, a collection of vintage [[automobile]]s, which was also founded in 1981. Owing to a major increase in the number of vehicles acquired, in 1993 the museum closed and its collection was transferred to the [[Heritage Motor Centre]] at Gaydon in [[Warwickshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk/about-the-heritage-motor-centre/car-collection/|title=About the Heritage Motor Centre|publisher=Heritage Motor Centre|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 an annual archaeological dig was initiated originally by the Channel 4 television ''[[Time Team]]'' programme to excavate the remains of the lost abbey. The annual dig is now undertaken by [[Birkbeck College]] part of the [[University of London]]. It is backed up by a permanent exhibition in the undercroft.<ref name=\"Syon Park House 2011\"/>\n\nIn November 2010, the results from an archaeological dig made two years before on the site of the new hotel were reported, with the excavations uncovering the remains of a Roman village that existed in what was then the rural outskirts of [[Londinium]]. Artefacts uncovered included 11,500 pottery fragments, 100 coins and pieces of jewellery. Some of the finds remain unexplained, such as the discovery of skeletons \"buried in ditches placed on their side\". Although the skeletons date from the Roman period, this burial practice was said by the senior archaeologist to be \"more suggestive of unknown prehistoric rites than Roman practice\".<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23897926-entire-roman-village-is-unearthed-in-syon-park.do Entire Roman village is unearthed in Syon Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119062837/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23897926-entire-roman-village-is-unearthed-in-syon-park.do |date=19 November 2010 }}, Louise Jury, Chief Arts Correspondent, ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', 16 November 2010</ref>\n\nSyon Park is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref>[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1004281.pdf Natural England citation, Syon Park]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://magic.defra.gov.uk/MagicMap.aspx?startTopic=Designations&activelayer=sssiIndex&query=HYPERLINK%3D%271004281%27|publisher= Natural England|title= Map of Syon Park SSSI}}</ref>\n\n==In media==\nDespite being on the route of the usually noisy [[Final approach (aeronautics)|final approach]] for [[Heathrow Airport]], the historic house and garden are a popular filming location particularly for films and television programmes, including the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=952|title=Syon House & Gosford Park|author1=London History Tours |author2=Adrian Sill |author3=Jeremy Tipton |work=shadyoldlady.com}}</ref> \n\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*''[[Endeavour (TV series)|Endeavour]]''\n*''[[Poirot (TV series)|Poirot]]''\n*''[[Dancing on the Edge (TV series)|Dancing on the Edge]]''\n*''[[Byron (TV film)|Byron]]''\n* [[Bedazzled (1967 film)|''Bedazzled'']]\n*''[[The Lost Prince]]''\n*''[[The Young Visiters]]''\n*''[[Longitude (TV series)|Longitude]]''\n*''[[Looking for Victoria]]''\n*''[[Daniel Deronda]]''\n*''[[Wives and Daughters (1999 miniseries)|Wives and Daughters]]''\n*''[[Love in a Cold Climate (TV serial)|Love in a Cold Climate]]''\n*''[[Gosford Park]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Gosford Park |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/ad/set-design/2013/period-movies-set-design-manors-castles-vanity-fair-jane-eyre-slideshow#slide=17 |work=The Castles and Manor Houses of Cinema's Greatest Period Films |publisher=Architectural Digest |accessdate=2 January 2013 |date=January 2013}}</ref>\n*''[[The Madness of King George]]''\n*''[[King Ralph]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-film-locations.com/King-Ralph-1991 |title=Where was ''King Ralph'' filmed? |publisher=British Film Locations |accessdate=31 October 2017}}</ref>\n*''[[The Wings of the Dove (1997 film)|The Wings of the Dove]]''\n*''[[Emma (1996 TV film)|Emma]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strangegirl.com/emma/2.php|title=Emma 2 - Miramax Emma - Gwyneth Paltrow :: Emma Adaptations Pages :: Jane Austen's Emma :: Emma Jane Austen Emma Movie Emma|work=strangegirl.com}}</ref>\n*''[[The Golden Bowl (film)|The Golden Bowl]]''\n*''[[The Avengers (1998 film)|The Avengers]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/a/Avengers_1998.html#.Uj_1IdJJOVE|title=The Avengers film locations|work=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations}}</ref>\n*''[[Killing Eve]]''{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Syon House East Aspect.JPG|East Aspect of Syon House (c. 2010)\nImage:AdamBrothersHallatSyon1778.jpg|A design for the hall by Robert and James Adam\nImage:Syon Plan.jpg|[[Robert Adam]]'s plan for the reconstruction of Syon House\nImage:Syon House Conservatory, London.JPG|Syon House Great Conservatory\nImage:File-observatory syonpark.jpg|Side view of the conservatory\nImage:Syon Park Enchanted Woodland 3.jpg|Syon Park Enchanted Woodland\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Alnwick Castle]], the principal seat of the Dukes of Northumberland\n* [[Hounslow parks and open spaces]]\n* [[List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Greater London]]\n* [[Northumberland House]], the former central London residence of the Dukes of Northumberland\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n* {{cite book |last=Field |first=D.

The abbey moved to the site now occupied by Syon House in 1431. It was one of the wealthiest nunneries in the country and a local legend recites that the monks of [[Sheen Priory|Sheen]] had a [[ley tunnel]] running to the nunnery at Syon.<ref name=\"Westwood6\">Westwood, Jennifer (1985), ''Albion. A Guide to Legendary Britain.'' Pub. Grafton Books, London. {{ISBN|0-246-11789-3}}. p. 126.</ref> In 1539, the abbey was closed by royal agents during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and the monastic community was expelled.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Syon Park:History |series=Syon Park:The London Home of the Duke of Northumberland |postscript= <!--None--> }}</ref>\n\nOn the closure of the abbey on the [[dissolution of the monasteries]] Syon became the property of the Crown for a short time before long lease to the [[1st Duke of Somerset]], who had the site rebuilt as Syon House in the Italian Renaissance style before his death in 1552. In 1541 and part of the following year Henry VIII's fifth wife [[Catherine Howard]] faced her long imprisonment at Syon. In February 1542, the King's men took her to the [[Tower of London]] and executed her on charges of adultery. Five years later when King Henry VIII died, his coffin surmounted by jewelled effigy rested at Syon House for its one night rest before the procession reached his burial place in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]].\n\nIn 1557 it was proposed to convert the new building to the earlier Catholic use but [[Elizabeth I of England]] acceded to the throne before this change was effected. Syon was acquired in 1594 by [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland]] (1564\u20131632) since when it has remained in his family.<ref name=\"Holmes 1991 181\u2013208\">{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Nancy|title=Noble House: Three Generations of Percys Enjoy Robert Adam's Neoclassical Grandeur|journal=House and Garden|year=1991|volume=163|issue=4|pages=181\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 17th century, Syon was in the possession of [[Charles Seymour, 6th Duke of Somerset]], through his wife, [[Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset|Elizabeth Seymour (n\u00e9e Percy)]]. After the future [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] had a disagreement with her sister, Mary II (wife of William III, also known as William of Orange), over her friendship with [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah Churchill, Countess of Marlborough]], Queen Mary [[Eviction|evicted]] Princess Anne from her court residence at [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] and [[Hampton Court Palace|Hampton Court]].  Princess Anne came to live at Syon with her close friends, the Somersets, in 1692. Anne gave birth to a stillborn child there. Shortly after the birth, Queen Mary came to visit her, again demanding that Anne dismiss the Countess of Marlborough and stormed out again when Anne flatly refused.\n\nIn the 18th century, [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland]], commissioned architect and [[interior design]]er [[Robert Adam]] and landscape designer [[Lancelot \"Capability\" Brown]] to redesign the house and estate. Work began on the interior reconstruction project in 1762. Five large rooms on the west, south and east sides of the House, were completed before work ceased in 1769. A central rotunda, which Adam had intended for the interior courtyard space, was not implemented, due to cost.<ref>{{cite book |last=Field |first=D. M. |title=The World's Greatest Architecture Past & Present |page=207}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Syon House was opened to the public for the first time under the 10th Duke and Duchess.  Later, in 1995 under the 12th Duke, the family rooms became open to the public as well.  As the Percy family continues to live there, they continue to enhance the house. Most recently the Duchess added a new central courtyard with the design of Marchioness of Salisbury.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\">{{cite journal|last=Musson|first=Jeremy|title=Syon House, Middlesex: A Seat of the Duke of Northumberland|journal=Country Life|date=2 November 2000|pages=94\u201399}}</ref>\n\nA \u00a3600K restoration was undertaken in late 2007, primarily involving work to the roof area.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Syon House Restoration |url=http://www.hprltd.co.uk/news.aspx?id=4 |date=12 November 2007 |publisher=Historic Property Restoration Ltd |access-date=21 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425082552/http://www.hprltd.co.uk/news.aspx?id=4 |archive-date=25 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=McDonnell |first=Colleen |date=13 April 2008 |title=Historic Syon House open again after major works |url=http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/thechiswick/chiswicknews/2190171.historic_syon_house_open_again_after_major_works/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404163012/http://www.richmondandtwickenhamtimes.co.uk/thechiswick/chiswicknews/2190171.historic_syon_house_open_again_after_major_works/ |archive-date=4 April 2012 |work=[[Richmond and Twickenham Times]] |location=[[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], UK |access-date=21 October 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>  In 2008 restoration work commenced on the Great Hall and a current long-term project is to restore the Adam Rooms.<ref name=\"Syon Park House 2011\">''Syon Park House & Gardens'' leaflet (2011)</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Syon Gateway and porters' lodges 1769 edited.jpg|thumb|300px|A design for a gateway and porters' lodges at Syon House by [[Robert Adam]], c. 1769]]\n[[File:Syon - proposal for a bridge.jpg|thumb|300px|Another design by Adam for a Bridge at Syon Park]]\nSyon House's exterior was erected in 1547 while under the ownership of the 1st Duke of Somerset.  Syon's current interior was designed by Robert Adam in 1762 under the commission of the 1st Duke and Duchess of Northumberland.\n\nThe well known \"Adam style\" is said to have begun with Syon House. It was commissioned to be built in the Neo-classical style, which was fulfilled, but Adam's eclectic style doesn't end there. Syon is filled with multiple styles and inspirations including a huge influence of Roman antiquity, highly visible Romantic, Picturesque, Baroque and Mannerist styles and a dash of Gothic. There is also evidence in his decorative motifs of his influence by Pompeii that he received while studying in Italy.<ref name=\"O'Connor 1987 183\u2013218\"/>  Adam's plan of Syon House included a complete set of rooms on the main floor, a domed rotunda with a circular inner colonnade meant for the main courtyard ('meant for' meaning that this rotunda was not built due to a lack of funds), five main rooms on the west, east and south side of the building, a pillared ante-room famous for its colour,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Syon House|journal=Country Life|date=21 May 1927|pages=795}}</ref> a Great Hall, a grand staircase (though not built as grand as originally designed) and a Long Gallery stretching 136 feet long.  Adam's most famous addition is the suite of state rooms and as such they remain exactly as they were built.\n\nMore specific to the interior of Adam's rooms is where the elaborate detail and colour shines through.  Adam added detailed marble chimneypieces, shuttering doors and doorways in the Drawing Room, along with fluted columns with Corinthian capitals.  The long gallery, which is about 14 feet high and 14 feet wide, contains many recesses and niches into the thick wall for books along with rich and light decoration and stucco-covered walls and ceiling.  At the end of the gallery is a closet with a domed circle supported by eight columns; halfway through the columns is a doorway imitating a niche.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\"/>\n\nIn the 1820s the north range of the house that was not completed by Adam was redesigned by the 3rd Duke. At this time the house was also refaced in Bath stone and the porch rebuilt.  This remodelling is thought to have been done by the architect Thomas Cady, who had worked on other estates belonging to the Percy family.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\"/>\n\nSyon House was refurbished again in the 1860s.  The 4th Duke had Renaissance-style plaster ceilings put into the Family Drawing Room, Family Dining Room and Print Room.<ref name=\"Holmes 1991 181\u2013208\"/>\n\nThe final plan of Syon House includes an entrance hall, ante-room, State Dining Room, State Drawing Room, Long Gallery, study, sitting room, Print Room, Family Drawing Room, Family Dining Room, private apartments on the top floor for the family to live in and a grand staircase.<ref name=\"Musson 94\u201399\"/>\n\n== Syon Park ==\n{{main|Syon Park}}\n'''Syon Park''' borders the [[Thames]], looking across the river to [[Kew Gardens]] and near its banks is a tidal meadow flooded twice a day by the river. It contains more than 200 species of rare trees. Although the park and lake were designed by Capability Brown in 1760, their character today is nineteenth century. The circular pool has a copy of [[Giambologna]]'s Mercury.  The park and the house in the background  were painted from across the [[River Thames|Thames]] by [[J. M. W. Turner]] c. 1802\u20131810 in the painting ''Zion House, Isleworth'' and in two [[capriccio (art)|capriccio]]s in 1805.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/turner-zion-house-isleworth-d08269 Tate Gallery ''Turner: Zion House, Isleworth''] Work reference:  D08269 Turner bequest CXXI M.

The conservatory appeared (as Heaven) in the original 1967 [[Dudley Moore]]\u2013[[Peter Cook]] version of ''[[Bedazzled (1967 film)|Bedazzled]]'', having already featured prominently in [[John Boorman]]'s first feature film ''[[Catch Us If You Can (film)|Catch Us If You Can]]'' (1965, ostensibly a vehicle for the [[Dave Clark Five]]), was shown in a dream sequence in [[Meera Syal]]'s 1993 film ''[[Bhaji on the Beach]]'' and was also the setting for the music video to [[The Cure]]'s 1984 single \"[[The Caterpillar (song)|The Caterpillar]]\", directed by [[Tim Pope]].\n\n[[Henry Percy, 11th Duke of Northumberland]], who was head of the family from 1988 to 1995, was noted for planting many trees in the grounds of Syon.\n\nIn 2002, the English poet [[Geoffrey Hill]] released a booklength poem, ''The Orchards of Syon'', to much acclaim. ''The Orchards of Syon'' focuses on the history of the region and in particular on the orchard of rare trees first planted in Syon Abbey.\n\nThe [[London Butterfly House]] was based in the grounds of Syon Park from 1981 until its closure on 28 October 2007 due to the [[Ralph Percy, 12th Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]]'s plans to build a hotel complex on the land. In 2004, planning permission was granted for the deluxe \u00a335-million Radisson Edwardian Hotel. In 2011, the Syon Park Waldorf Astoria hotel opened on the site. The hotel was renamed to the Hilton London Syon Park in 2013.<ref name=\"edbrown\">{{cite web | last = Brown | first = Ed | author2 = McGrath, Martin | author3 = Davis, Matt | title = So Crosse As Butterflies Head North | publisher = News Associates | url = http://www.journalism-courses.com/Archive.aspx?Type=&ID=ebd7f936-446d-494f-ac99-2794462e4179 | access-date = 18 July 2008 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090102025359/http://www.journalism-courses.com/Archive.aspx?Type=&ID=ebd7f936-446d-494f-ac99-2794462e4179 | archive-date = 2 January 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Malvern | first = Jack | title = Duke's hotel is a threat to butterflies' historic home | newspaper = The Times | date = 5 January 2005 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article407450.ece | accessdate = 18 July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Graham | title = London Syon Park no longer a Waldorf Astoria hotel | work = Business Traveller | publisher = Panacea Publishing | date = 20 May 2013 | url = https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2013/05/20/london-syon-park-no-longer-a-waldorf-astoria-hotel/ | accessdate = 10 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlso based in the grounds of Syon Park was the Heritage Motor Museum, a collection of vintage [[automobile]]s, which was also founded in 1981. Owing to a major increase in the number of vehicles acquired, in 1993 the museum closed and its collection was transferred to the [[Heritage Motor Centre]] at Gaydon in [[Warwickshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage-motor-centre.co.uk/about-the-heritage-motor-centre/car-collection/|title=About the Heritage Motor Centre|publisher=Heritage Motor Centre|accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 an annual archaeological dig was initiated originally by the Channel 4 television ''[[Time Team]]'' programme to excavate the remains of the lost abbey. The annual dig is now undertaken by [[Birkbeck College]] part of the [[University of London]]. It is backed up by a permanent exhibition in the undercroft.<ref name=\"Syon Park House 2011\"/>\n\nIn November 2010, the results from an archaeological dig made two years before on the site of the new hotel were reported, with the excavations uncovering the remains of a Roman village that existed in what was then the rural outskirts of [[Londinium]]. Artefacts uncovered included 11,500 pottery fragments, 100 coins and pieces of jewellery.
