It is organised by a host institution and vary for each year. ICYS is a member of [https://web.archive.org/web/20140424080817/http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/wfphc/  World Federation of Physics Competitions].\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\nIn 1993 the representatives of Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest and the State University of Belarus, Minsk decided to organize together a conference for 14- to 18-year-old secondary school students. The aim of the organizers with organizing such a new type of a competition was to acquaint secondary school students with the methods of scientific research. This includes different phases of research work from the very beginning the pointing out the topic to the last step, summing up the results of the research in a foreign language-lecture. The conference gives the challenging opportunity to the young scientists to get some feedback of the work with which they are just trying to deal, and to measure their strength in an international field.\nDuring the years students from the following countries have participated in the Conference: Belarus, Czech Republic, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, The Netherlands, Ukraine, United States of America, Yugoslavia.\nThe conference in Hungary (Visegrad, 1994, 1996, 1998), in Belarus (Baranovichi, 1995, 1997, 1999), in 2000 in The Netherlands, in Nijmegen, in 2001 in Poland, in Katowice, in 2002 in Georgia, in Kutaisi was organized respectively, in 2003 will be held in Czech Republic, in Prague.\nThe first ICYS was in Visegrad in 1994. Iran was observer in 2010. Then 70 lectures were presented by students from 5 countries. Hungarian organizers always come back to Visegrad, the competition become widely known as \"Visegrad Conference\".\nIn 1996 the number of participants increased, 86 lecturers from 9 countries gave their lectures. The Conference every year becomes richer, new countries join to the competition. The Conference has a good reputation not only in the Middle European countries, but outside Europe too. This year we have an observer from Singapore, a country where the education receives from the government the highest financial support all over the world. This year we have more than 80 secondary school participants, and more than 70 lectures with wide variety of topics. We are convinced, that nowadays, during the permanently decreasing popularity of sciences a scientific event which attracts the young generation has special significance. Perhaps most of the participating students will later become students at various universities and will be researchers reporting at scientific conferences. This first appearance may be a decisive factor in their future scientific career.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.izmir.edu.tr/icys2015/about/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092248/http://www.izmir.edu.tr/icys2015/about/history.html |archive-date=2015-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nIt celebrated its 20th year in Bali, Indonesia.

ICYS is a member of [https://web.archive.org/web/20140424080817/http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/wfphc/  World Federation of Physics Competitions].\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\nIn 1993 the representatives of Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest and the State University of Belarus, Minsk decided to organize together a conference for 14- to 18-year-old secondary school students. The aim of the organizers with organizing such a new type of a competition was to acquaint secondary school students with the methods of scientific research. This includes different phases of research work from the very beginning the pointing out the topic to the last step, summing up the results of the research in a foreign language-lecture. The conference gives the challenging opportunity to the young scientists to get some feedback of the work with which they are just trying to deal, and to measure their strength in an international field.\nDuring the years students from the following countries have participated in the Conference: Belarus, Czech Republic, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, The Netherlands, Ukraine, United States of America, Yugoslavia.\nThe conference in Hungary (Visegrad, 1994, 1996, 1998), in Belarus (Baranovichi, 1995, 1997, 1999), in 2000 in The Netherlands, in Nijmegen, in 2001 in Poland, in Katowice, in 2002 in Georgia, in Kutaisi was organized respectively, in 2003 will be held in Czech Republic, in Prague.\nThe first ICYS was in Visegrad in 1994. Iran was observer in 2010. Then 70 lectures were presented by students from 5 countries. Hungarian organizers always come back to Visegrad, the competition become widely known as \"Visegrad Conference\".\nIn 1996 the number of participants increased, 86 lecturers from 9 countries gave their lectures. The Conference every year becomes richer, new countries join to the competition. The Conference has a good reputation not only in the Middle European countries, but outside Europe too. This year we have an observer from Singapore, a country where the education receives from the government the highest financial support all over the world. This year we have more than 80 secondary school participants, and more than 70 lectures with wide variety of topics. We are convinced, that nowadays, during the permanently decreasing popularity of sciences a scientific event which attracts the young generation has special significance. Perhaps most of the participating students will later become students at various universities and will be researchers reporting at scientific conferences. This first appearance may be a decisive factor in their future scientific career.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.izmir.edu.tr/icys2015/about/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092248/http://www.izmir.edu.tr/icys2015/about/history.html |archive-date=2015-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nIt celebrated its 20th year in Bali, Indonesia.

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to show falsifiability are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v.

In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to show falsifiability are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

Unlike [[higher education in Europe]], there was no [[national curriculum]] for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. All institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical.<ref>Michael S.

Western painter [[Frederic Remington]] (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied the heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel ''Stover at Yale'' (1911) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, and the alumni, as well as the team itself.<ref>Robert Higgs, \"'G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung' and Palingenesis: Yale and the Heroic Ideal, 1865\u20131914,\" ''Proteus'' 1986 3(1): 18\u201324</ref>\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Yale's four-oared [[Rowing (sport)|crew]] team, posing with 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy, won at [[Philadelphia]]]]\n\nAlong with [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]], Yale students rejected elite British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.<ref>Ronald A.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J.

There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, \"The Football Crisis of 1909\u20131910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three',\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33\u201349</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]\n\nYale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E.

In 1887, as the college continued to grow under the presidency of [[Timothy Dwight&nbsp;V]], Yale College was renamed Yale University, with the name [[Yale College]] subsequently applied to the undergraduate college. The university would later add the [[Yale School of Music]] (1894), the [[Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies]] (founded by Gifford Pinchot in 1900), the [[Yale School of Public Health]] (1915), the [[Yale School of Nursing]] (1923), the [[Yale School of Drama]](1955), the [[Yale Physician Associate Program]] (1973), the [[Yale School of Management]] (1976), and the [[Jackson School of Global Affairs]] which will open in 2022.<ref name=\"The Future of Jackson\">{{Cite web|url=https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|title=The Future of Jackson|website=Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821223916/https://jackson.yale.edu/the-future-of-jackson/|archive-date=August 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It would also reorganize its relationship with the Sheffield Scientific School.\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, \"Noah Porter Revisited,\" ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29\u201366,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. He may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n[[File:Rummell, Richard Yale University cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus, facing north]]\n\n===20th century===\n\n====Behavioral sciences====\nBetween 1925 and 1940, [[Foundation (non-profit)|philanthropic foundations]], especially ones connected with the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], contributed about $7&nbsp;million to support the Yale Institute of Human Relations and the affiliated Yerkes Laboratories of Primate [[Biology]]. The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to \"improve mankind\" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, \"Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923\u201341,\" ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21\u201343,</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]\n\n====Biology====\nSlack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, \"Are Research Schools Necessary?

Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, \"Dean Milton C.

[[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose.<ref>Michael Holzman, \"The Ideological Origins of American Studies at Yale,\" ''American Studies'' 40:2 (Summer 1999): 71\u201399</ref> Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire [[William Robertson Coe]] made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming.

The [[Beinecke Rare Book Library]] has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The [[Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library]] includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The [[Lewis Walpole Library]] contains the largest collection of 18th\u2011century British literary works. The [[Elizabethan Club]], technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The [[Yale University Art Gallery]], the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartout and Kahn buildings. The latter, [[Louis Kahn]]'s first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The [[Yale Center for British Art]], the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of [[Paul Mellon]] and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\nThe [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The [[Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments]], affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from [[Peru]] by Yale history professor [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]] in his Yale-financed expedition to [[Machu Picchu]] in 1912 \u2013 when the removal of such artifacts was legal.

Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]\". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.\n\nSince summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].\n\n==Campus life==\nYale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds.

Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas,\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.<ref>{{cite news |author1-last=Lloyd-Thomas |author1-first=Matthew |author2-last=Rodrigues |author2-first=Adrian |title=New colleges to help reduce overcrowding |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=April 15, 2014 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |accessdate=September 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907085326/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |archive-date=September 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [[Old Campus]], the university's oldest precinct.\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] or [[Collegiate Gothic]] in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, [[Morse College|Morse]] and [[Ezra Stiles College|Ezra Stiles]] Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities.

Debates were covered on front pages of [[college newspaper]]s and emphasized in [[yearbook]]s, and team members even received the equivalent of [[athletic letters]] for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.<ref>Roberta J.

There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. President [[Arthur Hadley]] of Yale, A. [[Lawrence Lowell]] of Harvard, and [[Woodrow Wilson]] of Princeton worked to develop moderate changes to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and formation of the [[Intercollegiate Athletic Association]]. The big three had tried to operate independently of the majority, but changes did reduce injuries.<ref>John S., Watterson III, \"The Football Crisis of 1909\u20131910: the Response of the Eastern 'Big Three',\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 1981 8(1): 33\u201349</ref>\n\n====Expansion====\n[[File:View of Connecticut Hall Old Campus Yale College New Haven Connecticut.jpg|thumb|Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753]]\n\nYale expanded gradually, establishing the [[Yale School of Medicine]] (1810), [[Yale Divinity School]] (1822), [[Yale Law School]] (1843), [[Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences]] (1847), the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] (1847),<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from [[Joseph E.

[[Noah Porter]], moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.<ref>George Levesque, \"Noah Porter Revisited,\" ''Perspectives on the History of Higher Education'' 2007 26: 29\u201366,</ref> He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture.

The money went toward behavioral science research, which was supported by foundation officers who aimed to \"improve mankind\" under an informal, loosely defined human engineering effort. The behavioral scientists at Yale, led by President [[James R. Angell]] and psychobiologist [[Robert M. Yerkes]], tapped into foundation largesse by crafting research programs aimed to investigate, then suggest, ways to control sexual and social behavior. For example, Yerkes analyzed chimpanzee sexual behavior in hopes of illuminating the evolutionary underpinnings of human development and providing information that could ameliorate dysfunction. Ultimately, the behavioral-science results disappointed foundation officers, who shifted their human-engineering funds toward biological sciences.<ref>Kersten Jacobson Biehn, \"Psychobiology, Sex Research and Chimpanzees: Philanthropic Foundation Support for the Behavioral Sciences at Yale University, 1923\u201341,\" ''History of the Human Sciences'' 2008 21(2): 21\u201343,</ref>\n\n[[File:A View of the Buildings of Yale College at New Haven 1807.jpg|thumb|Old Brick Row in 1807]]\n\n====Biology====\nSlack (2003) compares three groups that conducted biological research at Yale during overlapping periods between 1910 and 1970. Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were [[Ross Granville Harrison]], [[Grace E. Pickford]], and [[G.&nbsp;Evelyn Hutchinson]], and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists. All produced innovative research, including the opening of new subfields in embryology, endocrinology, and ecology, respectively, over a long period of time. Harrison's group is shown to have been a classic research school; Pickford's and Hutchinson's were not. Pickford's group was successful in spite of her lack of departmental or institutional position or power. Hutchinson and his graduate and postgraduate students were extremely productive, but in diverse areas of ecology rather than one focused area of research or the use of one set of research tools. Hutchinson's example shows that new models for research groups are needed, especially for those that include extensive field research.<ref>Nancy G. Slack, \"Are Research Schools Necessary? Contrasting Models of 20th Century Research at Yale Led by Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford and G. Evelyn Hutchinson,\" ''Journal of the History of Biology'' 2003 36(3): 501\u2013529,</ref>\n\n====Medicine====\nMilton Winternitz led the [[Yale School of Medicine]] as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the Psychiatry Department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to resign.<ref>Howard Spiro and Priscilla Waters Norton, \"Dean Milton C. Winternitz at Yale,\" ''Perspectives in Biology & Medicine'' 2003 46(3): 403\u2013412,</ref>\n\n====Faculty====\nBefore [[World War&nbsp;II]], most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.<ref>William Palmer, \"On or about 1950 or 1955 History Departments Changed: A Step in the Creation of the Modern History Department,\" ''Journal of the Historical Society'' (1529921x); 2007 7(3): 385\u2013405</ref>\n\n====History and American studies====\nThe American studies program reflected the worldwide anti-Communist ideological struggle. [[Norman Holmes Pearson]], who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose.<ref>Michael Holzman, \"The Ideological Origins of American Studies at Yale,\" ''American Studies'' 40:2 (Summer 1999): 71\u201399</ref> Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire [[William Robertson Coe]] made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming.

Of the New Critics, [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[W.K. Wimsatt]], and [[Cleanth Brooks]] were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American [[deconstruction]]. [[Jacques Derrida]], the father of deconstruction, taught at the Department of Comparative Literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"[[Yale school (deconstruction)|Yale School]]\". These included [[Paul de Man]] who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, [[J.&nbsp;Hillis Miller]], [[Geoffrey Hartman]] (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and [[Harold Bloom]] (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians [[C.&nbsp;Vann Woodward]] and [[David Brion Davis]] are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of [[American South|southern]] historians; likewise, [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]], a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and Department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century. The ''Journal of Music Theory'' was founded there in 1957; [[Allen Forte]] and [[David Lewin]] were influential teachers and scholars.\n\nSince summer 2010, Yale has also been host to [[Yale Publishing Course]].\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 [[postdoctoral researcher|Postdocs]] from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the [[Yale Postdoctoral Association]].\n\n==Campus life==\nYale is a medium-sized research university, most of whose students are in the [[Graduate school|graduate]] and [[Professional school|professional]] schools. [[Undergraduate education|Undergraduates]], or [[Yale College]] students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic backgrounds, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010\u20132011 freshman class, 10% are non\u2011U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |title=Yale Factsheet |publisher=Yale.edu |accessdate=December 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403080525/http://www.yale.edu/oir/factsheet.html#Yale%20College%20Student%20Body%20Characteristics |archivedate=April 3, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n===Residential colleges===\n{{Main|Residential colleges of Yale University}}\nYale's [[residential college]] system was established in 1933 by [[Edward S. Harkness]], who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [[Collegiate university|colleges]] at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are [[Collegiate university#Dependent colleges|dependent entities]] of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas,\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.<ref>{{cite news |author1-last=Lloyd-Thomas |author1-first=Matthew |author2-last=Rodrigues |author2-first=Adrian |title=New colleges to help reduce overcrowding |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=April 15, 2014 |url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |accessdate=September 6, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907085326/http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2014/04/15/new-colleges-to-help-reduce-overcrowding/ |archive-date=September 7, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [[Old Campus]], the university's oldest precinct.\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were [[Georgian architecture|Georgian Revival]] or [[Collegiate Gothic]] in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, [[Morse College|Morse]] and [[Ezra Stiles College|Ezra Stiles]] Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history.

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the [[Old Master]]s and the first of the moderns.  He was also one of the great  [[portrait]]ists of his time.<ref name = \"HCC\">[http://medicalalumni.org/historicalcpc/home/ Historical Clinicopathological Conference (2017)] University of Maryland School of Medicine, retrieved January 27, 2017.</ref>\n\nGoya was born to a lower-middle-class family in 1746, in [[Fuendetodos]] in [[Aragon]]. He studied painting from age 14 under [[Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n|Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Martinez]] and moved to Madrid to study with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]. He married [[Josefa Bayeu]] in 1773; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and [[Rococo]] style [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] designed for the royal palace.\n\nHe was guarded, and although letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He suffered a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year [[Manuel Godoy]] made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799 Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara, the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In 1801 he painted ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nIn 1807 [[Napoleon]] led the French army into the [[Peninsular War]] against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not vocalise his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his ''[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]'' series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''. Other works from his mid-period include the ''[[Los Caprichos|Caprichos]]'' and ''[[Los Disparates]]'' etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with [[Yard with Lunatics|insanity]], [[The Madhouse|mental asylums]], [[Witches' Flight|witches]], [[The Bewitched Man|fantastical creatures]] and [[The Inquisition Tribunal|religious]] and [[The Junta of the Philippines|political]] corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\n\nHis late period culminates with the ''[[Black Paintings]]'' of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the [[Quinta del Sordo]] (''House of the Deaf Man'') where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of [[Bordeaux]], accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, [[Leocadia Weiss]], who may or may not have been his lover. There he completed his ''[[La Tauromaquia]]'' series and a number of other, major, canvases. Following a [[stroke]] which left him paralyzed on his right side, and suffering failing eyesight and poor access to painting materials, he died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82. His body was later re-interred in the [[Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida|Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida]] in Madrid. Famously, the skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back, \"Send Goya, with or without head.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yyj5PK-15UwC&pg=PA230&dq=with+or+without+head+fuentes+goya#v=onepage&q=with%20or%20without%20head%20fuentes%20goya&f=false|title= The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World.

Although there are no surviving records, it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas P\u00edas de San Ant\u00f3n, which offered free schooling. His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics.

That year he returned to Zaragoza and painted elements of the [[cupola]]s of the [[Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar|Basilica of the Pillar]] (including ''[[Adoration of the Name of God]]''), a [[Frescoes in the Cartuja de Aula Dei|cycle of frescoes]] for the monastic church of the [[Charterhouse of Aula Dei]], and the frescoes of the Sobradiel Palace.

Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of [[El Escorial]] and the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|Palacio Real del Pardo]], the residences of the Spanish monarchs. While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are mostly popularist in a [[rococo]] style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention.<ref name=\"hh7\">Hagen & Hagen, 7</ref>\n\nThe cartoons were not his only royal commissions, and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and Vel\u00e1zquez. Goya had a complicated relationship to the latter artist; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in Goya's attempts to copy and emulate him, he had access to a wide range of the long-dead painter's works that had been contained in the royal collection.<ref>Hughes (2004), 95</ref> Nonetheless, etching was a medium that the young artist was to master, a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs.<ref>Hagen; Hagen (1999), 7</ref> His c. 1779 etching of [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=762054&partId=1&object=22909&page=655 ''The Garrotted Man''] (\"El agarrotado\") was the largest work he had produced to date, and an obvious foreboding of his later \"[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]\" series.<ref>Hughes (2004), 96</ref>\n\n[[File:Goya - The Garroted Man.jpg|thumb|140px|''The Garroted Man'', before 1780. [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nGoya was beset by illness, and his condition was used against him by his rivals, who looked jealously upon any artist seen to be rising in stature. Some of the larger cartoons, such as ''The Wedding'', were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength. Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal.<ref>Hughes (2004), 130</ref> However, he found the format limiting, as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture, and was unsuited to the [[impasto]] and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing]] techniques he was by then applying to his painted works. The tapestries seem as comments on human types, fashion and fads.<ref>Hughes (2004), 83</ref>\n\nOther works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the [[San Francisco el Grande Basilica, Madrid|Church of San Francisco El Grande]] in Madrid, which led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art.\n\n==Court painter==\n[[File:La familia de Carlos IV, por Francisco de Goya.jpg|thumb|280px|''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800{{efn-ua|[[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] described the figures as looking like \"the corner baker and his wife after they won the lottery\".<ref>Chocano, Carina. \"[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/cl-et-goya20jul20,1,399263.story?ctrack=1&cset=true Goya's Ghosts]\".

These portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter; his ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'' is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family.{{efn-ua|\"Even if one takes into consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic to the point of eccentricity, Goya's portrait still remains unique in its drastic description of human bankruptcy\". Licht (1979), 68}} Modern interpreters view the portrait as satirical; it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of Charles IV. Under his reign his wife [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Louisa]] was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait. From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay.\n\n[[File:Francisco de Goya - Godoy como general - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy]]'', 1801.

In 1801 he painted Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief [[War of the Oranges]] against Portugal. The two were friends, even if Goya's ''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy|1801 portrait]]'' is usually seen as satire. Yet even after Godoy's fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms. Godoy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the Caprichos and is widely believed to have commissioned ''[[La maja desnuda]]''.<ref>Tomlinson (1991), 59</ref>\n\n==Middle period (1793\u20131799)==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center | align= center  | direction = horizontal |  image1= Goya Maja naga2.jpg |width1=280|height1=400| alt1= ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', 1790\u20131800 | caption1= ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', 1790\u20131800 | image2= Maja vestida (Prado).jpg |width=280|height2=400|caption2= ''[[La maja vestida]]'', 1800\u20131805}}\n\n''La Maja Desnuda'' (''La maja desnuda'') has been described as \"the first totally profane life-size female nude in Western art\" without pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning.<ref>Licht (1979), 83</ref> The identity of the ''Majas'' is uncertain.

The extent of Goya's involvement with the court of the \"Intruder king\", [[Joseph I of Spain|Joseph I]], the brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], is not known; he painted works for French patrons and sympathisers, but kept neutral during the fighting. After the restoration of the Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in 1814, Goya denied any involvement with the French. By the time of his wife Josefa's death in 1812, he was painting ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', and preparing the series of etchings later known as ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' (''Los desastres de la guerra''). Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 but relations with Goya were not cordial. The artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries, but not for the king himself.\n\nWhile convalescing between 1793\u20131794, Goya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that mark a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art, and draw from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare. ''[[Yard with Lunatics]]'' is an imaginary vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation.

He is considered the most important Spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicler of his era. Immensely successful in his lifetime, Goya is often referred to as both the last of the [[Old Master]]s and the first of the moderns.  He was also one of the great  [[portrait]]ists of his time.<ref name = \"HCC\">[http://medicalalumni.org/historicalcpc/home/ Historical Clinicopathological Conference (2017)] University of Maryland School of Medicine, retrieved January 27, 2017.</ref>\n\nGoya was born to a lower-middle-class family in 1746, in [[Fuendetodos]] in [[Aragon]]. He studied painting from age 14 under [[Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n|Jos\u00e9 Luz\u00e1n y Martinez]] and moved to Madrid to study with [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]. He married [[Josefa Bayeu]] in 1773; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pregnancies and miscarriages, and only one child, a son, survived into adulthood. Goya became a court painter to the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the Spanish aristocracy and royalty, and [[Rococo]] style [[List of Francisco Goya's tapestry cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] designed for the royal palace.\n\nHe was guarded, and although letters and writings survive, little is known about his thoughts. He suffered a severe and undiagnosed illness in 1793 which left him deaf, after which his work became progressively darker and pessimistic. His later easel and mural paintings, prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal, social and political levels, and contrast with his social climbing. He was appointed Director of the Royal Academy in 1795, the year [[Manuel Godoy]] made an unfavorable treaty with France. In 1799 Goya became Primer Pintor de C\u00e1mara, the highest rank for a Spanish court painter. In the late 1790s, commissioned by Godoy, he completed his ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In 1801 he painted ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', also influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez.\n\nIn 1807 [[Napoleon]] led the French army into the [[Peninsular War]] against Spain. Goya remained in Madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply. Although he did not vocalise his thoughts in public, they can be inferred from his ''[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]'' series of prints (although published 35 years after his death) and his 1814 paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''. Other works from his mid-period include the ''[[Los Caprichos|Caprichos]]'' and ''[[Los Disparates]]'' etching series, and a wide variety of paintings concerned with [[Yard with Lunatics|insanity]], [[The Madhouse|mental asylums]], [[Witches' Flight|witches]], [[The Bewitched Man|fantastical creatures]] and [[The Inquisition Tribunal|religious]] and [[The Junta of the Philippines|political]] corruption, all of which suggest that he feared for both his country's fate and his own mental and physical health.\n\nHis late period culminates with the ''[[Black Paintings]]'' of 1819\u20131823, applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the [[Quinta del Sordo]] (''House of the Deaf Man'') where, disillusioned by political and social developments in Spain he lived in near isolation. Goya eventually abandoned Spain in 1824 to retire to the French city of [[Bordeaux]], accompanied by his much younger maid and companion, [[Leocadia Weiss]], who may or may not have been his lover. There he completed his ''[[La Tauromaquia]]'' series and a number of other, major, canvases. Following a [[stroke]] which left him paralyzed on his right side, and suffering failing eyesight and poor access to painting materials, he died and was buried on 16 April 1828 aged 82. His body was later re-interred in the [[Royal Chapel of St. Anthony of La Florida|Real Ermita de San Antonio de la Florida]] in Madrid. Famously, the skull was missing, a detail the Spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in Madrid, who wired back, \"Send Goya, with or without head.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yyj5PK-15UwC&pg=PA230&dq=with+or+without+head+fuentes+goya#v=onepage&q=with%20or%20without%20head%20fuentes%20goya&f=false|title= The Buried Mirror: Reflections on Spain and the New World.

Although there are no surviving records, it is thought that Goya may have attended the Escuelas P\u00edas de San Ant\u00f3n, which offered free schooling. His education seems to have been adequate but not enlightening; he had reading, writing and numeracy, and some knowledge of the classics.

Over five years he designed some 42 patterns, many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of [[El Escorial]] and the [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|Palacio Real del Pardo]], the residences of the Spanish monarchs. While designing tapestries was neither prestigious nor well paid, his cartoons are mostly popularist in a [[rococo]] style, and Goya used them to bring himself to wider attention.<ref name=\"hh7\">Hagen & Hagen, 7</ref>\n\nThe cartoons were not his only royal commissions, and were accompanied by a series of engravings, mostly copies after old masters such as [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and Vel\u00e1zquez. Goya had a complicated relationship to the latter artist; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in Goya's attempts to copy and emulate him, he had access to a wide range of the long-dead painter's works that had been contained in the royal collection.<ref>Hughes (2004), 95</ref> Nonetheless, etching was a medium that the young artist was to master, a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs.<ref>Hagen; Hagen (1999), 7</ref> His c. 1779 etching of [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=762054&partId=1&object=22909&page=655 ''The Garrotted Man''] (\"El agarrotado\") was the largest work he had produced to date, and an obvious foreboding of his later \"[[The Disasters of War|Disasters of War]]\" series.<ref>Hughes (2004), 96</ref>\n\n[[File:Goya - The Garroted Man.jpg|thumb|140px|''The Garroted Man'', before 1780. [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nGoya was beset by illness, and his condition was used against him by his rivals, who looked jealously upon any artist seen to be rising in stature. Some of the larger cartoons, such as ''The Wedding'', were more than 8 by 10 feet, and had proved a drain on his physical strength. Ever resourceful, Goya turned this misfortune around, claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal.<ref>Hughes (2004), 130</ref> However, he found the format limiting, as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture, and was unsuited to the [[impasto]] and [[Glaze (painting technique)|glazing]] techniques he was by then applying to his painted works. The tapestries seem as comments on human types, fashion and fads.<ref>Hughes (2004), 83</ref>\n\nOther works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the [[San Francisco el Grande Basilica, Madrid|Church of San Francisco El Grande]] in Madrid, which led to his appointment as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art.\n\n==Court painter==\n[[File:La familia de Carlos IV, por Francisco de Goya.jpg|thumb|280px|''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800{{efn-ua|[[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] described the figures as looking like \"the corner baker and his wife after they won the lottery\".<ref>Chocano, Carina. \"[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/cl-et-goya20jul20,1,399263.story?ctrack=1&cset=true Goya's Ghosts]\".

He became friends with the King's half-brother [[Infante Luis, Count of Chinch\u00f3n|Luis]], and spent two summers working on portraits of both the Infante and his family.<ref>Tomlinson (2003), 147</ref> During the 1780s, his circle of patrons grew to include the [[Mar\u00eda Josefa Pimentel, Duchess of Osuna|Duke and Duchess of Osuna]], the King and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted. In 1786, Goya was given a salaried position as painter to Charles III.\n\n[[File:La familia del infante don Luis.jpg|left|thumb|240px|''[[The Family of the Infante Don Luis]]'', 1784. [[Magnani-Rocca]], [[Parma]]]]\nGoya was appointed court painter to Charles IV in 1789. The following year he became First Court Painter, with a salary of 50,000 [[Spanish real|reales]] and an allowance of 500 [[ducat]]s for a coach. He painted portraits of the king and the queen, and the Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel de Godoy]] and many other nobles. These portraits are notable for their disinclination to flatter; his ''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'' is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family.{{efn-ua|\"Even if one takes into consideration the fact that Spanish portraiture is often realistic to the point of eccentricity, Goya's portrait still remains unique in its drastic description of human bankruptcy\". Licht (1979), 68}} Modern interpreters view the portrait as satirical; it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of Charles IV. Under his reign his wife [[Maria Luisa of Parma|Louisa]] was thought to have had the real power, and thus Goya placed her at the center of the group portrait. From the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer, and the painting behind the family depicts [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] and his daughters, thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay.\n\n[[File:Francisco de Goya - Godoy como general - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy]]'', 1801.

In 1801 he painted Godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief [[War of the Oranges]] against Portugal. The two were friends, even if Goya's ''[[Portrait of Manuel Godoy|1801 portrait]]'' is usually seen as satire. Yet even after Godoy's fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms. Godoy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the Caprichos and is widely believed to have commissioned ''[[La maja desnuda]]''.<ref>Tomlinson (1991), 59</ref>\n\n==Middle period (1793\u20131799)==\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center | align= center  | direction = horizontal |  image1= Goya Maja naga2.jpg |width1=280|height1=400| alt1= ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', 1790\u20131800 | caption1= ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', 1790\u20131800 | image2= Maja vestida (Prado).jpg |width=280|height2=400|caption2= ''[[La maja vestida]]'', 1800\u20131805}}\n\n''La Maja Desnuda'' (''La maja desnuda'') has been described as \"the first totally profane life-size female nude in Western art\" without pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning.<ref>Licht (1979), 83</ref> The identity of the ''Majas'' is uncertain.

The extent of Goya's involvement with the court of the \"Intruder king\", [[Joseph I of Spain|Joseph I]], the brother of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], is not known; he painted works for French patrons and sympathisers, but kept neutral during the fighting. After the restoration of the Spanish king [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in 1814, Goya denied any involvement with the French. By the time of his wife Josefa's death in 1812, he was painting ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', and preparing the series of etchings later known as ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' (''Los desastres de la guerra''). Ferdinand VII returned to Spain in 1814 but relations with Goya were not cordial. The artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries, but not for the king himself.\n\nWhile convalescing between 1793\u20131794, Goya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that mark a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art, and draw from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare. ''[[Yard with Lunatics]]'' is an imaginary vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation. The condemnation of brutality towards prisoners (whether criminal or insane) is a subject that Goya assayed in later works<ref name=\"Eisenman2007\">{{cite book|last=Crow|first=Thomas|editor=Stephen Eisenman|title=Nineteenth Century Art.: A Critical History|url=https://www.msu.edu/course/ha/445/crowgoya.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2013|edition=3rd |year=2007|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location= New York|chapter=3: Tensions of the Enlightenment, Goya}}</ref> that focused on the degradation of the human figure.<ref>Licht (1979), 156</ref> It was one of the first of Goya's mid-1790s [[cabinet painting]]s, in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between naturalism and fantasy that would preoccupy him for the rest of his career.<ref>Schulz, Andrew. \"The Expressive Body in Goya's Saint Francis Borgia at the Deathbed of an Impenitent\".

The final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored Bourbon monarchy, encouraged by the Catholic hierarchy, rejected the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] and opposed both state and religious reform.

In the [[2007 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain]], [[Steven Kane]] won more races than anyone else, finishing 3rd overall.\n\nThe team took a break form the Carrera Cup in 2008 to focus on their [[British Touring Car Championship]] campaign but were back for the [[2009 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain]] entering all three classes. Michael Caine was able to take 3 wins for the team during the year on his way to 4th in the championship.\n\n[[2010 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain|2010]] saw Michael Caine lead Motorbase's charge for the title gaining 7 wins along the way. However, he was beaten by 10 points to the title by ex-Motorbase driver [[Tim Harvey]]. In [[2011 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain|2011]], Harvey attempted to defend his title with Motorbase, partnering his rival Caine.<ref>http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2011/02/harvey-rejoins-motorbase-for-pccgb-title-defence/</ref> However, the championship was won by [[James Sutton (racing driver)|James Sutton]].\n\n===Porsche Carrera Cup GB results===\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:750px\"\n! colspan=9| [[Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain]] results\n|-\n!
