This was after members of the public had called a radio station claiming to have heard her appearing to repeat back information that they said moments earlier they'd overheard coming from the theatre lighting box during one of Morgan's shows at ''The Grand Canal Theatre'' in Dublin.\n\nZenon stated that stage psychics and mediums often use various Internet tools as well as traditional cold-reading techniques to fish for information with the intention of making their audiences believe that they are communicating with the deceased. He writes \"if... performers like Sally Morgan aren't actually talking to the dead, then I think the public has a right to know\".{{Citation needed|date = October 2014}} Shortly after the article was published, Paul discovered video footage of Morgan walking off a theatre stage and appearing to remove an earpiece. He announced this finding on live television on ''This Morning ''(ITV1). Shortly afterwards Morgan made a statement on her Facebook page saying: \"I have done and will continue to wear an earpiece... This is entirely normal and allows me to take stage directions and cues from my Stage Director. Just to be clear, I have never received anything other than stage direction or cues from my Stage Director through an earpiece.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/sallymorgantv/posts/263732197002482|title = Sally Morgan Facebook Page|date = 14 October 2011|accessdate = 11 October 2014|website = Facebook|publisher = |last = Morgan|first = Sally}}</ref>\n\nCiting \"substantial damage to her reputation, as well as hurt, distress and embarrassment\" Morgan filed a complaint to [[Associated Newspapers]] and sued for damages over their allegations made via a number of articles about the subject.
