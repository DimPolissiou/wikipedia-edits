To the east it borders the municipality of [[Moya, Las Palmas|Moya]] defined by [[Barranco de Moya]] until its mouth. To the west, the division follows some channels, surrounds the Pico de La Atalaya or G\u00e1ldar mountain, and continues to the coast, dividing the Pico de la Atalaya in two.\n\nThe coastline is defined between [[Caleta de Arriba]] until the mouth of the Barranco de Moya. The coasts are rocky due to erosion, cliffs predominate, although with exceptions such as San Felipe beach, which in summer is covered with sand.\n\n=== Climatology ===\nThe climatic conditions of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda derive from its northern position. Thus, there are three altitudinal steps, which are:\n\n* The coastal zone, which reaches up to 300 meters;\n* The medians between 300 and 600 meters;\n* The high zone, from 600 meters.\n\nAs it enters the interior of the island the number of sunny days per year is less; It rains more and temperatures are generally lower.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=center\n|cols=2\n| 1991 | 12383 \n| 1996 | 13117 \n| 2001 | 13893 \n| 2002 | 14171 \n| 2003 | 14255\n| 2004 | 14107 \n| 2013 | 13811\n}}\n\n==Heritage sites==\n\nThe [[caves of Valer\u00f3n]], also called ''cenobio de Valer\u00f3n'', is a [[property of cultural interest]] in the \"archaeological site\" category.

The change was approved in full by the local corporation on April 26, 1963, subsequently obtaining the approval of the [[Cabildo insular|Island Council]] de [[Gran Canaria]], which had been denied in the first instance, the change being to ''Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda de Gran Canaria'' by agreement of the Council of Ministers of the Franco government on July 23, 1963. <ref> {{cite web | url =http://www.descubreguia.com/contenidos/70-Historia.html | title = History | access-date = November 15, 2018}} </ref> <ref> {{cite book | title = Today, patron feast of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda | url =https://jable.ulpgc.es/jable/el.eco.de.canarias/1965/08/15/0005.htm?palabras=guia+gran+canaria | newspaper = El Eco de Canarias | date = 15 August 1965 | access-date = November 15, 2018}} </ref>\n\nIn 2008, the City Council promoted a debate from the municipal website for neighbors to express their opinion on whether or not to officially retake the name of ''Gu\u00eda de Gran Canaria''. <ref> {{cite news | first = M.

M\u00aa de Gu\u00eda.]]\nLocated in the north of Gran Canaria, the municipality has a triangular shape, which places its [[Vertex (geometry) | vertex]] towards the south, near the [[Volcanic caldera | caldera]] of the Pinos de [[ G\u00e1ldar]]. To the east it borders the municipality of [[Moya, Las Palmas|Moya]] defined by [[Barranco de Moya]] until its mouth. To the west, the division follows some channels, surrounds the Pico de La Atalaya or G\u00e1ldar mountain, and continues to the coast, dividing the Pico de la Atalaya in two.\n\nThe coastline is defined between [[Caleta de Arriba]] until the mouth of the Barranco de Moya. The coasts are rocky due to erosion, cliffs predominate, although with exceptions such as San Felipe beach, which in summer is covered with sand.\n\n=== Climatology ===\nThe climatic conditions of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda derive from its northern position. Thus, there are three altitudinal steps, which are:\n\n* The coastal zone, which reaches up to 300 meters;\n* The medians between 300 and 600 meters;\n* The high zone, from 600 meters.\n\nAs it enters the interior of the island the number of sunny days per year is less; It rains more and temperatures are generally lower.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=center\n|cols=2\n| 1991 | 12383 \n| 1996 | 13117 \n| 2001 | 13893 \n| 2002 | 14171 \n| 2003 | 14255\n| 2004 | 14107 \n| 2013 | 13811\n}}\n\n==Heritage sites==\n\nThe [[caves of Valer\u00f3n]], also called ''cenobio de Valer\u00f3n'', is a [[property of cultural interest]] in the \"archaeological site\" category. It is the largest pre-Hispanic collective granary. Its size is representative of Gran Canaria agriculture, unique among the Canaries islands in that it was traditionally dominated by plantations, with much of these being grains, rather than by stock-breeding.<ref name=\"arqu\">[http://www.arqueologiacanaria.com/Arqueologia_Canaria/Cenobio_de_Valeron.html Cenobio de Valeron], section \"''El yacimiento arqueologico''\". On ''arqueologiacanaria.com''.</ref>\n\nThe [[Casa Quintana|Quintana House]] is a sample of the ancient architecture of the municipality of Guia de Gran Canaria in the Canarian island of Gran Canaria, located in the Plaza Mayor de Gu\u00eda and its buildings date from the [[16th century]]. The Canarian balcony is of [[Mud\u00e9jar art|Mudejar style]], in wood and coat of arms with the surnames Guanarteme and Quintana.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of municipalities in Las Palmas]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mancomunidaddelnorte.org/guia.htm mancomunidaddelnorte.org]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda de Gran Canaria\n|North     = ''[[Atlantic Ocean]]''\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Moya, Las Palmas|Moya]]\n|Southeast = \n|South     = \n|Southwest = G\u00e1ldar\n|West      = [[G\u00e1ldar, Las Palmas|G\u00e1ldar]]\n|Northwest = \n}}\n\n{{Municipalities in Las Palmas|state=autocollapse}}\n\n{{Gran Canaria}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santa Maria de Guia de Gran Canaria}}\n[[Category:Municipalities in Gran Canaria]]\n", "name_user": "Error", "label": "safe", "comment": "{{for|the Christian image in the Philippines|Our Lady of Guidance}}", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Mar%C3%ADa_de_Gu%C3%ADa_de_Gran_Canaria"}

{"title_page": "Roman Senate", "text_new": "{{short description|Political institution in ancient Rome}}\n{{Roman government}}\n\nThe '''Roman Senate''' ({{lang-la|Sen\u0101tus R\u014dm\u0101nus}}) was a governing and advisory assembly in [[ancient Rome]]. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the [[Rome|city of Rome]] (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the [[king]]s in 509 BC, the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] in the 1st century BC, the division of the [[Roman Empire]] in AD 395, the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in AD 476, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries.\n\nDuring the days of the [[Roman Kingdom|kingdom]], most of the time the Senate was little more than an advisory council to the king, but it also elected new Roman kings. The last [[king of Rome]], [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], was overthrown following a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who founded the Roman Republic. During the early Republic, the [[Senate]] was politically weak, while the various executive magistrates were quite powerful. Since the transition from monarchy to constitutional rule was most likely gradual, it took several generations before the Senate was able to assert itself over the executive magistrates. By the middle Republic, the Senate had reached the apex of its republican power. The late Republic saw a decline in the Senate's power, which began following the reforms of the [[tribune]]s [[Gracchi|Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus]].\n\nAfter the transition of the Republic into the [[Principate]], the Senate lost much of its political power as well as its prestige. Following the constitutional reforms of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], the Senate became politically irrelevant. When the seat of government was transferred out of Rome, the Senate was reduced to a purely municipal body. This decline in status was reinforced when the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] created [[Byzantine Senate|an additional senate]] in [[Constantinople]].\n\nAfter [[Romulus Augustulus]] was deposed in 476, the Senate in the West functioned under the rule of [[Odoacer]] (476\u2013489) and during Ostrogothic rule (489\u2013535). It was restored after the reconquest of Italy by [[Justinian I]], but ultimately disappeared after AD 603, the date of its last recorded public act. The title \"senator\" continued into the Middle Ages as a largely meaningless honorific. The Eastern Senate survived in Constantinople through the 14th century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Senate of the Roman Kingdom===\n{{Main article|Senate of the Roman Kingdom|Constitution of the Roman Kingdom}}\n\nThe senate was a political institution in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]]. The word ''[[senate]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''[[senex]]'', which means \"old man\"; the word thus means \"assembly of elders\". The prehistoric [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] who settled Italy in the centuries before the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC<ref name=\"Abbott, 3\">Abbott, 3</ref> were structured into tribal communities,<ref name=\"Abbott, 1\">Abbott, 1</ref> and these communities often included an aristocratic board of tribal elders.<ref name=\"Abbott, 12\">Abbott, 12</ref>\n\nThe early Roman family was called a ''gens'' or \"clan\",<ref name=\"Abbott, 1\"/> and each clan was an aggregation of families under a common living male patriarch, called a ''[[paterfamilias|pater]]'' (the Latin word for \"father\").<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\">Abbott, 6</ref> When the early Roman ''gentes'' were aggregating to form a common community, the ''[[patres]]'' from the leading clans were selected<ref name=\"Abbott, 16\">Abbott, 16</ref> for the confederated board of elders that would become the Roman senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\"/> Over time, the ''patres'' came to recognize the need for a single leader, and so they elected a [[King of Rome|king]] (''rex''),<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\"/> and vested in him their sovereign power.<ref name=\"Byrd, 42\">Byrd, 42</ref> When the king died, that sovereign power naturally reverted to the ''patres''.<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\"/>\n\nThe senate is said to have been created by Rome's first king, [[Romulus]], initially consisting of 100 men. The descendants of those 100 men subsequently became the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] class.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#8|1:8]]</ref> Rome's fifth king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], chose a further 100 senators.  They were chosen from the minor leading families, and were accordingly called the ''patres minorum gentium''.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#35|1:35]]</ref>\n\nRome's seventh and final king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], executed many of the leading men in the senate, and did not replace them, thereby diminishing their number. However, in 509 BC Rome's first and third [[Roman consul|consuls]], [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] chose from amongst the leading equites new men for the senate, these being called ''conscripti'', and thus increased the size of the senate to 300.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#1|2.1]]</ref>\n\nThe senate of the [[Roman Kingdom]] held three principal responsibilities: It functioned as the ultimate repository for the executive power,<ref name=\"Abbott, 10\">Abbott, 10</ref> it served as the king's council, and it functioned as a legislative body in concert with the [[spqr|people of Rome]].<ref name=\"Abbott, 17\">Abbott, 17</ref> During the years of the monarchy, the senate's most important function was to elect new kings. While the king was nominally elected by the people, it was actually the senate who chose each new king.<ref name=\"Abbott, 10\"/>\n\nThe period between the death of one king and the election of a new king was called the ''[[interregnum]]'',<ref name=\"Abbott, 10\"/> during which time the [[Interrex]] nominated a candidate to replace the king.<ref name=\"Abbott, 14\">Abbott, 14</ref> After the senate gave its initial approval to the nominee, he was then formally elected by the people,<ref name=\"Byrd, 20\">Byrd, 20</ref> and then received the senate's final approval.<ref name=\"Abbott, 14\"/> At least one king, [[Servius Tullius]], was elected by the senate alone, and not by the people.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#41|1.41]]</ref>\n\nThe senate's most significant task, outside regal elections, was to function as the king's council, and while the king could ignore any advice it offered, its growing prestige helped make the advice that it offered increasingly difficult to ignore. Only the king could make new laws, although he often involved both the senate and the curiate assembly (the popular assembly) in the process.<ref name=\"Abbott, 17\"/>\n\n===Senate of the Roman Republic===\n{{Main article|Constitution of the Roman Republic|Senate of the Roman Republic}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|400px|Representation of a sitting of the Roman senate: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catiline]], from a 19th-century fresco in Palazzo Madama, Rome, house of the [[Italian Senate]]. It is worth noting that idealistic medieval and subsequent artistic depictions of the Senate in session are almost uniformly inaccurate. Illustrations commonly show the senators arranged in a semicircle around an open space where orators were deemed to stand; in reality the structure of the existing [[Curia Julia]] building, which dates in its current form from the Emperor [[Diocletian]], shows that the senators sat in straight and parallel lines on either side of the interior of the building. In current media depictions in film this is shown correctly in ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', and incorrectly in, for example, ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.]]\n[[File:Togatus Barberini 2392.PNG|thumb|The so-called \"[[Togatus Barberini]]\", a statue depicting a Roman senator holding the ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'' ([[effigies]]) of deceased ancestors in his hands; marble, late 1st century BC; head (not belonging): mid-1st century BC.]]\n\nWhen the Republic began, the Senate functioned as an advisory council.  It consisted of 300\u2013500 senators who served for life.  Only patricians were members in the early period, but plebeians were also admitted before long, although they were denied the senior magistracies for a longer period.\n\nSenators were entitled to wear a [[toga]] with a broad purple stripe, maroon shoes, and an iron (later gold) ring.\n\nThe Senate of the Roman Republic passed decrees called ''[[Senatus consultum|senatus consulta]]'', which in form constituted \"advice\" from the senate to a magistrate. While these decrees did not hold legal force, they usually were obeyed in practice.<ref name=\"Byrd, 44\">Byrd, 44</ref>\n\nIf a ''senatus consultum'' conflicted with a law (''lex'') that was passed by an [[Roman assemblies|assembly]], the law overrode the ''senatus consultum'' because the ''senatus consultum'' had its authority based in precedent and not in law. A ''senatus consultum'', however, could serve to interpret a law.<ref name=\"Abbott, 233\">Abbott, 233</ref>\n\nThrough these decrees, the senate directed the [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]], especially the [[Roman Consul]]s (the chief magistrates) in their prosecution of military conflicts. The senate also had an enormous degree of power over the civil government in Rome. This was especially the case with regard to its management of state finances, as only it could authorize the disbursal of public funds from the treasury. As the Roman Republic grew, the senate also supervised the administration of the provinces, which were governed by former consuls and [[praetors]], in that it decided which magistrate should govern which province.\n\nSince the 3rd century BC the senate also played a pivotal role in cases of emergency. It could call for the appointment of a [[Roman Dictator|dictator]] (a right resting with each consul with or without the senate's involvement). However, after 202 BC, the office of dictator fell out of use (and was revived only two more times) and was replaced with the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (\"ultimate decree of the senate\"), a senatorial decree which authorised the consuls to employ any means necessary to solve the crisis.<ref name=\"Abbott, 240\">Abbott, 240</ref>\n\nWhile senate meetings could take place either inside or outside the formal boundary of the city (the ''[[pomerium]]''), no meeting could take place more than a mile (1 km) outside it.<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\">Byrd, 34</ref> The senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the ''[[auspice]]s'') was taken.<ref name=\"Lintott, 72\">Lintott, 72</ref> The senate was only allowed to assemble in places dedicated to the gods.\n\nMeetings usually began at dawn, and a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] who wished to summon the senate had to issue a compulsory order.<ref name=\"Lintott, 75\">Lintott, 75</ref> The senate meetings were public<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/> and directed by a presiding magistrate (usually a [[Roman consul|consul]]).<ref name=\"Byrd, 42\"/> While in session, the senate had the power to act on its own, and even against the will of the presiding magistrate if it wished. The presiding magistrate began each meeting with a speech,<ref name=\"Lintott, 78\">Lintott, 78</ref> then referred an issue to the senators, who would discuss it in order of seniority.<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/>\n\nSenators had several other ways in which they could influence (or frustrate) a presiding magistrate. For example, every senator was permitted to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall,<ref name=\"Byrd, 44\"/> a dedicated group or even a single senator could talk a proposal to death (a [[filibuster]] or ''diem consumere'').<ref name=\"Lintott, 78\"/> When it was time to call a vote, the presiding magistrate could bring up whatever proposals he wished, and every vote was between a proposal and its negative.<ref name=\"Lintott, 83\">Lintott, 83</ref>\n\nWith a dictator as well as a senate, the senate could veto any of the dictator's decisions. At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be [[veto]]ed, usually by a [[tribune]]. If there were no veto, and the matter were of minor importance, it could be put to either a voice vote or a show of hands. If there were no veto and no obvious majority, and the matter were of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house,<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/> with senators voting by taking a place on either side of the chamber.\n\nSenate membership was controlled by the [[Roman censor|censors]].  By the time of [[Augustus]], ownership of property worth at least one million sesterces was required for membership. The ethical requirements of senators were significant. In contrast to members of the [[Equestrian order]], senators could not engage in banking or any form of public contract. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce,<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/> they could not leave Italy without permission from the rest of the senate and they were not paid a salary. Election to magisterial office resulted in automatic senate membership.<ref name=\"Byrd, 36\">Byrd, 36</ref>\n\n===Senate of the Roman Empire===\n{{Main article|Constitution of the Roman Empire|Senate of the Roman Empire|Constitution of the Late Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Republic]], the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman senate to the [[Roman Emperor]]. Though retaining its legal position as under the republic, in practice, however, the actual authority of the imperial senate was negligible, as the emperor held the true power in the state. As such, membership in the senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than actual authority.\n\nDuring the reigns of the first emperors, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers were all transferred from the [[Roman assemblies]] to the senate. However, since the emperor held control over the senate, the senate acted as a vehicle through which he exercised his autocratic powers.\n\n[[File:Curia Iulia.JPG|thumb|300px|The [[Curia Julia]] in the [[Roman Forum]], the seat of the imperial Senate.]]\nThe first emperor, [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], reduced the size of the senate from 900 members to 600, even though there were only about 100 to 200 active senators at one time. After this point, the size of the senate was never again drastically altered. Under the empire, as was the case during the late republic, one could become a senator by being elected ''[[quaestor]]'' (a magistrate with financial duties), but only if one were already of senatorial rank.<ref name=\"Abbott, 381\">Abbott, 381</ref> In addition to quaestors, elected officials holding a range of senior positions were routinely granted senatorial rank by virtue of the offices that they held.<ref>Metz, 59, 60</ref>\n\nIf an individual were not of senatorial rank, there were two ways for him to become a senator. Under the first method, the emperor manually granted that individual the authority to stand for election to the quaestorship,<ref name=\"Abbott, 381\"/> while under the second method, the emperor appointed that individual to the senate by issuing a decree.<ref name=\"Abbott, 382\">Abbott, 382</ref> Under the empire, the power that the emperor held over the senate was absolute.<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\">Abbott, 385</ref>\n\nThe two consuls were a part of the senate, but had more power than the senators. During senate meetings, the emperor sat between the two consuls,<ref name=\"Abbott, 383\">Abbott, 383</ref> and usually acted as the presiding officer. Senators of the early empire could ask extraneous questions or request that a certain action be taken by the senate. Higher ranking senators spoke before those of lower rank, although the emperor could speak at any time.<ref name=\"Abbott, 383\"/>\n\nBesides the emperor, consuls and praetors could also preside over the senate. Since no senator could stand for election to a magisterial office without the emperor's approval, senators usually did not vote against bills that had been presented by the emperor. If a senator disapproved of a bill, he usually showed his disapproval by not attending the senate meeting on the day that the bill were to be voted on.<ref name=\"Abbott, 384\">Abbott, 384</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Roman assemblies]] continued to meet after the founding of the empire, their powers were all transferred to the senate, and so senatorial decrees (''senatus consulta'') acquired the full force of law.<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\"/> The legislative powers of the imperial senate were principally of a financial and an administrative nature, although the senate did retain a range of powers over the provinces.<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\"/>\n\nDuring the early Roman Empire, all judicial powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies were also transferred to the senate. For example, the senate now held jurisdiction over criminal trials. In these cases, a consul presided, the senators constituted the jury, and the verdict was handed down in the form of a decree (''senatus consultum''),<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\"/><ref name=\"Abbott, 386\">Abbott, 386</ref> and, while a verdict could not be appealed, the emperor could pardon a convicted individual through a veto. The emperor [[Tiberius]] transferred all electoral powers from the assemblies to the senate,<ref name=\"Abbott, 386\"/> and, while theoretically the senate elected new magistrates, the approval of the emperor was always needed before an election could be finalized.\n\nAround 300 AD, the emperor [[Diocletian]] enacted a series of constitutional reforms. In one such reform, he asserted the right of the emperor to take power without the theoretical consent of the senate, thus depriving the senate of its status as the ultimate depository of supreme power. Diocletian's reforms also ended whatever illusion had remained that the senate had independent legislative, judicial, or electoral powers. The senate did, however, retain its legislative powers over public games in Rome, and over the senatorial order.\n\nThe senate also retained the power to try treason cases, and to elect some magistrates, but only with the permission of the emperor. In the final years of the western empire, the senate would sometimes try to appoint their own emperor, such as in the case of [[Eugenius]], who was later defeated by forces loyal to [[Theodosius I]]. The senate remained the last stronghold of the traditional Roman religion in the face of the spreading Christianity, and several times attempted to facilitate the return of the [[Altar of Victory]] (first removed by [[Constantius II]]) to the senatorial curia.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' (''Elagabalus'' 4.2 and 12.3) emperor [[Elagabalus]] had his mother or grandmother take part in Senate proceedings. \"And Elagabalus was the only one of all the emperors under whom a woman attended the senate like a man, just as though she belonged to the senatorial order\" (David Magie's translation). According to the same work, Elagabalus also established a women's senate called the ''senaculum'', which enacted rules to be applied to matrons, regarding clothing, chariot riding, the wearing of jewelry etc. (''Elagabalus'' 4.3 and ''Aurelian'' 49.6). Before this, [[Agrippina the Younger]], mother of [[Nero]], had been ''listening'' to Senate proceedings, concealed behind a curtain, according to [[Tacitus]] (''Annales'', 13.5).\n\n===Post-Imperial Senate in Rome===\n\n====Senate in the West====\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the senate continued to function under the Germanic chieftain [[Odoacer]], and then under [[Ostrogothic]] rule. The authority of the senate rose considerably under barbarian leaders, who sought to protect the institution. This period was characterized by the rise of prominent Roman senatorial families, such as the [[Anicii]], while the senate's leader, the [[princeps senatus]], often served as the right hand of the barbarian leader. It is known that the senate successfully installed [[Antipope Laurentius|Laurentius]] as pope in 498, despite the fact that both King Theodoric and Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]] supported the other candidate, [[Pope Symmachus|Symmachus]].<ref name=\"Levillain2002\">Levillain, 907</ref>\n\nThe peaceful coexistence of senatorial and barbarian rule continued until the Ostrogothic leader [[Theodahad]] found himself at war with Emperor [[Justinian I]] and took the senators as hostages. Several senators were executed in 552 as revenge for the death of the Ostrogothic king, [[Totila]]. After Rome was recaptured by the imperial ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) army, the senate was restored, but the institution (like classical Rome itself) had been mortally weakened by the long war. Many senators had been killed and many of those who had fled to the east chose to remain there, thanks to favorable legislation passed by Emperor Justinian, who, however, abolished virtually all senatorial offices in Italy. The importance of the Roman senate thus declined rapidly.<ref name=\"Schnurer, 339\">Schnurer, 339</ref>\n\nIn 578 and again in 580, the senate sent envoys to Constantinople. They delivered 3000 pounds (=1,360 kilograms) of gold as a gift to the new emperor, [[Tiberius II Constantinus]], along with a plea for help against the [[Lombards]], who had invaded Italy ten years earlier. [[Pope Gregory I]], in a sermon from 593, lamented the almost complete disappearance of the senatorial order and the decline of the prestigious institution.<ref name=\"NeilSanto2013\">Bronwen, 3. \"For since the Senate has failed, the people have perished, and the sufferings and groans of the few who remain are multiplied each day. Rome, now empty, is burning!\"</ref><ref name=\"CooperHillner2007\">Cooper, 23</ref>\n\nIt is not clearly known when the Roman senate disappeared in the West, but it is known from the Gregorian register that the senate acclaimed new statues of Emperor [[Phocas]] and Empress [[Leontia]] in 603,<ref name=\"Levillain2002b\"/><ref>Richards, 246</ref> and that was also the last time the senate was mentioned.<ref name=\"Levillain2002b\">Levillain 1047</ref> In 630, the house of the Senate, [[Curia Julia]], was transformed into a church by [[Pope Honorius I]], probably with the permission of the Emperor [[Heraclius]].<ref name=\"Kaegi2003\">Kaegi, 196</ref>\n\nIn later medieval times, the title \"senator\" was still in occasional use, but it had become a meaningless adjunct title of nobility and no longer implied membership in an organized governing body.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n \nIn 1144, the [[Commune of Rome]] attempted to establish a government modeled on the old [[Roman Republic]] in opposition to the temporal power of the higher nobles and the [[pope]]. This included setting up a senate along the lines of the ancient one. The revolutionaries divided Rome into fourteen ''[[14 regions of Medieval Rome|regions]]'', each electing four senators for a total of 56 (although one source,{{which|date=March 2013}}{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} often repeated, gives a total of 50).  These senators elected as their leader [[Giordano Pierleoni]], son of the Roman consul [[Pier Leoni]], with the title [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]], since ''[[Roman consul|consul]]'' was also a deprecated noble styling.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThis renovated form of government was constantly embattled. By the end of the 12th century, it had undergone a radical transformation, with the reduction of the number of senators to a single one \u2013 ''[[Summus Senator]]'' \u2013 being thereafter the title of the head of the civil government of Rome. In modern terms, for example, this is comparable to the reduction of a board of commissioners to a single commissioner, such as the [[New York City Police Commissioner|political head of the police department of New York City]]. Between 1191 and 1193, this was a certain Benedetto called ''Carus homo'' or ''carissimo''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n====Senate in the East====\n{{Main article|Byzantine Senate}}\nThe senate continued to exist in Constantinople however, although it evolved into an institution that differed in some fundamental forms from its predecessor. Designated in Greek as ''synkletos'', or assembly, the Senate of Constantinople was made up of all current or former holders of senior ranks and official positions, plus their descendants. At its height during the 6th and 7th centuries, the Senate represented the collective wealth and power of the Empire, on occasion nominating and dominating individual emperors.<ref>Runciman, 60.</ref>\n   \nIn the second half of the 10th century a new office, ''[[proedros|pro\u00ebdrus]]'' ({{lang-gr|\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}), was created as head of the senate by Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]]. Up to the mid-11th century, only [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] could become pro\u00ebdrus, but later this restriction was lifted and several pro\u00ebdri could be appointed, of which the senior pro\u00ebdrus, or ''protopro\u00ebdrus'' ({{lang-gr|\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}), served as the head of the senate. There were two types of meetings practised: ''silentium'', in which only magistrates currently in office participated and ''conventus'', in which all syncletics ({{lang-gr|\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af}}, senators) could participate. The Senate in Constantinople existed until at least the beginning of the 13th century, its last known act being the election of [[Nicolas Canabus]] as emperor in 1204 during the [[Fourth Crusade]].<ref>Phillips, 222\u2013226.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Acta Senatus]]\n* [[Aedile]]\n* [[Centuria]]\n* [[Curia]]\n* [[Curiate Assembly|Comitia curiata]]\n* [[Gerousia]]\n* [[SPQR]]\n* [[Cursus honorum]]\n* [[Interrex]]\n* [[Master of the Horse]]\n* [[Pontifex Maximus]]\n* [[Princeps senatus]]\n* [[Promagistrate]]\n* [[Roman Law]]\n* [[Plebeian Council]]\n* [[Praetor]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n\n* [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=546&chapter=83299&layout=html&Itemid=27 Cicero, Marcus Tullius ''De Re Publica'', Book Two]\n* Cicero, Marcus Tullius (1841).

It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the [[Rome|city of Rome]] (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the [[king]]s in 509 BC, the fall of the [[Roman Republic]] in the 1st century BC, the division of the [[Roman Empire]] in AD 395, the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in AD 476, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries.\n\nDuring the days of the [[Roman Kingdom|kingdom]], most of the time the Senate was little more than an advisory council to the king, but it also elected new Roman kings. The last [[king of Rome]], [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], was overthrown following a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who founded the Roman Republic. During the early Republic, the [[Senate]] was politically weak, while the various executive magistrates were quite powerful. Since the transition from monarchy to constitutional rule was most likely gradual, it took several generations before the Senate was able to assert itself over the executive magistrates. By the middle Republic, the Senate had reached the apex of its republican power. The late Republic saw a decline in the Senate's power, which began following the reforms of the [[tribune]]s [[Gracchi|Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus]].\n\nAfter the transition of the Republic into the [[Principate]], the Senate lost much of its political power as well as its prestige. Following the constitutional reforms of the Emperor [[Diocletian]], the Senate became politically irrelevant. When the seat of government was transferred out of Rome, the Senate was reduced to a purely municipal body. This decline in status was reinforced when the emperor [[Constantine the Great]] created [[Byzantine Senate|an additional senate]] in [[Constantinople]].\n\nAfter [[Romulus Augustulus]] was deposed in 476, the Senate in the West functioned under the rule of Odovacer (476\u2013489) and during Ostrogothic rule (489\u2013535). It was restored after the reconquest of Italy by [[Justinian I]], but ultimately disappeared after AD 603, the date of its last recorded public act. The title \"senator\" continued into the Middle Ages as a largely meaningless honorific. The Eastern Senate survived in Constantinople through the 14th century.\n\n==History==\n\n===Senate of the Roman Kingdom===\n{{Main article|Senate of the Roman Kingdom|Constitution of the Roman Kingdom}}\n\nThe senate was a political institution in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]]. The word ''[[senate]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] word ''[[senex]]'', which means \"old man\"; the word thus means \"assembly of elders\". The prehistoric [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] who settled Italy in the centuries before the legendary founding of Rome in 753 BC<ref name=\"Abbott, 3\">Abbott, 3</ref> were structured into tribal communities,<ref name=\"Abbott, 1\">Abbott, 1</ref> and these communities often included an aristocratic board of tribal elders.<ref name=\"Abbott, 12\">Abbott, 12</ref>\n\nThe early Roman family was called a ''gens'' or \"clan\",<ref name=\"Abbott, 1\"/> and each clan was an aggregation of families under a common living male patriarch, called a ''[[paterfamilias|pater]]'' (the Latin word for \"father\").<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\">Abbott, 6</ref> When the early Roman ''gentes'' were aggregating to form a common community, the ''[[patres]]'' from the leading clans were selected<ref name=\"Abbott, 16\">Abbott, 16</ref> for the confederated board of elders that would become the Roman senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\"/> Over time, the ''patres'' came to recognize the need for a single leader, and so they elected a [[King of Rome|king]] (''rex''),<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\"/> and vested in him their sovereign power.<ref name=\"Byrd, 42\">Byrd, 42</ref> When the king died, that sovereign power naturally reverted to the ''patres''.<ref name=\"Abbott, 6\"/>\n\nThe senate is said to have been created by Rome's first king, [[Romulus]], initially consisting of 100 men. The descendants of those 100 men subsequently became the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] class.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#8|1:8]]</ref> Rome's fifth king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], chose a further 100 senators.  They were chosen from the minor leading families, and were accordingly called the ''patres minorum gentium''.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#35|1:35]]</ref>\n\nRome's seventh and final king, [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], executed many of the leading men in the senate, and did not replace them, thereby diminishing their number. However, in 509 BC Rome's first and third [[Roman consul|consuls]], [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Publius Valerius Publicola]] chose from amongst the leading equites new men for the senate, these being called ''conscripti'', and thus increased the size of the senate to 300.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 2#1|2.1]]</ref>\n\nThe senate of the [[Roman Kingdom]] held three principal responsibilities: It functioned as the ultimate repository for the executive power,<ref name=\"Abbott, 10\">Abbott, 10</ref> it served as the king's council, and it functioned as a legislative body in concert with the [[spqr|people of Rome]].<ref name=\"Abbott, 17\">Abbott, 17</ref> During the years of the monarchy, the senate's most important function was to elect new kings. While the king was nominally elected by the people, it was actually the senate who chose each new king.<ref name=\"Abbott, 10\"/>\n\nThe period between the death of one king and the election of a new king was called the ''[[interregnum]]'',<ref name=\"Abbott, 10\"/> during which time the [[Interrex]] nominated a candidate to replace the king.<ref name=\"Abbott, 14\">Abbott, 14</ref> After the senate gave its initial approval to the nominee, he was then formally elected by the people,<ref name=\"Byrd, 20\">Byrd, 20</ref> and then received the senate's final approval.<ref name=\"Abbott, 14\"/> At least one king, [[Servius Tullius]], was elected by the senate alone, and not by the people.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 1#41|1.41]]</ref>\n\nThe senate's most significant task, outside regal elections, was to function as the king's council, and while the king could ignore any advice it offered, its growing prestige helped make the advice that it offered increasingly difficult to ignore. Only the king could make new laws, although he often involved both the senate and the curiate assembly (the popular assembly) in the process.<ref name=\"Abbott, 17\"/>\n\n===Senate of the Roman Republic===\n{{Main article|Constitution of the Roman Republic|Senate of the Roman Republic}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|400px|Representation of a sitting of the Roman senate: [[Cicero]] attacks [[Catiline]], from a 19th-century fresco in Palazzo Madama, Rome, house of the [[Italian Senate]]. It is worth noting that idealistic medieval and subsequent artistic depictions of the Senate in session are almost uniformly inaccurate. Illustrations commonly show the senators arranged in a semicircle around an open space where orators were deemed to stand; in reality the structure of the existing [[Curia Julia]] building, which dates in its current form from the Emperor [[Diocletian]], shows that the senators sat in straight and parallel lines on either side of the interior of the building. In current media depictions in film this is shown correctly in ''[[The Fall of the Roman Empire (film)|The Fall of the Roman Empire]]'', and incorrectly in, for example, ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.]]\n[[File:Togatus Barberini 2392.PNG|thumb|The so-called \"[[Togatus Barberini]]\", a statue depicting a Roman senator holding the ''[[Roman funerals and burial#Funerary art|imagines]]'' ([[effigies]]) of deceased ancestors in his hands; marble, late 1st century BC; head (not belonging): mid-1st century BC.]]\n\nWhen the Republic began, the Senate functioned as an advisory council.  It consisted of 300\u2013500 senators who served for life.  Only patricians were members in the early period, but plebeians were also admitted before long, although they were denied the senior magistracies for a longer period.\n\nSenators were entitled to wear a [[toga]] with a broad purple stripe, maroon shoes, and an iron (later gold) ring.\n\nThe Senate of the Roman Republic passed decrees called ''[[Senatus consultum|senatus consulta]]'', which in form constituted \"advice\" from the senate to a magistrate. While these decrees did not hold legal force, they usually were obeyed in practice.<ref name=\"Byrd, 44\">Byrd, 44</ref>\n\nIf a ''senatus consultum'' conflicted with a law (''lex'') that was passed by an [[Roman assemblies|assembly]], the law overrode the ''senatus consultum'' because the ''senatus consultum'' had its authority based in precedent and not in law. A ''senatus consultum'', however, could serve to interpret a law.<ref name=\"Abbott, 233\">Abbott, 233</ref>\n\nThrough these decrees, the senate directed the [[Roman magistrate|magistrates]], especially the [[Roman Consul]]s (the chief magistrates) in their prosecution of military conflicts. The senate also had an enormous degree of power over the civil government in Rome. This was especially the case with regard to its management of state finances, as only it could authorize the disbursal of public funds from the treasury. As the Roman Republic grew, the senate also supervised the administration of the provinces, which were governed by former consuls and [[praetors]], in that it decided which magistrate should govern which province.\n\nSince the 3rd century BC the senate also played a pivotal role in cases of emergency. It could call for the appointment of a [[Roman Dictator|dictator]] (a right resting with each consul with or without the senate's involvement). However, after 202 BC, the office of dictator fell out of use (and was revived only two more times) and was replaced with the ''[[senatus consultum ultimum]]'' (\"ultimate decree of the senate\"), a senatorial decree which authorised the consuls to employ any means necessary to solve the crisis.<ref name=\"Abbott, 240\">Abbott, 240</ref>\n\nWhile senate meetings could take place either inside or outside the formal boundary of the city (the ''[[pomerium]]''), no meeting could take place more than a mile (1 km) outside it.<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\">Byrd, 34</ref> The senate operated while under various religious restrictions. For example, before any meeting could begin, a sacrifice to the gods was made, and a search for divine omens (the ''[[auspice]]s'') was taken.<ref name=\"Lintott, 72\">Lintott, 72</ref> The senate was only allowed to assemble in places dedicated to the gods.\n\nMeetings usually began at dawn, and a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]] who wished to summon the senate had to issue a compulsory order.<ref name=\"Lintott, 75\">Lintott, 75</ref> The senate meetings were public<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/> and directed by a presiding magistrate (usually a [[Roman consul|consul]]).<ref name=\"Byrd, 42\"/> While in session, the senate had the power to act on its own, and even against the will of the presiding magistrate if it wished. The presiding magistrate began each meeting with a speech,<ref name=\"Lintott, 78\">Lintott, 78</ref> then referred an issue to the senators, who would discuss it in order of seniority.<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/>\n\nSenators had several other ways in which they could influence (or frustrate) a presiding magistrate. For example, every senator was permitted to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall,<ref name=\"Byrd, 44\"/> a dedicated group or even a single senator could talk a proposal to death (a [[filibuster]] or ''diem consumere'').<ref name=\"Lintott, 78\"/> When it was time to call a vote, the presiding magistrate could bring up whatever proposals he wished, and every vote was between a proposal and its negative.<ref name=\"Lintott, 83\">Lintott, 83</ref>\n\nWith a dictator as well as a senate, the senate could veto any of the dictator's decisions. At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be [[veto]]ed, usually by a [[tribune]]. If there were no veto, and the matter were of minor importance, it could be put to either a voice vote or a show of hands. If there were no veto and no obvious majority, and the matter were of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house,<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/> with senators voting by taking a place on either side of the chamber.\n\nSenate membership was controlled by the [[Roman censor|censors]].  By the time of [[Augustus]], ownership of property worth at least one million sesterces was required for membership. The ethical requirements of senators were significant. In contrast to members of the [[Equestrian order]], senators could not engage in banking or any form of public contract. They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce,<ref name=\"Byrd, 34\"/> they could not leave Italy without permission from the rest of the senate and they were not paid a salary. Election to magisterial office resulted in automatic senate membership.<ref name=\"Byrd, 36\">Byrd, 36</ref>\n\n===Senate of the Roman Empire===\n{{Main article|Constitution of the Roman Empire|Senate of the Roman Empire|Constitution of the Late Roman Empire}}\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Republic]], the constitutional balance of power shifted from the Roman senate to the [[Roman Emperor]]. Though retaining its legal position as under the republic, in practice, however, the actual authority of the imperial senate was negligible, as the emperor held the true power in the state. As such, membership in the senate became sought after by individuals seeking prestige and social standing, rather than actual authority.\n\nDuring the reigns of the first emperors, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers were all transferred from the [[Roman assemblies]] to the senate. However, since the emperor held control over the senate, the senate acted as a vehicle through which he exercised his autocratic powers.\n\n[[File:Curia Iulia.JPG|thumb|300px|The [[Curia Julia]] in the [[Roman Forum]], the seat of the imperial Senate.]]\nThe first emperor, [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]], reduced the size of the senate from 900 members to 600, even though there were only about 100 to 200 active senators at one time. After this point, the size of the senate was never again drastically altered. Under the empire, as was the case during the late republic, one could become a senator by being elected ''[[quaestor]]'' (a magistrate with financial duties), but only if one were already of senatorial rank.<ref name=\"Abbott, 381\">Abbott, 381</ref> In addition to quaestors, elected officials holding a range of senior positions were routinely granted senatorial rank by virtue of the offices that they held.<ref>Metz, 59, 60</ref>\n\nIf an individual were not of senatorial rank, there were two ways for him to become a senator. Under the first method, the emperor manually granted that individual the authority to stand for election to the quaestorship,<ref name=\"Abbott, 381\"/> while under the second method, the emperor appointed that individual to the senate by issuing a decree.<ref name=\"Abbott, 382\">Abbott, 382</ref> Under the empire, the power that the emperor held over the senate was absolute.<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\">Abbott, 385</ref>\n\nThe two consuls were a part of the senate, but had more power than the senators. During senate meetings, the emperor sat between the two consuls,<ref name=\"Abbott, 383\">Abbott, 383</ref> and usually acted as the presiding officer. Senators of the early empire could ask extraneous questions or request that a certain action be taken by the senate. Higher ranking senators spoke before those of lower rank, although the emperor could speak at any time.<ref name=\"Abbott, 383\"/>\n\nBesides the emperor, consuls and praetors could also preside over the senate. Since no senator could stand for election to a magisterial office without the emperor's approval, senators usually did not vote against bills that had been presented by the emperor. If a senator disapproved of a bill, he usually showed his disapproval by not attending the senate meeting on the day that the bill were to be voted on.<ref name=\"Abbott, 384\">Abbott, 384</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Roman assemblies]] continued to meet after the founding of the empire, their powers were all transferred to the senate, and so senatorial decrees (''senatus consulta'') acquired the full force of law.<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\"/> The legislative powers of the imperial senate were principally of a financial and an administrative nature, although the senate did retain a range of powers over the provinces.<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\"/>\n\nDuring the early Roman Empire, all judicial powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies were also transferred to the senate. For example, the senate now held jurisdiction over criminal trials. In these cases, a consul presided, the senators constituted the jury, and the verdict was handed down in the form of a decree (''senatus consultum''),<ref name=\"Abbott, 385\"/><ref name=\"Abbott, 386\">Abbott, 386</ref> and, while a verdict could not be appealed, the emperor could pardon a convicted individual through a veto. The emperor [[Tiberius]] transferred all electoral powers from the assemblies to the senate,<ref name=\"Abbott, 386\"/> and, while theoretically the senate elected new magistrates, the approval of the emperor was always needed before an election could be finalized.\n\nAround 300 AD, the emperor [[Diocletian]] enacted a series of constitutional reforms. In one such reform, he asserted the right of the emperor to take power without the theoretical consent of the senate, thus depriving the senate of its status as the ultimate depository of supreme power. Diocletian's reforms also ended whatever illusion had remained that the senate had independent legislative, judicial, or electoral powers. The senate did, however, retain its legislative powers over public games in Rome, and over the senatorial order.\n\nThe senate also retained the power to try treason cases, and to elect some magistrates, but only with the permission of the emperor. In the final years of the western empire, the senate would sometimes try to appoint their own emperor, such as in the case of [[Eugenius]], who was later defeated by forces loyal to [[Theodosius I]]. The senate remained the last stronghold of the traditional Roman religion in the face of the spreading Christianity, and several times attempted to facilitate the return of the [[Altar of Victory]] (first removed by [[Constantius II]]) to the senatorial curia.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' (''Elagabalus'' 4.2 and 12.3) emperor [[Elagabalus]] had his mother or grandmother take part in Senate proceedings. \"And Elagabalus was the only one of all the emperors under whom a woman attended the senate like a man, just as though she belonged to the senatorial order\" (David Magie's translation). According to the same work, Elagabalus also established a women's senate called the ''senaculum'', which enacted rules to be applied to matrons, regarding clothing, chariot riding, the wearing of jewelry etc. (''Elagabalus'' 4.3 and ''Aurelian'' 49.6). Before this, [[Agrippina the Younger]], mother of [[Nero]], had been ''listening'' to Senate proceedings, concealed behind a curtain, according to [[Tacitus]] (''Annales'', 13.5).\n\n===Post-Imperial Senate in Rome===\n\n====Senate in the West====\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the senate continued to function under the Germanic chieftain [[Odoacer]], and then under [[Ostrogothic]] rule. The authority of the senate rose considerably under barbarian leaders, who sought to protect the institution. This period was characterized by the rise of prominent Roman senatorial families, such as the [[Anicii]], while the senate's leader, the [[princeps senatus]], often served as the right hand of the barbarian leader. It is known that the senate successfully installed [[Antipope Laurentius|Laurentius]] as pope in 498, despite the fact that both King Theodoric and Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius]] supported the other candidate, [[Pope Symmachus|Symmachus]].<ref name=\"Levillain2002\">Levillain, 907</ref>\n\nThe peaceful coexistence of senatorial and barbarian rule continued until the Ostrogothic leader [[Theodahad]] found himself at war with Emperor [[Justinian I]] and took the senators as hostages. Several senators were executed in 552 as revenge for the death of the Ostrogothic king, [[Totila]]. After Rome was recaptured by the imperial ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]) army, the senate was restored, but the institution (like classical Rome itself) had been mortally weakened by the long war. Many senators had been killed and many of those who had fled to the east chose to remain there, thanks to favorable legislation passed by Emperor Justinian, who, however, abolished virtually all senatorial offices in Italy. The importance of the Roman senate thus declined rapidly.<ref name=\"Schnurer, 339\">Schnurer, 339</ref>\n\nIn 578 and again in 580, the senate sent envoys to Constantinople. They delivered 3000 pounds (=1,360 kilograms) of gold as a gift to the new emperor, [[Tiberius II Constantinus]], along with a plea for help against the [[Lombards]], who had invaded Italy ten years earlier. [[Pope Gregory I]], in a sermon from 593, lamented the almost complete disappearance of the senatorial order and the decline of the prestigious institution.<ref name=\"NeilSanto2013\">Bronwen, 3. \"For since the Senate has failed, the people have perished, and the sufferings and groans of the few who remain are multiplied each day. Rome, now empty, is burning!\"</ref><ref name=\"CooperHillner2007\">Cooper, 23</ref>\n\nIt is not clearly known when the Roman senate disappeared in the West, but it is known from the Gregorian register that the senate acclaimed new statues of Emperor [[Phocas]] and Empress [[Leontia]] in 603,<ref name=\"Levillain2002b\"/><ref>Richards, 246</ref> and that was also the last time the senate was mentioned.<ref name=\"Levillain2002b\">Levillain 1047</ref> In 630, the house of the Senate, [[Curia Julia]], was transformed into a church by [[Pope Honorius I]], probably with the permission of the Emperor [[Heraclius]].<ref name=\"Kaegi2003\">Kaegi, 196</ref>\n\nIn later medieval times, the title \"senator\" was still in occasional use, but it had become a meaningless adjunct title of nobility and no longer implied membership in an organized governing body.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n \nIn 1144, the [[Commune of Rome]] attempted to establish a government modeled on the old [[Roman Republic]] in opposition to the temporal power of the higher nobles and the [[pope]]. This included setting up a senate along the lines of the ancient one. The revolutionaries divided Rome into fourteen ''[[14 regions of Medieval Rome|regions]]'', each electing four senators for a total of 56 (although one source,{{which|date=March 2013}}{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} often repeated, gives a total of 50).  These senators elected as their leader [[Giordano Pierleoni]], son of the Roman consul [[Pier Leoni]], with the title [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]], since ''[[Roman consul|consul]]'' was also a deprecated noble styling.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThis renovated form of government was constantly embattled. By the end of the 12th century, it had undergone a radical transformation, with the reduction of the number of senators to a single one \u2013 ''[[Summus Senator]]'' \u2013 being thereafter the title of the head of the civil government of Rome. In modern terms, for example, this is comparable to the reduction of a board of commissioners to a single commissioner, such as the [[New York City Police Commissioner|political head of the police department of New York City]]. Between 1191 and 1193, this was a certain Benedetto called ''Carus homo'' or ''carissimo''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n====Senate in the East====\n{{Main article|Byzantine Senate}}\nThe senate continued to exist in Constantinople however, although it evolved into an institution that differed in some fundamental forms from its predecessor. Designated in Greek as ''synkletos'', or assembly, the Senate of Constantinople was made up of all current or former holders of senior ranks and official positions, plus their descendants. At its height during the 6th and 7th centuries, the Senate represented the collective wealth and power of the Empire, on occasion nominating and dominating individual emperors.<ref>Runciman, 60.</ref>\n   \nIn the second half of the 10th century a new office, ''[[proedros|pro\u00ebdrus]]'' ({{lang-gr|\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}), was created as head of the senate by Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]]. Up to the mid-11th century, only [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] could become pro\u00ebdrus, but later this restriction was lifted and several pro\u00ebdri could be appointed, of which the senior pro\u00ebdrus, or ''protopro\u00ebdrus'' ({{lang-gr|\u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b5\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}), served as the head of the senate. There were two types of meetings practised: ''silentium'', in which only magistrates currently in office participated and ''conventus'', in which all syncletics ({{lang-gr|\u03c3\u03c5\u03b3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af}}, senators) could participate. The Senate in Constantinople existed until at least the beginning of the 13th century, its last known act being the election of [[Nicolas Canabus]] as emperor in 1204 during the [[Fourth Crusade]].<ref>Phillips, 222\u2013226.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* [[Acta Senatus]]\n* [[Aedile]]\n* [[Centuria]]\n* [[Curia]]\n* [[Curiate Assembly|Comitia curiata]]\n* [[Gerousia]]\n* [[SPQR]]\n* [[Cursus honorum]]\n* [[Interrex]]\n* [[Master of the Horse]]\n* [[Pontifex Maximus]]\n* [[Princeps senatus]]\n* [[Promagistrate]]\n* [[Roman Law]]\n* [[Plebeian Council]]\n* [[Praetor]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n\n* [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=546&chapter=83299&layout=html&Itemid=27 Cicero, Marcus Tullius ''De Re Publica'', Book Two]\n* Cicero, Marcus Tullius (1841).

In ''[[Philosophy of Right]]'', [[Hegel]] had supported the role of specialized officials in [[public administration]], although he never used the term \"bureaucracy\" himself. By contrast, Marx was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while [[corporation|corporate]] and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist. He wrote that \"The Corporation is civil society's attempt to become state; but the bureaucracy is the state which has really made itself into civil society.\"<ref name=\"Marx1843\"/>\n\n===John Stuart Mill===\nWriting in the early 1860s, political scientist [[John Stuart Mill]] theorized that successful monarchies were essentially bureaucracies, and found evidence of their existence in [[Imperial China]], the [[Russian Empire]], and the regimes of [[Europe]]. Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election. Mill wrote that ultimately the bureaucracy stifles the mind, and that \"a bureaucracy always tends to become a pedantocracy.\"<ref name=\"Mill\"/>\n\n===Max Weber===<!--'Weberian bureaucracy' redirects here-->\n{{Quote box\n| quote = The fully developed bureaucratic apparatus compares with other organisations exactly as does the machine with the non-mechanical modes of production.\n|The fully developed bureaucratic apparatus compares with other organisations exactly as does the machine with the non-mechanical modes of production.|\u2013'''Max Weber'''<ref>\"Bureaucracy\" from Weber\u2019s Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy, and Social Stratification.

Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that \"is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress.\"\n\nWilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, \"Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices\". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.<ref>Christopher Hood (30 March 2000).

Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to \"the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life.\" Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, \"What must be realized is only that the strait jacket <!--[sic]--> of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement.\"<ref name=\"Mises\"/>\n\n===Robert K. Merton===\nAmerican sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a \"trained incapacity\" resulting from \"over conformity\". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as \"arrogant\" and \"haughty\".<ref name=\"Merton\"/>\n\n=== Elliott Jaques ===\nIn his book \"A General Theory of Bureaucracy\", first published in 1976, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constructing the infrastructure for the knowledge economy : methods and tools, theory and structure|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|others=Linger, Henry|isbn=978-0306485541|location=New York|pages=104|oclc=55877281}}</ref>\n\n[[Elliott Jaques]] argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:\n* Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies).\n* Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.\n* The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability).\n* The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.\n* Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).\n* Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A general theory of bureaucracy|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques|date=1976|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0435824785|location=London|oclc=2089721}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/free-associations/kirsnerjaques.html|title=Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy|website=www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1990/01/in-praise-of-hierarchy|title=In Praise of Hierarchy|date=1990-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\nThe definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by [[Elliott Jaques]] is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy.

By contrast, Marx was opposed to bureaucracy. Marx posited that while [[corporation|corporate]] and government bureaucracy seem to operate in opposition, in actuality they mutually rely on one another to exist.

Mill referred to bureaucracy as a distinct form of government, separate from representative democracy. He believed bureaucracies had certain advantages, most importantly the accumulation of experience in those who actually conduct the affairs. Nevertheless, he believed this form of governance compared poorly to representative government, as it relied on appointment rather than direct election.

Wilson advocated a bureaucracy that \"is a part of political life only as the methods of the counting house are a part of the life of society; only as machinery is part of the manufactured product. But it is, at the same time, raised very far above the dull level of mere technical detail by the fact that through its greater principles it is directly connected with the lasting maxims of political wisdom, the permanent truths of political progress.\"\n\nWilson did not advocate a replacement of rule by the governed, he simply advised that, \"Administrative questions are not political questions. Although politics sets the tasks for administration, it should not be suffered to manipulate its offices\". This essay became a foundation for the study of public administration in America.<ref>Christopher Hood (30 March 2000).

Profit management, he argued, is the most effective method of organization when the services rendered may be checked by economic calculation of profit and loss. When, however, the service in question can not be subjected to economic calculation, bureaucratic management is necessary. He did not oppose universally bureaucratic management; on the contrary, he argued that bureaucracy is an indispensable method for social organization, for it is the only method by which the law can be made supreme, and is the protector of the individual against despotic arbitrariness. Using the example of the Catholic Church, he pointed out that bureaucracy is only appropriate for an organization whose code of conduct is not subject to change. He then went on to argue that complaints about bureaucratization usually refer not to the criticism of the bureaucratic methods themselves, but to \"the intrusion of bureaucracy into all spheres of human life.\" Mises saw bureaucratic processes at work in both the private and public spheres; however, he believed that bureaucratization in the private sphere could only occur as a consequence of government interference. According to him, \"What must be realized is only that the strait jacket <!--[sic]--> of bureaucratic organization paralyzes the individual's initiative, while within the capitalist market society an innovator still has a chance to succeed. The former makes for stagnation and preservation of inveterate methods, the latter makes for progress and improvement.\"<ref name=\"Mises\"/>\n\n===Robert K. Merton===\nAmerican sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] expanded on Weber's theories of bureaucracy in his work ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', published in 1957. While Merton agreed with certain aspects of Weber's analysis, he also noted the dysfunctional aspects of bureaucracy, which he attributed to a \"trained incapacity\" resulting from \"over conformity\". He believed that bureaucrats are more likely to defend their own entrenched interests than to act to benefit the organization as a whole but that pride in their craft makes them resistant to changes in established routines. Merton stated that bureaucrats emphasize formality over interpersonal relationships, and have been trained to ignore the special circumstances of particular cases, causing them to come across as \"arrogant\" and \"haughty\".<ref name=\"Merton\"/>\n\n=== Elliott Jaques ===\nIn his book \"A General Theory of Bureaucracy\", first published in 1976, [[Elliott Jaques|Dr. Elliott Jaques]] describes the discovery of a universal and uniform underlying structure of managerial or work levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy for any type of employment systems.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constructing the infrastructure for the knowledge economy : methods and tools, theory and structure|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|others=Linger, Henry|isbn=978-0306485541|location=New York|pages=104|oclc=55877281}}</ref>\n\n[[Elliott Jaques]] argues and presents evidence that for the bureaucracy to provide a valuable contribution to the open society some of the following conditions must be met:\n* Number of levels in a bureaucracy hierarchy must match the complexity level of the employment system for which the bureaucratic hierarchy is created (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 levels of complexity for bureaucratic hierarchies).\n* Roles within a bureaucratic hierarchy differ in the level of work complexity.\n* The level of work complexity in the roles must be matched with the level of human capability of the role holders (Elliott Jaques identified maximum 8 Levels of human capability).\n* The level of work complexity in any managerial role within a bureaucratic hierarchy must be one level higher than the level of work complexity of the subordinate roles.\n* Any managerial role in a bureaucratic hierarchy must have full managerial accountabilities and authorities (veto selection to the team, decide task types and specific task assignments, decide personal effectiveness and recognition, decide initiation of removal from the team within due process).\n* Lateral working accountabilities and authorities must be defined for all the roles in the hierarchy (7 types of lateral working accountabilities and authorities: collateral, advisory, service-getting and -giving, coordinative, monitoring, auditing, prescribing).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A general theory of bureaucracy|last=Elliott.|first=Jaques|date=1976|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0435824785|location=London|oclc=2089721}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com/human_nature/free-associations/kirsnerjaques.html|title=Psychoanalysis Psychotherapy|website=www.psychoanalysis-and-therapy.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/1990/01/in-praise-of-hierarchy|title=In Praise of Hierarchy|date=1990-01-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>\nThe definition of effective bureaucratic hierarchy by [[Elliott Jaques]] is of importance not only to sociology but to social psychology, social anthropology, economics, politics, and social philosophy.
