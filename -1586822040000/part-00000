Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.\n\nThe storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog<ref name=\"SFW\" /> as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One [[software library]] and format that aids this is [[gettext]].\n\nThus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also [[#Standard locale data|Standard locale data]] above.\n\nMany localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, [[OpenOffice.org]] achieves this with compilation switches.\n\n== Process ==\n\nA globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.<ref name=\"SFW\" />\n\nTo some degree (e.g. for [[quality assurance]]), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enable all the others.<ref name=\"SFW\" /> Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.\n\nOnce properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: [[free and open source software]] usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Localization in Free Software: How Translations Are Performed|last=Reina|first=Laura Arjona|last2=Robles|first2=Gregorio|last3=Gonz\u00e1lez-Barahona|first3=Jes\u00fas M.|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-38927-6|editor-last=Petrinja|editor-first=Etiel|series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|pages=153\u2013167|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|doi-access=free|editor-last2=Succi|editor-first2=Giancarlo|editor-last3=Ioini|editor-first3=Nabil El|editor-last4=Sillitti|editor-first4=Alberto}}</ref> The [[KDE3]] project, for example, has been translated into over 100 languages;<ref>For the current list see [http://l10n.kde.org/teams-list.php KDE.org]</ref> [[MediaWiki]] in 270 languages, of which 100 mostly complete {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Group_statistics|title=Translating:Group statistics \u2013 translatewiki.net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhen translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/58406/sponsored-feature-how-to-translate-a-game-into-20-languages-and-avoid-going-to-hell/|title=How to translate a game into 20 languages and avoid going to hell|publisher=}}</ref> For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.\n\n== Commercial considerations ==\n\nIn a commercial setting, the benefit from localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, [[Lotus 1-2-3]] took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over [[Microsoft Multiplan]].<ref name=\"SFW\" /> MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its [[WordStar]] documentation to, an executive said, not \"have the tone it should have had\".<ref name=\"schrage19850217\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/02/17/ibm-wins-dominance-in-european-computer-market/bdcb9e21-8107-4dad-88d7-713f2709a8d8/ |title=IBM Wins Dominance in European Computer Market |last=Schrage |first=Michael |date=1985-02-17 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-08-29 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.\n\nFinally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their own operations in the new languages, in order to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Subcomponents and standards\n** [[Bidirectional script support]]\n** [[International Components for Unicode]]\n** [[Language code]]\n** [[Language localisation|Language localization]]\n** [[Website localization]]\n* Related concepts\n** [[Computer accessibility]]\n** [[Computer Russification]], localization into Russian language\n** [[Separation of concerns]]\n* Methods and examples\n** [[Game localization]]\n** [[Globalization Management System]]\n** [[Pseudolocalization]], a [[software testing]] method for testing a software product's readiness for localization.\n* Other\n** [[Input method editor]]\n** [[Language industry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* ''.NET Internationalization: The Developer's Guide to Building Global Windows and Web Applications'', Guy Smith-Ferrier, Addison-Wesley Professional, 7 August 2006.  {{ISBN|0-321-34138-4}}\n* ''A Practical Guide to Localization'', Bert Esselink, John Benjamins Publishing, [2000].  {{ISBN|1-58811-006-0}}\n* [[Lydia Ash]]: ''The Web Testing Companion: The Insider's Guide to Efficient and Effective Tests'', Wiley, May 2, 2003.  {{ISBN|0-471-43021-8}}\n* ''Business Without Borders: A Strategic Guide to Global Marketing'', Donald A.

Programs are often built to reference resource libraries depending on the selected locale data.\n\nThe storage for translatable and translated strings is sometimes called a message catalog<ref name=\"SFW\" /> as the strings are called messages. The catalog generally comprises a set of files in a specific localization format and a standard library to handle said format. One [[software library]] and format that aids this is [[gettext]].\n\nThus to get an application to support multiple languages one would design the application to select the relevant language resource file at runtime. The code required to manage data entry verification and many other locale-sensitive data types also must support differing locale requirements. Modern development systems and operating systems include sophisticated libraries for international support of these types, see also [[#Standard locale data|Standard locale data]] above.\n\nMany localization issues (e.g. writing direction, text sorting) require more profound changes in the software than text translation. For example, [[OpenOffice.org]] achieves this with compilation switches.\n\n== Process ==\n\nA globalization method includes, after planning, three implementation steps: internationalization, localization and quality assurance.<ref name=\"SFW\" />\n\nTo some degree (e.g. for [[quality assurance]]), development teams include someone who handles the basic/central stages of the process which then enable all the others.<ref name=\"SFW\" /> Such persons typically understand foreign languages and cultures and have some technical background. Specialized technical writers are required to construct a culturally appropriate syntax for potentially complicated concepts, coupled with engineering resources to deploy and test the localization elements.\n\nOnce properly internationalized, software can rely on more decentralized models for localization: [[free and open source software]] usually rely on self-localization by end-users and volunteers, sometimes organized in teams.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Preliminary Analysis of Localization in Free Software: How Translations Are Performed|last=Reina|first=Laura Arjona|last2=Robles|first2=Gregorio|last3=Gonz\u00e1lez-Barahona|first3=Jes\u00fas M.|date=2013-06-25|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-38927-6|editor-last=Petrinja|editor-first=Etiel|series=IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology|pages=153\u2013167|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38928-3_11|doi-access=free|editor-last2=Succi|editor-first2=Giancarlo|editor-last3=Ioini|editor-first3=Nabil El|editor-last4=Sillitti|editor-first4=Alberto}}</ref> The [[KDE3]] project, for example, has been translated into over 100 languages;<ref>For the current list see [http://l10n.kde.org/teams-list.php KDE.org]</ref> [[MediaWiki]] in 270 languages, of which 100 mostly complete {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translatewiki.net/wiki/Translating:Group_statistics|title=Translating:Group statistics \u2013 translatewiki.net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nWhen translating existing text to other languages, it is difficult to maintain the parallel versions of texts throughout the life of the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/feature/58406/sponsored-feature-how-to-translate-a-game-into-20-languages-and-avoid-going-to-hell/|title=How to translate a game into 20 languages and avoid going to hell|publisher=}}</ref> For instance, if a message displayed to the user is modified, all of the translated versions must be changed.\n\n== Commercial considerations ==\n\nIn a commercial setting, the benefit from localization is access to more markets. In the early 1980s, [[Lotus 1-2-3]] took two years to separate program code and text and lost the market lead in Europe over [[Microsoft Multiplan]].<ref name=\"SFW\" /> MicroPro found that using an Austrian translator for the West German market caused its [[WordStar]] documentation to, an executive said, not \"have the tone it should have had\".<ref name=\"schrage19850217\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/02/17/ibm-wins-dominance-in-european-computer-market/bdcb9e21-8107-4dad-88d7-713f2709a8d8/ |title=IBM Wins Dominance in European Computer Market |last=Schrage |first=Michael |date=1985-02-17 |work=Washington Post |access-date=2018-08-29 |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are considerable costs involved, which go far beyond engineering. Further, business operations must adapt to manage the production, storage and distribution of multiple discrete localized products, which are often being sold in completely different currencies, regulatory environments and tax regimes.\n\nFinally, sales, marketing and technical support must also facilitate their own operations in the new languages, in order to support customers for the localized products. Particularly for relatively small language populations, it may never be economically viable to offer a localized product. Even where large language populations could justify localization for a given product, and a product's internal structure already permits localization, a given software developer or publisher may lack the size and sophistication to manage the ancillary functions associated with operating in multiple locales.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* Subcomponents and standards\n** [[Bidirectional script support]]\n** [[International Components for Unicode]]\n** [[Language code]]\n** [[Language localisation|Language localization]]\n** [[Website localization]]\n* Related concepts\n** [[Computer accessibility]]\n** [[Computer Russification]], localization into Russian language\n** [[Separation of concerns]]\n* Methods and examples\n** [[Game localization]]\n** [[Globalization Management System]]\n** [[Pseudolocalization]], a [[software testing]] method for testing a software product's readiness for localization.\n* Other\n** [[Input method editor]]\n** [[Language industry]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* ''.NET Internationalization: The Developer's Guide to Building Global Windows and Web Applications'', Guy Smith-Ferrier, Addison-Wesley Professional, 7 August 2006.  {{ISBN|0-321-34138-4}}\n* ''A Practical Guide to Localization'', Bert Esselink, John Benjamins Publishing, [2000].  {{ISBN|1-58811-006-0}}\n* [[Lydia Ash]]: ''The Web Testing Companion: The Insider's Guide to Efficient and Effective Tests'', Wiley, May 2, 2003.  {{ISBN|0-471-43021-8}}\n* ''Business Without Borders: A Strategic Guide to Global Marketing'', Donald A.

He was the son of farmer, John Robert Hall and Mary Jane Barnard.  He was one of five other children, four girls and one boy.

He married the church organist, Laura Woods, at his first congregation in Kansas.  The Halls had three children, Paul Lyman Hall, George Barton Hall and Wendell Woods Hall.  They moved from town to town, finding jobs, through the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]].  The family lived in Chicago during the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair of 1893]] and 1900.  For a few years, they moved to Decatur, Illinois between 1893 and 1900.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter preaching for a few years at a couple of different midwestern congregations of the Disciples of Christ, Hall formed a partnership with his brother-in-law and began holding meetings in various cities for a few years. After falling ill from exhaustion in the early 1890s, Hall, his wife and two sons, Paul and Barton, lived in Chicago during the time of the World's Fair, an event he wrote about in articles submitted to various Disciples-oriented publications, while he pastored a small congregation. Hall left Chicago and took a position in [[Decatur, Illinois]] at a Disciples church, where his preaching and methods eventually resulted in a split of the congregation. In 1902, Hall left Decatur and took his family back to Chicago where he preached at what he called the Christian Tabernacle until 1910. Hall was rather unusual in that, while preaching, he spent a great deal of time developing side businesses and investments as well as becoming a published author on Christian themes. As a result, he was able to purchase the large house of a business executive in Chicago.\n\nHall took pride in not taking a salary from his congregation, \"while making a pretty comfortable living by his publishing, as well as conducting weddings and funerals, and the frequent trips to hold meetings.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nDr. Hall (by 1910 he had earned some sort of degree at a local Bible College in the Chicago area) began to look for other business opportunities in the South. He and a number of investors purchased property in Western Louisiana, bordering Texas, with the idea that the land was to be used for lumber and mining. Unfortunately, Hall had used a local attorney in the land purchases who, behind Hall's back, had deeded significant portions of the property to friends, causing the collapse of the project and great financial loss to Hall and the other investors. He sued in an attempt to recoup his losses, but the Louisiana courts sided with his opponent in the end.\n\n\"George wrote extensively, particularly for Christian Church-oriented publications, from the mid-1880s until approximately 1917. He also published books, many of which were transcriptions of sermons, as well as discussions about dancing, the holding of evangelistic meetings, tithing and 'sexology.'\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to some of the sermons published by Dr. Hall towards the end of 1909, he had had big plans for his Chicago congregation, including the building of a massive church building that would have included \"baths\" and a treatment facility for people with epilepsy (his eldest son was one), but apparently the congregation must not have agreed with him, as he retired in 1910 from the ministry and devoted himself to pursuing yet another land deal, this time in Florida. \n\n\"George retired from his last church in Chicago in 1910 to devote himself to the Hall City project. His eldest son, Paul, was severely brain-damaged and epileptic; the middle son, Barton, went to Florida in 1910 after graduating from the University of Chicago High School to run the Hall City project, and Wendell, a constant behavioral challenge, eventually became a famous pioneer in radio during the Twenties.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHall envisioned the town starting with farmers, who purchased land from him, settling in his \"temperance town\", which would draw merchants, then eventually students to his \"Hall University\" which would help with student tuition, in part, by having students work in grapefruit and orange groves surrounding the campus.\n\n\"George died on September 15, 1925 in Chicago from heart failure. His various business projects had failed and his son Barton was told at the funeral by George's brother, a Federal Judge in Iowa, that his father had died bankrupt.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHall was tried and convicted of fraud and died in jail.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==G. Barton Hall==\nA major issue was exactly who would be traveling to Florida to be the on-site manager. Rev. Hall's oldest son, Paul Lyman Hall, had epilepsy and severe mental disabilities, his youngest son, Wendell Woods Hall, was still in grade school, and Rev. Hall himself would be busy traveling the country giving speeches to possible investors and farmers. The answer was in Rev. Hall's eighteen-year-old son, G. Barton (Bart) Hall, a 1910 graduate of the [[University of Chicago]]'s high school program. Bart, born in 1892, was a handsome young man who had transferred to the University high school for his senior year and played on the school baseball team as well as in the Church League basketball team for the Christian Tabernacle. Bart loaded up a Ford Model A customized as a camper and traveled about the Midwest to visit various relatives before heading down to Florida to begin the process of carving a town out of the palmetto scrub in what was certainly a pioneer area of the State.\n\nBart Hall lived on the second floor of what was either a hotel or a boarding house in LaBelle, Florida (according to a picture taken from his window in 1910-1911) while he started making plans to develop the Hall City site. According to other pictures taken during this early period, Bart spent time in Fort Myers, Florida and took sightseeing trips to the Everglades to see the Seminole Indians. Rev. Hall, various relatives and a girlfriend from Chicago wrote letters and postcards to Bart, detailing business issues and family problems; Rev. Hall wrote about successes and failures on the road trying to drum up investors and possible inhabitants of the new town, while an aunt in Kansas detailed their problems with Bart's older brother, who was in a \"foul air\" during the Christmas of 1911, but continued, in her mind, to make progress despite his severe disabilities.\n\nBart Hall, who had an early interest in photography while growing up in Chicago, documented some of the early progress of Hall City with a Kodak \"Picture Postcard\" folding camera, so-called because the negative produced was roughly the same size as a postcard (approximately 4x6\"). He placed some of the pictures into a \"pitch book\" or album that was used to \"pitch\" land sales to the interested willing to make the long trip to Florida and the Hall City development. Hall put very detailed captions on each picture, showing events and individuals in the history of the small town.\n\nWhile Bart Hall continued to work on clearing the land for Hall City, he also traveled about the South Florida region seeking investors. It was during one of those trips that he met a young woman, Bertha Ruhl, the daughter of a couple of itinerant newspaper editors known as \"Ma\" and \"Pa\" Ruhl and married her shortly thereafter. Their first son, George, was born at \"Cozynook Farm\", Bart's property at Hall City, with Rev. Hall in attendance and young George was later referred to as the \"King\" and other Hall City children as his \"Court\".\n\nBart built and ran the Hall City Hotel and the Hall City Mercantile Company. His younger brother, Wendell, who was a bit of a behavioral problem for his parents, ran away from a boarding school and made his way to Hall City before the outbreak of World War I and worked for a short time for his brother until arrangements were made for his return to Chicago. Wendell later became a well-known songwriter and entertainer in the 1920s, being mainly remembered today for popularizing the tune \"[[It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo']]\".\n\nWendell worked in Hall City \"until he had enough money to return north, where he wrote and recorded music.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs World War I approached, land sales and profits for Hall City shrank and Bart had to move to Jacksonville for a time to work for a company building concrete barges. Bertha obtained her teaching certificate so that she could teach music, as she was an accomplished organist. A second son, William Ruhl Hall, was born August 30, 1918 in Chicago during a family visit. The situation did not improve during the post-World War I era in Florida and the plans for Hall City collapsed.\n\nRev. Hall died in Chicago in February, 1925 of heart disease, with some questions being raised as to the legality of the land sales and calls for a criminal investigation by some of the investors.  When Bart traveled to Chicago he was taken aside by his uncle, a Federal Judge in Iowa and his brother Wendell, by now a famous entertainer and recording artist, and was told that his father was bankrupt and that he would receive nothing from the estate.  In fact, Wendell had to purchase the family house on the courthouse steps in a sale to be able to salvage some of the furniture and possessions to be able to resettle his mother in Lawrence, Kansas.\n\nThe remainder of Hall City was sold in bits and pieces, mainly for failure to pay taxes. The fledgling Lykes Bros. Corporation purchased most of the property, purchasing the last lot from Bart's brother-in-law in early 1970. Bart worked for Standard Oil for a time, reviving staid sales in his district, only to have the job given to a relative of a Standard Oil board member. He then ran a gas station for a few years, then opened up a Pepsi-Cola distributorship in 1940. Bart and his son William ran the distributorship with three trucks until William enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] shortly before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], 1941. Wartime rationing of gas, tires and sugar caused Bart to lose another promising business. In 1944, Bart and Bertha purchased a house in Sarasota, Florida and he worked selling ads for the local newspaper across the South. Bart died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947 during a business trip in [[Eastman, Georgia]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord|26|52|42|N|81|19|35|W|type:city_region:US-FL_source:GNIS-enwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Ghost towns in Florida]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Glades County, Florida]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Scene at a farm at Hall City, Christian Colony in Glades County.jpg|thumb|Scene at a farm at Hall City, 1915]]\n'''Hall City''' is a former community established in what is now [[Glades County, Florida]] during 1910 by Rev.

His eldest son, Paul, was severely brain-damaged and epileptic; the middle son, Barton, went to Florida in 1910 after graduating from the University of Chicago High School to run the Hall City project, and Wendell, a constant behavioral challenge, eventually became a famous pioneer in radio during the Twenties.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHall envisioned the town starting with farmers, who purchased land from him, settling in his \"temperance town\", which would draw merchants, then eventually students to his \"Hall University\" which would help with student tuition, in part, by having students work in grapefruit and orange groves surrounding the campus.\n\n\"George died on September 15, 1925 in Chicago from heart failure. His various business projects had failed and his son Barton was told at the funeral by George's brother, a Federal Judge in Iowa, that his father had died bankrupt.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHall was tried and convicted of fraud and died in jail.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==G. Barton Hall==\nA major issue was exactly who would be traveling to Florida to be the on-site manager. Rev. Hall's oldest son, Paul Lyman Hall, had epilepsy and severe mental disabilities, his youngest son, Wendell Woods Hall, was still in grade school, and Rev. Hall himself would be busy traveling the country giving speeches to possible investors and farmers. The answer was in Rev. Hall's eighteen-year-old son, G. Barton (Bart) Hall, a 1910 graduate of the [[University of Chicago]]'s high school program. Bart, born in 1892, was a handsome young man who had transferred to the University high school for his senior year and played on the school baseball team as well as in the Church League basketball team for the Christian Tabernacle. Bart loaded up a Ford Model A customized as a camper and traveled about the Midwest to visit various relatives before heading down to Florida to begin the process of carving a town out of the palmetto scrub in what was certainly a pioneer area of the State.\n\nBart Hall lived on the second floor of what was either a hotel or a boarding house in LaBelle, Florida (according to a picture taken from his window in 1910-1911) while he started making plans to develop the Hall City site. According to other pictures taken during this early period, Bart spent time in Fort Myers, Florida and took sightseeing trips to the Everglades to see the Seminole Indians. Rev. Hall, various relatives and a girlfriend from Chicago wrote letters and postcards to Bart, detailing business issues and family problems; Rev. Hall wrote about successes and failures on the road trying to drum up investors and possible inhabitants of the new town, while an aunt in Kansas detailed their problems with Bart's older brother, who was in a \"foul air\" during the Christmas of 1911, but continued, in her mind, to make progress despite his severe disabilities.\n\nBart Hall, who had an early interest in photography while growing up in Chicago, documented some of the early progress of Hall City with a Kodak \"Picture Postcard\" folding camera, so-called because the negative produced was roughly the same size as a postcard (approximately 4x6\"). He placed some of the pictures into a \"pitch book\" or album that was used to \"pitch\" land sales to the interested willing to make the long trip to Florida and the Hall City development. Hall put very detailed captions on each picture, showing events and individuals in the history of the small town.\n\nWhile Bart Hall continued to work on clearing the land for Hall City, he also traveled about the South Florida region seeking investors. It was during one of those trips that he met a young woman, Bertha Ruhl, the daughter of a couple of itinerant newspaper editors known as \"Ma\" and \"Pa\" Ruhl and married her shortly thereafter. Their first son, George, was born at \"Cozynook Farm\", Bart's property at Hall City, with Rev. Hall in attendance and young George was later referred to as the \"King\" and other Hall City children as his \"Court\".\n\nBart built and ran the Hall City Hotel and the Hall City Mercantile Company. His younger brother, Wendell, who was a bit of a behavioral problem for his parents, ran away from a boarding school and made his way to Hall City before the outbreak of World War I and worked for a short time for his brother until arrangements were made for his return to Chicago. Wendell later became a well-known songwriter and entertainer in the 1920s, being mainly remembered today for popularizing the tune \"[[It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo']]\".\n\nWendell worked in Hall City \"until he had enough money to return north, where he wrote and recorded music.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs World War I approached, land sales and profits for Hall City shrank and Bart had to move to Jacksonville for a time to work for a company building concrete barges. Bertha obtained her teaching certificate so that she could teach music, as she was an accomplished organist. A second son, William Ruhl Hall, was born August 30, 1918 in Chicago during a family visit. The situation did not improve during the post-World War I era in Florida and the plans for Hall City collapsed.\n\nRev. Hall died in Chicago in February, 1925 of heart disease, with some questions being raised as to the legality of the land sales and calls for a criminal investigation by some of the investors.  When Bart traveled to Chicago he was taken aside by his uncle, a Federal Judge in Iowa and his brother Wendell, by now a famous entertainer and recording artist, and was told that his father was bankrupt and that he would receive nothing from the estate.  In fact, Wendell had to purchase the family house on the courthouse steps in a sale to be able to salvage some of the furniture and possessions to be able to resettle his mother in Lawrence, Kansas.\n\nThe remainder of Hall City was sold in bits and pieces, mainly for failure to pay taxes. The fledgling Lykes Bros. Corporation purchased most of the property, purchasing the last lot from Bart's brother-in-law in early 1970. Bart worked for Standard Oil for a time, reviving staid sales in his district, only to have the job given to a relative of a Standard Oil board member. He then ran a gas station for a few years, then opened up a Pepsi-Cola distributorship in 1940. Bart and his son William ran the distributorship with three trucks until William enlisted in the [[United States Army Air Corps]] shortly before [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], 1941. Wartime rationing of gas, tires and sugar caused Bart to lose another promising business. In 1944, Bart and Bertha purchased a house in Sarasota, Florida and he worked selling ads for the local newspaper across the South. Bart died of a cerebral hemorrage in 1947 during a business trip in [[Eastman, Georgia]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{coord|26|52|42|N|81|19|35|W|type:city_region:US-FL_source:GNIS-enwiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Ghost towns in Florida]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Glades County, Florida]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_City,_Florida"}

Later, while still in high school, she was asked to take a [[screen test]] with [[Orson Welles]]. She did not get the part. In 1943, she appeared in a bit part in the film ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]''.{{Citation needed |date=March 2020}}\n\n==Career==\n===20th Century Fox===\n[[Image:Jeanne Crain.jpg|right|190px|thumb]]\n''The Gang's All Here'' was produced by 20th Century Fox. Fox then cast Crain in her first sizable role, in the romantic drama ''[[Home in Indiana]]'' (1944) with [[Walter Brennan]], in which she played the love interest of [[Lon McCallister]]. The film, shot in Technicolor, was popular at the box office and established Crain as a film name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Darryl F.

Her acting was critically panned, but she gained nationwide attention. It resulted in her landing the leading role in ''[[The Shocking Miss Pilgrim]]'' in October 1944, a musical film which was eventually made with [[Betty Grable]] as the star.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/18/archives/screen-news-fox-picks-starring-film-for-jeanne-crain.html |title=SCREEN NEWS; Fox Picks Starring Film for Jeanne Crain |accessdate=2010-02-05|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 18, 1944}}</ref>\n\nCrain first received critical acclaim when she starred in ''[[Winged Victory (film)|Winged Victory]]'' (1944). She co-starred in 1945 with [[Dana Andrews]] in the musical film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'', in which Louanne Hogan [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] Crain's singing numbers. After that, Crain often had singing parts in films, and they were invariably dubbed, in most cases by Hogan.\n\n''State Fair'' was a huge hit. So too was ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945), in which Crain was the \"good\" sister of \"bad\" [[Gene Tierney]], both in love with [[Cornel Wilde]]. Crain was now established as one of Fox's bigger stars - so much so that Zanuck refused to let her play the comparatively small part of Clementine in ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946)\n\nCrain and Wilde were reunited in ''[[Centennial Summer]]'' (1946), directed by Preminger, Fox's attempt to match the success of ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944). More popular was ''[[Margie (1946 film)|Margie]]'' (1946). Her ice skating ability was on display in this film, in which she and [[Conrad Janis]] danced around the ice rink as her boyfriend [[Alan Young]] slipped and stumbled his way.\n\nShe made two films in 1948, ''[[You Were Meant for Me (film)|You Were Meant for Me]]'', a musical with Dan Dailey, that might have been [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s first appearance on film, and ''[[Apartment for Peggy]]'', with William Holden.\n\n===Career peak===\nIn 1949, Crain appeared in three films. ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949), in which she was top billed, quickly became established as a classic, winning [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] two Oscars and being a solid box-office hit. ''[[The Fan (1949 film)|The Fan]]'', directed by Preminger and based on ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]], was received poorly. However, ''[[Pinky (film)|Pinky]]'' earned Crain a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and was one of the more popular films of the year. ''Pinky'' was controversial because it told the story of a light-skinned [[African American]] woman who passes for white in the [[Northern United States]]. Although [[Lena Horne]] and other black actresses were considered, producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] chose to cast a white actress for fear of racial backlash.\n\nCrain had another big success when she starred with [[Myrna Loy]] and [[Clifton Webb]] in the 1950 biographical film ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', although her part was more of a supporting role. She had a cameo as herself in ''[[I'll Get By (film)|I'll Get By]]'' (1951) and starred in ''[[Take Care of My Little Girl]]'' (1951), a mildly popular drama about snobbery in college sororities.\n\nNext, Crain paired with [[Cary Grant]] in the [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] film of the offbeat drama ''[[People Will Talk]]'' (1951). Despite Jeanne's heavily campaigning for the female lead, [[Anne Baxter]] was initially cast in the part, but when she had to forfeit due to pregnancy, Crain was given the role after all.<ref>{{cite news| title= Gets Anne's Role| authorlink= Louella Parsons| first= Louella | last= Parsons | work= [[Deseret News]]| date= March 12, 1951| page= 3}}</ref>\n\nShortly after, Crain starred in [[Charles Brackett]]'s production ''[[The Model and the Marriage Broker]]'' (1951). Cast in May 1951, Crain was Brackett's first choice for the role.<ref>{{cite news| title= Gets Anne's Role| first= Louella | last= Parsons | work= [[San Antonio Light]] | date= May 24, 1951| page= 6}}</ref> Crain was reunited with Loy for ''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' (1952), the sequel to ''Cheaper by the Dozen'', getting top billing this time.\n\nWhile still at [[20th Century Fox]], Crain played a young wife quickly losing her mind amid high seas intrigue in ''[[Dangerous Crossing]]'' (1953), co-starring [[Michael Rennie]]. She starred in ''[[Vicki (film)|Vicki]]'' (1953), a remake of ''[[I Wake Up Screaming]]''. Fox tried her in a Western ''[[City of Bad Men]]'' (1954). The box-office performance of these last few films was mild, and Crain left the studio.\n\n===Universal===\nCrain made ''[[Duel in the Jungle]]'' (1954) in Britain and then ''[[Man Without a Star]]'' (1955), a Western with [[Kirk Douglas]] at Universal, where she played the lead female role of a hard-nosed ranch-owner.\n\nShe showed her dancing skills in 1955's ''[[Gentlemen Marry Brunettes]]'', a quasi-sequel to ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' based on [[Anita Loos]]' novel and co-starring [[Jane Russell]]. The film was shot partly in Paris and was released in France as ''A Paris Pour les Quatre'' (''To Paris for the Four''), and in Belgium as ''Cevieren Te Parijs''. Later in the 1950s, Crain, Russell, and another actress formed a short-lived singing and dancing lounge act on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nCrain made the Western comedy ''[[The Second Greatest Sex]]'' (1956), then starred with [[Glenn Ford]], [[Russ Tamblyn]], and [[Broderick Crawford]] in ''[[The Fastest Gun Alive]]'' directed by [[Russell Rouse]].  It was a big hit. At Universal, she starred with [[Jeff Chandler]] in the thriller ''[[The Tattered Dress]]'' (1957), then played a socialite who helps floundering singer and comedian [[Joe E. Lewis]] ([[Frank Sinatra]]) redeem himself in ''[[The Joker Is Wild]]'' (1957).\n\nAt this time, Crain began working in television, playing Daisy in a 1958 adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and Rose in 1959's all-star production of ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' alongside [[Myrna Loy]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Jane Powell]], [[Ed Wynn]], and top billed [[Tab Hunter]].\n\n===Later career===\nFilm roles became fewer in the 1960s as Crain went into semi-retirement. She appeared as [[Nefertiti]] in the Italian production of ''[[Nefertiti, Queen of the Nile]]'' (1961) with [[Edmund Purdom]] and [[Vincent Price]] and in [[Madison Avenue]] (1962) with [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Eleanor Parker]]. During this period, Crain appeared \u2014 for the second time \u2014 as one of the mystery guests on ''[[What's My Line?]]'', and made guest appearances on the  ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nShe co-starred again with [[Dana Andrews]] in ''[[Hot Rods To Hell]]'' (1967). Her last films were 1971's ''[[The Night God Screamed]]'' and ''[[Skyjacked (film)|Skyjacked]]'' (1972) with [[Charlton Heston]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last= Katz| first= Ephraim| title= | work= The Film Encyclopedia| edition= Third| year= 1998| page= 304}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Jeanne Crain dancing with her husband Paul Brooks at the Mocambo, 1946.jpg|thumb|Crain dancing with her husband Paul Brinkman at the ''[[Mocambo (nightclub)|Mocambo]]'', 1946]]\nAt the height of her stardom, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Crain was nicknamed \"Hollywood's Number One party girl\", and she was quoted as saying that she was invited to at least 200 parties a year.<ref>{{cite news| title= Jeanne Crain Likes Night Life, Says So| work= [[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Long Beach Independent]]| date= March 18, 1955| page= 27}}</ref>\n\nAgainst her mother's wishes, on December 31, 1945, Crain married Paul Brinkman,<ref name= \"CBS obit\">{{cite news| last= Grace| first= Francie | date= December 15, 2003| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/15/entertainment/main588531.shtml |title= Actress Jeanne Crain Dead At 78 \u2014 Appeared In 64 Films, Co-Starred With Holden, Sinatra, Kirk Douglas| agency=[[Associated Press]]| work= [[CBS News]]| accessdate= January 8, 2010}}</ref> a former [[Studio system|contract player]] at [[RKO Pictures]] credited as Paul Brooks.

Later, while still in high school, she was asked to take a [[screen test]] with [[Orson Welles]]. She did not get the part. In 1943, she appeared in a bit part in the film ''[[The Gang's All Here (1943 film)|The Gang's All Here]]''.{{Citation needed |date=March 2020}}\n\n==Career==\n===20th Century Fox===\n[[Image:Jeanne Crain.jpg|right|190px|thumb]]\n''The Gang's All Here'' was produced by 20th Century Fox. Fox then cast Crain in her first sizable role, in the romantic drama ''[[Home in Indiana]]'' (1944) with [[Walter Brennan]], in which she played the love interest of [[Lon McCallister]]. The film, shot in Technicolor, was popular at the box office and established Crain as a film name.<ref>{{cite news|title=Darryl F.

Her acting was critically panned, but she gained nationwide attention. It resulted in her landing the leading role in ''[[The Shocking Miss Pilgrim]]'' in October 1944, a musical film which was eventually made with [[Betty Grable]] as the star.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/18/archives/screen-news-fox-picks-starring-film-for-jeanne-crain.html |title=SCREEN NEWS; Fox Picks Starring Film for Jeanne Crain |accessdate=2010-02-05|work=[[The New York Times]] | date=October 18, 1944}}</ref>\n\nCrain first received critical acclaim when she starred in ''[[Winged Victory (film)|Winged Victory]]'' (1944). She co-starred in 1945 with [[Dana Andrews]] in the musical film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'', in which Louanne Hogan [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] Crain's singing numbers. After that, Crain often had singing parts in films, and they were invariably dubbed, in most cases by Hogan.\n\n''State Fair'' was a huge hit. So too was ''[[Leave Her to Heaven]]'' (1945), in which Crain was the \"good\" sister of \"bad\" [[Gene Tierney]], both in love with [[Cornel Wilde]]. Crain was now established as one of Fox's bigger stars - so much so that Zanuck refused to let her play the comparatively small part of Clementine in ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946)\n\nCrain and Wilde were reunited in ''[[Centennial Summer]]'' (1946), directed by Preminger, Fox's attempt to match the success of ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944). More popular was ''[[Margie (1946 film)|Margie]]'' (1946). Her ice skating ability was on display in this film, in which she and [[Conrad Janis]] danced around the ice rink as her boyfriend [[Alan Young]] slipped and stumbled his way.\n\nShe made two films in 1948, ''[[You Were Meant for Me (film)|You Were Meant for Me]]'', a musical with Dan Dailey, that might have been [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s first appearance on film, and ''[[Apartment for Peggy]]'', with William Holden.\n\n===Career peak===\nIn 1949, Crain appeared in three films. ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949), in which she was top billed, quickly became established as a classic, winning [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] two Oscars and being a solid box-office hit. ''[[The Fan (1949 film)|The Fan]]'', directed by Preminger and based on ''[[Lady Windemere's Fan]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]], was received poorly. However, ''[[Pinky (film)|Pinky]]'' earned Crain a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and was one of the more popular films of the year. ''Pinky'' was controversial because it told the story of a light-skinned [[African American]] woman who passes for white in the [[Northern United States]]. Although [[Lena Horne]] and other black actresses were considered, producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] chose to cast a white actress for fear of racial backlash.\n\nCrain had another big success when she starred with [[Myrna Loy]] and [[Clifton Webb]] in the 1950 biographical film ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (1950 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'', although her part was more of a supporting role. She had a cameo as herself in ''[[I'll Get By (film)|I'll Get By]]'' (1951) and starred in ''[[Take Care of My Little Girl]]'' (1951), a mildly popular drama about snobbery in college sororities.\n\nNext, Crain paired with [[Cary Grant]] in the [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]] film of the offbeat drama ''[[People Will Talk]]'' (1951). Despite Jeanne's heavily campaigning for the female lead, [[Anne Baxter]] was initially cast in the part, but when she had to forfeit due to pregnancy, Crain was given the role after all.<ref>{{cite news| title= Gets Anne's Role| authorlink= Louella Parsons| first= Louella | last= Parsons | work= [[Deseret News]]| date= March 12, 1951| page= 3}}</ref>\n\nShortly after, Crain starred in [[Charles Brackett]]'s production ''[[The Model and the Marriage Broker]]'' (1951). Cast in May 1951, Crain was Brackett's first choice for the role.<ref>{{cite news| title= Gets Anne's Role| first= Louella | last= Parsons | work= [[San Antonio Light]] | date= May 24, 1951| page= 6}}</ref> Crain was reunited with Loy for ''[[Belles on Their Toes (film)|Belles on Their Toes]]'' (1952), the sequel to ''Cheaper by the Dozen'', getting top billing this time.\n\nWhile still at [[20th Century Fox]], Crain played a young wife quickly losing her mind amid high seas intrigue in ''[[Dangerous Crossing]]'' (1953), co-starring [[Michael Rennie]]. She starred in ''[[Vicki (film)|Vicki]]'' (1953), a remake of ''[[I Wake Up Screaming]]''. Fox tried her in a Western ''[[City of Bad Men]]'' (1954). The box-office performance of these last few films was mild, and Crain left the studio.\n\n===Universal===\nCrain made ''[[Duel in the Jungle]]'' (1954) in Britain and then ''[[Man Without a Star]]'' (1955), a Western with [[Kirk Douglas]] at Universal, where she played the lead female role of a hard-nosed ranch-owner.\n\nShe showed her dancing skills in 1955's ''[[Gentlemen Marry Brunettes]]'', a quasi-sequel to ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' based on [[Anita Loos]]' novel and co-starring [[Jane Russell]]. The film was shot partly in Paris and was released in France as ''A Paris Pour les Quatre'' (''To Paris for the Four''), and in Belgium as ''Cevieren Te Parijs''. Later in the 1950s, Crain, Russell, and another actress formed a short-lived singing and dancing lounge act on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nCrain made the Western comedy ''[[The Second Greatest Sex]]'' (1956), then starred with [[Glenn Ford]], [[Russ Tamblyn]], and [[Broderick Crawford]] in ''[[The Fastest Gun Alive]]'' directed by [[Russell Rouse]].  It was a big hit. At Universal, she starred with [[Jeff Chandler]] in the thriller ''[[The Tattered Dress]]'' (1957), then played a socialite who helps floundering singer and comedian [[Joe E. Lewis]] ([[Frank Sinatra]]) redeem himself in ''[[The Joker Is Wild]]'' (1957).\n\nAt this time, Crain began working in television, playing Daisy in a 1958 adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and Rose in 1959's all-star production of ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' alongside [[Myrna Loy]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Jane Powell]], [[Ed Wynn]], and top billed [[Tab Hunter]].\n\n===Later career===\nFilm roles became fewer in the 1960s as Crain went into semi-retirement. She appeared as [[Nefertiti]] in the Italian production of ''[[Nefertiti, Queen of the Nile]]'' (1961) with [[Edmund Purdom]] and [[Vincent Price]] and in [[Madison Avenue]] (1962) with [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Eleanor Parker]]. During this period, Crain appeared \u2014 for the second time \u2014 as one of the mystery guests on ''[[What's My Line?]]'', and made guest appearances on the  ''[[Riverboat (TV series)|Riverboat]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nShe co-starred again with [[Dana Andrews]] in ''[[Hot Rods To Hell]]'' (1967). Her last films were 1971's ''[[The Night God Screamed]]'' and ''[[Skyjacked (film)|Skyjacked]]'' (1972) with [[Charlton Heston]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| last= Katz| first= Ephraim| title= | work= The Film Encyclopedia| edition= Third| year= 1998| page= 304}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Jeanne Crain dancing with her husband Paul Brooks at the Mocambo, 1946.jpg|thumb|Crain dancing with her husband Paul Brinkman at the ''[[Mocambo (nightclub)|Mocambo]]'', 1946]]\nAt the height of her stardom, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Crain was nicknamed \"Hollywood's Number One party girl\", and she was quoted as saying that she was invited to at least 200 parties a year.<ref>{{cite news| title= Jeanne Crain Likes Night Life, Says So| work= [[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Long Beach Independent]]| date= March 18, 1955| page= 27}}</ref>\n\nAgainst her mother's wishes, on December 31, 1945, Crain married Paul Brinkman,<ref name= \"CBS obit\">{{cite news| last= Grace| first= Francie | date= December 15, 2003| url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/12/15/entertainment/main588531.shtml |title= Actress Jeanne Crain Dead At 78 \u2014 Appeared In 64 Films, Co-Starred With Holden, Sinatra, Kirk Douglas| agency=[[Associated Press]]| work= [[CBS News]]| accessdate= January 8, 2010}}</ref> a former [[Studio system|contract player]] at [[RKO Pictures]] credited as Paul Brooks.

It was released on July 22, 2002 internationally and on July 23, 2002, in the [[United States]]; a version including two bonus tracks was released on February 19, 2003. ''The Lonely Position of Neutral'' is Trust Company's most successful album to date and was certified gold for sales in excess of 500,000 copies. The track \"Drop to Zero\" was also known as \"The Lonely Position of Neutral\" back when the band was known as 41Down, and was later remade for this album.\n\nThe album's [[lead single]], \"[[Downfall (Trust Company song)|Downfall]],\" was released in 2002. It gained the band its breakthrough popularity for both its infectious melody and unusual [[music video]]. The track reached number six on both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]] charts, and earned a spot at number 91 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop chart. The video features front-man [[Kevin Palmer (singer)|Kevin Palmer]] walking down a street, with everything behind him blown away by wind. It found significant airplay on [[MTV2]]. \"Running from Me\" was the second single from the album and released in the same year. Its video features the band wearing strange masks and unveiling them in the pouring rain.

''The Lonely Position of Neutral'' is Trust Company's most successful album to date and was certified gold for sales in excess of 500,000 copies. The track \"Drop to Zero\" was also known as \"The Lonely Position of Neutral\" back when the band was known as 41Down, and was later remade for this album.\n\nThe album's [[lead single]], \"[[Downfall (Trust Company song)|Downfall]],\" was released in 2002. It gained the band its breakthrough popularity for both its infectious melody and unusual [[music video]]. The track reached number six on both the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] and [[Modern Rock Tracks]] charts, and earned a spot at number 91 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] pop chart. The video features front-man [[Kevin Palmer (singer)|Kevin Palmer]] walking down a street, with everything behind him blown away by wind. It found significant airplay on [[MTV2]]. \"Running from Me\" was the second single from the album and released in the same year.

The third single, \"The Fear,\" was released in 2003.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|MC = (59/100)<ref name=meta>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/the-lonely-position-of-neutral/trust-company/critic-reviews|title=Critic Reviews for The Lonely Position of Neutral|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}</ref>\n|rev1 = 411mania.com\n|rev1score = (7/10)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/25/Trust-Company---The-Lonely-Position-Of-Neutral-Review.htm|title=Music - Trust Company - The Lonely Position Of Neutral Review|last=Jaymz|first=Tony|publisher=411mania.com|date=September 9, 2002|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|rev2 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev2score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=AM>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-lonely-position-of-neutral-mw0000219566|title=The Lonely Position of Neutral - Trust Company|last=Taylor|first=Jason D.|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev3score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=meta/>\n|rev4 = [[E!|E!

Tunney was admitted to the [[Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] bars in 1959 and practiced law in [[New York City]]. He married his first wife, Mieke Sprengers, on February 5, 1959.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTunney joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a [[judge advocate]] and served until he was discharged as a captain in April 1963. He taught business law at the [[University of California, Riverside]] in 1961 and 1962. In 1963, he was admitted to practice law in [[California]]. He was a special adviser to the [[List of executive actions by John F. Kennedy|President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime]] from 1963 until 1968.\n\nIn 1964, Tunney was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[California's 38th congressional district]] ([[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]] counties). He served from January 3, 1965 until his resignation on January 2, 1971 when he became a senator. While serving as a congressman, Tunney was called to [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts|Hyannisport, Massachusetts]] by Senator Kennedy to assist in dealing with the death of Mary Jo Kopechne following the [[Chappaquiddick incident]].  Noting his \"service to the state,\" Tunney was made an honorary member of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] by the fraternity's [[California State University, Northridge|Cal State Northridge]] chapter in 1970.<ref name=\"HAAS10\">{{cite book|editor1= Phi Sigma Kappa| title= Hills and a Star| edition= 10th| publisher=Phi Sigma Kappa Fraternity| location=Indianapolis, Indiana| year= 1992| pages= 74\u201376}}</ref><ref name=\"Bairds\">{{cite book| editor1-first=Jack L.| editor1-last=Anson| editor2-first=Robert F.| editor2-last=Marchenasi | title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities| edition=20th| year=1991| origyear=1879| publisher=Baird's Manual Foundation, Inc.| location=Indianapolis, IN| isbn=978-0963715906| page=A-65}}</ref>\n\nAfter his 1976 Senate defeat, Tunney resumed practicing law and was a named partner at [[Manatt, Phelps & Phillips|Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg & Tunney]] (1976\u20131987). He also served on several corporate boards.\n\n==United States Senator==\nIn early 1970, Representative Tunney announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Senate. His announcement was followed by fellow congressman [[George Brown, Jr.]] Their primary battle turned into one of the most bitter in California history. One of the key issues was the military draft. While Brown and Tunney both questioned expanding U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Brown opposed a continuation of the military draft while Tunney favored it. This conflict gave incumbent Republican [[George Murphy]] an early lead in the polls. Murphy's staunch support for the Vietnam War hurt his campaign and as the general election approached, Tunney overtook him in the polls. The Murphy campaign suffered another setback when he underwent surgery for throat cancer, weakening his voice to a whisper. The Tunney campaign used his youthful appearance and high energy to contrast with the aging Murphy. His hairstyle and mannerisms drew comparisons to [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Ultimately, Californians split their ticket in the 1970 midterm election, re-electing Republican governor [[Ronald Reagan]] and electing Democrat Tunney to the Senate.\n\nDuring his Senate term, Tunney produced a weekly radio report to California, in which he often interviewed other legislators. In 1974, he authored an [[Competition law|antitrust]] bill known as the [[Tunney Act]]. Tunney would later write a book, ''[[The Changing Dream]]''.\n\nIn December 1975, Tunney advocated for using American diplomacy in dealing with the [[Angolan Civil War]]. American covert and military support for pro-US rebels there suggested a return to the policies that had led up toward the highly unpopular [[Vietnam War]]. The Senate had postponed passage of the annual defense budget because of concerns that the bill contained funds for covert operations against Soviet-backed Angolan rebels. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] conducted highly classified briefings for senators, including Tunney, providing an accounting of where money was being spent. However, they failed to persuade him of the policy's usefulness. It was at this time that Tunney introduced an amendment that would cut $33 million from the defense budget that was to be allocated to pro-US rebels for covert operations. That effectively ended current and future covert funding from defense appropriations for Angola. Aid supporters filibustered the cutoff, offered counter-amendments and tried to shelve the amendment in committee.\n\nThe Ford administration, which strongly supported the covert operations, asserted that the amendment was a threat to both US-Soviet and US-Cuban relations. Cuba had deployed combat troops to Angola a month earlier. On December 20, 1975, Tunney's amendment passed 54-22 with the support of 16 Republicans. Its passage also increased the power of the Congress in foreign affairs at the expense of the executive branch.\n\nTunney was renominated for a second term in 1976 despite a high-profile challenge from his left in the form of [[Tom Hayden]]. That fall, Tunney was defeated in his reelection bid by Republican [[S. I. Hayakawa]], the president of San Francisco State University, who had never held elected office. Hayakawa ran as an outsider and highlighted Tunney's numerous travels, missed Senate votes, and poor Senate attendance record during the campaign. He also painted Tunney as a [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopper]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQoNGLVAQc&feature=youtu.be&t=1063|title=ABC Commercial Breaks - October 18, 1976|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\nStill, Tunney led in the polls right up to election night, despite a steadily shrinking lead as the campaign wore on. Despite Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s victory in the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election]], Tunney lost to Hayakawa in a mild upset, though Republican [[Gerald Ford]] [[1976 United States presidential election in California|carried California]] in the presidential election. Tunney resigned his Senate seat on January 1, 1977, two days before his term would officially expire, to allow Hayakawa to have seniority over other incoming senators.\n\nThroughout Tunney's term as a senator, he served as California's junior senator and served with [[Alan Cranston]].\n\n==Interest in constitutional rights and government surveillance==\nIn early 1975, soon after becoming chairman of the Senate [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution|Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights]], Tunney asked the subcommittee staff to initiate a long-term comprehensive investigation into the technological aspects of surveillance. The Surveillance Technology Report of 1976 that \"This investigation of surveillance was the first attempt to organize an immense amount of data in a comprehensive and usable format and to provide a framework for future analyses and, ultimately, for the creation of institutional mechanisms that will diminish the threats posted by surveillance technology.\" In the preface of this report, Tunney stated, \"If knowledge is power, then certainly the secret and unlimited acquisition of the most detailed knowledge about the most intimate aspects of a person's thoughts and actions conveys extraordinary power over that person's life and reputation to the snooper who possesses the highly personal information.\"\n\nTunney also served as chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Technology, and as a member of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn May 22, 1972, Tunney's [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-born wife Mieke sued for dissolution their 13-year marriage on the basis of [[irreconcilable differences]]. In addition to alimony, child support and half of the community property, she requested custody of the couple's three children.\n\nOn April 23, 1977, Tunney married Kathinka Osborne, a member of the 1964 Swedish Olympic ski team, with longtime friend Senator Kennedy serving as the [[groomsman|best man]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zC9UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U40DAAAAIBAJ&dq=john%20tunney%20kathinka%20osborne&pg=6633%2C9180384 \"Tunney weds former skier\"], ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', April 25, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Tunney joined former Senate colleagues [[George McGovern]] and [[Fred R. Harris|Fred Harris]] in opposing the [[Iraq War]].\n\nTunney and his wife lived primarily in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]] (with homes also in New York and Los Angeles). He was chairman of the board of the [[Hammer Museum|Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Culture Center at UCLA]] and remained active in environmental causes.<ref>Jean Merl, [https://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-john-tunney-20130723,0,4966968.story \"The Times catches up with former Sen.

Tunney was admitted to the [[Virginia]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] bars in 1959 and practiced law in [[New York City]]. He married his first wife, Mieke Sprengers, on February 5, 1959.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nTunney joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a [[judge advocate]] and served until he was discharged as a captain in April 1963. He taught business law at the [[University of California, Riverside]] in 1961 and 1962. In 1963, he was admitted to practice law in [[California]]. He was a special adviser to the [[List of executive actions by John F. Kennedy|President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime]] from 1963 until 1968.\n\nIn 1964, Tunney was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[California's 38th congressional district]] ([[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] and [[Imperial County, California|Imperial]] counties). He served from January 3, 1965 until his resignation on January 2, 1971 when he became a senator. \nWhile serving as a congressman, Tunney was called to [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts|Hyannisport, Massachusetts]] by Senator Kennedy to assist in dealing with the death of Mary Jo Kopechne following the [[Chappaquiddick incident]].

He also served on several corporate boards.\n\n==United States Senator==\nIn early 1970, Representative Tunney announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for Senate. His announcement was followed by fellow congressman [[George Brown, Jr.]] Their primary battle turned into one of the most bitter in California history. One of the key issues was the military draft. While Brown and Tunney both questioned expanding U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Brown opposed a continuation of the military draft while Tunney favored it. This conflict gave incumbent Republican [[George Murphy]] an early lead in the polls. Murphy's staunch support for the Vietnam War hurt his campaign and as the general election approached, Tunney overtook him in the polls. The Murphy campaign suffered another setback when he underwent surgery for throat cancer, weakening his voice to a whisper. The Tunney campaign used his youthful appearance and high energy to contrast with the aging Murphy. His hairstyle and mannerisms drew comparisons to [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Ultimately, Californians split their ticket in the 1970 midterm election, re-electing Republican governor [[Ronald Reagan]] and electing Democrat Tunney to the Senate.\n\nDuring his Senate term, Tunney produced a weekly radio report to California, in which he often interviewed other legislators. In 1974, he authored an [[Competition law|antitrust]] bill known as the [[Tunney Act]]. Tunney would later write a book, ''[[The Changing Dream]]''.\n\nIn December 1975, Tunney advocated for using American diplomacy in dealing with the [[Angolan Civil War]]. American covert and military support for pro-US rebels there suggested a return to the policies that had led up toward the highly unpopular [[Vietnam War]]. The Senate had postponed passage of the annual defense budget because of concerns that the bill contained funds for covert operations against Soviet-backed Angolan rebels. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] conducted highly classified briefings for senators, including Tunney, providing an accounting of where money was being spent. However, they failed to persuade him of the policy's usefulness. It was at this time that Tunney introduced an amendment that would cut $33 million from the defense budget that was to be allocated to pro-US rebels for covert operations. That effectively ended current and future covert funding from defense appropriations for Angola. Aid supporters filibustered the cutoff, offered counter-amendments and tried to shelve the amendment in committee.\n\nThe Ford administration, which strongly supported the covert operations, asserted that the amendment was a threat to both US-Soviet and US-Cuban relations. Cuba had deployed combat troops to Angola a month earlier. On December 20, 1975, Tunney's amendment passed 54-22 with the support of 16 Republicans. Its passage also increased the power of the Congress in foreign affairs at the expense of the executive branch.\n\nTunney was renominated for a second term in 1976 despite a high-profile challenge from his left in the form of [[Tom Hayden]]. That fall, Tunney was defeated in his reelection bid by Republican [[S. I. Hayakawa]], the president of San Francisco State University, who had never held elected office. Hayakawa ran as an outsider and highlighted Tunney's numerous travels, missed Senate votes, and poor Senate attendance record during the campaign. He also painted Tunney as a [[Flip-flop (politics)|flip-flopper]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRQoNGLVAQc&feature=youtu.be&t=1063|title=ABC Commercial Breaks - October 18, 1976|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\nStill, Tunney led in the polls right up to election night, despite a steadily shrinking lead as the campaign wore on. Despite Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]]'s victory in the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election]], Tunney lost to Hayakawa in a mild upset, though Republican [[Gerald Ford]] [[1976 United States presidential election in California|carried California]] in the presidential election. Tunney resigned his Senate seat on January 1, 1977, two days before his term would officially expire, to allow Hayakawa to have seniority over other incoming senators.\n\nThroughout Tunney's term as a senator, he served as California's junior senator and served with [[Alan Cranston]].\n\n==Interest in constitutional rights and government surveillance==\nIn early 1975, soon after becoming chairman of the Senate [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution|Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights]], Tunney asked the subcommittee staff to initiate a long-term comprehensive investigation into the technological aspects of surveillance. The Surveillance Technology Report of 1976 that \"This investigation of surveillance was the first attempt to organize an immense amount of data in a comprehensive and usable format and to provide a framework for future analyses and, ultimately, for the creation of institutional mechanisms that will diminish the threats posted by surveillance technology.\" In the preface of this report, Tunney stated, \"If knowledge is power, then certainly the secret and unlimited acquisition of the most detailed knowledge about the most intimate aspects of a person's thoughts and actions conveys extraordinary power over that person's life and reputation to the snooper who possesses the highly personal information.\"\n\nTunney also served as chairman of the Commerce Subcommittee on Science and Technology, and as a member of the Joint Atomic Energy Committee.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn May 22, 1972, Tunney's [[Dutch people|Dutch]]-born wife Mieke sued for dissolution their 13-year marriage on the basis of [[irreconcilable differences]]. In addition to alimony, child support and half of the community property, she requested custody of the couple's three children.\n\nOn April 23, 1977, Tunney married Kathinka Osborne, a member of the 1964 Swedish Olympic ski team, with longtime friend Senator Kennedy serving as the [[groomsman|best man]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zC9UAAAAIBAJ&sjid=U40DAAAAIBAJ&dq=john%20tunney%20kathinka%20osborne&pg=6633%2C9180384 \"Tunney weds former skier\"], ''[[Boca Raton News]]'', April 25, 1977.</ref>\n\nIn February 2003, Tunney joined former Senate colleagues [[George McGovern]] and [[Fred R.
