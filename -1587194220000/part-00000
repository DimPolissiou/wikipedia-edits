Goyer]]. The film stars [[Odette Annable]] as a young woman who is tormented by a [[dybbuk]] and seeks help from a rabbi ([[Gary Oldman]]). The dybbuk seeks to use her death as a gateway to physical existence.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=41301 Unborn - ComingSoon.net Film Database<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{imdb title|id=1139668|title=The Unborn}}</ref> The film is produced by [[Michael Bay]] and his [[production company]] [[Platinum Dunes]]. It was released in American theaters on January 9, 2009, by [[Rogue Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Beldon has nightmarish hallucinations of strange-looking dogs in the neighborhood and an evil child with bright blue eyes following her around. While [[babysitting]] Matty, her neighbor's son, she finds him showing his infant sibling its reflection in a mirror. Matty attacks Casey, smashing the mirror on her head, and tells her: \"Jumby wants to be born now\". She puts him to bed and leaves in shock.\n\nCasey's friend Romy tells her of a [[Folklore|superstition]] that newborns should not see their reflections in the mirror for at least a year because otherwise they will die soon. Casey's eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as [[Chimera (genetics)#Tetragametic chimerism|tetragametic chimerism]] and [[heterochromia]], and that it is completely normal. Her neighbor's infant dies, supporting the superstition.\n\nCasey's father admits that she had a twin brother years ago who died while he was in the womb when [[nuchal cord|her umbilical cord strangled him]], and whom he and Casey's late mother, Janet, had nicknamed \"Jumby\". She begins to suspect that the spirit is haunting her and this is the spirit of her unborn twin, wanting to be born so it can enter the world of the living as evil. \n\nCasey meets Sofi Kozma (whom she later learns is her grandmother). Sofi explains that as a child she had a twin brother who died during [[Nazi human experimentation#Experiments on twins|Nazi experiments]] in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] during [[World War II]]. A [[dybbuk]] brought the brother back to life to use as a portal into the world of the living. Kozma killed her twin to stop the spirit, and now it haunts her family for revenge, which is why Casey's mother became insane and committed suicide.\n\nKozma gives Casey a [[hamsa]] amulet for protection, instructs her to destroy all mirrors and burn the shards, and refers her to [[Rabbi]] Joseph Sendak, who can perform a Jewish [[exorcism]] to remove the dybbuk out of her soul. Sendak does not believe Casey's story until he sees a dog with its head twisted upside-down in his [[synagogue]]. The dybbuk kills Kozma, then Romy soon after. Casey and her boyfriend Mark both see the spirit after it kills Romy and realize that it's getting stronger. \n\nSendak, Mark, [[Episcopal priest]] Arthur Wyndham, and other volunteers begin the exorcism, but the dybbuk attacks them and several are wounded or killed. The spirit, having possessed the priest, chases Casey and Mark. Mark knocks Wyndham unconscious but gets possessed. Casey stabs Mark in the neck with the amulet. Sendak arrives and he and Casey complete the exorcism. The rite draws the dybbuk out of the human world, but Mark falls and dies during the separation.\n\nCasey mourns her boyfriend but wonders why the dybbuk suddenly became active in her life now and why it didn't attack her earlier. She takes a pregnancy test and learns that she is pregnant with Mark's twins.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Odette Annable]] as Casey Beldon: a young woman who is paranoid after becoming the centerpiece to a series of supernatural and strange events; eye color, hallucinations, dreams, and seeing strange things. Casey later learns she had a twin that died in the womb, this is all happening to her because a dybbuk (a spirit trapped between worlds) sees her as a doorway to return to the mortal world.\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Romy Marshall: Casey's superstitious and loyal best friend. Romy is amongst those targeted by the dybbuk  to effectively weaken Casey to make her vulnerable. \n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Rabbi Joseph Sendak: A rabbi who Casey confides in to stop the spirit.\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as Mark Hardigan: Casey's skeptical but supportive boyfriend. Initially he is doubtful of all the transpiring events, but he later becomes helpful for Casey.\n* [[James Remar]] as Gordon Beldon: Casey's father. \n* [[Jane Alexander]] as Sofi Kozma: A survivor of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz, who is revealed to be Janet's biological mother and Casey's grandmother. Following the traumatizing possession and target by the dybbuk in the 1940s, Sofi becomes knowledgeable to avoid the spirit, and becomes a guide for Casey.\n* [[Idris Elba]] as Arthur Wyndham: A priest who assists in Casey's exorcism.\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Janet Beldon: Casey's deceased mother, who was clinically depressed and committed suicide when Casey was a young girl. Janet committed suicide after becoming a target by the dybbuk attempting to gain access to the mortal realm, and the mental effects drove her to commit suicide.\n* [[Atticus Shaffer]] as Matty Newton: A neighborhood boy whom Casey babysits and begins exhibiting odd behavior over the course of the film.\n* [[Ethan Cutkosky]] as Barto: Sofi's twin brother who died in Auschwitz during a Nazi experiment on twins. A dybbuk saw him as a chance to get in the mortal realm, and resurrected him to get into the mortal world. To stop it, Sofi killed \"Barto\" out of intention to defeat the spirit. The dybbuk continued to appear in the form of Barto throughout the film, ultimately having merged with his soul.\n* [[Rhys Coiro]] as Mr. Shields: Casey's college professor.\n* Michael Sassone as Eli Walker: An old man in the senior citizen's home Sofi lives at.\n* [[Rachel Brosnahan]] as Lisa: A friend of Casey and Mark\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn the United States, ''The Unborn'' opened at the third position, grossing $19,810,585 averaging $8,405 at 2,357 sites.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2009&wknd=002&p=.htm Weekend Box Office Results for January 9-11].

Goyer]]. The film stars [[Odette Annable]] as a young woman who is tormented by a [[dybbuk]] and seeks help from a rabbi ([[Gary Oldman]]). The dybbuk seeks to use her death as a gateway to physical existence.<ref>[http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=41301 Unborn - ComingSoon.net Film Database<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{imdb title|id=1139668|title=The Unborn}}</ref> The film is produced by [[Michael Bay]] and his [[production company]] [[Platinum Dunes]]. It was released in American theaters on January 9, 2009, by [[Rogue Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nCasey Beldon has nightmarish hallucinations of strange-looking dogs in the neighborhood and an evil child with bright blue eyes following her around. While [[babysitting]] Matty, her neighbor's son, she finds him showing his infant sibling its reflection in a mirror. Matty attacks Casey, smashing the mirror on her head, and tells her: \"Jumby wants to be born now\". She puts him to bed and leaves in shock.\n\nCasey's friend Romy tells her of a [[Folklore|superstition]] that newborns should not see their reflections in the mirror for at least a year because otherwise they will die soon. Casey's eyes begin to change color; a doctor asks if she is a twin, and explains the change as [[Chimera (genetics)#Tetragametic chimerism|tetragametic chimerism]] and [[heterochromia]], and that it is completely normal. Her neighbor's infant dies, supporting the superstition.\n\nCasey's father admits that she had a twin brother years ago who died while he was in the womb when [[nuchal cord|her umbilical cord strangled him]], and whom he and Casey's late mother, Janet, had nicknamed \"Jumby\". She begins to suspect that the spirit is haunting her and this is the spirit of her unborn twin, wanting to be born so it can enter the world of the living as evil. \n\nCasey meets Sofi Kozma (whom she later learns is her grandmother). Sofi explains that as a child she had a twin brother who died during [[Nazi human experimentation#Experiments on twins|Nazi experiments]] in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] during [[World War II]]. A [[dybbuk]] brought the brother back to life to use as a portal into the world of the living. Kozma killed her twin to stop the spirit, and now it haunts her family for revenge, which is why Casey's mother became insane and committed suicide.\n\nKozma gives Casey a [[hamsa]] amulet for protection, instructs her to destroy all mirrors and burn the shards, and refers her to [[Rabbi]] Joseph Sendak, who can perform a Jewish [[exorcism]] to remove the dybbuk out of her soul. Sendak does not believe Casey's story until he sees a dog with its head twisted upside-down in his [[synagogue]]. The dybbuk kills Kozma, then Romy soon after. Casey and her boyfriend Mark both see the spirit after it kills Romy and realize that it's getting stronger. \n\nSendak, Mark, [[Episcopal priest]] Arthur Wyndham, and other volunteers begin the exorcism, but the dybbuk attacks them and several are wounded or killed. The spirit, having possessed the priest, chases Casey and Mark. Mark knocks Wyndham unconscious but gets possessed. Casey stabs Mark in the neck with the amulet. Sendak arrives and he and Casey complete the exorcism. The rite draws the dybbuk out of the human world, but Mark falls and dies during the separation.\n\nCasey mourns her boyfriend but wonders why the dybbuk suddenly became active in her life now and why it didn't attack her earlier. She takes a pregnancy test and learns that she is pregnant with Mark's twins.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Odette Annable]] as Casey Beldon: a young woman who is paranoid after becoming the centerpiece to a series of supernatural and strange events; eye color, hallucinations, dreams, and seeing strange things. Casey later learns she had a twin that died in the womb, this is all happening to her because a dybbuk (a spirit trapped between worlds) sees her as a doorway to return to the mortal world.\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Romy Marshall: Casey's superstitious and loyal best friend. Romy is amongst those targeted by the dybbuk  to effectively weaken Casey to make her vulnerable. \n* [[Gary Oldman]] as Rabbi Joseph Sendak: A rabbi who Casey confides in to stop the spirit.\n* [[Cam Gigandet]] as Mark Hardigan: Casey's skeptical but supportive boyfriend. Initially he is doubtful of all the transpiring events, but he later becomes helpful for Casey.\n* [[James Remar]] as Gordon Beldon: Casey's father. \n* [[Jane Alexander]] as Sofi Kozma: A survivor of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz, who is revealed to be Janet's biological mother and Casey's grandmother. Following the traumatizing possession and target by the dybbuk in the 1940s, Sofi becomes knowledgeable to avoid the spirit, and becomes a guide for Casey.\n* [[Idris Elba]] as Arthur Wyndham: A priest who assists in Casey's exorcism.\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Janet Beldon: Casey's deceased mother, who was clinically depressed and committed suicide when Casey was a young girl. Janet committed suicide after becoming a target by the dybbuk attempting to gain access to the mortal realm, and the mental effects drove her to commit suicide.\n* [[Atticus Shaffer]] as Matty Newton: A neighborhood boy whom Casey babysits and begins exhibiting odd behavior over the course of the film.\n* [[Ethan Cutkosky]] as Barto: Sofi's twin brother who died in Auschwitz during a Nazi experiment on twins. A dybbuk saw him as a chance to get in the mortal realm, and resurrected him to get into the mortal world. To stop it, Sofi killed \"Barto\" out of intention to defeat the spirit. The dybbuk continued to appear in the form of Barto throughout the film, ultimately having merged with his soul.\n* [[Rhys Coiro]] as Mr. Shields: Casey's college professor.\n* Michael Sassone as Eli Walker: An old man in the senior citizen's home Sofi lives at.\n* [[Rachel Brosnahan]] as Lisa: A friend of Casey and Mark\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn the United States, ''The Unborn'' opened at the third position, grossing $19,810,585 averaging $8,405 at 2,357 sites.<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2009&wknd=002&p=.htm Weekend Box Office Results for January 9-11].

Both of the Bj\u00f6rler brothers and Erlandsson were members of the seminal [[melodic death metal]] band [[At the Gates]], a pioneering force in the [[Swedish death metal]] scene.\n\nThe majority of members, past and present, are from Gothenburg, Sweden; with the exception of Patrik Jensen, who is from [[Link\u00f6ping]]; [[Per M\u00f6ller Jensen]], who is from [[Denmark]]; Adrian Erlandsson, who is from Malm\u00f6; and Marco \"Shark-Fin\" Annaka, who is from [[Finland]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''The Haunted'' (1996\u20131999)===\nOn 27 July 1996, Patrik Jensen co-created the band with Adrian Erlandsson, who had just become an ex-member of his former band, [[At the Gates]], due to the bands' split up the day before.<ref>[http://www.the-haunted.com/site/?p=band ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221180937/http://www.the-haunted.com/site/?p=band |date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> They had made their [[demo (music)|demo]], called ''Demo '97'', in 1997.\n\nThe band released their first album, while signed to [[Earache Records]], the self-titled debut ''[[The Haunted (album)|The Haunted]]'', in 1998. The album resulted in The Haunted being praised as ''Newcomer of the Year'' by several magazines, and the album being called ''Album of the Year'' by [[Terrorizer Magazine]]. The Haunted made a respectable live reputation staging the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Heavy metal music|metal]] scene, as well the international scene, touring the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] with [[Napalm Death]].\n\nAfter the release of this album, [[Peter Dolving]] and [[Adrian Erlandsson]] both left the band in 1999, the former focusing on a solo career and the latter joining [[Cradle of Filth]]. Their replacements were Marco Aro and Per M\u00f6ller Jensen. The band began to record their second album right after.\n\n===''Made Me Do It'' (2000\u20132002)===\nTheir second album, ''[[Made Me Do It]]'', released in 2000, was more melodic and resembled the [[Gothenburg metal|Gothenburg style]] (with bands such as [[At the Gates]], etc.) more than old-school [[thrash metal]] that was used on ''The Haunted''. It is originally called ''Made Me Do It'', but it is meant for the band name to be included in the title. \"''The Haunted Made Me Do It''\" topped [[College Music Journal|CMJ]] Loud Rock Radio Chart in four weeks, and won a [[Grammis|Swedish Grammy]] for ''Best Hard Rock Album''. The album was followed by European tours with [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Nile (band)|Nile]], [[The Crown (band)|The Crown]] in U.K., and [[In Flames]] in [[Japan]]. The Haunted played on festivals such as ''2000 Decibel'', [[Hultsfred]] (both in Sweden), [[Graspop]] ([[Belgium]]), and [[Wacken Open Air]] ([[Germany]]).

After another tour to [[Scandinavia]], [[North America]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]] in the fall of 2003, the sudden departure of Marco Aro came as a shock. Though, this opened a new chance of building up a reunion with former vocalist [[Peter Dolving]].\n\nTheir first album with Peter Dolving back at the helm (and signed to a new deal with [[Century Media]]), was entitled ''[[Revolver (The Haunted album)|Revolver]]''. The new album was released in October 2004 and named as it was to convey the evolution of the band and the music it plays as a whole. ''Revolver'' was met with a fair amount of fan support and critical acclaim, and the band toured the world extensively in support of it, including a second stage spot at [[Ozzfest]] 2005. On February 2 of 2005, Marco Aro played his last show in Stockholm, Sweden but as a guest singer. In 2006, the band performed on the Extreme The Dojo vol.15 tour in Japan with [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Nile band|Nile]], while [[Edge of Spirit (band)|Edge of Spirit]] opened for them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.earache.com/bands/haunted/haunted.html|title=Earache Records|accessdate=2009-08-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409102420/http://www.earache.com/bands/haunted/haunted.html|archivedate=2009-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===''The Dead Eye'' (2006\u20132007)===\nThe Haunted's fifth studio album, ''[[The Dead Eye]]'', was released on 30 October 2006 in Europe and so far has been a huge success, showing a more sinister side to Dolving's vocals and a more technical, haunting musical display.

Jonas announced on The Band's Facebook that both he and Patrik were still deeply committed to the band, but now that two other band members have left, they are uncertain of the band's future thus creating a hiatus.\n\n===''Exit Wounds'' (2014\u20132016)===\nPatrik Jensen and Jonas Bj\u00f6rler had a discussion at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband. When Jensen asked Bj\u00f6rler who should be the new vocalist in the band, Bj\u00f6rler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days later, Jensen phoned Aro asking him to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and was tempted to rejoin, but he was hesitant at first because he was not interested in returning to the hectic touring he had done with the band in the past. The Haunted had done a lot of touring for almost a decade straight after Aro left, reducing the band's desire to continue with more. More hesitation came because Aro had struggled with [[drug addiction]] during his time with the band, causing problems with his family, and he didn't want it to reoccur. He indicated that he needed to discuss rejoining the band with his family.\nAro is also in the band [[The Resistance (Swedish band)|The Resistance]] and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have a discussion with The Resistance as well. Aro told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which encouraged Aro to rejoin The Haunted.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marco-aro-why-i-decided-to-rejoin-the-haunted/ |title=Marco Aro: Why I Decided To Rejoin The Haunted |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2013-06-29 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxFFJSk_UMw |title=Access: The Resistance - singer Marco Aro |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> His picture was in a [[silhouette]] on the band's official [[Facebook]] the day before the band announced a new line-up.

members were [[Anders Bj\u00f6rler|Anders]] and [[Jonas Bj\u00f6rler]], [[Peter Dolving]], [[Adrian Erlandsson]] and [[Patrik Jensen]]. Both of the Bj\u00f6rler brothers and Erlandsson were members of the seminal [[melodic death metal]] band [[At the Gates]], a pioneering force in the [[Swedish death metal]] scene.\n\nThe majority of members, past and present, are from Gothenburg, Sweden; with the exception of Patrik Jensen, who is from [[Link\u00f6ping]]; [[Per M\u00f6ller Jensen]], who is from [[Denmark]]; Adrian Erlandsson, who is from Malm\u00f6; and Marco \"Shark-Fin\" Annaka, who is from [[Finland]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation and ''The Haunted'' (1996\u20131999)===\nOn 27 July 1996, Patrik Jensen co-created the band with Adrian Erlandsson, who had just become an ex-member of his former band, [[At the Gates]], due to the bands' split up the day before.<ref>[http://www.the-haunted.com/site/?p=band ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221180937/http://www.the-haunted.com/site/?p=band |date=February 21, 2014 }}</ref> They had made their [[demo (music)|demo]], called ''Demo '97'', in 1997.\n\nThe band released their first album, while signed to [[Earache Records]], the self-titled debut ''[[The Haunted (album)|The Haunted]]'', in 1998. The album resulted in The Haunted being praised as ''Newcomer of the Year'' by several magazines, and the album being called ''Album of the Year'' by [[Terrorizer Magazine]]. The Haunted made a respectable live reputation staging the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Heavy metal music|metal]] scene, as well the international scene, touring the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] with [[Napalm Death]].\n\nAfter the release of this album, [[Peter Dolving]] and [[Adrian Erlandsson]] both left the band in 1999, the former focusing on a solo career and the latter joining [[Cradle of Filth]]. Their replacements were Marco Aro and Per M\u00f6ller Jensen. The band began to record their second album right after.\n\n===''Made Me Do It'' (2000\u20132002)===\nTheir second album, ''[[Made Me Do It]]'', released in 2000, was more melodic and resembled the [[Gothenburg metal|Gothenburg style]] (with bands such as [[At the Gates]], etc.) more than old-school [[thrash metal]] that was used on ''The Haunted''. It is originally called ''Made Me Do It'', but it is meant for the band name to be included in the title. \"''The Haunted Made Me Do It''\" topped [[College Music Journal|CMJ]] Loud Rock Radio Chart in four weeks, and won a [[Grammis|Swedish Grammy]] for ''Best Hard Rock Album''. The album was followed by European tours with [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and [[Nile (band)|Nile]], [[The Crown (band)|The Crown]] in U.K., and [[In Flames]] in [[Japan]]. The Haunted played on festivals such as ''2000 Decibel'', [[Hultsfred]] (both in Sweden), [[Graspop]] ([[Belgium]]), and [[Wacken Open Air]] ([[Germany]]). The band subsequently released their first live album - ''[[Live Rounds in Tokyo]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the-haunted.com/site/?p=albums&id=03 |title=No false pride, no fashion, no fake set of values |publisher=The Haunted |accessdate=2011-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814110014/http://the-haunted.com/site/?p=albums&id=03 |archivedate=2014-08-14 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 2001, [[guitarist]]/[[songwriter]] [[Anders Bj\u00f6rler]] left the band and he was temporarily replaced by Marcus Sunesson of [[The Crown (band)|The Crown]] for The Haunted's headlining tour; in less than a year Bj\u00f6rler returned to the band. This meant that he could appear on the third studio album.\n\n===''One Kill Wonder'' and ''Revolver'' (2003\u20132005)===\nThe next album was released in February 2003 and was titled ''[[One Kill Wonder]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://the-haunted.com/site/?p=albums&id=04 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715201434/http://the-haunted.com/site/?p=albums&id=04 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=No false pride, no fashion, no fake set of values |publisher=The Haunted |accessdate=2011-07-03 }}</ref> The Haunted broke their own record being listed at number one on CMJ Loud Rock Radio Chart in five weeks. [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] hailed The Haunted as one of metal's 25 most important bands. The song ''D.O.A.'', from this album, became available for download in March 2008 for the video game [[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]], on the [[Xbox 360]]'s [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], and the [[PlayStation 3]]'s [[PlayStation Network]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35505 |title=DLC Week of 3/18 |accessdate=2008-03-17 |publisher=Harmonix |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307052540/http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?t=35505 |archivedate=2011-03-07 }}</ref> Another song from the same album, ''Shadow World'', was announced as a future download.\n\n''One Kill Wonder'' resulted in the band dominating album charts all over the world, and their first tours to [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]], another tour to [[Japan]], and a second [[Grammy]]. After another tour to [[Scandinavia]], [[North America]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Europe]] in the fall of 2003, the sudden departure of Marco Aro came as a shock. Though, this opened a new chance of building up a reunion with former vocalist [[Peter Dolving]].\n\nTheir first album with Peter Dolving back at the helm (and signed to a new deal with [[Century Media]]), was entitled ''[[Revolver (The Haunted album)|Revolver]]''. The new album was released in October 2004 and named as it was to convey the evolution of the band and the music it plays as a whole. ''Revolver'' was met with a fair amount of fan support and critical acclaim, and the band toured the world extensively in support of it, including a second stage spot at [[Ozzfest]] 2005. On February 2 of 2005, Marco Aro played his last show in Stockholm, Sweden but as a guest singer. In 2006, the band performed on the Extreme The Dojo vol.15 tour in Japan with [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]] and [[Nile band|Nile]], while [[Edge of Spirit (band)|Edge of Spirit]] opened for them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.earache.com/bands/haunted/haunted.html|title=Earache Records|accessdate=2009-08-10|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409102420/http://www.earache.com/bands/haunted/haunted.html|archivedate=2009-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===''The Dead Eye'' (2006\u20132007)===\nThe Haunted's fifth studio album, ''[[The Dead Eye]]'', was released on 30 October 2006 in Europe and so far has been a huge success, showing a more sinister side to Dolving's vocals and a more technical, haunting musical display.

In 2009 the band released a compilation album [[Warning Shots]]. In April 2010, the band released a live CD called ''[[Road Kill (The Haunted album)|Road Kill]]'', and they supported heavy metal legends [[Slayer]] on their August 2010 tour. The band was also confirmed as being part of the soundtrack for [[Namco Bandai Games]]' 2010 remake of [[Splatterhouse (2010 video game)|Splatterhouse]].\n\n===''Unseen'' (2010\u20132012)===\nIn April, 2010, Dolving revealed that they had started writing new material,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://squatneysteel.wordpress.com/2010/04/21/interview-peter-dolving|title=Interview: Peter Dolving|publisher=Squatneysteel.wordpress.com|accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> and the recording of a seventh album started in the same fall. On December 30, the band announced that the upcoming album was to be called ''[[Unseen (album)|Unseen]]'' and released in March 2011.<ref name=Blabbermouth>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=151630 |title=The Haunted: New Album Title Announced - Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref>\n\nThe first sneak preview of the album was on 22 January 2011, when the band performed the song \"No Ghost\" at the [[Sveriges Radio P3|P3 Guld Gala]], broadcast live on [[Sveriges Television|TV]] and [[Sveriges Radio|radio]] throughout Sweden.\n\nOn 29 February 2012, Peter Dolving quit the band again. On 1 March 2012, The Haunted announced vocalist auditions via Facebook page:\n{{cquote| The Haunted is looking for a new voice...

Jonas announced on The Band's Facebook that both he and Patrik were still deeply committed to the band, but now that two other band members have left, they are uncertain of the band's future thus creating a hiatus.\n\n===''Exit Wounds'' (2014\u20132016)===\nPatrik Jensen and Jonas Bj\u00f6rler had a discussion at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband. When Jensen asked Bj\u00f6rler who should be the new vocalist in the band, Bj\u00f6rler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days later, Jensen phoned Aro asking him to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and was tempted to rejoin, but he was hesitant at first because he was not interested in returning to the hectic touring he had done with the band in the past. The Haunted had done a lot of touring for almost a decade straight after Aro left, reducing the band's desire to continue with more. More hesitation came because Aro had struggled with [[drug addiction]] during his time with the band, causing problems with his family, and he didn't want it to reoccur. He indicated that he needed to discuss rejoining the band with his family.\nAro is also in the band [[The Resistance (Swedish band)|The Resistance]] and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so he had to have a discussion with The Resistance as well. Aro told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which encouraged Aro to rejoin The Haunted.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marco-aro-why-i-decided-to-rejoin-the-haunted/ |title=Marco Aro: Why I Decided To Rejoin The Haunted |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2013-06-29 |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxFFJSk_UMw |title=Access: The Resistance - singer Marco Aro |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-07-11}}</ref> His picture was in a [[silhouette]] on the band's official [[Facebook]] the day before the band announced a new line-up.
