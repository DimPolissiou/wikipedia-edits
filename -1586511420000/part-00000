NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), the [[National Association of Basketball Coaches]] (NABC), the ''[[Sporting News]]'', and the [[United States Basketball Writers Association]] (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\n \nBefore the 2017\u201318 season, it was impossible for a consensus women's All-America team to be determined because the AP had been the only body that divided its women's selections into separate teams. The USBWA first named separate teams in 2017\u201318. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]] (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize ''Sporting News'' as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\n\n===Major player of the year awards===\n*'''[[John R.

Thus {{lang|ar|\u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u064a\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0628}} ''huwwa yaktub'' (\"he writes\") \u2192 {{lang|ar|\u0646\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0646\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0628}} ''na\u1e25nu naktub'' (\"we write\").\n\n===Saraiki n\u016bn===\nIt is '''retroflex nasal'''  [[consonant]]al sound  symbol, used in some [[Speech communication|spoken]] [[language]]s. The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|\u0273}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>n`</code>. Like all the [[retroflex consonant]]s, the IPA symbol is formed by adding a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of an en (the letter used for the corresponding [[alveolar consonant]]). It is similar to {{angbr IPA|\u0272}}, the letter for the [[palatal nasal]], which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem, and to {{angbr IPA|\u014b}}, the letter for the [[velar nasal]], which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem.\n[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] uses the letter \u27e8\u0768\u27e9 for {{IPAslink|\u0273}}. It is a compound of n\u016bn and rre (\u27e8\u0691\u27e9). For example:\n:\u06a9\u0768 \u0645\u0768\u060c \u0686\u06be\u0768 \u0686\u06be\u0768\u060c \u0648\u0646\u0684\u0768\u06d4\n\n===Social media campaign (2014)===\n{{see also|Christians#Arabic terms|Persecution of Christians by ISIL|Sectarianism and minorities in the Syrian Civil War#Christians}}\nAfter the [[Northern Iraq offensive (June 2014)|fall of Mosul]], ISIL demanded [[Assyrian Christians]] in the city to [[Forced conversion|convert to Islam]], [[Jizya|pay tribute]], or face execution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28381455|title=BBC News - Iraqi Christians flee after Isis issue Mosul ultimatum|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> ISIL begun marking homes of Christian residents with the letter ''n\u016bn'' for ''Nassarah'' (\"[[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]]\").<ref name=\"BBC-1\">{{cite news |date=August 7, 2014 |title=Iraqi Christians flee after Isis issue Mosul ultimatum |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28381455 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724045752/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28381455 |archivedate=July 24, 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph-2\">{{cite news |last=Loveluck |first=Louisa |date=August 7, 2014 |title=Christians flee Iraq's Mosul after Islamists tell them: convert, pay or die |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10977698/Christians-flee-Iraqs-Mosul-after-Islamists-tell-them-convert-pay-or-die.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730003543/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/10977698/Christians-flee-Iraqs-Mosul-after-Islamists-tell-them-convert-pay-or-die.html |archivedate=July 30, 2014 |accessdate=August 7, 2014 }}</ref> Thousands of Christians, Yazidis (the latter whom were given only the choice of conversion or death) and other, mostly [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]], Muslims (whom ISIL consider to be [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]]) abandoned their homes and land.\n\nIn response to the [[Persecution of Christians by ISIL|persecution of Christians]] and [[Genocide of Yazidis by ISIL|Yazidis]] by ISIL, an international social media campaign was launched to raise global awareness of the plight of religious minorities in Mosul, making use of the letter '''{{lang|ar|\u0646}}''' (''nun'')&mdash;the mark that ISIL troops spray painted on properties owned by Christians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/383493/christian-genocide-symbolized-one-letter-christine-sisto|title=A Christian Genocide Symbolized by One Letter|work=National Review Online}}</ref> Some Christians changed their profile pictures on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] to pictures of the letter {{lang|ar|\u0646}} as a symbol of support.<ref name=\"euronews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/07/22/how-an-arabic-letter-was-reclaimed-to-support-iraqs-persecuted-christians-n/|title=#\u0646: How an Arabic letter was reclaimed to support Iraq\u2019s persecuted Christians|work=euronews}}</ref> The letter {{lang|ar|\u0646}}, in relation to this social media campaign, is being called the \"Mark of the Nazarene\" from {{transl|ar|DIN|''na\u1e63r\u0101n\u012b''}} ({{lang|ar|\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a}}; plural {{transl|ar|DIN|''na\u1e63\u0101r\u0101''}} {{lang|ar|\u0646\u0635\u0627\u0631\u0649}}), a normative Arabic term disparagingly used by ISIL to brand Christians.<ref name=\"euronews.com\" />\n\nThe word ''na\u1e63\u0101r\u0101'' comes from [[Classical Arabic]].

It was founded in 2001 by friends [[Mariusz Duda]], Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski, [[Piotr Kozieradzki]] and Jacek Melnicki, who shared a love for progressive rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although Duda, the main lyricist and composer of the band, was originally a fan of [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[experimental music]], like [[Radiohead]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Dead Can Dance]], [[Tangerine Dream]], and [[Peter Gabriel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backgroundmagazine.nl/Specials/InterviewDuda.html|title=BACKGROUND MAGAZINE Interview Mariusz Duda (Riverside, Lunatic Soul)|website=www.backgroundmagazine.nl|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> Riverside can be described as a blend of atmospheric rock and metal elements, resulting in a sound similar to that of [[Porcupine Tree]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Opeth]], and [[Dream Theater]], while still maintaining an identity of their own.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings and ''Out of Myself'' ===\nOne day near the turn of the millennium, during a short drive, Piotr Kozieradzki played [[Marillion]] in his car for Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski. While drummer Piotr 'Mitloff' Kozieradzki had played in two death metal bands, Dominion and Hate, and Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski had played guitar in a metal band, Unnamed, they both shared a deep affection for progressive rock. They were already friends with producer and keyboardist Jacek Melnicki who also owned his own studio. The three decided to experiment with progressive music but they needed a bass player to complete the lineup. Mariusz Duda, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist from the band Xanadu, agreed to attend a rehearsal in late fall of 2001 at the request of Jacek. Reactions to this first meeting between the four experienced instrumentalists were extremely positive.\n\nAfter a few rehearsals, the members realized that they were involved in something special and deeply satisfying. Once a few compositions were completed, Mariusz attempted to sing in his own language, singing that was probably similar to the vocalizations in their future track \"The Curtain Falls\", although all future vocals and lyrics were to be written in English. Thus Mariusz began to take on the role of vocalist, as well as that of the bass player. In October 2002, about a year after their formation, the band performed a pair of shows in Warsaw. After the distribution of about 500 copies of their demo, the band performed at a small club in Warsaw once again in early 2003. As the band continued to write more material for a full-length release, there grew a dissonance between keyboardist Jacek and the other members of Riverside. Jacek wished to continue with his studio pursuits, so during the latter part of 2003, he split from the group.\n\nThe rest of the band was left to mix their first album, which was to be entitled ''Out of Myself''. It was released in Poland in late 2003. The success of the album in Poland and the live shows that the band performed led to a release of the album on American record label Laser's Edge in September 2004, this time with cover art from [[Travis Smith (artist)|Travis Smith]], painter for bands such as [[Opeth]], [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], and [[Devin Townsend]]. The album ''[[Out of Myself]]'' has won best debut in many magazines and websites such as Metal Hammer and Belgium Prog-Nose.\n\n=== ''Voices in My Head'' and ''Second Life Syndrome'' ===\nFollowing their 2003 debut ''[[Out of Myself]]'' and the success that followed in 2004, the band began working on an EP entitled ''[[Voices in My Head (EP)|Voices in My Head]]'' which was at first a release exclusive to Poland through the label [[Mystic Production]]. The quartet from Poland performed their first foreign gig at the Progpower festival in the Dutch city of Baarlo. The band were taken in by major prog label [[Inside Out Music|Inside Out]], releasing ''[[Second Life Syndrome]]'' in late October 2005. The album was a massive success, expanding the scope of the band's reach even further than Out of Myself. The album holds a formidable spot as number 62 on ''[[Prog Archives]]'' top 100 prog albums as well as the number one rated album of 2005.<ref name=\"prog archives top list\">{{cite web | url = http://www.progarchives.com/top-prog-albums.asp?salbumtypes=1#list | title = Progarchives top 100 albums | date = 2009-01-23 | accessdate= 2009-01-23}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[Voices in My Head (EP)|Voices in My Head]]'', the EP originally released in Poland only, was re-released under the InsideOut label, now revamped with the inclusion of three high quality live tracks off the ''[[Out of Myself]]'' album. In addition, the band played their first overseas show at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on 24 June 2006. Soon after, the band would begin writing for its third full-length album and final instalment in the Reality Dream Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riversideband.pl/en/bio-band|title=RAPID EYE MOVEMENT, REALITY DREAM|website=riversideband.pl}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Rapid Eye Movement'' and ''Lunatic Soul'' ===\nIn October 2007, the band released the album ''[[Rapid Eye Movement (album)|Rapid Eye Movement]]'', once again under the InsideOut label. The European release had the standard nine tracks but the American release saw two versions of the album. One was a single CD with the nine tracks from the album, plus three tracks from their 02 Panic Room Single. This single was also exclusive to Mystic Production and therefore mostly unavailable to oversea fans. The other version contained 2 CDs, the first with the nine album tracks and the second disc containing the three songs from the single as well as two new, more atmospheric, compositions. Before the release, the band toured in support for [[Dream Theater]] on the European leg of their tour, exposing them to even more potential fans. Mariusz Duda released the self-titled debut album from his new project  ''[[Lunatic Soul]]'' by [[Kscope]] on 13 October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/lunaticsoul |title=Kscope present Lunatic Soul |publisher=Kscopemusic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Anno Domini High Definition'' and ''Memories in My Head'' ===\nThe quartet's next album was \"Anno Domini High Definition\".<ref>[http://riverside.art.pl/en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621070137/http://riverside.art.pl/en |date=June 21, 2009 }}</ref> Mariusz Duda had the following to say about the album on 27 January 2009:\n\t\n\"We have gone from Warsaw, we have changed the studio and the producer.

It was founded in 2001 by friends [[Mariusz Duda]], Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski, [[Piotr Kozieradzki]] and Jacek Melnicki, who shared a love for progressive rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although Duda, the main lyricist and composer of the band, was originally a fan of [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]] and [[experimental music]], like [[Radiohead]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Dead Can Dance]], [[Tangerine Dream]], and [[Peter Gabriel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backgroundmagazine.nl/Specials/InterviewDuda.html|title=BACKGROUND MAGAZINE Interview Mariusz Duda (Riverside, Lunatic Soul)|website=www.backgroundmagazine.nl|access-date=2017-11-15}}</ref> Riverside can be described as a blend of atmospheric rock and metal elements, resulting in a sound similar to that of [[Porcupine Tree]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Opeth]], and [[Dream Theater]], while still maintaining an identity of their own.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Beginnings and ''Out of Myself'' ===\nOne day near the turn of the millennium, during a short drive, Piotr Kozieradzki played [[Marillion]] in his car for Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski. While drummer Piotr 'Mitloff' Kozieradzki had played in two death metal bands, Dominion and Hate, and Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski had played guitar in a metal band, Unnamed, they both shared a deep affection for progressive rock. They were already friends with producer and keyboardist Jacek Melnicki who also owned his own studio. The three decided to experiment with progressive music but they needed a bass player to complete the lineup. Mariusz Duda, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist from the band Xanadu, agreed to attend a rehearsal in late fall of 2001 at the request of Jacek. Reactions to this first meeting between the four experienced instrumentalists were extremely positive.\n\nAfter a few rehearsals, the members realized that they were involved in something special and deeply satisfying. Once a few compositions were completed, Mariusz attempted to sing in his own language, singing that was probably similar to the vocalizations in their future track \"The Curtain Falls\", although all future vocals and lyrics were to be written in English. Thus Mariusz began to take on the role of vocalist, as well as that of the bass player. In October 2002, about a year after their formation, the band performed a pair of shows in Warsaw. After the distribution of about 500 copies of their demo, the band performed at a small club in Warsaw once again in early 2003. As the band continued to write more material for a full-length release, there grew a dissonance between keyboardist Jacek and the other members of Riverside. Jacek wished to continue with his studio pursuits, so during the latter part of 2003, he split from the group.\n\nThe rest of the band was left to mix their first album, which was to be entitled ''Out of Myself''. It was released in Poland in late 2003. The success of the album in Poland and the live shows that the band performed led to a release of the album on American record label Laser's Edge in September 2004, this time with cover art from [[Travis Smith (artist)|Travis Smith]], painter for bands such as [[Opeth]], [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], and [[Devin Townsend]]. The album ''[[Out of Myself]]'' has won best debut in many magazines and websites such as Metal Hammer and Belgium Prog-Nose.\n\n=== ''Voices in My Head'' and ''Second Life Syndrome'' ===\nFollowing their 2003 debut ''[[Out of Myself]]'' and the success that followed in 2004, the band began working on an EP entitled ''[[Voices in My Head (EP)|Voices in My Head]]'' which was at first a release exclusive to Poland through the label [[Mystic Production]]. The quartet from Poland performed their first foreign gig at the Progpower festival in the Dutch city of Baarlo. The band were taken in by major prog label [[Inside Out Music|Inside Out]], releasing ''[[Second Life Syndrome]]'' in late October 2005. The album was a massive success, expanding the scope of the band's reach even further than Out of Myself. The album holds a formidable spot as number 62 on Prog Archives top 100 prog albums as well as the number one rated album of 2005.<ref name=\"prog archives top list\">{{cite web | url = http://www.progarchives.com/top-prog-albums.asp?salbumtypes=1#list | title = Progarchives top 100 albums | date = 2009-01-23 | accessdate= 2009-01-23}}</ref> In 2006, ''[[Voices in My Head (EP)|Voices in My Head]]'', the EP originally released in Poland only, was re-released under the InsideOut label, now revamped with the inclusion of three high quality live tracks off the ''[[Out of Myself]]'' album. In addition, the band played their first overseas show at NEARfest in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania on 24 June 2006. Soon after, the band would begin writing for its third full-length album and final instalment in the Reality Dream Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riversideband.pl/en/bio-band|title=RAPID EYE MOVEMENT, REALITY DREAM|website=riversideband.pl}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Rapid Eye Movement'' and ''Lunatic Soul'' ===\nIn October 2007, the band released the album ''[[Rapid Eye Movement (album)|Rapid Eye Movement]]'', once again under the InsideOut label. The European release had the standard nine tracks but the American release saw two versions of the album. One was a single CD with the nine tracks from the album, plus three tracks from their 02 Panic Room Single. This single was also exclusive to Mystic Production and therefore mostly unavailable to oversea fans. The other version contained 2 CDs, the first with the nine album tracks and the second disc containing the three songs from the single as well as two new, more atmospheric, compositions. Before the release, the band toured in support for [[Dream Theater]] on the European leg of their tour, exposing them to even more potential fans. Mariusz Duda released the self-titled debut album from his new project  ''[[Lunatic Soul]]'' by [[Kscope]] on 13 October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/lunaticsoul |title=Kscope present Lunatic Soul |publisher=Kscopemusic.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Anno Domini High Definition'' and ''Memories in My Head'' ===\nThe quartet's next album was \"Anno Domini High Definition\".<ref>[http://riverside.art.pl/en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621070137/http://riverside.art.pl/en |date=June 21, 2009 }}</ref> Mariusz Duda had the following to say about the album on 27 January 2009:\n\t\n\"We have gone from Warsaw, we have changed the studio and the producer. We care deeply about creating a coherent record and that is why most probably there are only going to be five songs on it. The material will be energetic, multifarious, and - I hope so - very good for live performances. It will be a story about liquid modernity, life in a constant hurry, stress and anxiety about the future. A picture of our times in 1920 x 1080 definition.\"\n\t\nThe record was released in Poland by Mystic Production on 15 June 2009. ''Anno Domini High Definition'' became the best selling album in Poland during its second week on the charts, following a debut at sixth place.:<ref>[http://www.olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=517&lang=en ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627040030/http://www.olis.onyx.pl/listy/index.asp?idlisty=517&lang=en |date=June 27, 2015 }}</ref> The album was released on 6 June in the rest of Europe and on 28 July in North America.

The second disc is a DVD that contains a seven-song video production. The show was taped at the Paradiso Theater in Amsterdam.\n\nAn EP entitled [[Memories in My Head]] was released in 2011.\n\n=== ''Shrine of New Generation Slaves'' ===\nIn January 2013, Riverside released their fifth full-length album, ''[[Shrine of New Generation Slaves]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riversideband.pl/en/discography/shrine-of-new-generation-slaves |title=Riverside - Shrine of New Generation Slaves |publisher=Riversideband.pl |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Love, Fear and the Time Machine'', ''Eye of the Soundscape'' and the death of Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski ===\nThe sixth full-length album, ''[[Love, Fear and the Time Machine]]'', was released at the beginning of September 2015 and obtained higher peak sales outside Poland than their previous albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://riversideband.pl/en/news/item/riverside-are-entering-the-studio-to-record-their-sixth-album-love-fear-and-the-time-machine |title=Riverside - Riverside are entering the studio to record their sixth album \"Love, Fear and the Time Machine\" |publisher=Riversideband.pl |date= |accessdate=2015-09-13}}</ref>\n\nOn February 21, 2016, guitarist Piotr Grudzi\u0144ski died.<ref>{{cite web|title=RIVERSIDE Guitarist PIOTR GRUDZINSKI Dead At 40|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/riverside-guitarist-piotr-grudzinski-dead-at-40/|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 21, 2016|accessdate=February 21, 2016}}</ref> He had attended a [[The Winery Dogs|Winery Dogs]] concert in [[Warsaw]] the night before.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mikeportnoy/status/701418674989748225 |title=Mike Portnoy on Twitter: \"Just received the shocking news that Riverside guitarist Piotr Grudzinski passed away after attending last nights Winery Dogs show in Warsaw\" |publisher=Twitter |date=2016-02-21 |accessdate=2016-03-05}}</ref> It was revealed on the 4th of March that he had died of a sudden cardiac arrest.

Brownlow served in several positions in the Union Army, finishing the war as colonel of the 1st Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry Regiment (Union). He was noted for his courage and perceptiveness in battle and keen sense of military tactics. He led several daring raids and attacks. The [[United States Senate]] confirmed the award of the grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, to Brownlow on March 12, 1866. After the war, he was adjutant general of the State of Tennessee and then a railroad superintendent. He died in 1879 at the age of 36.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Patton Brownlow was born on December 14, 1842, in [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]].

A few days later, on October 12, 1863, Campbell's brigade made an attack at nightfall in the rain on Confederate Brigadier General [[Philip D. Roddey]]'s Division, which soon disengaged and moved to a camp away from the battlefield. The regiment removed to [[Winchester, Tennessee]], to rest and re-equip. Then on November 25, 1863, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry engaged the Confederate 25th Tennessee Infantry Regiment and Confederate guerrillas at [[Sparta, Tennessee]], eventually driving them off.

On December 24, 1863, Campbell's brigade and an artillery battery were ordered to attack a Confederate force at [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. The Confederates had left Dandridge and taken up a position about {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east at Hays Ferry where the 1st Tennessee Cavalry became heavily engaged in support of Colonel Garrard's cavalry brigade from the Army of the Ohio.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 122</ref> During the day, the regiment lost 11 killed and 7 wounded before it withdrew to [[New Market, Tennessee]].\n\nOn November 16, 1863, Brigadier General [[Washington Lafayette Elliott]] replaced Major General [[David S. Stanley]] as Chief of Cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 108</ref> When McCook's division moved to Knoxville, Brigadier General [[Samuel D. Sturgis]] of the Army of the Ohio took command of the division because he had taken command of all cavalry operating in East Tennessee on December 15, 1863.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 119\"/>\n\nOn December 29, 1863, Brigadier General Sturgis learned that a brigade of Confederate cavalry had moved to Dandridge and sent most of the cavalry opposite Confederate Lieutenant General Longstreet's encampment to destroy it. He left only Campbell's brigade to hold the camp and valley at [[Battle of Mossy Creek|Mossy Creek]], Tennessee. Campbell positioned his regiments and three cannons of Lilly's battery which had not been sent on the mission to Dandridge in the valley. A large Confederate force moved to attack Campbell's regiments, which fell back because they were outnumbered. Then, Colonel Campbell ordered the 1st Tennessee Cavalry to charge the Confederates on the right of a brick house, a prominent feature on the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry made the charge and halted the advance of the entire Confederate line while the 2d Michigan Cavalry, which was fighting dismounted, staggered the Confederate line with rifle fire. Campbell then again ordered his advance regiments to fall back and take a position near Lilly's battery and the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry, fighting as they moved back. Despite Colonel Campbell's misgivings, Colonel Brownlow assumed responsibility of ordering a [[saber]] charge on the advancing Confederate line of battle. The charge drove the Confederates back and the 1st Tennessee took 26 prisoners. However, they in turn were forced back by the superior number of Confederate attackers. The outnumbered Union force was reinforced at a critical moment and together with the reinforcements, Campbell's men forced the Confederates from the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry suffered 9 killed and 9 wounded in the battle.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 127&ndash;132</ref>\n\n===Fair Garden capture and escape===\nAfter the [[Battle of Mossy Creek]], the Union forces withdrew to Knoxville. After a brief expedition to fight [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (Indians) and guerrillas from North Carolina in [[Cocke County, Tennessee]], Colonels Brownlow and Palmer with about one thousand men of the 1st Tennessee Cavalry, 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry and 10th Ohio Cavalry held the army's right wing, watching for arrival of a Confederate force reportedly approaching East Tennessee from North Carolina. Confederate Brigadier General [[William T. Martin]] marched his army across the country from Dandridge and went into camp near Fair Garden, Tennessee. This unexpected movement of Longstreet's cavalry made it necessary to push forward the divisions of McCook and Wolford from Knoxville to support the right wing. Late in the afternoon of January 26, 1864, the Confederates under General Martin were discovered advancing toward [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] on the Fair Garden road. McCook's division was ordered to meet this force. Campbell's brigade moved to strike the Confederates behind the east fork of the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)|Pigeon River]] but after an artillery duel, nightfall halted the engagement.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 138&ndash;139</ref>\n\nIn the renewed engagement of January 27, 1864, as nightfall approached, Colonel Brownlow became separated from his men while pursuing Confederates who had been driven from the field. Brownlow was taken prisoner. He hid his grade (rank) and identity from his captors, claiming to be a private, and managed to bribe a guard with a gold watch to permit him to escape. His men were greatly relieved when he returned to camp the next day.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 139&ndash;144</ref> Then, the Union troops fell back to Sevierville and on January 29, 1864, the Union cavalry went into camp at [[Maryville, Tennessee]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of Knoxville.<ref name=\"Carter144\">Carter, 1902, p. 144</ref>\n\n===Atlanta campaign; McCook's raid===\nOn February 10, 1864, McCook's division left for [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], to rejoin the Army of the Cumberland and to go into camp at that location until May.<ref name=\"Carter145\">Carter, 1902, p. 145</ref> At Cleveland, the 8th Iowa Cavalry replaced the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry in the First Brigade of the First Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Cumberland.

He had most of his men keep up a steady fire from their side of the shore while he led a squad of nine men to a point about {{convert|1|mi|km}} upstream where they put their guns and cartridge boxes on a small wooden raft and swam naked across the Chattahoochee.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 170</ref> Leaving one man to guard the raft, Brownlow led his naked men through the woods. As they somewhat painfully proceeded without shoes or other clothing for cover, Brownlow ordered them to \"cuss low\" so as not to give themselves away. When they reached the Confederate positions, they emerged, clothed only with cartridge boxes, screaming and shooting. The scene so startled the Confederate defenders that most of them immediately fled into the woods, leaving 12 men to be taken prisoner.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 171. Carter noted on page 172 that General McCook reported that Brownlow returned with 4 prisoners. He does not explain the discrepancy but presumably 8 of the original prisoners escaped in the walk back to the spot where they swam back to the other side of the river.</ref> After swimming back across the river, Brownlow's men expressed even more admiration for their commander who was willing to share the hardships and dangers of the mission and not just to order others to carry out the unusual and uncomfortable task.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 172</ref><ref>Evans, David.

Now part of Brigadier General [[John T. Croxton]]'s brigade, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry reached Palmetto Station, Georgia and about 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and began to destroy telegraph facilities, the depot and supplies. By 9:00 pm., the force moved toward Lovejoy Station, Georgia, which they reached by dawn the next morning.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 177</ref> Then, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry captured a 500&ndash;wagon train and turned it over to the rear guard to be destroyed.<ref name=\"Carter178\">Carter, 1902, p. 178</ref> By 7:00&nbsp;p.m., the regiment began to destroy facilities at Lovejoy Station.<ref name=\"Carter178\"/> General McCook waited until 2:00&nbsp;p.m. in an effort to communicate with General Stoneman and, failing to hear from Stoneman, McCook left just as Confederate Major General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry approached.

Brownlow said he would be \"damned if he would surrender\" because Southern Unionists were treated worse by the Confederates that Northerners.<ref name=\"Carter182\"/> Brownlow led the brigade in an effort to escape with Croxton coming with him. McCook headed for Marietta by another route.<ref name=\"Carter182\"/> The brigade was scattered and Brownlow took command of those with him.<ref name=\"Carter183\">Carter, 1902, p. 183</ref> He found a small bridge and an escape route from the imminent battle and his remaining force got ahead of the Confederate pursuers. They reached the Chattahoochee River at Rotherwood about 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on July 31 and started crossing in two small canoes. Some troopers swam the river with their horses and Brownlow swam back and forth several times to help men across.<ref name=\"Carter183\"/> About 200 to 300 men had made the river crossing when Confederates appeared and began to attack and take many of the exhausted and surprised men as prisoners. Many of those who had got across the river could not get their horses across and the group was still about {{convert|75|mi|km}} from Marietta so they were at greater risk of being captured. Brownlow and a small group of men from several regiments got to Marietta on August 1 and others began to arrive on August 2.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 185</ref> Many of McCook's men straggled into Marietta by August 10 but Stoneman and several hundred of his men were captured trying to free the Union prisoners at Macon.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 186\">Carter, 1902, p. 186</ref> Thus, Colonel Brownlow briefly commanded the first brigade of the first division of the Army of the Cumberland from July 30, 1864 to August 12, 1864.<ref name=\"Hunt86\"/><ref>Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

Atlanta fell to Sherman's forces while Croxton's men were at Nashville and Franklin.\n\nThe 1st Tennessee Cavalry carried on from this date without Colonel Brownlow and had several more engagements or operations. As the war wound down to a conclusion, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry made a reconnaissance from Waterloo, Alabama as far as Corinth, Mississippi, starting on January 27, 1865. They returned to Nashville on February 10, 1865, where they remained until mustered out on June 14, 1865, having recently been rejoined by Colonel Brownlow.<ref name=\"CivilWar320\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn January 13, 1866, [[President of the United States]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Brownlow for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865.

Brownlow became [[adjutant general]] of the [[state of Tennessee]] after the election of his father as [[governor of Tennessee]]. He wrote: ''Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Tennessee of the Military Forces of the State from 1861 to 1866.'' In December 1866, Brownlow received an appointment at the grade of captain in the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th United States Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. He delayed reporting because of his state duties and ultimately resigned in 1868 because he was posted to California and did not wish to be that far from Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, 2001. p. 149</ref> His occupations thereafter included railroad superintendent for the [[Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad]], farmer and printer.

With respect to Colonel Johnson's ill health, Baggett states that Johnson imbibed heavily, especially after the death of his brother Charles and Brownlow often commanded in the field.</ref> In June 1863, Major General [[David S. Stanley]] organized the Cavalry Corps of the [[Army of the Cumberland]]. Brigadier General [[Robert B. Mitchell]] commanded the corps, Colonel (later Brigadier General) [[Edward M. McCook]] commanded the First Division and Colonel A. P. Campbell commanded the 1st Brigade, to which the 1st Tennessee Volunteer Cavalry Regiment was assigned.<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/> In that month, Major General [[William Rosecrans]] began the Tullahoma Campaign which forced the Confederates to abandon that town and retreat to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/> Brownlow's regiment covered the retreat of the Union Army to Chattanooga after the [[Battle of Chickamauga]], September 19&ndash;20, 1863.<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/><ref>Carter, 1902, p. 96</ref>\n\nOn September 30, 1863, Confederate Major General [[Joseph Wheeler]] began a ride around the Union Army in an effort to cut their communications and supplies in support of Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s siege of Chattanooga. Brownlow's regiment joined in the pursuit of Wheeler's force, riding over {{convert|300|mi}} in eight days. A few days later, on October 12, 1863, Campbell's brigade made an attack at nightfall in the rain on Confederate Brigadier General [[Philip D. Roddey]]'s Division, which soon disengaged and moved to a camp away from the battlefield. The regiment removed to [[Winchester, Tennessee]], to rest and re-equip. Then on November 25, 1863, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry engaged the Confederate 25th Tennessee Infantry Regiment and Confederate guerrillas at [[Sparta, Tennessee]], eventually driving them off. In early December, they were joined by the other regiments of their brigade.<ref name=\"CivilWar319\"/><ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 100&ndash;111</ref>\n\n===Knoxville campaign===\nOn December 7, 1863, McCook's First Division of the Army of the Cumberland Cavalry Corps headed for [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], where the Union garrison under Major General [[Ambrose Burnside]] was threatened by the corps of Confederate [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lieutenant General]] [[James Longstreet]], which had been detached from General [[Braxton Bragg]]'s army.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 112</ref> On December 15, the division reached Knoxville and McCook allowed the 1st Tennessee Cavalry to be the first regiment to enter the home town of Colonel Brownlow and many of the men.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 113</ref> Burnside had just been relieved as commander of the Union forces at Knoxville by Brigadier General [[John G.

On December 24, 1863, Campbell's brigade and an artillery battery were ordered to attack a Confederate force at [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. The Confederates had left Dandridge and taken up a position about {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east at Hays Ferry where the 1st Tennessee Cavalry became heavily engaged in support of Colonel Garrard's cavalry brigade from the Army of the Ohio.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 122</ref> During the day, the regiment lost 11 killed and 7 wounded before it withdrew to [[New Market, Tennessee]].\n\nOn November 16, 1863, Brigadier General [[Washington Lafayette Elliott]] replaced Major General [[David S. Stanley]] as Chief of Cavalry of the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 108</ref> When McCook's division moved to Knoxville, Brigadier General [[Samuel D. Sturgis]] of the Army of the Ohio took command of the division because he had taken command of all cavalry operating in East Tennessee on December 15, 1863.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 119\"/>\n\nOn December 29, 1863, Brigadier General Sturgis learned that a brigade of Confederate cavalry had moved to Dandridge and sent most of the cavalry opposite Confederate Lieutenant General Longstreet's encampment to destroy it. He left only Campbell's brigade to hold the camp and valley at [[Battle of Mossy Creek|Mossy Creek]], Tennessee. Campbell positioned his regiments and three cannons of Lilly's battery which had not been sent on the mission to Dandridge in the valley. A large Confederate force moved to attack Campbell's regiments, which fell back because they were outnumbered. Then, Colonel Campbell ordered the 1st Tennessee Cavalry to charge the Confederates on the right of a brick house, a prominent feature on the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry made the charge and halted the advance of the entire Confederate line while the 2d Michigan Cavalry, which was fighting dismounted, staggered the Confederate line with rifle fire. Campbell then again ordered his advance regiments to fall back and take a position near Lilly's battery and the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry, fighting as they moved back. Despite Colonel Campbell's misgivings, Colonel Brownlow assumed responsibility of ordering a [[saber]] charge on the advancing Confederate line of battle. The charge drove the Confederates back and the 1st Tennessee took 26 prisoners. However, they in turn were forced back by the superior number of Confederate attackers. The outnumbered Union force was reinforced at a critical moment and together with the reinforcements, Campbell's men forced the Confederates from the field. The 1st Tennessee Cavalry suffered 9 killed and 9 wounded in the battle.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 127&ndash;132</ref>\n\n===Fair Garden capture and escape===\nAfter the [[Battle of Mossy Creek]], the Union forces withdrew to Knoxville. After a brief expedition to fight [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] (Indians) and guerrillas from North Carolina in [[Cocke County, Tennessee]], Colonels Brownlow and Palmer with about one thousand men of the 1st Tennessee Cavalry, 15th Pennsylvania Cavalry and 10th Ohio Cavalry held the army's right wing, watching for arrival of a Confederate force reportedly approaching East Tennessee from North Carolina. Confederate Brigadier General [[William T. Martin]] marched his army across the country from Dandridge and went into camp near Fair Garden, Tennessee. This unexpected movement of Longstreet's cavalry made it necessary to push forward the divisions of McCook and Wolford from Knoxville to support the right wing. Late in the afternoon of January 26, 1864, the Confederates under General Martin were discovered advancing toward [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]] on the Fair Garden road. McCook's division was ordered to meet this force. Campbell's brigade moved to strike the Confederates behind the east fork of the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)|Pigeon River]] but after an artillery duel, nightfall halted the engagement.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 138&ndash;139</ref>\n\nIn the renewed engagement of January 27, 1864, as nightfall approached, Colonel Brownlow became separated from his men while pursuing Confederates who had been driven from the field. Brownlow was taken prisoner. He hid his grade (rank) and identity from his captors, claiming to be a private, and managed to bribe a guard with a gold watch to permit him to escape. His men were greatly relieved when he returned to camp the next day.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 139&ndash;144</ref> Then, the Union troops fell back to Sevierville and on January 29, 1864, the Union cavalry went into camp at [[Maryville, Tennessee]], {{convert|16|mi|km}} south of Knoxville.<ref name=\"Carter144\">Carter, 1902, p. 144</ref>\n\n===Atlanta campaign; McCook's raid===\nOn February 10, 1864, McCook's division left for [[Cleveland, Tennessee]], to rejoin the Army of the Cumberland and to go into camp at that location until May.<ref name=\"Carter145\">Carter, 1902, p. 145</ref> At Cleveland, the 8th Iowa Cavalry replaced the 9th Pennsylvania Cavalry in the First Brigade of the First Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Cumberland.

The fords were impassable because of heavy spring rains.<ref name=\"Carter168\">Carter, 1902, p. 168</ref> McCook's division remained near Soap Creek guarding the ferries. They exchanged gunfire from time to time with Confederates occupying rifle pits on the other side of the Chattahoochee.<ref name=\"Carter168\"/> On July 9, 1864, Brownlow's men were ordered to dislodge them and attempted to do so at a supposed ford near Power's Ferry. They found the river impassable.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 169\">Carter, 1902, p. 169</ref> Colonel Joseph Dorr of the 8th Iowa Cavalry Regiment, acting commander of the brigade, arrived on the scene and ordered Brownlow to complete the mission.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 169\"/> Brownlow then devised one of the most unusual raids of the Civil War, if not in all military history. He had most of his men keep up a steady fire from their side of the shore while he led a squad of nine men to a point about {{convert|1|mi|km}} upstream where they put their guns and cartridge boxes on a small wooden raft and swam naked across the Chattahoochee.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 170</ref> Leaving one man to guard the raft, Brownlow led his naked men through the woods. As they somewhat painfully proceeded without shoes or other clothing for cover, Brownlow ordered them to \"cuss low\" so as not to give themselves away. When they reached the Confederate positions, they emerged, clothed only with cartridge boxes, screaming and shooting. The scene so startled the Confederate defenders that most of them immediately fled into the woods, leaving 12 men to be taken prisoner.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 171. Carter noted on page 172 that General McCook reported that Brownlow returned with 4 prisoners. He does not explain the discrepancy but presumably 8 of the original prisoners escaped in the walk back to the spot where they swam back to the other side of the river.</ref> After swimming back across the river, Brownlow's men expressed even more admiration for their commander who was willing to share the hardships and dangers of the mission and not just to order others to carry out the unusual and uncomfortable task.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 172</ref><ref>Evans, David.

Sherman]] ordered General McCook to lead a raid south of Atlanta toward Fayetteville, Georgia with the objective of destroying {{convert|2|mi|km}} to {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the [[Atlanta and West Point Railroad]], [[Macon and Western Railroad]] and telegraph lines.<ref name=\"Carter176\">Carter, 1902, p. 176</ref> Union Brigadier General [[George Stoneman]], whose division was to participate in the raid. also wanted to free the Union Army prisoners at the [[Andersonville, Georgia|Andersonville]] and [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] prisoner of war camps.<ref name=\"Carter176\"/> McCook led 5,000 men against the Atlanta and Western and Stoneman led 3,500 men against the Macon and Western.<ref name=\"Carter176\"/> On July 27, 1864, McCook moved his division back across the Chattahoochee River and then around to the south. Now part of Brigadier General [[John T. Croxton]]'s brigade, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry reached Palmetto Station, Georgia and about 3:00&nbsp;p.m. and began to destroy telegraph facilities, the depot and supplies. By 9:00 pm., the force moved toward Lovejoy Station, Georgia, which they reached by dawn the next morning.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 177</ref> Then, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry captured a 500&ndash;wagon train and turned it over to the rear guard to be destroyed.<ref name=\"Carter178\">Carter, 1902, p. 178</ref> By 7:00&nbsp;p.m., the regiment began to destroy facilities at Lovejoy Station.<ref name=\"Carter178\"/> General McCook waited until 2:00&nbsp;p.m. in an effort to communicate with General Stoneman and, failing to hear from Stoneman, McCook left just as Confederate Major General Joseph Wheeler's cavalry approached. Wheeler's men cut off Croxton's brigade and the brigade, including the 1st Tennessee Cavalry, had to fight their way out, taking several casualties.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 179</ref><ref>Their advance was impeded by the pack train and prisoners taken earlier.</ref>\n\nThe brigade reached [[Newnan, Georgia]], about 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on July 30, 1864, and started to destroy the Atlanta and Western Railroad and telegraph facilities.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 180</ref> McCook soon found his division confronted by a larger force of Confederate cavalry and infantry.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 181</ref> Even after driving the Confederates back, McCook's men were nearly surrounded.<ref name=\"Carter182\">Carter, 1902, p. 182</ref> McCook called his commanders together and discussed the possibility of surrender. Brownlow said he would be \"damned if he would surrender\" because Southern Unionists were treated worse by the Confederates that Northerners.<ref name=\"Carter182\"/> Brownlow led the brigade in an effort to escape with Croxton coming with him. McCook headed for Marietta by another route.<ref name=\"Carter182\"/> The brigade was scattered and Brownlow took command of those with him.<ref name=\"Carter183\">Carter, 1902, p. 183</ref> He found a small bridge and an escape route from the imminent battle and his remaining force got ahead of the Confederate pursuers. They reached the Chattahoochee River at Rotherwood about 1:00&nbsp;a.m. on July 31 and started crossing in two small canoes. Some troopers swam the river with their horses and Brownlow swam back and forth several times to help men across.<ref name=\"Carter183\"/> About 200 to 300 men had made the river crossing when Confederates appeared and began to attack and take many of the exhausted and surprised men as prisoners. Many of those who had got across the river could not get their horses across and the group was still about {{convert|75|mi|km}} from Marietta so they were at greater risk of being captured. Brownlow and a small group of men from several regiments got to Marietta on August 1 and others began to arrive on August 2.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 185</ref> Many of McCook's men straggled into Marietta by August 10 but Stoneman and several hundred of his men were captured trying to free the Union prisoners at Macon.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 186\">Carter, 1902, p. 186</ref> Thus, Colonel Brownlow briefly commanded the first brigade of the first division of the Army of the Cumberland from July 30, 1864 to August 12, 1864.<ref name=\"Hunt86\"/><ref>Boatner, Mark Mayo, III.

He was ordered to turn his brigade's remaining horses over to the other brigades and to take his men to Nashville for refitting.<ref name=\"Carter, 1902, p. 186\"/> Soon after they arrived in Nashville and were refitted, Croxton's brigade had to face Confederate Major General Joseph Wheeler's force which had detached from the main Confederate [[Army of Tennessee]] and were raiding into Tennessee. Croxton's men moved out of Nashville on the night of August 31, 1864.<ref>Carter, 1902, pp. 189&ndash;190</ref> Colonel Brownlow's regiment was ordered to take the advance.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 190</ref> On September 1, 1864, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry engaged men of Wheeler's force who were trying to destroy the railroad near Lavergne, Tennessee. Wheeler was able to do little damage to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad and so he turned his attention to the Nashville and Decatur Railroad at [[Franklin, Tennessee]].<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 191</ref> Croxton's brigade arrived at Franklin just ahead of Wheeler.<ref name=\"Carter192\">Carter, 1902, p. 192</ref> Brownlow's men dismounted and reached the crest of a hill just before Wheeler's men arrived at the same place. Brownlow was wounded in both thighs while leading his men into the Confederate force.<ref name=\"Carter192\"/><ref>Eicher, 2001, p. 149. This occurred before the [[Battle of Franklin]] in November 1864.</ref> Brownlow had to be carrier from the field and almost bled to death before surgeons saved him.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 193</ref> From this time until April 1865, the regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Calvin M. Dyer. Croxton drew his men back but Wheeler was forced to withdraw when Union infantry arrived at the battle.<ref>Carter, 1902, p. 194</ref> On September 5, Wheeler began to withdraw into Alabama. Atlanta fell to Sherman's forces while Croxton's men were at Nashville and Franklin.\n\nThe 1st Tennessee Cavalry carried on from this date without Colonel Brownlow and had several more engagements or operations. As the war wound down to a conclusion, the 1st Tennessee Cavalry made a reconnaissance from Waterloo, Alabama as far as Corinth, Mississippi, starting on January 27, 1865. They returned to Nashville on February 10, 1865, where they remained until mustered out on June 14, 1865, having recently been rejoined by Colonel Brownlow.<ref name=\"CivilWar320\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn January 13, 1866, [[President of the United States]] [[Andrew Johnson]] nominated Brownlow for the award of the honorary grade of [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865. The [[United States Senate]] confirmed the award on March 12, 1866.<ref>Eicher, John H., and [[David J. Eicher]]. ''Civil War High Commands''.

Brownlow became [[adjutant general]] of the [[state of Tennessee]] after the election of his father as [[governor of Tennessee]]. He wrote: ''Report of the Adjutant General of the State of Tennessee of the Military Forces of the State from 1861 to 1866.'' In December 1866, Brownlow received an appointment at the grade of captain in the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th United States Cavalry Regiment]] of the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]]. He delayed reporting because of his state duties and ultimately resigned in 1868 because he was posted to California and did not wish to be that far from Tennessee.<ref>Eicher, 2001. p. 149</ref> His occupations thereafter included railroad superintendent for the [[Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad]], farmer and printer. Brownlow died at [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], on April 26, 1879, aged 36.
