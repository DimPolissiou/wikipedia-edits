Single-gender, [[gender-neutral housing|gender-neutral]] and substance-free floors are also available.\n\nAll of the colleges, except for Kresge, have both residence halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by four to eight students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and a combination of shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.\n\nIn addition to the residential colleges, housing is available at the Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will be restricted to only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within this theme housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Student Housing Services | url=http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | accessdate=April 16, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404191759/http://housing.ucsc.edu/shs/index.html | archive-date=April 4, 2008 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\nUCSC is home to few fraternities and sororities.

The Men's water polo team was ranked 18th in the nation in 2006 and won the D3 national Championship, however in 2009 the team was cut due to budget cuts. UCSC maintains a number of club teams. It has won several club national championships in men's tennis, 3 in men's waterpolo and also a women's Division II championship in club rugby.\n\nIn 2016, due to a mounting debt in funding of the athletic program, the university polled its students on whether or not they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program.

The Men's water polo team was ranked 18th in the nation in 2006 and won the D3 national Championship, however in 2009 the team was cut due to budget cuts. UCSC maintains a number of club teams. It has won several club national championships in men's tennis, 3 in men's waterpolo and also a women's Division II championship in club rugby.\n\nIn 2016, due to a mounting debt in funding of the athletic program, the university polled its students on whether or not they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant doubt that the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.\n\n==Notable alumni and faculty==\n{{main|List of University of California, Santa Cruz people}}\nNotable alumni of the University of California, Santa Cruz include co-founder of the Black Panther Party [[Huey P.

The NBER defines a [[recession]] as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the [[Economy of the United States|economy]], lasting more than two quarters which is 6 months, normally visible in real [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales\".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html|title=The NBER's Recession Dating Procedure |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=October 21, 2003|author=Hall, Robert }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rule of thumb defining recession as two [[Fiscal year|quarters]] of negative GDP growth is not used by NBER.<ref>{{cite web|title=The NBER's Recession Dating Procedure: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> The NBER looks for monthly dating (GDP is a quarterly figure) and GDP will sometimes be positive even in clear periods of decline, e.g. in the second quarter of 1974, GDP was slightly positive even in the middle of the severe [[1973\u201375 recession]].|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nIn the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with [[Financial crisis|financial crises]]. Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of [[economic statistics]], so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the [[economic system]] such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|title=Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 1929 through Second Quarter 2003|publisher=[[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|date=December 10, 2003|author=Brent Moulton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920053305/http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|archive-date=2008-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMajor modern economic statistics, such as [[unemployment]] and GDP, were not compiled on a regular and standardized basis until after World War II.

Following the [[Bank War]], the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was [[Free banking era|no national presence in banking]], but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the [[National Banking Act]], creating [[History of central banking in the United States#1863\u20131913: National Banks|nationally chartered banks]]. There was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, and thus banking panics were common. Recessions often led to bank panics and financial crises, which in turn worsened the recession.{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as [[gross domestic product]] and unemployment, were not gathered during this period. [[Victor Zarnowitz]] evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions.

Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of [[economic statistics]], so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the [[economic system]] such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|title=Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 1929 through Second Quarter 2003|publisher=[[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|date=December 10, 2003|author=Brent Moulton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920053305/http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|archive-date=2008-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMajor modern economic statistics, such as [[unemployment]] and GDP, were not compiled on a regular and standardized basis until after World War II.

Following the [[Bank War]], the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was [[Free banking era|no national presence in banking]], but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the [[National Banking Act]], creating [[History of central banking in the United States#1863\u20131913: National Banks|nationally chartered banks]]. There was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, and thus banking panics were common. Recessions often led to bank panics and financial crises, which in turn worsened the recession.{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as [[gross domestic product]] and unemployment, were not gathered during this period. [[Victor Zarnowitz]] evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, which can be used to compare recessions.<ref group=\"nb\" name=Zarn/>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|+ US recessions, Free Banking Era to the Great Depression\n! style=\"width:100px;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Name\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Dates{{#tag:ref|The NBER's monthly chronology of recessions begins in 1854.

The convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]], to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].\n\nThe severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] involved in the 1649 [[execution of Charles I]].\n\nAlthough the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].\n\n==Treason in England==\n[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 \"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54\u201358}}</ref> attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].

Suspects were first questioned in private by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] before they were publicly tried. They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}</ref> This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Execution of the sentence==\n{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}\nOnce sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution.

A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of [[Thomas Ford (martyr)|Thomas Ford]]. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}</ref> The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}</ref>\n\nThe condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was \"a-quarter-inge.\" [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}</ref> Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]\u2014the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to \"show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.\"{{refn|group=\"nb\"|For an explanation of \"corruption of blood\", see [[Attainder]].}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson <ref>(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto & Windus</ref> shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural.

(BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse]]]]\n\nTo be '''hanged, drawn and quartered''' was, [[Treason Act 1351|from 1352]], a [[statutory]] penalty in England for men convicted of [[high treason]], although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216\u20131272). The convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]], to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].\n\nThe severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] involved in the 1649 [[execution of Charles I]].\n\nAlthough the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].\n\n==Treason in England==\n[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 \"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54\u201358}}</ref> attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: \"dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Giles|1852|p=139}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|\"''<!-- Quo cognito -->Rex eum, quasi regiae majestatis (occisorem), membratim laniatum equis apud Coventre, exemplum terribile et spectaculum comentabile praebere (iussit) omnibus audentibus talia machinari.

De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the [[Tower of London]] to be executed. There he was hanged from a [[gibbet]] until dead. His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|Paris|1987|p=234}}</ref> The punishment is more frequently recorded during [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diehl|Donnelly|2009|p=58}}</ref>  \n\nThe [[Welsh people|Welsh]] Prince [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself [[Prince of Wales]] and Lord of Snowdon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=11}}</ref> Dafydd's rebellion infuriated [[Edward I]] so much that he demanded a novel punishment. Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. For killing English nobles he was hanged alive. For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|pp=23\u201326}}</ref> A similar fate was suffered by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] leader [[William Wallace|Sir William Wallace]].

They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}</ref> This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Execution of the sentence==\n{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}\nOnce sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution.

Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}</ref> The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}</ref>\n\nThe condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was \"a-quarter-inge.\" [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}</ref> Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]\u2014the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to \"show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.\"{{refn|group=\"nb\"|For an explanation of \"corruption of blood\", see [[Attainder]].}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson <ref>(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto & Windus</ref> shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural.

Influenced by his friend, [[Jeremy Bentham]], Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the [[Bloody Code|severity of England's laws]] was responsible for an increase in crime. When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as \"Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|p=42}}</ref> He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy,<!-- this cited to previous citation, block/hostettler, no need for two cites so close together --> and [[Treason Act 1814|in 1814]] proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal.

The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls.<ref>{{Citation | last = Belchem | first = John | title = Brandreth, Jeremiah (1786/1790\u20131817) | volume = 1 | work = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press, hosted at oxforddnb.com | origyear = 2004 | year = 2008 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3270 | accessdate = 19 August 2010 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/3270}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> The plot was the last crime for which the sentence was applied.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abbott|2005|pp=161\u2013162}}</ref>\n\nReformation of England's capital punishment laws continued throughout the 19th century, as politicians such as [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]], sought to remove from the statute books many of the capital offences that remained.<ref>{{Harvnb|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=51\u201358}}</ref> [[Robert Peel]]'s drive to ameliorate law enforcement saw petty treason abolished by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]], which removed the distinction between crimes formerly considered as petty treason, and murder.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wiener|2004|p=23}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Dubber|2005|p=27}}</ref> The [[Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1864-1866]] recommended that there be no change to treason law, quoting the \"more merciful\" [[Treason Felony Act 1848]], which limited the punishment for most treasonous acts to [[penal servitude]].
