In it he recognises principles in common law contrary to parliamentary sovereignty. The foundation of his decision was on four propositions:<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2002/195.html bailii.org - England and Wales High Court (Administrative Court) Decisions: 2002 EWHC 195 (Admin)]</ref>\n<blockquote>\n# All the specific rights and obligations which EU law creates are by the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] incorporated into our domestic law and rank supreme: that is, anything in our substantive law inconsistent with any of these rights and obligations is abrogated or must be modified to avoid the inconsistency. This is true even where the inconsistent municipal provision is contained in [[primary legislation]]. \n# The ECA is a constitutional statute: that is, it cannot be [[Implied repeal|impliedly repealed]]. A constitutional statute can, however, be explicitly repealed by a subsequent statute.\n# The truth of (2) is derived, not from EU law, but purely from the law of England: the common law recognises a category of [[constitutional statutes]]. \n# The fundamental legal basis of the United Kingdom's relationship with the EU rests with the domestic, not the European, legal powers. In the event, which no doubt would never happen in the real world, that a European measure was seen to be repugnant to a fundamental or constitutional right guaranteed by the law of England, a question would arise whether the general words of the ECA were sufficient to incorporate the measure and give it overriding effect in domestic law. But that is very far from this case. \n</blockquote>\n\n[[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings]] - Sir John sat in the first instance hearing of this historic case, concerning the legality of a decision made to prohibit hunting on a small area of land which the Council had acquired and was argued to maintain under s120(1)(b) [[Local Government Act 1972]].\n\n[[McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd]] - Sir John attracted considerable press attention for stating \"The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds [...] is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary.\" This was in response to a witness statement submitted by former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey|Lord Carey]] that Christians should be afforded special protections under equality legislation on the grounds of earnestly held religious belief.\n\n==Constitutional theory==\nSir John Laws is noted for his extrajudicial writings in the [[Law review|journal]], ''[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]''. His most notable contribution, \"Law and Democracy\", asserts that the constitution would be undemocratic if it gave all the power under it to the elected government. Therefore, it is the constitution, and not Parliament, that should be sovereign in the British constitution.  He posits that the constitution must create a \"higher-order law\"  in which human rights and constitutional fundamentals in a democracy can be protected by the courts against the abuses of government. This position stems from a fundamental distrust of the political constitution in holding the executive to account. It is similar in form to [[Lord Hailsham]]'s claim that in Britain there is an \"''[[elective dictatorship]]''\". Sir John does not see this shift to the legal sphere as being anti-democratic because judges uphold apolitical values that no politician would contest and are above the arguments that take place in the political sphere between politicians of political parties.\n\nThese statements are certainly controversial and have been fiercely contested by academics such as John Griffith and Martin Loughlin, both professors at the [[London School of Economics]]. The essential arguments made by these authors are to the effect that the metaphysical principles that Sir John cites are highly contentious. A good example of this is Laws' love of freedom of expression. When is it right for racist or sexist comments to be illegal? Whilst for Griffith it should be up to a democratically elected legislature to decide such tricky moral issues, for Laws it is firmly a matter of law for the judges to decide. The problem with the latter approach, according to Griffith, stems from the fact that judges cannot be removed if the decisions they make are judged to be wrong by citizens of a polity. For Laws, on the other hand, such counter-majoritarianism is a beneficial aspect of the law, which acts to protect those that are vulnerable in society against the tyranny of the majority.\n\n==Personal life==\nSir John married Sophie Susan Sydenham Cole Marshall in 1973, with whom he had one daughter.

He writes: \n:''The Serer people had earlier settled on the plains of the highland of [[Futa Toro]] in modern Senegal. They lived side by side with the Tukulor and were ruled by them until the eleventh century. At that time, perhaps because of growing Islamic influence among the Tukulor, the Serer\u2014who refused to accept Islam\u2013migrated to an area between the Sine and Saloum rivers in what is now southeastern Senegal. The Serer conquered the Mande-speaking tribes then inhabiting the Sine-Salum and settled the area.

Since the Wolof language itself is the original language of the [[Lebou people]], and not the Wolof; and the Wolof people are a mixture of the other Senegambian ethnic group\u2014and became a distinct ethnic group only few centuries ago, Marcel Mahawa Diouf proposes an alliance between all non-Wolofs who have had historic alliances such as Serers, Toucouleurs, Sarakol\u00e9s, Soss\u00e9s, Jola, Lebou, etc. The purpose of this is to disconnect the Wolof, and in effect, disinherit them from the Senegambia region and its history.<ref name=\"\u00c9tienne\"/> In the oral tradition of the Wolof, they claim descent from Ndiadiane Ndiaye-founder of the Jolof Empire.<ref>Anyidoho, Kofi.

The Wolof appear nowhere in the ethnogenesis of the Senegalese nation they propose, except as the final product of the mixing of the \u201cscraps\u201d of these groups. In the eyes of the promoters of joking pacts, that is, the Senegalese nation is Wolof only from a linguistic point of view, the Wolof language itself being nothing more than the result of the amalgamation of all of the country\u2019s languages and the Wolof identity being the possible outcome of the merging of such groups. But insofar as honor, prestige, cultural richness, or historical depth is concerned, the peripheral histories of the Serer, Haalpulaar, Joola, or Mandinka occupy center stage.

He writes: \n:''The Serer people had earlier settled on the plains of the highland of [[Futa Toro]] in modern Senegal.

At that time, perhaps because of growing Islamic influence among the Tukulor, the Serer\u2014who refused to accept Islam\u2013migrated to an area between the Sine and Saloum rivers in what is now southeastern Senegal. The Serer conquered the Mande-speaking tribes then inhabiting the Sine-Salum and settled the area.

In the eyes of the promoters of joking pacts, that is, the Senegalese nation is Wolof only from a linguistic point of view, the Wolof language itself being nothing more than the result of the amalgamation of all of the country\u2019s languages and the Wolof identity being the possible outcome of the merging of such groups.
