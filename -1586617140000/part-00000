Some mobile phone companies issued an interim software update for their special [[Short message service|SMS]]Vbbb  character set, replacing the less-frequent Japanese [[yen sign]] with the euro sign. Later mobile phones have both currency signs.\n\nThe euro is represented in the [[Unicode]] [[character set]] with the character name EURO SIGN and the code position U+20AC (decimal 8364) as well as in updated versions of the traditional Latin character set encodings.{{efn|For details please see the [[Western Latin character sets (computing)]]}}{{efn|For Eastern European character set Latin 10 with the euro sign, please see [[ISO/IEC 8859-16]]}} In [[HTML]], the <tt>&amp;euro;</tt> entity can also be used.\n\nAn implicit character encoding, along with the fact that the code position of the euro sign is different in historic encoding schemes ([[code page]]s), led to many initial problems displaying the euro sign consistently in computer applications, depending on access method. While displaying the euro sign is no problem as long as only one system is used (provided an up-to-date [[Typeface|font]] with the proper [[glyph]] is available), mixed setups often produced errors. Initially, Apple, Microsoft and Unix systems each chose a different code point to represent a euro symbol: thus a user of one system might see a euro symbol whereas another would see a different symbol or nothing at all. Another was [[Legacy system|legacy software]] which could only handle older encodings such as [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|ISO 8859-1]] that contained no euro sign at all.

It is loosely based on a short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] (which in turn was based on his 1948 radio play for the [[CBS]] show ''[[Suspense_(radio_drama)|Suspense]]'') with a script written by Merwin Gerard. The film was produced by [[Universal Television]] and originally aired as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' on January 29, 1972. It features [[John Williams]]'s last score (to date) for a TV movie.\n\n==Plot==\nDe Havilland plays Laura Wynant, a wealthy former mental patient who has travelled to her country estate to recuperate. While there, she discovers, when hearing faint calls for help, that a woman has been buried alive on her property. Wynant tries to inform others of what she has found but nobody believes her, and her family begins to suspect a relapse in her mental condition. Because her hands are nearly crippled by arthritis, she is not able to dig the woman up herself. She tricks a local boy into assisting her by telling him she is digging for a lost earring, but when he is scared by the cries of the buried woman she is forced to tell him the truth, which results in a confrontation with the lad's angry father. While going door-to-door to seek help she encounters the buried woman's husband, who had buried her after striking her on the head with a shovel and thought her dead. Wynant is confined to her home under doctor's orders but, in a fit of desperation, experiences enough recovery from the arthritis to provide strength in her hands. She begins to dig up the buried woman, who is still alive. Just then the murderous husband arrives on the scene, intending to bury his wife's body thoroughly. He comes up behind Wynant and is about to strike her with the shovel when the buried woman grabs Wynant's hand and pulls herself up out of the ground. The husband is petrified, giving the authorities just enough time to arrive on the scene and save Wynant and the buried woman.\n\n==Cast<ref>{{Citation|title=The Screaming Woman|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067721/|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>==\n* [[Olivia De Havilland]] as Laura Wynant\n* [[Ed Nelson]] as Carl Nesbitt\n* [[Laraine Stephens]] as Caroline Wynant\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as George Tresvant\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Dr. Amos Larkin\n* [[Charles Knox Robinson]] as Howard Wynant\n* [[Alexandra Hay]] as Evie Carson\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Ken Bronson\n* Russell Wiggins as Harry Sands\n* [[Gene Andrusco]] as David\n* Joyce Cunningham as Bernice Wilson\n* Jan Arvan as Martin, the Servant\n* Jay Montgomery as Ted Wilson\n* John Alderman as Slater\n\n==Television debuts==\nThe film was first shown in the United States on January 29, 1972, in Sweden on June 23, 1973, and in Great Britain in July 1985.\n\n==Other adaptations==\nA television adaptation more faithful to the source material was broadcast as \"The Screaming Woman\", episode 5 of season 1 of ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', on February 22, 1986.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}1972 NBC show. \n<br />{{Jack Smight}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Screaming Woman, The}}\n[[Category:1972 television films]]\n[[Category:1970s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1972 horror films]]\n[[Category:ABC Movie of the Week]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Horror television films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Smight]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Williams]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Ray Bradbury]]\n", "text_old": "{{unsourced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = The Screaming Woman\n| image                = The Screaming Woman.jpg\n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = Title card\n| genre                = \n| based_on             = A short story by [[Ray Bradbury]]\n| writer               = Merwin Gerard\n| director             = [[Jack Smight]]\n| starring             = [[Olivia de Havilland]]<br>[[Ed Nelson]]<br>[[Laraine Stephens]]<br>[[Joseph Cotten]]\n| music                = [[John Williams]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| producer             = William Frye\n| editor               = Robert F.
