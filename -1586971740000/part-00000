Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art. After 3 years living in a monastery in India, Mark and her mother moved to Berlin, and after graduating high school at the age of 18 she moved to New York to live with her godparents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edailybuzz.com/2019/03/12/amber-mark-wiki-bio-2019-age-height-net-worth-birthday-mother-boyfriend-social-media/|title=Amber Mark Wiki, Bio 2019: Age, Height, Net worth, Birthday, Mother, Boyfriend, Social Media.|date=March 12, 2019|work=edailybuzz.com|accessdate=December 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer mother, Mia, died on 3 June 2013 at the age of 60.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj5Y_Mni-eU|title=Amber Mark - Monsoon (Official Video) ft.

She stated in an interview that this was when she realized that being an artist was what she wanted to do.<ref>(2017, August 21) Retrieved November 19, 2019, from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3pNkDnoo5k&t=102s</ref> Her mother was a huge part of her early life and one of her first songs was in dedication to her mother's passing in 2013.<ref>Ciara, H., & Calum, S.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\".

Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere.

Her parents split up when Mark was only 1 year old and she lived with her mother in Miami until the age of 9 when they moved to India so that her mother could study Thangka, a traditional Buddhist form of art.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker.

{"title_page": "Impressionism", "text_new": "{{About|the art movement||Impressionism (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Impression, soleil levant]]'' (''Impression, Sunrise''), 1872, oil on canvas, [[Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet]], [[Paris]]. This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]\n'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in [[France]]. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.\n\nThe development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s atmospheric work was influential on the birth of Impressionism, here ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' (1839)]]\n\nRadicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.<ref>Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].</ref> The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short \"broken\" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour\u2014not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary\u2014to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F. Walther, ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1''], Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, {{ISBN|3822870315}}</ref>]]\n\nImpressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.\n\nThe public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].\n\n==Beginnings==\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century\u2014a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|rebuilt Paris]] and waged war\u2014the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Acad\u00e9mie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Acad\u00e9mie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.<ref>Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14</ref> Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.<ref name=\"The Met\">[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. \"Impressionism: Art and Modernity\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]</ref>\n\nThe Acad\u00e9mie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Acad\u00e9mie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].\n\nIn the early 1860s, four young painters\u2014[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]]\u2014met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air,<ref>White, Harrison C., Cynthia A. White (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2D_ehhO_14QC&pg=PA116 Canvases and Careers: Institutional Change in the French Painting World]''. University of Chicago Press. p. 116. {{ISBN|0226894878}}.</ref> but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21\u201327.</ref> By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Caf\u00e9 Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].<ref>Greenspan, Taube G. \"Armand Guillaumin\", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]\nDuring the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.<ref>Seiberling, Grace, \"Impressionism\", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref> In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.133.</ref> The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.\n\nAfter Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refus\u00e9s drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.194.</ref>\n[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''[[View of the Canal Saint-Martin]]'', 1870, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]]]\nArtists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied.

Monet and C\u00e9zanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.\n\nHe wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,\n:\"Impression\u2014I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.\"<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 323.</ref>\n[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together\u2014albeit with shifting membership\u2014eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.<ref name=\"The Met\" />\n\nMonet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the \"purest\" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.<ref>Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. \u00c9douard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,<ref>Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.</ref> never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that \"the Salon is the real field of battle\" where a reputation could be made.<ref>Richardson (1976), p. 3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]\nAmong the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as C\u00e9zanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.105.</ref> Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], [[Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of \"opening doors to first-come daubers\".<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 603.</ref> The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.\n\nThe individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York.

The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.\n\nA number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists\u2014and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Turner]]\u2014the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:\n\n* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].\n* Colors are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.\n* Greys and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.\n* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.\n* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.\n* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. \n* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''\u2014the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.\n* In paintings made ''[[en Plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)\n\nNew technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39\u201341.</ref> Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}.

Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography \"produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably\".<ref name = \"impressionism757\"/>\n\nIn spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused \"on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph\u2014by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated\".<ref name = \"impressionism757\"/> The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their \"tacit imperatives of taste and conscience\".<ref name=\"impressionism758\">Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London</ref> Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: \"The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph\".<ref name=\"impressionism757\">Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York</ref>\n[[File:Claude Monet - Jardin \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Garden at Sainte-Adresse|Jardin \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse]],'' 1867, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.,<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437133?rpp=20&pg=1&ao=on&ft=Claude+Monet&pos=1 Metropolitan Museum of Art]</ref> a work showing the influence of Japanese prints]]\nAnother major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]).

[[Eva Gonzal\u00e8s]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean B\u00e9raud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.<ref>Rewald (1973), p.476\u2013477.</ref> Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.\n\nThe influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.\n\n==Beyond France==\n[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]\n[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]\n[[File:'Hip, Hip, Hurrah!

Some of the more important examples are:\n* The [[American Impressionism|American Impressionists]], including [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Metcalf]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Theodore Robinson]], [[Edmund C.

Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.\n\n[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919\u20131929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L\u2019Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.\n\n==Music and literature==\n{{Main|Impressionist music|Impressionism (literature)}}\n[[File:Monet Water Lilies 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Water Lilies (Monet series)|Water Lilies]],'' 1916, [[The National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo]]\nMusical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.\n\nThe influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), [[Manuel De Falla]] and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain), and [[Charles Griffes]] (America).\n\nThe term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.\n\n[[File:Camille Pissarro 019.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Children on a Farm'', 1887]]\n\n==Post-Impressionism==\n{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}\nDuring the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat, 1884.png|[[Georges Seurat]], ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', 1884\u20131886, [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]\nFile:Vincent Van Gogh 0016.jpg|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Cypresses'', 1889, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Paul Gauguin 044.jpg|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''The Midday Nap'', 1894, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Card Players-Paul Cezanne.jpg|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''[[The Card Players]]'', 1894\u20131895, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Art periods]]\n* [[Expressionism]] (as a reaction to Impressionism)\n* [[Les XX]]\n* [[Luminism (Impressionism)]]\n* [[Macchiaioli]]\n* [[Cantonese school of painting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Baumann, Felix Andreas, Marianne Karabelnik-Matta, Jean Sutherland Boggs, and Tobia Bezzola (1994).

This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]\n'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in [[France]]. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.\n\nThe development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J.

They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.<ref>Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].</ref> The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short \"broken\" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour\u2014not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary\u2014to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F.

The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.\n\nThe public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].\n\n==Beginnings==\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century\u2014a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|rebuilt Paris]] and waged war\u2014the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Acad\u00e9mie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Acad\u00e9mie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.<ref>Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14</ref> Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.<ref name=\"The Met\">[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. \"Impressionism: Art and Modernity\".

The standards of the juries represented the values of the Acad\u00e9mie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].\n\nIn the early 1860s, four young painters\u2014[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]]\u2014met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air,<ref>White, Harrison C., Cynthia A. White (1993).

A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Caf\u00e9 Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].<ref>Greenspan, Taube G. \"Armand Guillaumin\", ''Grove Art Online.

Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref> In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.133.</ref> The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.\n\nAfter Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refus\u00e9s drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.194.</ref>\n[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''[[View of the Canal Saint-Martin]]'', 1870, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]]]\nArtists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied.

Monet and C\u00e9zanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.\n\nHe wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,\n:\"Impression\u2014I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.\"<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 323.</ref>\n[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together\u2014albeit with shifting membership\u2014eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.<ref name=\"The Met\" />\n\nMonet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the \"purest\" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour.

(1974), p. 127.</ref> never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that \"the Salon is the real field of battle\" where a reputation could be made.<ref>Richardson (1976), p. 3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]\nAmong the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as C\u00e9zanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.105.</ref> Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], [[Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of \"opening doors to first-come daubers\".<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 603.</ref> The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.\n\nThe individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York.

By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 475\u2013476.</ref>\n\n==Impressionist techniques==\n[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]\nFrench painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Th\u00e9odore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.\n\nA number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists\u2014and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Turner]]\u2014the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:\n\n* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].\n* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.\n* Greys and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.\n* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.\n* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.\n* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. \n* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''\u2014the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.\n* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)\n\nNew technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39\u201341.</ref> Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}.

Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography \"produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably\".<ref name = \"impressionism757\"/>\n\nIn spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused \"on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph\u2014by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated\".<ref name = \"impressionism757\"/> The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations.

[[Eva Gonzal\u00e8s]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean B\u00e9raud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.<ref>Rewald (1973), p.476\u2013477.</ref> Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.\n\nThe influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.\n\n==Beyond France==\n[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]\n[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]\n[[File:'Hip, Hip, Hurrah!

''Gardner's art through the ages: a concise Western history''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.\n\n[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919\u20131929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L\u2019Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.\n\n==Music and literature==\n{{Main|Impressionist music|Impressionism (literature)}}\n[[File:Monet Water Lilies 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Water Lilies (Monet series)|Water Lilies]],'' 1916, [[The National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo]]\nMusical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.\n\nThe influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy), [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), [[Manuel De Falla]] and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain), and [[Charles Griffes]] (America).\n\nThe term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.\n\n[[File:Camille Pissarro 019.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Children on a Farm'', 1887]]\n\n==Post-Impressionism==\n{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}\nDuring the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat, 1884.png|[[Georges Seurat]], ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', 1884\u20131886, [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]\nFile:Vincent Van Gogh 0016.jpg|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Cypresses'', 1889, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Paul Gauguin 044.jpg|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''The Midday Nap'', 1894, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Card Players-Paul Cezanne.jpg|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''[[The Card Players]]'', 1894\u20131895, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Art periods]]\n* [[Expressionism]] (as a reaction to Impressionism)\n* [[Les XX]]\n* [[Luminism (Impressionism)]]\n* [[Macchiaioli]]\n* [[Cantonese school of painting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Baumann, Felix Andreas, Marianne Karabelnik-Matta, Jean Sutherland Boggs, and Tobia Bezzola (1994).

He returned in the sequels ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future Part III|Part III]]'' to not only reprise his role as Biff, but to also play Biff's grandson [[List of Back to the Future characters#Griff|Griff Tannen]] and great-grandfather [[List of Back to the Future characters#Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen|Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen]].

Fox]]'s character [[Marty McFly]]. He reprised his role as Biff and voiced various Tannen relatives in [[Back to the Future (TV series)|the animated series]].  Wilson did not reprise his role as Biff in the initial versions of [[Telltale Games|Telltale]]'s ''[[Back to the Future: The Game]]'' released in 2011, being replaced by [[Kid Beyond]]. When the game was ported to the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2015 in commemoration of the original film's 30th anniversary, Wilson returned to provide Biff's voice in these newer versions.\n\nIn 1992, he voiced gangster [[Tony Zucco]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and police detective Matt Bluestone in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} He later went to co-star with [[Mark Hamill]] in ''[[Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger]]'', a video game. It was the third chapter in the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' series, but the first to feature [[live action]] and was extremely popular at the time. The character played by Wilson was Major Todd \"Maniac\" Marshall, a fellow [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]] pilot of Hamill's character. Wilson also starred in the sequels ''[[Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom]]'' (1995) and ''[[Wing Commander: Prophecy]]'' (1997) and contributed his voice to the animated series ''[[Wing Commander Academy]]'' (1996) in the same role.

He returned in the sequels ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future Part III|Part III]]'' to not only reprise his role as Biff, but to also play Biff's grandson [[List of Back to the Future characters#Griff|Griff Tannen]] and great-grandfather [[List of Back to the Future characters#Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen|Buford \"Mad Dog\" Tannen]]. In every ''Back to the Future'' film, his character ends up in a pile of [[manure]] (in reality, a heap of decayed [[sphagnum]] and other [[mulch]]es) after trying to kill or hurt [[Michael J. Fox]]'s character [[Marty McFly]]. He reprised his role as Biff and voiced various Tannen relatives in [[Back to the Future (TV series)|the animated series]].  Wilson did not reprise his role as Biff in the initial versions of [[Telltale Games|Telltale]]'s ''[[Back to the Future: The Game]]'' released in 2011, being replaced by [[Kid Beyond]]. When the game was ported to the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Xbox One]] in 2015 in commemoration of the original film's 30th anniversary, Wilson returned to provide Biff's voice in these newer versions.\n\nIn 1992, he voiced gangster [[Tony Zucco]] in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and police detective Matt Bluestone in the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} He later went to co-star with [[Mark Hamill]] in ''[[Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger]]'', a video game. It was the third chapter in the ''[[Wing Commander (franchise)|Wing Commander]]'' series, but the first to feature [[live action]] and was extremely popular at the time. The character played by Wilson was Major Todd \"Maniac\" Marshall, a fellow [[Military spacecraft in fiction|starfighter]] pilot of Hamill's character. Wilson also starred in the sequels ''[[Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom]]'' (1995) and ''[[Wing Commander: Prophecy]]'' (1997) and contributed his voice to the animated series ''[[Wing Commander Academy]]'' (1996) in the same role. He also guest starred in an episode of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' in 1997.\n\nWilson played McKinley High School's Coach Ben Fredricks in the 1999\u20132000 [[NBC]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]''. Coach Fredricks dated Bill Haverchuck's mother. Wilson was briefly reunited with his ''Back to the Future'' co-star [[Christopher Lloyd]] in the 1994 film ''[[Camp Nowhere]]''.\n\nWilson has done voice-over work for the Nickelodeon TV show ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. He has voiced many villainous characters that are physically strong and menacing, such as Flats the Flounder in the third season episode The Bully, and The Tattletale Strangler in SpongeBob Meets the Strangler, and the non-villainous character Reg the Club Bouncer in No Weenies Allowed. In 2005 he played Coach Phelps in the TV series ''[[Zoey 101]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2346301/zoey-101-celeb-guest-stars/ |title=12 Celeb Guest Stars You Completely Forgot Were On 'Zoey 101' |first=Stacey |last=Grant |date=29 October 2015 |access-date=25 April 2019 |work=[[MTV News]] |publisher=[[MTV]]}}</ref>\n\nHe has hosted a podcast, ''Big Pop Fun'', on the [[The Nerdist Podcast|Nerdist Network]] starting in November 2011.

While continuing his private practice, he served as a design critic and professor of architecture at [[Yale School of Architecture]] from 1947 to 1957. From 1957 until his death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].\n\nKahn created a style that was monumental and monolithic; his heavy buildings for the most part do not hide their weight, their materials, or the way they are assembled. Famous for his meticulously built works, his provocative proposals that remained unbuilt, and his teaching, Kahn was one of the most influential architects of the twentieth century. He was awarded the [[AIA Gold Medal]] and the [[RIBA Gold Medal]].

His birth year may have been inaccurately recorded in the process of immigration. According to his son's 2003 documentary film, the family could not afford pencils. They made their own charcoal sticks from burnt twigs so that Louis could earn a little money from drawings.<ref name=\"sons\">[http://www20.sbs.com.au/whatson/?date=2008-01-15&channelID=1 ''My Architect: A Son's Journey''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102073830/http://www20.sbs.com.au/whatson/?date=2008-01-15&channelID=1 |date=2008-01-02}}, SBS Hot Docs, 15 January 2008</ref> Later he earned money by playing piano to accompany silent movies in theaters.

He was an unenthusiastic and undistinguished student at [[Philadelphia Central High School]] until he took a course in architecture in his senior year, which convinced him to become an architect.

Initially working in a fairly orthodox version of the International Style, he was influenced vitally by a stay as Architect in Residence at the [[American Academy in Rome]] during 1950, which marked a turning point in his career. After visiting the ruins of ancient buildings in Italy, Greece, and Egypt, he adopted a back-to-the-basics approach. He developed his own style as influenced by earlier modern movements, but not limited by their sometimes-dogmatic ideologies. In the 1950s and 1960s as a consultant architect for the Philadelphia City Planning Commission Kahn developed several plans for the center of Philadelphia that were never executed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

This should be interplayed with a sense of movement which does not tax local streets for non-local traffic. There should be a system of viaducts which encase an area which can reclaim the local streets for their own use, and it should be made so this viaduct has a ground floor of shops and usable area.

His few projects reflect his deep personal involvement with each. [[Isamu Noguchi]] called him \"a philosopher among architects.\" He was known for his ability to create monumental architecture that responded to the human scale. He also was concerned with creating strong formal distinctions between ''served'' spaces and ''servant'' spaces. What he meant by ''servant'' spaces was not spaces for servants, but rather spaces that serve other spaces, such as stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or any other back-of-house function such as storage space or mechanical rooms. His palette of materials tended toward heavily textured brick and bare concrete, the textures often reinforced by juxtaposition to highly refined surfaces such as travertine marble. He is often well remembered for his deliberation about the use of brick, on how it can be more than the basic building material:\n\n<blockquote>If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, 'What do you want, Brick?' And Brick says to you, 'I like an Arch.' And if you say to Brick, 'Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?' Brick says, 'I like an Arch.' And it's important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. ... You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of shortchanging it.<ref name=\"Kahn 2003\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile widely known for the poetic sensibilities of his spaces, Kahn also worked closely with engineers and contractors on his buildings. The results often were technically innovative and highly refined. In addition to the influence Kahn's more well-known work has on contemporary architects (such as [[Muzharul Islam]], [[Tadao Ando]]), some of his work (especially the unbuilt City Tower Project) became very influential among the [[high-tech architecture|high-tech]] architects of the late twentieth century (such as [[Renzo Piano]], who worked in Kahn's office, [[Richard Rogers]], and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]). His prominent apprentices include [[Muzharul Islam]], [[Moshe Safdie]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Jack Diamond (architect)|Jack Diamond]], and [[Charles E. Dagit, Jr.|Charles Dagit]].\n\nMany years after his death, Kahn continues to provoke controversy. Before his [[Franklin D.

That the task is daunting makes it worthy of the man it honors, who guided the nation through the Depression, the New Deal and a world war.

Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt's defense of the Four Freedoms\u2014of speech and religion, and from want and fear\u2014he designed an open 'room and a garden' at the bottom of the island. Trees on either side form a 'V' defining a green space, and leading to a two-walled stone room at the water's edge that frames the United Nations and the rest of the skyline.</blockquote>\n\nA group spearheaded by [[William J. vanden Heuvel]] raised over $50 million in public and private funds between 2005 and 2012 to establish the memorial.

While continuing his private practice, he served as a design critic and professor of architecture at [[Yale School of Architecture]] from 1947 to 1957. From 1957 until his death, he was a professor of architecture at the School of Design at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].\n\nKahn created a style that was monumental and monolithic; his heavy buildings for the most part do not hide their weight, their materials, or the way they are assembled. Famous for his meticulously built works, his provocative proposals that remained unbuilt, and his teaching, Kahn was one of the most influential architects of the twentieth century. He was awarded the [[AIA Gold Medal]] and the [[RIBA Gold Medal]].

He was an unenthusiastic and undistinguished student at [[Philadelphia Central High School]] until he took a course in architecture in his senior year, which convinced him to become an architect.  He turned down an offer to go to the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] to study art under a full scholarship, instead working at a variety of jobs to pay his own tuition for a degree in architecture at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design|University of Pennsylvania School of Fine Arts]].  There, he studied under [[Paul Philippe Cret]] in a version of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts tradition]], one that discouraged excessive ornamentation.<ref>{{cite book| last=Lesser| first=Wendy| title=You Say to Brick: The Life of Louis Kahn| date=14 March 2017| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fj7jDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA56| pages=56-60| publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux| isbn=978-0374713317}}</ref>\n\n===Career===\nAfter completing his [[Bachelor of Architecture]] in 1924, Kahn worked as senior draftsman in the office of the city architect, John Molitor.

Initially working in a fairly orthodox version of the International Style, he was influenced vitally by a stay as Architect in Residence at the [[American Academy in Rome]] during 1950, which marked a turning point in his career. After visiting the ruins of ancient buildings in Italy, Greece, and Egypt, he adopted a back-to-the-basics approach. He developed his own style as influenced by earlier modern movements, but not limited by their sometimes-dogmatic ideologies. In the 1950s and 1960s as a consultant architect for the Philadelphia City Planning Commission Kahn developed several plans for the center of Philadelphia that were never executed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R.

This should be interplayed with a sense of movement which does not tax local streets for non-local traffic. There should be a system of viaducts which encase an area which can reclaim the local streets for their own use, and it should be made so this viaduct has a ground floor of shops and usable area.

It includes interviews with such renowned architectural contemporaries as [[Shamshul Wares]], [[B. V. Doshi]], [[Frank Gehry]], [[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Ed Bacon]], [[Philip Johnson]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Vincent J. Scully]], and [[Robert A. M. Stern]].

The two laboratory blocks frame a long view of the [[Pacific Ocean]], accentuated by a thin linear fountain that seems to reach for the horizon.

His few projects reflect his deep personal involvement with each. [[Isamu Noguchi]] called him \"a philosopher among architects.\" He was known for his ability to create monumental architecture that responded to the human scale. He also was concerned with creating strong formal distinctions between ''served'' spaces and ''servant'' spaces. What he meant by ''servant'' spaces was not spaces for servants, but rather spaces that serve other spaces, such as stairwells, corridors, restrooms, or any other back-of-house function such as storage space or mechanical rooms. His palette of materials tended toward heavily textured brick and bare concrete, the textures often reinforced by juxtaposition to highly refined surfaces such as travertine marble. He is often well remembered for his deliberation about the use of brick, on how it can be more than the basic building material:\n\n<blockquote>If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, 'What do you want, Brick?' And Brick says to you, 'I like an Arch.' And if you say to Brick, 'Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?' Brick says, 'I like an Arch.' And it's important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. ... You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of shortchanging it.<ref name=\"Kahn 2003\"/></blockquote>\n\nWhile widely known for the poetic sensibilities of his spaces, Kahn also worked closely with engineers and contractors on his buildings. The results often were technically innovative and highly refined. In addition to the influence Kahn's more well-known work has on contemporary architects (such as [[Muzharul Islam]], [[Tadao Ando]]), some of his work (especially the unbuilt City Tower Project) became very influential among the [[high-tech architecture|high-tech]] architects of the late twentieth century (such as [[Renzo Piano]], who worked in Kahn's office, [[Richard Rogers]], and [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]). His prominent apprentices include [[Muzharul Islam]], [[Moshe Safdie]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Jack Diamond (architect)|Jack Diamond]], and [[Charles E. Dagit, Jr.|Charles Dagit]].\n\nMany years after his death, Kahn continues to provoke controversy. Before his [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park]] at the southern tip of [[Roosevelt Island]] was built,<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite press release| url=http://www.feri.org/news/news_detail.cfm?QID=3332| title=The Franklin D.

That the task is daunting makes it worthy of the man it honors, who guided the nation through the Depression, the New Deal and a world war. As for Mr. Kahn, he died in 1974, as he passed alone through New York City's Penn Station. In his briefcase were renderings of the memorial, his last completed plan.<ref>{{cite news| title=A Roosevelt for Roosevelt Island| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/opinion/05mon4.html?searchResultPosition=3| newspaper=The New York Times.| date=November 5, 2007}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe editorial describes Kahn's plan as:\n\n<blockquote>... simple and elegant. Drawing inspiration from Roosevelt's defense of the Four Freedoms\u2014of speech and religion, and from want and fear\u2014he designed an open 'room and a garden' at the bottom of the island. Trees on either side form a 'V' defining a green space, and leading to a two-walled stone room at the water's edge that frames the United Nations and the rest of the skyline.</blockquote>\n\nA group spearheaded by [[William J. vanden Heuvel]] raised over $50 million in public and private funds between 2005 and 2012 to establish the memorial. Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park officially opened to the public on October 24, 2012.\n\n==In popular culture==\nKahn was the subject of the 2003 Oscar-nominated documentary film ''[[My Architect: A Son's Journey]]'', presented by [[Nathaniel Kahn]], his son.<ref name=CaseEstreller2014>{{cite book| first1=Natasha| last1=Case| author2=Freya Estreller| author3=Kathleen Squires| title=Coolhaus Ice Cream Book: Custom-Built Sandwiches with Crazy-Good Combos of Cookies, Ice Creams, Gelatos, and Sorbets| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keNJAQAAQBAJ| accessdate=2014-10-29| date=2014-05-20| publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt| isbn=978-0-544-12978-8}}</ref>{{rp|127}} Kahn's complicated family life inspired the \"[[Undaunted Mettle]]\" episode of ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]''.\n\nIn the 1993 film ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'', character David Murphy (played by [[Woody Harrelson]]), referenced Kahn during a lecture to architecture students, attributing the quote \"Even a brick wants to be something\" to Kahn.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning composer [[Lewis Spratlan]], with collaborators Jenny Kallick and John Downey (Amherst College, class of 2003), composed the chamber opera ''Architect'' as a character study of Kahn. The premiere recording was due to be released in 2012 by Navona Records.\n\nIn Showtime's ''[[Billions (TV series)|Billions]]'' (Season 4, Episode 6), Taylor Mason and Wendy Rhoades meet at the [[Franklin D.
