This was long considered to represent best play for both sides in the Caro\u2013Kann. White usually continues: 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3. Although White's [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an [[chess endgame|endgame]].<ref>Schiller, p. 33</ref>\n\nMuch of the Caro\u2013Kann's reputation as a {{chessgloss|solid}} defence stems from this variation. Black makes very few compromises in [[pawn structure]] and plays a timely ...c6\u2013c5 to contest the d4-square. Variations with Black [[castling]] {{chessgloss|queenside}} gave the Caro\u2013Kann its reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. More popular recently are variations with Black castling {{chessgloss|kingside}} and even leaving his king in the {{chessgloss|centre}}. These variations can be {{chessgloss|sharp}} and dynamic.\n\nHere is a {{chessgloss|brilliancy}} illustrating White's attacking chances when the players castle on opposite sides in the Classical Variation:\n:Lev Milman vs. Joseph Fang, Foxwoods Open 2005 <br />'''1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

At one time named after the first world champion [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], nowadays the  variation is variously referred to as the Smyslov Variation after the seventh world champion [[Vasily Smyslov]] who played a number of notable games with it, the Karpov Variation, after the twelfth world champion [[Anatoly Karpov]], in whose repertoire it appeared quite often, or, most commonly, the Modern Variation. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease {{chessgloss|development}} by the early exchange of a pair of knights without compromising the structural integrity of Black's position. Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6-square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the centre, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5{{chesspunc|!?}} where Black's development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous [[Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|last game]] of the [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] versus [[Garry Kasparov]] rematch where Kasparov committed a known [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] and lost was played in this very line.\n\nSpecialist knowledge is a must to play this opening.

Black's 5...exf6 is regarded as sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the Bronstein\u2013Larsen Variation and offers Black rapid development, though also ceding White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects (Black has to be cautious that the d-pawn is now a potential [[passed pawn]] in the endgame).\n{{clear}}\n\n====Gurgenidze Variation: 3.Nc3 g6 {{anchor|Gurgenidze Variation}}====\n{{Chess diagram  \n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|  |pd\n|  |  |pd|  |  |  |pd|  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |pl|pl|  |  |  \n|  |  |nl|  |  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  |bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|Gurgenidze Variation: 3...g6\n}}\nThe Gurgenidze Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 g6. Black prepares to [[fianchetto]] the bishop on g7, creating pressure against White's d4-pawn. After 4.Nf3 Bg7 White usually plays 5.h3 to prevent the ...Bg4 pin. This variation, originated by [[Bukhuti Gurgenidze]], led to a rise in the popularity of 3.Nd2 during the 1970s. After 3.Nd2, 3...g6 is met by 4.c3, when the fianchettoed bishop has little to do. 3.Nd2 will usually transpose into the Classical Variation after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Advance Variation: 3.e5 {{anchor|Advance Variation}}===\n{{Chess diagram small \n |tright\n |\n |rd|nd|  |qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n |pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|pl|bd|  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n |pl|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n |Advance Variation with 3...Bf5\n}}\nThe 3...Bf5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] (playing as White) suffered at the hands of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca|Jos\u00e9 Capablanca]] in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1007846 Nimzowitsch vs. Capablanca, New York 1927] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\nThe Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Alexei Shirov]], or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English grandmaster [[Nigel Short]] and often seen in the 1990s.

The line was christened the \"Arkell/Khenkin Variation\" in the leading chess magazine ''[[New in Chess]]'' yearbook 42 in recognition of the work these two grandmasters did and the success they were having with the variation.

It is named after [[Vasily Panov]] and the world champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]. This system often leads to typical {{chessgloss|isolani|isolated queen's pawn}} (IQP) positions, with White obtaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to compensate for the long-term structural weakness of the [[Isolated pawn|isolated]] d4-pawn. The major variation in this line is 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position often transposing into lines of the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]]) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square by advancing the  b-pawn to b5, or by exchanging the black knight on c6 after Bb5.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tartakower or Fantasy Variation: 3.f3 {{anchor|Tartakower or Fantasy Variation}}===\nThe [[Savielly Tartakower|Tartakower]] or Fantasy Variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3, somewhat resembles the [[Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit]]. 3...e6 is probably the most solid response, preparing to exploit the dark squares via ...c5, though 3....g6 has been tried by [[Yasser Seirawan]].

Interesting, though probably insufficient is 3...e5. This so-called 'Twisted Fantasy Variation' aims to exploit White's weaknesses on the a7\u2013g1 diagonal, an idea similar to 3...Qb6, a variation championed by [[Baadur Jobava]]. Related to the Fantasy Variation are the gambits 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3, originated by [[Stuart Milner-Barry|Sir Stuart Milner-Barry]], and 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.f3  (von Hennig).\n\n==Two Knights Variation: 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) {{anchor|Two Knights Variation}}==\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  \n|  |  |nl|  |  |nl|  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|  |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  |bl|ql|kl|bl|  |rl\n| Two Knights Variation\n}}\nThe Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by [[Bobby Fischer]] in his youth, but has since declined in popularity.

After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is {{chessgloss|playable}} but Black must be careful.

This was long considered to represent best play for both sides in the Caro\u2013Kann. White usually continues: 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3. Although White's [[pawn (chess)|pawn]] on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an [[chess endgame|endgame]].<ref>Schiller, p. 33</ref>\n\nMuch of the Caro\u2013Kann's reputation as a {{chessgloss|solid}} defence stems from this variation. Black makes very few compromises in [[pawn structure]] and plays a timely ...c6\u2013c5 to contest the d4-square. Variations with Black [[castling]] {{chessgloss|queenside}} gave the Caro\u2013Kann its reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. More popular recently are variations with Black castling {{chessgloss|kingside}} and even leaving his king in the {{chessgloss|centre}}. These variations can be {{chessgloss|sharp}} and dynamic.\n\nHere is a {{chessgloss|brilliancy}} illustrating White's attacking chances when the players castle on opposite sides in the Classical Variation:\n:Lev Milman vs. Joseph Fang, Foxwoods Open 2005 <br />'''1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.

At one time named after the first world champion [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], nowadays the  variation is variously referred to as the Smyslov Variation after the seventh world champion [[Vasily Smyslov]] who played a number of notable games with it, the Karpov Variation, after the twelfth world champion [[Anatoly Karpov]], in whose repertoire it appeared quite often, or, most commonly, the Modern Variation. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease {{chessgloss|development}} by the early exchange of a pair of knights without compromising the structural integrity of Black's position. Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6-square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the centre, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5{{chesspunc|!?}} where Black's development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous [[Deep Blue - Kasparov, 1997, Game 6|last game]] of the [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]] versus [[Garry Kasparov]] rematch where Kasparov committed a known [[blunder (chess)|blunder]] and lost was played in this very line.\n\nSpecialist knowledge is a must to play this opening.

This variation, originated by [[Bukhuti Gurgenidze]], led to a rise in the popularity of 3.Nd2 during the 1970s. After 3.Nd2, 3...g6 is met by 4.c3, when the fianchettoed bishop has little to do. 3.Nd2 will usually transpose into the Classical Variation after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Advance Variation: 3.e5 {{anchor|Advance Variation}}===\n{{Chess diagram small \n |tright\n |\n |rd|nd|  |qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n |pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pd|pl|bd|  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n |pl|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n |Advance Variation with 3...Bf5\n}}\nThe 3...Bf5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that [[Aron Nimzowitsch]] (playing as White) suffered at the hands of [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca|Jos\u00e9 Capablanca]] in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1007846 Nimzowitsch vs. Capablanca, New York 1927] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\nThe Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Alexei Shirov]], or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English grandmaster [[Nigel Short]] and often seen in the 1990s. Another less popular but aggressive line is the Tal variation (4.h4 h5), popularised by [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Mikhail Tal]].\n{{clear}}\n\n{{Chess diagram small  \n |tright\n |\n |rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n |pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|pd\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n |  |  |pd|pd|pl|  |  |  \n |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n |pl|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n |rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n |Advance Variation with 3...c5\n}}\nThe 3...c5 variation that follows with 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5!? is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] in his [[World Chess Championship 1961|1961 match]] versus [[Mikhail Tal]] (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik \u2013 two [[draw (chess)|draws]] and a loss). The line was christened the \"Arkell/Khenkin Variation\" in the leading chess magazine ''[[New in Chess]]'' yearbook 42 in recognition of the work these two grandmasters did and the success they were having with the variation. In comparison to the French Defence, Black lacks the [[tempo (chess)|tempo]] normally spent on ...e6; however, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central {{chessgloss|bind}} with 4. dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 cxd5 {{anchor|Exchange Variation}}===\nThe Exchange Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5.\n\n====Main line: 4.Bd3====\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |bl|  |  |  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|  |  |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|  |nl|rl\n| Exchange Variation with 4.Bd3\n}}\nThe \"true\" Exchange Variation begins with 4.Bd3 (to prevent ...Bf5 while still developing) 4...Nc6 5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 Bg4 7.Qb3. This line is considered to offer equal chances, and was tried by [[Bobby Fischer]].

It is named after [[Vasily Panov]] and the world champion [[Mikhail Botvinnik]]. This system often leads to typical {{chessgloss|isolani|isolated queen's pawn}} (IQP) positions, with White obtaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to compensate for the long-term structural weakness of the [[Isolated pawn|isolated]] d4-pawn. The major variation in this line is 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position often transposing into lines of the [[Nimzo-Indian Defence]]) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square by advancing the  b-pawn to b5, or by exchanging the black knight on c6 after Bb5.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tartakower or Fantasy Variation: 3.f3 {{anchor|Tartakower or Fantasy Variation}}===\nThe [[Savielly Tartakower|Tartakower]] or Fantasy Variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3, somewhat resembles the [[Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit]]. 3...e6 is probably the most solid response, preparing to exploit the dark squares via ...c5, though 3....g6 has been tried by [[Yasser Seirawan]]. [[Grandmaster (chess)|GM]] Lars Schandorff and GM Sam Shankland both prefer 3...dxe4 4.fxe4 e5 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bc4 Nd7 7.0-0 Ngf6 8.c3 Bd6 with play being sharp and double-edged. Interesting, though probably insufficient is 3...e5. This so-called 'Twisted Fantasy Variation' aims to exploit White's weaknesses on the a7\u2013g1 diagonal, an idea similar to 3...Qb6, a variation championed by [[Baadur Jobava]]. Related to the Fantasy Variation are the gambits 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3, originated by [[Stuart Milner-Barry|Sir Stuart Milner-Barry]], and 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.f3  (von Hennig).\n\n==Two Knights Variation: 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) {{anchor|Two Knights Variation}}==\n{{Chess diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|qd|kd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|  |  |pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |pd|  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |pl|  |  |  \n|  |  |nl|  |  |nl|  |  \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|  |pl|pl|pl\n|rl|  |bl|ql|kl|bl|  |rl\n| Two Knights Variation\n}}\nThe Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by [[Bobby Fischer]] in his youth, but has since declined in popularity. White's intention is to benefit from rapid development as well as to retain options regarding the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is {{chessgloss|playable}} but Black must be careful. In  [[Daniel Noteboom|Noteboom]]\u2013Mindeno 1927 Black lost quickly after 5.exd5 cxd5 6.g4 Bg6 7.Ne5 a6? (7...Nc6 is necessary) 8.h4 d4 9.h5! dxc3 10.hxg6 cxd2+ 11.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 and Black must lose {{chessgloss|material}}.<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1590007 Noteboom vs. Mindeno, Holland 1927] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\nThis variation sets a trap: if Black plays along the lines of the Classical Variation, he gets in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?!

Black will probably play 2...d5 (see [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...c6/2. c4/2...d5|1.e4 c6 2.c4 d5]]). This can transpose to the Panov\u2013Botvinnik (B14, given above, with 3.exd5 cxd5 4.d4) or Caro\u2013Kann (B10, with the double capture on d5). Alternatively, Black may play 2...e5, the Open Variation (see [[b:Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...c6/2. c4/2...e5|1.e4 c6 2.c4 e5]]). The 2.c4 line can also arise by transposition from the [[English Opening]]: 1.c4 c6 2.e4.\n\nThe Hillbilly Attack,<ref>{{cite book |title=Taming Wild Chess Openings: How to Deal with the Good, the Bad and the Ugly over the Chess Board |first1=John |last1=Watson |publisher=New In Chess |year=2015 |isbn=978-90-5691-571-1 |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fidBCwAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=fidBCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA148 Extract of page 148]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Unorthodox Chess Openings |edition=illustrated |first1=Eric |last1=Schiller |publisher=Cardoza |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-940685-73-4 |page=82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpMXAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> 1.e4 c6 2.Bc4?!, is most often played by weaker players unfamiliar with the Caro\u2013Kann Defence.

This can be done by viewing the traffic statistics found in the web server log file, an automatically generated list of all the pages served. A ''hit'' is generated when any file is served. The page itself is considered a file, but images are also files, thus a page with 5 images could generate 6 hits (the 5 images and the page itself). A ''[[page view]]'' is generated when a visitor requests any page within the website&nbsp;\u2013 a visitor will always generate at least one page view (the main page) but could generate many more.\n[[Web tracking|Tracking]] applications external to the website can record traffic by inserting a small piece of HTML code in every page of the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-mwt1/|title=Measuring Web Traffic|last=Malacinski|first=Andrei|author2=Dominick, Scott|author3=Hartrick, Tom|date=1 March 2001|publisher=IBM|accessdate=10 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719075253/http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-mwt1/|archive-date=19 July 2008|url-status=dead}}|</ref>\n\nWeb traffic is also sometimes measured by [[Packet sniffer|packet sniffing]] and thus gaining random samples of traffic data from which to extrapolate information about web traffic as a whole across total [[Internet]] usage.\n\nThe following types of information are often collated when monitoring web traffic:\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalanalyticsassociation.org/Files/PDF_standards/WebAnalyticsDefinitionsVol1.pdf|title=Web Analytics Definitions|author = |publisher = Web Analytics Association|date = 22 September 2008|accessdate = 18 May 2015}}</ref>\n*The number of visitors.\n*The average number of page views per visitor&nbsp;\u2013 a high number would indicate that the average visitors go deep inside the site, possibly because they like it or find it useful.\n*Average visit duration&nbsp;\u2013 the total length of a user's visit.

The difficulty with this is that it does not look at the complete traffic picture for a site. Large sites usually hire the services of companies such as the [[Nielsen NetRatings]] or [[Quantcast]], but their reports are available only by subscription.\n\n==Control==\n\nThe amount of traffic seen by a website is a measure of its popularity. By analysing the statistics of visitors it is possible to see shortcomings of the site and look to improve those areas. It is also possible to increase the popularity of a site and the number of people that visit it.\n\n===Limiting access===\n\nIt is sometimes important to protect some parts of a site by password, allowing only authorized people to visit particular sections or pages.\n\nSome site administrators have chosen to block their page to specific traffic, such as by geographic location. The [[political campaign|re-election campaign]] site for [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] ([http://www.georgewbush.com GeorgeWBush.com]) was blocked to all [[internet]] users outside of the U.S. on 25 October 2004 after a reported attack on the site.<ref>{{cite news\n | url = http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/10/26/bush_campaign_web_site_rejects_nonus_visitors.html\n | title = Bush Campaign Web Site Rejects Non-US Visitors\n | first = Rich\n | last = Miller\n | date = 2004-10-26\n }}\n</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to limit access to a web server both based on the number of connections and by the bandwidth expended by each connection. On [[Apache HTTP server]]s, this is accomplished by the ''limitipconn'' module and others.\n\n===From search engines===\n\nThe majority of website traffic is driven by the [[Web search engines|search engines]].  Millions of people use search engines every day to research various topics, buy products, and go about their daily surfing activities. Search engines use [[Index term|keywords]] to help users find relevant information, and each of the major search engines has developed a unique [[algorithm]] to determine where websites are placed within the search results. When a user clicks on one of the listings in the search results, they are directed to the corresponding website and data is transferred from the website's server, thus counting the visitors towards the overall flow of traffic to that website.\n\n[[Search engine optimization]] (SEO), is the ongoing practice of optimizing a website to help improve its rankings in the search engines.  Several internal and external factors are involved which can help improve a site's listing within the search engines.  The higher a site ranks within the search engines for a particular keyword, the more traffic they will receive.\n\n===Increasing traffic===\n\nWeb traffic can be increased by placement of a site in search engines and purchase of [[advertising]], including bulk e-mail, [[pop-up ads]], and in-page advertisements. \n\nWeb traffic can also be increased by purchasing through web traffic providers who are experts at delivering targeted traffic, however, buying traffic in the past has seen many websites being penalized on search engines.\n\nWeb traffic can be increased not only by attracting more visitors to a site, but also by encouraging individual visitors to \"linger\" on the site, viewing many pages in a visit. (''see [[Outbrain]] for an example of this practice'')\n\nIf a web page is not listed in the first pages of any search, the odds of someone finding it diminishes greatly (especially if there is other competition on the first page). Very few people go past the first page, and the percentage that go to subsequent pages is substantially lower. Consequently, getting proper placement on search engines, a practice known as SEO, is as important as the website itself..{{cn|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Traffic overload==<!-- This section is linked from [[Slashdot effect]] -->\n\nToo much web traffic can dramatically slow down or prevent all access to a website. This is caused by more file requests going to the server than it can handle and may be an intentional attack on the site or simply caused by over-popularity. Large-scale websites with numerous servers can often cope with the traffic required, and it is more likely that smaller services are affected by traffic overload. Sudden traffic load may also hang your server or may result in a shutdown of your services.\n\n===Denial of service attacks===\n\n[[Denial-of-service attack]]s (DoS attacks) have forced websites to close after a malicious attack, flooding the site with more requests than it could cope with.

However, it became an enjoyable and positive experience for them, and by the time it finished \"we were so charged up we wanted to keep on playing.\"<ref name=WNEW91/><ref name=ME91/> This renewed energy in the band carried through to the writing and recording sessions for ''Roll the Bones''.<ref name=WNEW91>{{cite interview|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19910829wnew.htm|title=Roll the Bones CD Launch \u2013 Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson Interview|first=Dan|last=Neer|publisher=WNEW-FM|location=New York City|date=August 29, 1991|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> They then took a break, but decided to cut it short in order to start work on new material for a follow-up record.<ref name=RTBTOUR/> \n\nAs with ''Presto'', Rush started work by retreating to Chalet Studios, a remote studio in [[Claremont, Ontario]].<ref name=GW1991>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19911200guitarworld.htm|title=Alex Lifeson & Geddy Lee: Flesh and Bones|first=Mike|last=Mettler|magazine=Guitar World|date=December 1991|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19931022billboard.htm|title=Rushing Back to the Limelight With 'Counterparts'|first=Larry|last=Leblanc|work=Billboard|date=October 22, 1993|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}</ref> They stayed for two-and-a-half months, with Lee and Lifeson working on the music while Peart wrote lyrics.

Lee said the change was \"a backlash against the more computer-style of writing\" which had dominated their sound through the 1980s, and instead used synthesizers and sequencers as an \"orchestration device\" rather than a key component in the songwriting.<ref name=NMS91/> The writing sessions for ''Presto'' had involved just bass, guitar, and vocals which contributed to the style shift, and the group continued with this approach for ''Roll the Bones''.<ref name=NMS91/><ref name=GP91>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19911100guitarplayer.htm|title=Rush Redefined|date=November 1991|magazine=Guitar Player|first=Andy|last=Widders-Ellis|accessdate=November 13, 2018}}</ref> Another aspect that carried over from ''Presto'' was Lee's intention to come up with strong vocal melodies at the beginning and base the rest of the tune around it.<ref name=NMS91/> Lifeson had wanted to try playing funk rhythms and having attempted it on ''Presto'', wished to explore it further on ''Roll the Bones''.<ref name=GP91/> The majority of the arrangements worked out at the writing stage remained unchanged which allowed the group to use the demos as a guide for recording, done by transferring the completed demos to 24-track and re-recording the parts.<ref name=GP91/>\n\nThe album contains a running lyrical theme concerning the element of chance in different aspects of life, which Peart had devised while experimenting with lyrics.<ref name=MH91>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19911000metalhammer.htm|title=Rush & Roulette|first=Howard|last=Johnson|magazine=Metal Hammer|issue=14|volume=6|date=October 1991|accessdate=November 13, 2018}}</ref> The first lyric that he wrote for the album was used on \"Face Up,\" specifically: \"Turn it up \u2013 or turn that wild card down.\"<ref name=RTBTOUR/> He recalled sitting on his cottage floor \"with a pile of papers around me\" of notes from the previous two years, mostly consisting of phrases written on tour or during \"that dreamlike moment before sleep.\"<ref name=RTBTOUR/> He started to experiment with the phrases \"turn it up\" and \"turn it down\" which led to the idea of turning a card down and a wild card, and applied them to events that a person may face.<ref name=RTBTOUR/>\n\n==Recording==\n''Roll the Bones'' was recorded at [[Le Studio]] in [[Morin-Heights, Quebec]] and McClear Place in Toronto, between February and May 1991. The band resumed working with co-producer [[Rupert Hine]] and engineer [[Stephen W Tayler|Stephen Tayler]], both of whom had worked on ''Presto''.<ref name=CM91/> The vocals were recorded in England.<ref name=ROCKLINE/> Rush wanted to continue to work with Hine due to his accomplished songwriting, the feedback he gave their songs and his ability for the group to achieve a looser sound than previous albums.<ref name=NMS91/><ref name=GP91/> Lee said that various production tricks they had learned from working with [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]] in the 1980s were used on ''Presto'' and ''Roll the Bones''.<ref name=NMS91/>\n\nThe bass and drum parts were put down in four days, and the guitars in eight. Lee was amazed at how Peart had learned his parts for an entire song prior to recording it, and that \"Nine times out of 10 it took only one pass for him to nail it.\"<ref name=GP91/> The band had originally planned to release the album in January 1992, but they finished it two months early.<ref name=WNEW91/><ref name=MEAT92>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19920300meat.htm |title=Canada's #1 Rock Act!

It was released November 21, 1989 by [[Anthem Records]] and was the band's first album released internationally by [[Atlantic Records]] following the group's departure from [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]. After the ''[[Hold Your Fire]]'' (1987) tour ended in 1988, the group members reconvened in December to decide their next step and agreed to take six months off before starting on a new album. ''Presto'' marked another change in Rush's sound, with guitar taking a more dominant role in the writing and a reduction in synthesizers and a return towards more guitar-driven arrangements.\n\n''Presto'' reached No. 7 in Canada and No. 16 in the United States. Rush released \"[[Show Don't Tell (song)|Show Don't Tell]],\" \"[[The Pass (song)|The Pass]]\" and \"Superconductor\" as singles from ''Presto''; the former charted at No. 1 on the U.S. [[Album Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>[http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/musicology/grads/bowman/PDFS/DBowman_dissertation.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708155545/http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/musicology/grads/bowman/PDFS/DBowman_dissertation.pdf |date=July 8, 2009 }}</ref> Rush supported the album with the [[Presto tour|Presto Tour]] from February to June 1990.

They adopted their usual method of Lifeson and Lee working on the music while Peart worked alone on the lyrics. Peart wrote: \"At the end of the day I might wander into the studio, ice cubes clinking, and listen to what they'd been up to, and if I'd been lucky, show them something new.\"<ref name=PTB90/> Rush worked at the studio during the week and returned home on weekends.<ref name=PTB90/>\n\n''Presto'' marks the beginning of Rush's return to a more guitar-driven sound from what is known to many as Rush's \"synthesizer period\" of the band's last four releases. When Lifeson and Lee discussed what musical direction to take, they agreed that the core of the band's sound, emotion, and energy had come from the guitar, something that they wanted to return to for ''Presto''.<ref name=PTB90/> This resulted in a much more satisfying album for Lifeson.<ref name=K89/> Lifeson had felt constricted in his guitar playing since synthesizers began playing a more dominant role in the songwriting and performance on ''Signals'' (1982), which had continued through the 1980s.<ref name=S89/> Lee explained that Rush wanted ''Presto'' to be \"more of a singer's album, and I think you'll notice that the arrangements musically support the vocal[s]&nbsp;... Neil's lyrics to me are a lot more heartfelt [...] This album was a real reaction against technology in a sense. I was getting sick and tired of working with computers and synthesizers [...] We made a pact to stay away from strings, pianos, and organs\u2014to stay away from digital technology. In the end, we couldn't resist using them for colour.\"<ref>Krewen, Nick. \"Rush: Presto change-o\"  Canadian Musician 12.2</ref>\n\nIn a contrast to previous albums ''Grace Under Pressure'', ''Power Windows'' and ''Hold Your Fire'', the album does not contain an overall running lyrical theme, or what Peart described as \"heavy\" lyrical messages, instead adopting a more loose approach with each track making its own statement.<ref name=ME90/> Peart used the word \"response\" to describe the lyrical content as a whole. \"The idea that you don't go through life just looking at things. It doesn't matter if you've been all around the world - you may have seen it, but if you haven't felt it, you haven't been there.\"<ref name=CP90/> Peart added: \"There are many threads and a strong motif of looking at life today and trying to act inside it.\"<ref>[http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900400cm.htm \"Presto Change-O\" - Canadian Musician, April 1990]. 2112.net.

However, their initial choice, [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who'd worked on ''[[Power Windows (album)|Power Windows]]'' (1985) and ''Hold Your Fire'', reluctantly declined the offer to work on ''Presto'' as he wished to produce other bands. Though Rush felt confident enough to undertake production duties themselves, they still wanted someone they could trust and to provide an objective point of view to their ideas.<ref name=PTB90/> Among the various candidates was English producer, songwriter, and keyboardist [[Rupert Hine]], whose experience with a variety of artists attracted the group. Peart recalled the time when they presented their ideas to Hine: \"We were a little bemused [...] at the end of some of them he actually seemed to be laughing! We looked at each other, eyebrows raised as if to say: \"He thinks our songs are funny?\" But evidently it was a laugh of pleasure; he stayed 'til the end\".<ref name=PTB90/> At Hine's suggestion, the group brought in [[Stephen W. Tayler]] as the recording and mixing engineer. The sessions with Rush and Hine together were productive; initially, 10 days were assigned for pre-production work with one track for each day, but it was complete after just one-and-a-half days.<ref name=K89/>\n\nThe album's title was an idea that Rush had considered to use for ''A Show of Hands'', but when Peart had started writing for a song entitled \"Presto\" it was then used as the title.<ref name=RL89/><ref name=ME90/>\n\n==Recording==\n''Presto'' was recorded from June to August 1989.<ref name=CDNOTES>{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rush-Presto/release/428391|title=Presto|id=7 82040-2|publisher=Atlantic Records|year=1989}}</ref> As part of their deal with Hine, the band agreed to record parts of ''Presto'' in London.<ref name=RL89>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19891204rockline.htm|title=Geddy Lee on Rockline for Presto|first=Bob|last=Coburn|work=Rockline|date=December 4, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref> ''Presto'' was finished around four weeks ahead of schedule.<ref name=K89/>\n\nWhen the album was complete, Rush sought a new record deal and signed to [[Atlantic Records]] after executive [[Doug Morris]] had wanted to sign the group for a number of years and made an attractive offer.<ref name=K89/>\n\n==Songs==\n===Side one===\n\"The Pass\" concerns a friend of Peart's who joined him on a cycle ride and once discussed juvenile suicide, which inspired the lyrics for the song.<ref name=S89/> Peart named it the song he had worked the hardest on due to the delicate nature of the subject.<ref name=CP90>http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900103canadianpress.htm</ref> The song became a group favorite; Peart picked the track as the reason to choose ''Presto'' as one album of theirs that they could re-record if they could.<ref>[http://exploremusic.com/show/the-time-machine-tour-interview-with-neil-peart-of-rush/ Corus Radio - YouTube].

The pattern was derived from a tribal rhythm [[Neil Peart]] experienced while on a bicycle tour of Africa (later chronicled in his first book, ''[[The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa]]''). He went on to incorporate this pattern into his live drum solos. The song also features the use of a [[music sequencer|sequencer]] in place of, and often mistaken for, a bass guitar.\n\nTitle track \"Presto\" was not performed live until 2010 for the [[Time Machine Tour]].

It was released November 21, 1989 by [[Anthem Records]] and was the band's first album released internationally by [[Atlantic Records]] following the group's departure from [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]. After the ''[[Hold Your Fire]]'' (1987) tour ended in 1988, the group members reconvened in December to decide their next step and agreed to take six months off before starting on a new album. ''Presto'' marked another change in Rush's sound, with guitar taking a more dominant role in the writing and a reduction in synthesizers and a return towards more guitar-driven arrangements.\n\n''Presto'' reached No. 7 in Canada and No. 16 in the United States. Rush released \"[[Show Don't Tell (song)|Show Don't Tell]],\" \"[[The Pass (song)|The Pass]]\" and \"Superconductor\" as singles from ''Presto''; the former charted at No. 1 on the U.S. [[Album Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>[http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/musicology/grads/bowman/PDFS/DBowman_dissertation.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708155545/http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/musicology/grads/bowman/PDFS/DBowman_dissertation.pdf |date=July 8, 2009 }}</ref> Rush supported the album with the [[Presto tour|Presto Tour]] from February to June 1990.

They adopted their usual method of Lifeson and Lee working on the music while Peart worked alone on the lyrics. Peart wrote: \"At the end of the day I might wander into the studio, ice cubes clinking, and listen to what they'd been up to, and if I'd been lucky, show them something new.\"<ref name=PTB90/> Rush worked at the studio during the week and returned home on weekends.<ref name=PTB90/>\n\n''Presto'' marks the beginning of Rush's return to a more guitar-driven sound from what is known to many as Rush's \"synthesizer period\" of the band's last four releases. When Lifeson and Lee discussed what musical direction to take, they agreed that the core of the band's sound, emotion, and energy had come from the guitar, something that they wanted to return to for ''Presto''.<ref name=PTB90/> This resulted in a much more satisfying album for Lifeson.<ref name=K89/> Lifeson had felt constricted in his guitar playing since synthesizers began playing a more dominant role in the songwriting and performance on ''Signals'' (1982), which had continued through the 1980s.<ref name=S89/> Lee explained that Rush wanted ''Presto'' to be \"more of a singer's album, and I think you'll notice that the arrangements musically support the vocal[s]&nbsp;... Neil's lyrics to me are a lot more heartfelt [...] This album was a real reaction against technology in a sense. I was getting sick and tired of working with computers and synthesizers [...] We made a pact to stay away from strings, pianos, and organs\u2014to stay away from digital technology. In the end, we couldn't resist using them for colour.\"<ref>Krewen, Nick. \"Rush: Presto change-o\"  Canadian Musician 12.2</ref>\n\nIn a contrast to previous albums ''Grace Under Pressure'', ''Power Windows'' and ''Hold Your Fire'', the album does not contain an overall running lyrical theme, or what Peart described as \"heavy\" lyrical messages, instead adopting a more loose approach with each track making its own statement.<ref name=ME90/> Peart used the word \"response\" to describe the lyrical content as a whole. \"The idea that you don't go through life just looking at things. It doesn't matter if you've been all around the world - you may have seen it, but if you haven't felt it, you haven't been there.\"<ref name=CP90/> Peart added: \"There are many threads and a strong motif of looking at life today and trying to act inside it.\"<ref>[http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900400cm.htm \"Presto Change-O\" - Canadian Musician, April 1990]. 2112.net. Retrieved on 2014-05-12.</ref>\n\nAfter several songs had been worked out, the band felt it was the right time to present what they had to a co-producer. However, their initial choice, [[Peter Collins (record producer)|Peter Collins]], who'd worked on ''[[Power Windows (album)|Power Windows]]'' (1985) and ''Hold Your Fire'', reluctantly declined the offer to work on ''Presto'' as he wished to produce other bands. Though Rush felt confident enough to undertake production duties themselves, they still wanted someone they could trust and to provide an objective point of view to their ideas.<ref name=PTB90/> Among the various candidates was English producer, songwriter, and keyboardist [[Rupert Hine]], whose experience with a variety of artists attracted the group. Peart recalled the time when they presented their ideas to Hine: \"We were a little bemused [...] at the end of some of them he actually seemed to be laughing! We looked at each other, eyebrows raised as if to say: \"He thinks our songs are funny?\" But evidently it was a laugh of pleasure; he stayed 'til the end\".<ref name=PTB90/> At Hine's suggestion, the group brought in [[Stephen W. Tayler]] as the recording and mixing engineer. The sessions with Rush and Hine together were productive; initially, 10 days were assigned for pre-production work with one track for each day, but it was complete after just one-and-a-half days.<ref name=K89/>\n\nThe album's title was an idea that Rush had considered to use for ''A Show of Hands'', but when Peart had started writing for a song entitled \"Presto\" it was then used as the title.<ref name=RL89/><ref name=ME90/>\n\n==Recording==\n''Presto'' was recorded from June to August 1989.<ref name=CDNOTES>{{cite AV media notes|url=https://www.discogs.com/Rush-Presto/release/428391|title=Presto|id=7 82040-2|publisher=Atlantic Records|year=1989}}</ref> As part of their deal with Hine, the band agreed to record parts of ''Presto'' in London.<ref name=RL89>{{cite web|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19891204rockline.htm|title=Geddy Lee on Rockline for Presto|first=Bob|last=Coburn|work=Rockline|date=December 4, 1989|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref> ''Presto'' was finished around four weeks ahead of schedule.<ref name=K89/>\n\nWhen the album was complete, Rush sought a new record deal and signed to [[Atlantic Records]] after executive [[Doug Morris]] had wanted to sign the group for a number of years and made an attractive offer.<ref name=K89/>\n\n==Songs==\n===Side one===\n\"The Pass\" concerns a friend of Peart's who joined him on a cycle ride and once discussed juvenile suicide, which inspired the lyrics for the song.<ref name=S89/> Peart named it the song he had worked the hardest on due to the delicate nature of the subject.<ref name=CP90>http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19900103canadianpress.htm</ref> The song became a group favorite; Peart picked the track as the reason to choose ''Presto'' as one album of theirs that they could re-record if they could.<ref>[http://exploremusic.com/show/the-time-machine-tour-interview-with-neil-peart-of-rush/ Corus Radio - YouTube].

The pattern was derived from a tribal rhythm [[Neil Peart]] experienced while on a bicycle tour of Africa (later chronicled in his first book, ''[[The Masked Rider: Cycling in West Africa]]''). He went on to incorporate this pattern into his live drum solos. The song also features the use of a [[music sequencer|sequencer]] in place of, and often mistaken for, a bass guitar.\n\nTitle track \"Presto\" was not performed live until 2010 for the [[Time Machine Tour]]. Lifeson said the song is about \"feeling more active in your heart than in your head, not having the answers to problems.\"<ref name=S89/>\n\n===Side two===\n\"Superconductor\" deals with the superficiality of mainstream music. That topic also appears in other songs such as \"Grand Designs\" from the ''Power Windows'' album. \n\nIn \"Anagram (for Mongo),\" every line contains one or more words that are formed by using letters in another word from that same line (e.g. \"There is no '''safe seat''' at the '''feast'''\"), and certain lines contain anagrammed words (e.g. \"'''Miracles''' will have their '''claimers'''\"). Its title was inspired by the character Mongo from ''[[Blazing Saddles]]''.<ref name=RL89/> Lifeson spoke about the lyrics: \"It doesn't mean anything, it was just a fun thing, but there are some great twists in there.\"<ref name=S89>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/19891209sounds.htm|title=The Magic Circle|first=Paul|last=Elliot|magazine=Sounds|date=December 9, 1989|accessdate=January 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n\"Red Tide\" has been seen as a commentary on climate change and the growing problem of global warming.<ref>[http://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/review-presto.php Rush: Presto - Album Review].
