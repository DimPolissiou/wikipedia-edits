In the 1960s, several British rock bands such as the [[Rolling Stones]], [[the Who]] and [[the Animals]] were referred to and promoted as being R&B bands; posters for the Who's residency at the [[Marquee Club]] in 1964 contained the slogan, \"Maximum R&B\".<ref>[http://www.myvintagegeneration.com/2013/04/the-who-maximum-r-b-live-at-leeds-new-musical-express-cover/ \"The Who Maximum R&B Live at Leeds New Musical Express Cover\"], Myvintagegeneration.com</ref> Their mix of rock and roll and R&B is now known as \"[[British rhythm and blues]]\". By the 1970s, the term \"rhythm and blues\" changed again and was used as a blanket term for soul and [[funk]]. In the 1980s, a newer style of R&B developed, becoming known as \"[[contemporary R&B]]\".

Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.<ref>Morrison, Craig (1952). ''Go Cat Go!''

These genres of music were often performed by full-time musicians, either working alone or in small groups. The precursors of rhythm and blues came from jazz and blues, which overlapped in the late-1920s and 1930s through the work of musicians such as the [[Harlem Hamfats]], with their 1936 hit \"Oh Red\", as well as [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Leroy Carr]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[Count Basie]], and [[T-Bone Walker]].

It may also account for the fact that patterns such as [tresillo have]{{nbsp}}... remained one of the most useful and common syncopated patterns in jazz.\" ''Early Jazz; Its Roots and Musical Development''. New York: Oxford Press.</ref> The use of tresillo was continuously reinforced by the consecutive waves of Cuban music, which were adopted into North American popular culture. In 1940 Bob Zurke released \"Rhumboogie,\" a boogie-woogie with a tresillo bass line, and lyrics proudly declaring the adoption of Cuban rhythm:\n\n{{quote|Harlem's got a new rhythm, man it's burning up the dance floors because it's so hot!

On 'Country Boy' I had my bass and drums playing a straight swing rhythm and wrote out that 'rumba' bass part for the saxes to play on top of the swing rhythm.

I'd have the string bass, an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison.<ref>Dave Bartholomew quoted by Palmer, Robert (1988: 27) \"The Cuban Connection\" ''Spin Magazine'' Nov.</ref>}}\n\nBartholomew referred to the Cuban [[son music|son]] by the misnomer ''rumba'', a common practice of that time. Fats Domino's \"[[Blue Monday (Fats Domino song)|Blue Monday]],\" produced by Bartholomew, is another example of this now classic use of tresillo in R&B. Bartholomew's 1949 tresillo-based \"Oh Cubanas\" is an attempt to blend African American and Afro-Cuban music.

New Orleans musicians such as Bartholomew and Longhair incorporated Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as \"Carnival Day,\" (Bartholomew 1949) and \"Mardi Gras In New Orleans\" (Longhair 1949). While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.\n\nRobert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and \"fell under the spell of Perez Prado's [[mambo (music)|mambo]] records.\"<ref>Palmer, Robert (1979: 14).

Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure.<ref>Morrison, Craig (1952). ''Go Cat Go!''

While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.\n\nRobert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and \"fell under the spell of Perez Prado's [[mambo (music)|mambo]] records.\"<ref>Palmer, Robert (1979: 14).

He attended the [[New Mexico Military Institute|Goss Military Academy]] (since renamed as the New Mexico Military Institute) and St. Michael's College (now [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]), and the New Mexico School of Mines (now [[New Mexico Tech]], Socorro, NM). He was a member of the international fraternity [https://www.tke.org/chapter/139/alpha-omicron [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] \u2013 Alpha Omicron Chapter]. In his early twenties, Hilton was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representative in the first [[New Mexico Legislature]], when the state was newly formed. He served two years in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]].  While Conrad was in France with the army after the war, his father was killed in a car accident.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Be My Guest\" by Conrad Hilton, copyright 1958 by the Prentice Hall Press</ref>\n\nThe most enduring influence to shape Hilton's philanthropic philosophy beyond that of his parents was the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and his sisters. He credited his mother with guiding him to prayer and the church whenever he was troubled or dismayed\u2014from the boyhood loss of a beloved pony to severe financial losses during the [[Great Depression]]. His mother continually told him that prayer was the best investment he would ever make.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Career==\nAs a young boy, Hilton developed entrepreneurial skills working at his father's general store in [[Socorro County]], [[New Mexico]], which was partially converted into a 10-room hotel.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhi39 ''The Handbook of Texas Online'' (Texas State Historical Association)].</ref><ref>[https://theoutline.com/post/1073/hilton-never-ending-quest-to-build-a-hotel-in-space ''The never-ending quest to build a hotel in space''].</ref> This was followed by varied experiences, including a stint as a representative in New Mexico's first State Legislature and a career decision to become a banker.\n\nIt was with the intention of buying a bank that he arrived in Texas at the height of the oil boom. He bought his first hotel instead, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in [[Cisco, Texas]], in 1919,<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> when a bank purchase fell through. The hotel did such brisk business that rooms changed hands as often as three times a day, and the dining room was converted into additional rooms to meet the demand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"bigspring\">Associated Press. \"Modest Inn at Cisco Began Hotel String of Conrad Hilton,\" ''Big Spring Daily Herald'', November 21, 1963, p. 12-A.</ref>\n\nHe went on to buy and build hotels throughout Texas, including the highrise [[Dallas Hilton]], opened in 1925; the Abilene Hilton in 1927; Waco Hilton in 1928; and [[Plaza Hotel (El Paso)|El Paso Hilton]] in 1930. The first hotel outside of Texas that Hilton built was in 1939 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Today it is known as the [[Andaluz Hotel|Hotel Andaluz]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Hilton was nearly forced into [[bankruptcy]] and lost several of his hotels. Nevertheless, he was retained as manager of a combined chain, and eventually regained control of his remaining eight hotels.\n\nOver the next decade, he expanded west to California and east to Chicago and New York, crowning his expansions with such acquisitions as the [[Stevens Hotel]] in Chicago (then the world's largest hotel, it was renamed the Conrad Hilton), and the fabled [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in New York. He formed the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] in 1946, and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton International Company]] in 1948.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hilton Hotels' worldwide expansion facilitated both American tourism and overseas business by American corporations. It was the world's first international hotel chain, at the same time establishing a certain worldwide standard for hotel accommodations. In 1954, Hilton Hotels bought The Hotels Statler Company, Inc., for $111 million, then the world's largest real estate transaction. In all, Hilton eventually owned 188 hotels in 38 cities in the U.S., including the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, DC, the [[Palmer House]] in Chicago, and the [[Plaza Hotel]] and Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, along with fifty-four hotels abroad. He later purchased the [[Carte Blanche (credit card)|Carte Blanche]] Credit Company and an interest in the American Crystal Sugar Company, as well as other enterprises.\n\nHilton received honorary degrees from the [[University of Detroit]] (1953), [[DePaul University]] (1954), [[Barat College]] (1955), [[Adelphi College]] (1957), [[Sophia University]], Tokyo (1963), and the [[University of Albuquerque]] (1975). Hilton's autobiography, ''Be My Guest'',<ref>[http://www.doubletreefranchise.com/SF/Overview/HHC_History.asp?HCode=HHC ''Be My Guest, Autobiography of Conrad Hilton''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324124351/http://www.doubletreefranchise.com/SF/Overview/HHC_History.asp?HCode=HHC |date=March 24, 2012 }}.</ref> was published in 1958 by [[Prentice Hall]]. In 1966, Hilton was succeeded as [[president (corporate title)|president]] by his son [[Barron Hilton|Barron]] and was elected [[chairman of the board]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1925, Hilton married Mary Adelaide Barron (1906\u20131966). They had three children: [[Conrad Hilton Jr.|Conrad Nicholson \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr.]], [[Barron Hilton|William Barron Hilton]], and [[Eric Hilton|Eric Michael Hilton]], before divorcing in 1934.\n\nIn 1942, Hilton married actress [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. They had one child: [[Constance Francesca Hilton]], before divorcing in 1947. Gabor wrote in her 1991 autobiography ''One Lifetime is Not Enough'' that she only became pregnant by Hilton after he raped her during their marriage.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/10/zsazsa200710?currentPage=2 Review of Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography].</ref> Their daughter Constance died on January 5, 2015, at age 67, from a stroke.\n\nIn 1976, Hilton married Mary Frances Kelly. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1979. Mary Hilton died in 2006, at the age of 90.\n\n===Hilton family fortune===\nOn January 3, 1979, Hilton died of natural causes at the age of 91. He is interred at Calvary Hill Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He left $500,000 to his two surviving siblings, $100,000 to his daughter Francesca, and $10,000 to each of his nieces and nephews.  The bulk of his estate was left to the [[Conrad N.

He attended the [[New Mexico Military Institute|Goss Military Academy]] (since renamed as the New Mexico Military Institute) and St. Michael's College (now [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]), and the New Mexico School of Mines (now [[New Mexico Tech]], Socorro, NM). He was a member of the international fraternity [https://www.tke.org/chapter/139/alpha-omicron [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] \u2013 Alpha Omicron Chapter]. In his early twenties, Hilton was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] representative in the first [[New Mexico Legislature]], when the state was newly formed. He served two years in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War I]].  While Conrad was in France with the army after the war, his father was killed in a car accident.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Be My Guest\" by Conrad Hilton, copyright 1958 by the Prentice Hall Press</ref>\n\nThe most enduring influence to shape Hilton's philanthropic philosophy beyond that of his parents was the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and his sisters. He credited his mother with guiding him to prayer and the church whenever he was troubled or dismayed\u2014from the boyhood loss of a beloved pony to severe financial losses during the [[Great Depression]]. His mother continually told him that prayer was the best investment he would ever make.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n==Career==\nAs a young boy, Hilton developed entrepreneurial skills working at his father's general store in [[Socorro County]], [[New Mexico]], which was partially converted into a 10-room hotel.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhi39 ''The Handbook of Texas Online'' (Texas State Historical Association)].</ref><ref>[https://theoutline.com/post/1073/hilton-never-ending-quest-to-build-a-hotel-in-space ''The never-ending quest to build a hotel in space''].</ref> This was followed by varied experiences, including a stint as a representative in New Mexico's first State Legislature and a career decision to become a banker.\n\nIt was with the intention of buying a bank that he arrived in Texas at the height of the oil boom. He bought his first hotel instead, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in [[Cisco, Texas]], in 1919,<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\"/> when a bank purchase fell through. The hotel did such brisk business that rooms changed hands as often as three times a day, and the dining room was converted into additional rooms to meet the demand.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"bigspring\">Associated Press. \"Modest Inn at Cisco Began Hotel String of Conrad Hilton,\" ''Big Spring Daily Herald'', November 21, 1963, p. 12-A.</ref>\n\nHe went on to buy and build hotels throughout Texas, including the highrise [[Dallas Hilton]], opened in 1925; the Abilene Hilton in 1927; Waco Hilton in 1928; and [[Plaza Hotel (El Paso)|El Paso Hilton]] in 1930. The first hotel outside of Texas that Hilton built was in 1939 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Today it is known as the [[Andaluz Hotel|Hotel Andaluz]]. During the [[Great Depression]], Hilton was nearly forced into [[bankruptcy]] and lost several of his hotels. Nevertheless, he was retained as manager of a combined chain, and eventually regained control of his remaining eight hotels.\n\nOver the next decade, he expanded west to California and east to Chicago and New York, crowning his expansions with such acquisitions as the [[Stevens Hotel]] in Chicago (then the world's largest hotel, it was renamed the Conrad Hilton), and the fabled [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in New York. He formed the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] in 1946, and [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton International Company]] in 1948.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Hilton Hotels' worldwide expansion facilitated both American tourism and overseas business by American corporations. It was the world's first international hotel chain, at the same time establishing a certain worldwide standard for hotel accommodations. In 1954, Hilton Hotels bought The Hotels Statler Company, Inc., for $111 million, then the world's largest real estate transaction. In all, Hilton eventually owned 188 hotels in 38 cities in the U.S., including the [[Mayflower Hotel]] in Washington, DC, the [[Palmer House]] in Chicago, and the [[Plaza Hotel]] and Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, along with fifty-four hotels abroad. He later purchased the [[Carte Blanche (credit card)|Carte Blanche]] Credit Company and an interest in the American Crystal Sugar Company, as well as other enterprises.\n\nHilton received honorary degrees from the [[University of Detroit]] (1953), [[DePaul University]] (1954), [[Barat College]] (1955), [[Adelphi College]] (1957), [[Sophia University]], Tokyo (1963), and the [[University of Albuquerque]] (1975).

In 1966, Hilton was succeeded as [[president (corporate title)|president]] by his son [[Barron Hilton|Barron]] and was elected [[chairman of the board]].\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1925, Hilton married Mary Adelaide Barron (1906\u20131966). They had three children: [[Conrad Hilton Jr.|Conrad Nicholson \"Nicky\" Hilton Jr.]], [[Barron Hilton|William Barron Hilton]], and [[Eric Hilton|Eric Michael Hilton]], before divorcing in 1934.\n\nIn 1942, Hilton married actress [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]. They had one child: [[Constance Francesca Hilton]], before divorcing in 1947. Gabor wrote in her 1991 autobiography ''One Lifetime is Not Enough'' that she only became pregnant by Hilton after he raped her during their marriage.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/10/zsazsa200710?currentPage=2 Review of Zsa Zsa Gabor's autobiography].</ref> Their daughter Constance died on January 5, 2015, at age 67, from a stroke.\n\nIn 1976, Hilton married Mary Frances Kelly. Their marriage lasted until his death in 1979. Mary Hilton died in 2006, at the age of 90.\n\n===Hilton family fortune===\nOn January 3, 1979, Hilton died of natural causes at the age of 91. He is interred at Calvary Hill Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He left $500,000 to his two surviving siblings, $100,000 to his daughter Francesca, and $10,000 to each of his nieces and nephews.  The bulk of his estate was left to the [[Conrad N.
