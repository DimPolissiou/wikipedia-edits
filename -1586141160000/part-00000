It was renamed as Chubu University in 1984, and has been subsequently expanded to comprise seven schools and six graduate schools, with about 11,000 students and twenty research institutions.\n\n==Location==\nIt is located on a hill with full of green trees in City of Kasugai neighboring in the north of City of Nagoya with the population of 2.3 million, the central city of Chubu (meaning Central Japan). There are Japanese major industries such as automobile industry including Toyota and Honda, aerospace industry including Heavy Industries of Mitsubishi and Kawasaki as well as small high skill manufacturers producing one-third of parts of Boeing jets and Mitsubishi Regional Jet, textile industry including Toray producing carbon fiber. Chubu University has strong connections with these big and small industries.\n\n==Sustainability sciences==\nWhilst, Chubu University has promoted sustainability sciences including certified as a Regional Center of UNESCO ESD (Education for Sustainable Development), and the connections with NASA in digital earth research, with Club of Rome and United Nations Center for Regional Development in global critical issues, SDGs and quality of life and with JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) in smart transport and city planning in developing countries.\n\n==Distinguished scholars and their research==\nChancellor Atsuo Iiyoshi, the plasma physicist, was the leader of Japan team in international competition in nuclear fusion method in 80\u2019s and President of National Institute for Fusion Science. President Osamu Ishihara, also plasma physicist, has experienced to teach in US for 25 years and Life fellow of IEEE. Okitsugu Yamashita, Ex President, is an entomologist and received prizes such as Louis Pasteur Prize.\n\nInstitute of Science and technology are gathering eminent researchers including Hisashi Yamamoto (Catalyst Chemistry, President of Japan Society of Chemistry, awarded including Japan Academy Prize, Roger Adams Prize), Mitsuo Sawamoto (Molecule Chemistry, awarded including Benjamin Franklin Medal) and Yoshitsugu Hayashi (Sustainable and Well-being City, Full Member of Club of Rome, President of World Conference on Transport Research Society).\n\nChubu Institute for Advanced Studies has also excellent researchers including Takaho Ando (History of Philosophy, awarded Japan Academy Prize), Hiromichi Fukui (Digital Earth) and Kimitaka Kawamura (Atmospheric Chemistry, awards including Geochemical Society Geochemical Fellow).\n\nCenter for Applied Superconductivity and Sustainable Energy Research directed by Sakutaro Yamaguchi has achieved the world top performance in electricity transmission, i.e. 1 million kw by a coil only in 5&nbsp;cm diameter covered by a 30&nbsp;cm pipe for cooling at minus 196 degrees in Celsius. This technology will bring a revolution in electricity transmission by replacing huge infrastructure of several 100m high pylons by a pipe in 30&nbsp;cm diameter. Electric companies in Europe and Asia have much interest in it.\n\n==Visiting Scholars==\nChubu University gathers eminent visiting professors including Koichiro Matsuura (Emeritus Member of Club of Rome, Ex Secretary General of UNESCO), Alexander Likhotal (Full Member of Club of Rome, Ex.President of Green Cross International, Spokesman under President Gorbachev of Soviet Union), Timothy Foresman (Principal Researcher for Digital Earth Project under Vice-President Al Gore), etc.\n\n==Outreaching activities to local society==\nOutreach activities of the university are extended to local society very actively. A competitive fund was awarded for the revitalization of Kozoji New Town, which was constructed as one of the big new towns built in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka metropolitan areas in 1970\u2019s and has been recently declining due to the aging of inhabitants. Cultural events such as Chubu University Music Festival, Adult College, and Kids Seminar are popular among the local citizens.\n\n==Sports==\nChubu University is active also in sport, particularly in handball, Kendo and baseball, of which teams have been always selected to Japanese university championship. The Handball club became the Champion in 2014. Also, professional baseball players have been produced. It has excellent sports facilities including all-weather 400m x 6 lane track, 4-story Budo (Kendo, Judo) arena, one of the best among Japanese universities.\n\n==International Affiliations==\nChubu University has 44 international affiliations as listed below. Amongst them, 40 years long special cooperation with Ohio University since 1977 is worthy of special mention. PASEO (Preparation for Academic Study in English Overseas) in Chubu University was originally started in 1991 in which lecturers sent by Ohio University are teaching. Student exchange has counted several hundred during 40 years.

The [[Catholic Church]] became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Rome]]. A news story and police investigation show the three members of the clergy whom she murdered. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her.\n\nTwenty years later, Isabella is in the process of filming a documentary with filmmaker Michael Schaefer about exorcisms and, to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome. She meets two priests, Ben Rawlings and David Keane, before going to see her mother Maria in the asylum. She finds that her mother speaks in different accents and has paintings all over the walls. Maria then soils herself while screaming in an unidentified language. She has inverted crosses carved into her arms and her bottom lip and tells Isabella that killing a child is against God's will. Isabella tells the priests that she had an abortion years ago and her mother had no way of knowing that\u2014another sign that showed possible possession. David and Ben take her with them on an unsanctioned exorcism performed on Rosalita, a young woman. They bring medical equipment to determine if it is possession or mental illness. Rosalita calls Isabella by her name, despite not knowing her, and attacks the crew after spouting out obscene remarks in different languages and accents. Eventually, they get her under control.\n\nAs the crew discusses performing an exorcism and analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. They persuade him to aid in the process. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past and transfers demons to David and Isabella. The process is stopped by hospital workers and is unsuccessful.\n\nAfter analyzing the data from the video and audio files, they present the evidence to the Church. David shows many signs of stress, as Ben repeatedly plays the audio files. Ben finds that there are four different demons speaking in unison. David is to perform a [[baptism]] at his church, which Michael tags along to record. When he holds the baby to start the [[immersion baptism]], he mutters some lines from the [[Bible]] and starts forcefully submerging the baby in the holy water. The crowd rushes up to save the baby as he passes out.\n\nSoon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and David acquires an officer's handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]], and forgets the last few words. He laughs and shoots himself. Isabella begins having a seizure.\n\nBen hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. Ben and Michael leave with Isabella in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She tries to strangle Michael and breathes into his mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, unbuckling his seatbelt and accelerating into oncoming traffic. The car collides, and the corpses of Michael and Ben sit in the overturned car while Isabella is not visible.\n\nA title card is shown informing that the case of the Rossi family is still unresolved, followed by another title card directing viewers to a website \"for more information on the ongoing investigation\".{{efn|The website displayed, {{url|therossifiles.com}}, is defunct as of March 10, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rossi Files - 404 Not Found |url=http://therossifiles.com/site |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310052637/therossifiles.com/site |archivedate=March 10, 2013}}</ref> An archived version of the site as it appeared on the film's U.S. release date of January 6, 2012, is still available through the [[Wayback Machine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=the rossi files - be part of the ongoing investigation |url=http://therossifiles.com/site |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106214200/therossifiles.com/site |archivedate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Fernanda Andrade]] as Isabella Rossi\n* [[Simon Quarterman]] as Father Ben Rawlings\n* [[Evan Helmuth]] as Father David Keane\n* Ionut Grama as Michael Schaefer\n* [[Suzan Crowley]] as Maria Rossi\n* [[Bonnie Morgan]] as Rosalita\n* Brian Johnson as Lieutenant Dreyfus\n* Preston James Hillier as Male Reporter\n* D.T.

Rosalita calls Isabella by her name, despite not knowing her, and attacks the crew after spouting out obscene remarks in different languages and accents. Eventually, they get her under control.\n\nAs the crew discusses performing an exorcism and analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. They persuade him to aid in the process. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past and transfers demons to David and Isabella. The process is stopped by hospital workers and is unsuccessful.\n\nAfter analyzing the data from the video and audio files, they present the evidence to the Church. David shows many signs of stress, as Ben repeatedly plays the audio files. Ben finds that there are four different demons speaking in unison. David is to perform a [[baptism]] at his church, which Michael tags along to record. When he holds the baby to start the [[immersion baptism]], he mutters some lines from the [[Bible]] and starts forcefully submerging the baby in the holy water. The crowd rushes up to save the baby as he passes out.\n\nSoon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and David acquires an officer's handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]], and forgets the last few words. He laughs and shoots himself. Isabella begins having a seizure.\n\nBen hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. Ben and Michael leave with Isabella in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She tries to strangle Michael and breathes into his mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, unbuckling his seatbelt and accelerating into oncoming traffic. The car collides, and the corpses of Michael and Ben sit in the overturned car while Isabella is not visible.\n\nA title card is shown informing that the case of the Rossi family is still unresolved, followed by another title card directing viewers to a website \"for more information on the ongoing investigation\".{{efn|The website displayed, {{url|therossifiles.com}}, is defunct as of March 10, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rossi Files - 404 Not Found |url=http://therossifiles.com/site |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |accessdate=September 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310052637/therossifiles.com/site |archivedate=March 10, 2013}}</ref> An archived version of the site as it appeared on the film's U.S. release date of January 6, 2012, is still available through the [[Wayback Machine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=the rossi files - be part of the ongoing investigation |url=http://therossifiles.com/site |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106214200/therossifiles.com/site |archivedate=January 6, 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Fernanda Andrade]] as Isabella Rossi\n* [[Simon Quarterman]] as Father Ben Rawlings\n* [[Evan Helmuth]] as Father David Keane\n* Ionut Grama as Michael Schaefer\n* [[Suzan Crowley]] as Maria Rossi\n* [[Bonnie Morgan]] as Rosalita\n* Brian Johnson as Lieutenant Dreyfus\n* Preston James Hillier as Male Reporter\n* D.T.

He headed the [[Inserm]] 176/CNRS \"Neurobiology of Behaviours\" unit at the Bordeaux University Hospital (1978-1990) before taking over as Director of the Alfred-Fessart Institute in [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] from 1992 to 2003.

He has a much more pessimistic vision than his colleague [[Boris Cyrulnik]] about what predetermines human behaviour and believes in the primacy of the biological over reason, stating in 2013 in the film ''La Possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre humain'' : \"''L'homme est libre, ouis mais, en libert\u00e9 surveill\u00e9e''\".\n\nHe has published numerous books with biologizing thesis, Biologie des passions, La Chair et le diable.<ref>S\u00e9bastien Lemerle, \u00ab Les habits neufs du biologisme en France \u00bb, ''Actes de la recherche en sciences sociale'', <abbr>n<sup>os</sup></abbr> 176-177, 2009, <abbr>p.</abbr> 75</ref> In Biologie des passions, he defends a dynamic above all sexual dynamics of love (Eros). He lists the sexual practices that are omnipresent in nature (even the most \"deviant\"), and suggests that the notion of women's property was born during the sedentarization of the [[Neolithic era]]. It also details the complexity of sexual systems, which are often designed to frame the reproductive rules of each species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Didier Vincent: \"Baisez et tout ira mieux\"|url=http://www.sinemensuel.com/interview/jean-didier-vincent-baisez-et-tout-ira-mieux/|website=Sinemensuel.com|date=July 2015|access-date=21 January 2016|publication-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Bienvenue en Transhumanie'', he takes a sceptical look at [[transhumanism]], denouncing a lack of morality that is necessary around this radical transformation of the [[genome]].

He headed the [[Inserm]] 176/CNRS \"Neurobiology of Behaviours\" unit at the Bordeaux University Hospital (1978-1990) before taking over as Director of the Alfred-Fessart Institute in [[Gif-sur-Yvette]] from 1992 to 2003.

He has a much more pessimistic vision than his colleague [[Boris Cyrulnik]] about what predetermines human behaviour and believes in the primacy of the biological over reason, stating in 2013 in the film ''La Possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre humain'' : \"''L'homme est libre, ouis mais, en libert\u00e9 surveill\u00e9e''\".\n\nHe has published numerous books with biologizing thesis, Biologie des passions, La Chair et le diable.<ref>S\u00e9bastien Lemerle, \u00ab Les habits neufs du biologisme en France \u00bb, ''Actes de la recherche en sciences sociale'', <abbr>n<sup>os</sup></abbr> 176-177, 2009, <abbr>p.</abbr> 75</ref> In Biologie des passions, he defends a dynamic above all sexual dynamics of love (Eros). He lists the sexual practices that are omnipresent in nature (even the most \"deviant\"), and suggests that the notion of women's property was born during the sedentarization of the [[Neolithic era]]. It also details the complexity of sexual systems, which are often designed to frame the reproductive rules of each species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jean-Didier Vincent: \"Baisez et tout ira mieux\"|url=http://www.sinemensuel.com/interview/jean-didier-vincent-baisez-et-tout-ira-mieux/|website=Sinemensuel.com|date=July 2015|access-date=21 January 2016|publication-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Bienvenue en Transhumanie'', he takes a sceptical look at [[transhumanism]], denouncing a lack of morality that is necessary around this radical transformation of the [[genome]].

Latakia was subsequently ruled by the [[Roman empire|Romans]], then the [[Ummayad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s in the 8th\u201310th centuries of the Christian era. Under their rule, the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]] frequently attacked the city, periodically recapturing it before losing it again to the Arabs, particularly the [[Fatimid]]s. Afterward, Latakia was ruled successively by the [[Seljuk Turks]], [[Crusades|Crusaders]], [[Ayyubid]]s, [[Mamluk]]s, and the [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]]. Following [[World War I]], Latakia was assigned to the [[French mandate of Syria]], in which it served as the capital of the autonomous territory of the [[Alawite]]s. This autonomous territory became the [[Alawite State]] in 1922, proclaiming its independence a number of times until reintegrating into Syria in 1944.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Distinguish|Laodicea ad Lycum}}\nLike many [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] cities, Latakia was named after a member of the ruling dynasty.<ref name=\"le Strange380\"/> First named ''Laodikeia on the Coast'' ({{Lang-el|\u039b\u03b1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f21 \u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}) by [[Seleucus I Nicator]] in honor of his mother, [[Laodice of Macedonia|Laodice]].

The Byzantine Empire recaptured the city in 970 by [[John I Tzimiskes]], but it was lost to the [[Fatimids]] in 980. The [[Banu Munqidh]] managed to control the city until they were succeeded by the [[Seljuks]] during the reign of [[Malik-Shah I]], after their wars against the [[Buyid dynasty]] in 1086, despite a brief Byzantine control in 1074. Later on, [[Guynemer of Boulogne]] raided the city on 19 August 1097, with 28 ships coming from [[Cyprus]] during the [[First Crusade]]. In 1098, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond of Saint-Gilles]] captured the city, with the Byzantine fleet presence; hence, the city became contested between the crusaders and the Byzantines who controlled Latakia and [[Baniyas]] in the meantime.{{sfn|La Boda|1994|p=453}}\n\nAfter failed efforts by [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] to capture Latakia from the Byzantine Empire in 1099, and a brief control of the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fleet in 1101, the city was taken in 1103 by forces under the command of [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred of Hauteville]], a veteran of the First Crusade and acting regent of the [[Principality of Antioch]].<ref>Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land, (London: Simon & Schuster, 2010), pp.137\u2013138.</ref> Following the defeat of Antiochene forces at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104, the city was reoccupied by the Byzantines led by Admiral [[Cantacuzenus]], however they would again lose the city. Despite a treaty in 1108 with Bohemond promising to return Latakia to the Empire by 1110 it was firmly under the control of the Principality of Antioch,<ref>Thomas Asbridge, The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land, (London: Simon & Schuster, 2010), pp.137\u2013144.</ref> as it was called \"La Liche\". In 1126, the cities of Latakia and [[Jabala]] were the dowry of Princess [[Alice of Antioch|Alice]], daughter of King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]], who later donated a house in Latakia to the [[Knights Hospitaller]], which became their main base in the region. In April 1136, the city was sacked by Emir Sawar ibn Aytakin, governor of [[Aleppo]], then it was struck by the [[1157 Hama earthquake|1157 Hama earthquake]] and the [[1170 Syria earthquake]].{{sfn|La Boda|1994|p=453}} \n\nThis situation remained the same with the city serving as the primary port for the Principality until after the loss of Antioch itself to the [[Ayyubids]], under the rule of [[Saladin]] on 23 July 1188.

The landlords in the countryside tended to be Sunni and Orthodox Christians, while the peasants were mostly Alawi. Like the [[Druze]]s, who also had a special status before the end of World War I, the Alawis had a strained relationship with the Ottoman overlords.

Whatsoever, the French justified the creation of the Alawite state by citing the \"backwardness\" of the mountain-dwellers, religiously distinct from the surrounding Sunni population, and claimed that the division intended to protect the Alawi people from more-powerful majorities.<ref name= \"L\">Longrigg, Stephen Hemsley. \"Syria and Lebanon Under French Mandate.\" London: Oxford University Press, 1958.</ref>\n[[File:Stamp Alaouites 1926 10pi air.jpg|thumb|left|A 10-piastre stamp of Syria used in the Alawite State]]\nThe division the French administration created in Syria didn't stop Alawites such as [[Sheikh Saleh al-Ali]], who led the [[Syrian Revolt of 1919]], to continue and protest French rule. Saleh al-Ali coordinated with the leaders of other anti-French revolts in the country, including the revolt of [[Ibrahim Hananu]] in the Aleppo countryside and [[Subhi Barakat]]'s revolt in Antioch, but Saleh al-Ali's revolt was put down in 1921, and a French court-martial in Latakia sentenced Shaykh Saleh to death in absentia, and offered a reward of 100,000 francs for information on his whereabouts. After the French gave up trying to capturing Shaykh Saleh, a pardon was issued by General [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]].\n\nThe state became part of the Syrian Federation in 1922, but left the federation again in 1924. In 1930 the Alawite State was renamed as the Government of Latakia, the only concession by the French to Arab nationalists until 1936. On 3 December 1936 (becoming effective in 1937), the Alawite state was re-incorporated into Syria as a concession by the French to the [[National Bloc (Syria)|Nationalist Bloc]] (the ruling party of the semi-autonomous Syrian government).<ref>Shambrook, Peter A. \"French Imperialism in Syria, 1927\u20131936.\" Reading: Ithaca Press, 1998.</ref>\n\nThere was a great deal of Alawite separatist sentiment in the region, but their political views could not be coordinated into a unified voice. There was also a great deal of factionalism amongst the Alawite tribes, and the Alawite State was incorporated into Syria with little organised resistance.\n\nIn 1942, the Latakia and Druze regions were returned to Syrian control, and by 1946, the French completely left Syria and a new independent government was created.\n\n===Modern era===\n[[File:Lattakia 1970.jpg|thumb|Latakia in 1970.]]\nAll but a few classical buildings have been destroyed, often by earthquakes; those remaining include a Roman triumphal arch and [[Corinthian column]]s known as the Colonnade of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> However, important remains from the city at Roman and Hellenistic periods including full body statues, Roman funerary art, and column capitals that once belonged to the ancient city, are found in its national museum.\n\nAn extensive port project was proposed in 1948, and construction work began on the [[Port of Latakia]] in 1950, aided by a [[United States dollar|US$]]6&nbsp;million loan from [[Saudi Arabia]].

Latakia was subsequently ruled by the [[Roman empire|Romans]], then the [[Ummayad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s in the 8th\u201310th centuries of the Christian era. Under their rule, the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]] frequently attacked the city, periodically recapturing it before losing it again to the Arabs, particularly the [[Fatimid]]s. Afterward, Latakia was ruled successively by the [[Seljuk Turks]], [[Crusades|Crusaders]], [[Ayyubid]]s, [[Mamluk]]s, and the [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]]. Following [[World War I]], Latakia was assigned to the [[French mandate of Syria]], in which it served as the capital of the autonomous territory of the [[Alawite]]s.

Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious [[ninja]] family, and one of the most powerful, allied with {{nihongo|Konohagakure|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc||English version: \"Hidden Leaf Village\"}}. Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, [[Itachi Uchiha]], before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Sakura Haruno]], Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]. Sasuke appears in several of the series' [[Naruto#Films|animated feature films]] and related media, including [[List of Naruto video games|video games]], [[Naruto#Original video animations|original video animations]] ([[original video animations|OVAs]]), and ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' (2015) and its manga [[sequel]], ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' (2016), in which he is depicted as a [[vigilante]] supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto's son [[Boruto Uzumaki]].\n\nKishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark [[character arc|character development]] later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by [[Noriaki Sugiyama]] in Japanese and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in English.\n\nSasuke's character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with Naruto Uzumaki received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in the mold of similar characters from other [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] and as exhibiting a cold personality. Nevertheless, Sasuke's characterization in latter parts of the story and more mature personality in the ''Boruto'' sequels earned further positive comments.

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from [[CyberConnect2]], the video game development studio who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''.

The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact.

Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, [[Itachi Uchiha]], before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Sakura Haruno]], Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]. Sasuke appears in several of the series' [[Naruto#Films|animated feature films]] and related media, including [[List of Naruto video games|video games]], [[Naruto#Original video animations|original video animations]] ([[original video animations|OVAs]]), and ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' (2015) and its manga [[sequel]], ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' (2016), in which he is depicted as a [[vigilante]] supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto's son [[Boruto Uzumaki]].\n\nKishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark [[character arc|character development]] later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by [[Noriaki Sugiyama]] in Japanese and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in English.\n\nSasuke's character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with Naruto Uzumaki received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in the mold of similar characters from other [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] and as exhibiting a cold personality. Nevertheless, Sasuke's characterization in latter parts of the story and more mature personality in the ''Boruto'' sequels earned further positive comments. Sasuke has also placed highly in ''Naruto'' reader popularity polls and has also been the subject of studies by scholars. Character-based merchandise, including [[action figure]]s and [[Keychain|key chains]], has been released.\n\n=={{anchor|Creation and conception}}Creation==\n===Development===\n[[Manga]] artist [[Masashi Kishimoto]] did not include Sasuke Uchiha in his original concept for the ''[[Naruto]]'' series, a story revolving around the character [[Naruto Uzumaki]].

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from [[CyberConnect2]], the video game development studio who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight look realistic, giving Sasuke a scary look as well as hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact. The staff noted that following this fight, Sasuke's face became calmer despite his initial look, giving room to explore his redemption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pierrot2.com/naruto/2016/10/03/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%90%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%8F%E8%A9%B1/|title=\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u88cf\u8a71|publisher=Pierrot|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nKishimoto found Sasuke a difficult character to write, requiring considerable planning.

He was held in the custody of the same jailer, [[B\u00e9nigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars]], for a period of 34 years. He died on 19 November 1703 under the name Marchioly, during the reign of King [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715). \n\nBecause no one ever saw his face because it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, the true identity of the prisoner remains a mystery; it has been extensively debated by historians, and various theories have been expounded in numerous books and films.\n\nAmong the leading theories are those proposed by writer and philosopher [[Voltaire]]: He claimed in the second edition of his ''Questions sur l'Encyclop\u00e9die'' (1771) that the prisoner wore a mask made of iron rather than of cloth, and that he was the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. What little is known about the historical Man in the Iron Mask is based mainly on correspondence between Saint-Mars and his superiors in Paris. Recent research suggests that his name might have been Eustache Dauger, a man who was involved in several political scandals of the late 17th century, but this assertion has not been proven.\n\nThe [[National Archives of France]] has made available online the original data relating to the inventories of the goods and papers of Saint-Mars (one inventory, of 64 pages, was drawn up at the [[Bastille]] in 1708; the other, of 68 pages, at the [[citadel of Sainte-Marguerite]] in 1691). These documents had been sought in vain for more than a century and were thought to have been lost. They were discovered in 2015, among the 100 million documents of the {{ill|Minutier central des notaires de Paris|fr}}.<ref>Archives nationales de France: salle des inventaires, Archives nationales (accessed 23 January 2017).</ref><ref>Analyse et photographies des documents d\u00e9couverts, https://sergearoles-documents-archives.com/ [archive] (accessed 23 January 2017).</ref> They show that some of the 800 documents in the possession of the jailer Saint-Mars were analysed after his death. These documents confirm the reputed avarice of Saint-Mars, who appears to have diverted the funds paid by the king for the prisoner. They also give a description of a cell occupied by the masked prisoner, which contained only a sleeping mat, but no luxuries, as was previously thought. \n\nWith the scientific support of the [[National Library of France]] collections of ancient textiles, the accuracy of these notary documents discovered in 2015 has allowed the creation of the first virtual reconstruction of the prison of the man in the iron mask.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twincities.com/2010/11/26/bastille-prison-had-5-star-comforts-research-shows/ |title=Bastille prison had 5-star comforts, research shows|publisher=Twin Cities Pioneer Press |date= 2010-11-06|accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask has also appeared in many works of fiction, most prominently in the late 1840s by [[Alexandre Dumas]]. A section of his novel ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]'', the final installment of his [[D'Artagnan Romances|D'Artagnan saga]], features the Man in the Iron Mask. Here the prisoner is forced to wear an iron mask and is portrayed as Louis XIV's identical twin.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\" /> Dumas also presented a review of the popular theories about the prisoner extant in his time in the chapter \"L'homme au masque de fer\" in the sixth volume of his non-fiction ''Crimes C\u00e9l\u00e8bres''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/crimesclbres02dumagoog |title=Crimes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres : Alexandre Dumas : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Prisoner==\n===Arrest and imprisonment===\nThe earliest surviving records of the masked prisoner are from late July 1669, when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s minister, the [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Marquis de Louvois]], sent a letter to [[B\u00e9nigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars]], governor of the prison of Pignerol, which at the time was part of France. In his letter, Louvois informed Saint-Mars that a prisoner named \"Eustache Dauger\" was due to arrive in the next month or so.\n[[File:Pinerolo 001.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The town of [[Pinerolo]], previously Pignerol, in Piedmont, Italy.]]\n\nLouis XIV instructed Saint-Mars to prepare a cell with multiple doors, one closing upon the other, which were to prevent anyone from the outside listening in. Saint-Mars was to see Dauger only once a day to provide food and whatever else he needed. Dauger was to be told that if he, Dauger, spoke of anything other than his immediate needs he would be killed, but, according to Louvois, the prisoner should not require much since he was \"only a valet\".\n\nHistorians have noted that the name Eustache Dauger was written in a handwriting different from that used in the rest of the letter's text, suggesting that a clerk wrote the letter under Louvois' dictation, while someone else, very likely Louvois, added the name afterward.\n\nDauger was arrested by Captain Alexandre de Vauroy, garrison commander of [[Dunkirk]], and taken to Pignerol, where he arrived in late August. Evidence has been produced to suggest that the arrest was actually made in [[Calais]] and that not even the local governor was informed of the event \u2013 Vauroy's absence being explained away by his hunting for Spanish soldiers who had strayed into France via the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\nThe first rumours of the prisoner's identity (specifically as a [[Marshal of France]]) began to circulate at this point.\n\n===Masked man serves as a valet===\n[[File:La masque de fer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Illustration, c. 1872]]\n[[File:Masque de fer selon Warin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''L'Homme au masque de fer'', by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin]]]]\nThe prison at Pignerol, like the others at which Dauger was later held, was used for men who were considered an embarrassment to the state and usually held only a handful of prisoners at a time.\n\nSaint-Mars' other prisoners at Pignerol included Count [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]], an Italian diplomat who had been kidnapped and jailed for double-crossing the French over the purchase of the important fortress town of [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]] on the Italian border. There was [[Nicolas Fouquet]], Marquis of Belle-\u00cele, a former superintendent of finances who had been jailed by Louis XIV on the charge of embezzlement, and the [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Marquis de Lauzun]], who had become engaged to the [[Anne, Duchess of Montpensier|Duchess of Montpensier]], a cousin of the king, without the king's consent. Fouquet's cell was above that of Lauzun.\n\nIn his letters to Louvois, Saint-Mars describes Dauger as a quiet man, giving no trouble, \"disposed to the will of God and to the king\", compared to his other prisoners, who were always complaining, constantly trying to escape, or simply mad.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\nDauger was not always isolated from the other prisoners. Wealthy and important ones usually had manservants; Fouquet for instance was served by a man called La Rivi\u00e8re. These servants, however, would become as much prisoners as their masters and it was thus difficult to find people willing to volunteer for such an occupation. Because La Rivi\u00e8re was often ill, Saint-Mars applied for permission for Dauger to act as servant for Fouquet. In 1675, Louvois gave permission for such an arrangement on condition that he was to serve Fouquet only while La Rivi\u00e8re was unavailable and that he was not to meet anyone else; for instance, if Fouquet and Lauzun were to meet, Dauger was not to be present.\n\nIt is an important point that the man in the mask served as a valet. Fouquet was never expected to be released; thus, meeting Dauger was no great matter, but Lauzun was expected to be set free eventually, and it would have been important not to have him spread rumours of Dauger's existence. Historians have also argued that 17th-century protocol made it unthinkable that a man of royal blood would serve as a manservant, casting some doubt on speculation that Dauger was in some way related to the king.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\">''The Man in the Iron Mask'', [[Timewatch]] TV documentary presented by [[Henry Lincoln]], [[BBC]], 1988</ref>\n\nAfter Fouquet's death in 1680, Saint-Mars discovered a secret hole between Fouquet and Lauzun's cells. He was sure that they had communicated through this hole without detection by him or his guards and thus that Lauzun must have been made aware of Dauger's existence. Louvois instructed Saint-Mars to move Lauzun to Fouquet's cell and to tell him that Dauger and La Rivi\u00e8re had been released.\n\n===Other prisons===\n[[File:Exilles02.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Fortress of Exilles]]]]\n[[File:Lerins-iron mask prison.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]]]]\nLauzun was freed in 1681. Later that same year, Saint-Mars was appointed governor of the prison of the [[Exilles Fort|Exiles Fort]] (now [[Exilles]] in Italy). He went there, taking Dauger and La Rivi\u00e8re with him. La Rivi\u00e8re's death was reported in January 1687; in May, Saint-Mars and Dauger moved to [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite|Sainte-Marguerite]], one of the [[L\u00e9rins Islands]], half a mile offshore from Cannes.\n\nIt was during the journey to Sainte-Marguerite that rumors spread that the prisoner was wearing an iron mask. Again, he was placed in a cell with multiple doors.\n\nOn 18 September 1698, Saint-Mars took up his new post as governor of the [[Bastille]] prison in Paris, bringing Dauger with him. He was placed in a solitary cell in the prefurnished third chamber of the Bertaudi\u00e8re tower. The prison's second-in-command, de Rosarges, was to feed him. Lieutenant du Junca, another officer of the Bastille, noted that the prisoner wore \"a mask of black velvet\".\n\nThe masked prisoner died on 19 November 1703 and was buried the next day under the name of Marchioly.\n\nIn 1711, King Louis's sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine]], sent a letter to her aunt, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], stating that the prisoner had \"two [[musketeers]] at his side to kill him if he removed his mask\". She described him as very devout, and stated that he was well treated and received everything he desired. However, the prisoner had already been dead for eight years by that point and the Princess had not necessarily seen him for herself; rather, she was quite likely reporting rumours she had heard at court.\n\n==Popular interest==\nThe fate of the mysterious prisoner \u2013 and the extent of the apparent precautions his jailers took \u2013 created significant interest in his story and gave birth to many legends. Many theories exist and several books have been written about the case. Some were presented after the existence of the letters was widely known. Still later commentators have presented their own theories, possibly based on embellished versions of the original tale.\n\nTheories about his identity popular during his time included that he was a Marshal of France; the English [[Henry Cromwell]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first= Alexandre|title= Celebrated Crimes|volume= 6|page=[https://archive.org/details/celebratedcrimes06duma/page/2008 2008] |date=1910|url= https://archive.org/details/celebratedcrimes06duma}}</ref> son of [[Oliver Cromwell]]; or [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Beaufort]]. Later, many people such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2751 |title=Gutenberg.org |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-09-22 |accessdate=2018-01-31}}</ref> suggested other theories about the man in the mask.\n\n==Candidates==\n\n===King's relative===\n[[Voltaire]] claimed that the prisoner was a son of [[Anne of Austria]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]], and therefore an illegitimate half-brother of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. However, the sincerity of this claim is uncertain.\n\n==== King's twin brother ====\nIn his history essay ''Le Masque de fer'',<ref name=\"Marcel Pagnol\">{{cite book |title=Le Masque de fer |last=Pagnol |first=Marcel |publisher=\u00c9ditions de Provence |year=1965 |pages=chapters 11 & 12}}</ref> French novelist [[Marcel Pagnol]], supporting his theory in particular on the circumstances of King Louis XIV's birth, claims that the Man in the Iron mask was indeed a twin but born second, and hence the younger, and would have been hidden in order to avoid any dispute over the throne holder.<ref name=\"Marcel Pagnol\"/> {{efn|To make the context clearer, note that at the time there was a controversy over which one of twins was the elder: The one born first, or the one born second, who was then thought to have been conceived first.}}\n\nThe historians who reject this theory (including [[:fr:Jean-Christian Petitfils|Jean-Christian Petitfils]]), highlight the conditions of childbirth for the queen: It usually took place in the presence of multiple witnesses \u2013 the main court's figures. But according to Marcel Pagnol, right after the birth of the future Louis XIV, King Louis XIII took his whole court to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|''Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain'']]'s chapel to celebrate a ''[[Te Deum]]'' in great pomp, contrary to the common practice of celebrating it several days before childbirth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Suppl\u00e9ment au Corps Universel Diplomatique |volume=IV |page=176 |editor=Dumont, Jean |editor-link=Jean Dumont (publicist)}}</ref>\n\nAlso supporting the theory of King Louis XIV's twin, a thorough examination of the French Kings' genealogy shows many twin births, in the [[Capetian dynasty]], as well as in the [[House of Valois]], [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], and the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Yann |last=Kermabon |article=Courrier des lecteurs |title-link=:fr:Historia (revue) |title=Revue Historia |date=October 1998}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Dumas]] explored a similar theory in his book ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'', where the prisoner was instead an identical twin of Louis XIV. This book has served as the basis \u2013 even if loosely adapted \u2013 for many [[The Man in the Iron Mask (film)|film versions]] of the story.\n\nAccording to Marcel Pagnol\u2019s theory, this twin was then born in 1638 and grew up on the Island of [[Jersey]] under the name [[James de la Cloche]]. He would later conspire with [[Roux de Marcilly]] against King Louis XIV, and hypothetically was arrested in Calais in 1669.\n\n==== King's father ====\nHugh Ross Williamson<ref name=\"Williamson2002\">{{cite book|title=Who Was The Man In the Iron Mask? and Other Historical Mysteries|first=Hugh Ross|last=Williamson|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=0-14-139097-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whowasmaninironm00ross}}</ref> argues that the man in the iron mask was the natural father of Louis XIV. According to this theory, the \"miraculous\" birth of Louis XIV in 1638 would have come after [[Louis XIII]] had been estranged from his wife [[Anne of Austria]] for 14 years.\n\nThe theory then suggests that [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the king's minister, had arranged for a substitute, probably an illegitimate son or grandson of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], to become intimate with the queen and father an heir in the king's stead. At the time, the [[heir presumptive]] was Louis XIII's brother [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who was Richelieu's enemy. If Gaston became king, Richelieu would quite likely have lost both his job as minister and his life, and so it was in his best interests to thwart Gaston's ambitions.\n\nSupposedly the substitute father then left for the [[New France|Americas]] but in the 1660s returned to France with the aim of extorting money for keeping his secret, and was promptly imprisoned. This theory would explain the secrecy surrounding the prisoner, whose true identity would have destroyed the legitimacy of Louis XIV's claim to the throne had it been revealed.\n\nThis theory was first disputed by British politician [[Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood]]. He said the idea has no historical basis and is hypothetical. Williamson held that to say it is a guess with no solid historical basis is merely to say that it is like every other theory on the matter, although it makes more sense than any of the other theories. There is no known evidence that is incompatible with it, even the age of the prisoner, which Cecil had considered a weak point; and it explains every aspect of the mystery.<ref name=\"Williamson2002\" />\n\n===French general===\n{{See also|Great Cipher#The Man in the Iron Mask}}\n\nIn 1890, Louis Gendron, a French military historian, came across some coded letters and passed them on to [[\u00c9tienne Bazeries]] in the French Army's cryptographic department. After three years Bazeries managed to read some messages in the [[Great Cipher]] of Louis XIV. One of them referred to a prisoner and identified him as General {{ill|Vivien de Bulonde|fr|Vivien l'Abb\u00e9 de Bulonde}}. One of the letters written by Louvois made specific reference to de Bulonde's crime.\n\nAt the [[Siege of Cuneo (1691)|Siege of Cuneo]] in 1691, Bulonde was concerned about enemy troops arriving from Austria and ordered a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind his munitions and wounded men. Louis XIV was furious and in another of the letters specifically ordered him \"to be conducted to the fortress at Pignerol where he will be locked in a cell and under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlements during the day with a 330 309.\" It has been suggested that the 330 stood for ''masque'' and the 309 for full stop. However, in 17th-century French ''avec un masque'' would mean \"in a mask\".\n\nSome believe that the evidence of the letters means that there is now little need of an alternative explanation for the man in the mask. Other sources, however, claim that Bulonde's arrest was no secret and was actually published in a newspaper at the time and that he was released after just a few months. His death is also recorded as happening in 1709, six years after that of the man in the mask.<ref name=\"Noone\">''The Man Behind the Iron Mask'' by John Noone, 1988 {{ISBN|0750906790}}</ref>\n\n===Valet===\nIn 1801, revolutionary legislator Pierre Roux-Fazillac stated that the tale of the masked prisoner was an amalgamation of the fates of two separate prisoners, [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]] (see below) and an imprisoned valet named \"Eustache d'Auger\".\n\n[[Andrew Lang|Lang]] (1903)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Valet's Tragedy and Other Stories |year=1903 |author-link=Andrew Lang |first=Andrew |last=Lang}}</ref> presented a theory that \"Eustache d'Auger\" was a prison pseudonym of a man called \"Martin\", valet of the [[Huguenot]] [[Roux de Marcilly]]. After his master's execution in 1669 the valet was taken to France, possibly by abduction. A letter from the French Foreign minister has been found rejecting an offer to arrest Martin: He was simply not important.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Man in the Iron Mask |first=Harry |last=Thompson |page=77}}</ref>\n\nNoone (1988)<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Noone |title=The Man behind the Mask |page=272 |year=1988}}</ref> pointed out that the minister was concerned Dauger should not communicate, rather than that his face should be concealed. Later, St. Mars elaborated upon instructions that the prisoner should not be seen during transportation. The idea of keeping d'Auger in a velvet mask was St. Mars' own, to increase his self importance. What d'Auger had seen or done is still a mystery.\n\n===Son of Charles II===\nBarnes (1908)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Man of the Mask |year=1908 |first=Arthur |last=Barnes}}</ref> presents [[James de la Cloche]], the alleged illegitimate son of the reluctant Protestant [[Charles II of England]], who would have been his father's secret intermediary with the Catholic court of France.\n\nOne of Charles's confirmed illegitimate sons, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], has also been proposed as the man in the mask. A Protestant, he led [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] against his uncle, the Catholic [[James II of England|King James II]]. The rebellion failed and Monmouth was executed in 1685. But in 1768, a writer named Saint-Foix claimed that another man was executed in his place and that Monmouth became the masked prisoner, it being in Louis XIV's interests to assist a fellow Catholic like James who would not necessarily want to kill his own nephew. Saint-Foix's case was based on unsubstantiated rumors and allegations that Monmouth's execution was faked.<ref name=\"Noone\"/>\n\n===Italian diplomat===\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2019}}\nAnother candidate, much favored in the 1800s, was Fouquet's fellow prisoner Count [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]] (or Matthioli). He was an Italian diplomat who acted on behalf of debt-ridden [[Charles IV, Duke of Mantua]] in 1678, in selling [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]], a strategic fortified town near the border with France. A French occupation would be unpopular, so discretion was essential, but Mattioli leaked the details to France's Spanish enemies, after pocketing his commission once the sale had been concluded, and they made a bid of their own before the French forces could occupy the town. Mattioli was kidnapped by the French and thrown into nearby Pignerol in April 1679. The French took possession of Casale two years later.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\n[[George Agar Ellis]] reached the conclusion that Mattioli was the state prisoner commonly called The Iron Mask when he reviewed documents extracted from French archives in the 1820s. His book,<ref>George Agar Ellis, The true history of the State Prisoner commonly called the Iron Mask, here identified with Count E.A. Mattioli, extracted from documents in the French archives (London, J. Murray, 1826)</ref> published in English in 1826, was translated into French and published in 1830. German historian Wilhelm Broecking came to the same conclusion independently seventy years later.  [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Chambers Book of Days|Book of Days]]'' supports the claim and places Matthioli in the Bastille for the last 13 years of his life.\n\nSince that time, letters sent by Saint-Mars, which earlier historians missed, indicate that Mattioli was only held at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite and was not at Exilles or the Bastille and, therefore, it is argued that he can be discounted.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\" />\n\n===Eustache Dauger de Cavoye===\nIn his letter to Saint-Mars announcing the imminent arrival of the prisoner who would become the \"man in the iron mask,\" Louvois gave his name as \"Eustache Dauger\" and historians have found evidence that a \"Eustache Dauger\" was living in France at the time and was involved in scandalous and embarrassing events involving people in high places known as [[Affair of the Poisons|l'Affaire des Poisons]]. His full name was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\n====Early life====\nRecords indicate that he was born on 30 August 1637, the son of Fran\u00e7ois Dauger, a captain in [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guards. Fran\u00e7ois was married to Marie de S\u00e9rignan and they had 11 children, nine of whom survived into adulthood. When Fran\u00e7ois and his two eldest sons were killed in battle, Eustache became the nominal head of the family.\n\n====Disgrace====\nIn April 1659, Eustache and Guiche were invited to an Easter weekend party at the castle of Roissy-en-Brie. By all accounts it was a debauched affair of merry-making, with the men involved in all sorts of sordid activities, including attacking a man who claimed to be [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s attorney. It was also claimed,{{By whom|date=July 2010}} among other things, that a [[black mass]] was enacted and that a pig was baptized as carp in order to allow them to eat pork on Good Friday.\n\nWhen news of these events became public, an inquiry was held and the various perpetrators jailed or exiled. There is no record as to what happened to Dauger, but in 1665, near the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], he allegedly killed a young [[Page (occupation)|page boy]] in a drunken brawl involving the Duc de Foix. The two men claimed that they had been provoked by the boy, who was drunk, but the fact that the killing took place near a castle where the king was staying meant that this was not a good enough explanation, and as a result, Dauger was forced to resign his [[Commissioned officers|commission]].\n\nDauger's mother died shortly afterwards. In her will, written a year previously, she passed over her eldest surviving sons Eustache and Armand, leaving the bulk of the estate to their younger brother Louis. Eustache was restricted in the amount of money to which he had access, having built up considerable debts, and left with barely enough for \"food and upkeep\".{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n====Affair of the Poisons====\n{{main|Affair of the Poisons}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}\nIn the 1930s, historian Maurice Duvivier linked Eustache Dauger de Cavoye to the [[Poison affair|Affair of the Poisons]], a notorious scandal of 1677\u20131682 in which people in high places were accused of being involved in [[black mass]] and poisonings. An investigation had been launched, but Louis XIV had instigated a cover-up when it appeared that his mistress [[Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]] was involved.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\nThe records show that during the inquiry the investigators were told about a supplier of poisons, a surgeon named Auger, and Duvivier became convinced that Dauger de Cavoye, disinherited and short of money, had become Auger, the supplier of poisons, and subsequently Dauger, the man in the mask.\n\nIn a letter sent by Louvois to Saint-Mars shortly after Fouquet's death while in prison (with Dauger acting as his valet), the minister adds a note in his own handwriting, asking how Dauger performed certain acts that Saint-Mars had mentioned in a previous correspondence (now lost) and \"how he got the drugs necessary to do so\". Duvivier suggested that Dauger may have poisoned Fouquet as part of a complex power struggle between Louvois and his rival [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]].\n\n====Dauger in prison====\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}\nHowever, evidence has emerged that Dauger de Cavoye actually died in the [[Prison Saint-Lazare]], an asylum run by monks which many families used in order to imprison their \"[[black sheep]]\". Documents have survived indicating that Dauger de Cavoye was held at Saint-Lazare in Paris at about the same time that Dauger, the man in the mask, was taken into custody in Pignerol, hundreds of miles away in the south.\n\nThese include a letter sent to Dauger de Cavoye's sister, the Marquise de Fabr\u00e8gues, dated 20 June 1678, which is filled with self-pity as Eustache complains about his treatment in prison, where he has been held for 10 years, and how he was deceived by their brother Louis and Cl\u00e9rac, their brother-in-law and the manager of Louis' estate. A year later, he wrote a letter to the king, outlining the same complaints and making a similar request for freedom. The best the king would do, however, was to send a letter to the head of Saint-Lazare telling him that \"M. de Cavoye should have communication with no one at all, not even with his sister, unless in your presence or in the presence of one of the priests of the mission\". The letter was signed by the king and Colbert.\n\nA poem written by Louis-Henri de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne, an inmate at the time, indicates that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died as a result of heavy drinking in the late 1680s. Historians consider all this proof enough that he was not involved in any way with the man in the mask.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\" /><ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Literature===\n* [[Alfred de Vigny]], \"The Prison\" (1821),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Prison_(Vigny) |title=La Prison (Vigny) |via=Wikisource |language=fr|publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}</ref> a long poem describing the final events in the life of the Man in the Iron Mask. An aged priest is called to offer the last rites of the Catholic Church to a mysterious prisoner. After an involved process to ensure the prisoner's anonymity, the priest is introduced to the dying prisoner, who is addressed as \"my prince\" by the jailer. The priest realizes in the dim light that the prisoner wears an iron mask, and recalls the tales he heard in his youth. The prisoner rejects the priest's efforts, even after the priest promises that his lifelong incarceration has already opened Heaven to him if he would only embrace God. The prisoner dies without repenting. The priest continues to pray for the man for several hours, and is horrified to see that the corpse continues to wear the mask underneath the shroud, denied release even in death.\n* [[Alexandre Dumas]], ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later#Part Three: ''The Man in the Iron Mask'' (Chapters 181\u2013269)|The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]'' (1847\u20131850), the final section of which is titled ''The Man in the Iron Mask'' (French: {{lang|fr|L'homme au masque de fer}})\n* [[Henry Vizetelly]], ''The Man With the Iron Mask'' (1870)\n* [[Juliette Benzoni]], ''Secret d'etat''\n* Louis-C\u00e9sar, ''Cassandra Palmer'' series\n* [[Algis Budrys]]'s 1958 science-fiction novel ''[[Who?

He was held in the custody of the same jailer, [[B\u00e9nigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars]], for a period of 34 years. He died on 19 November 1703 under the name Marchioly, during the reign of King [[Louis XIV of France]] (1643\u20131715). \n\nBecause no one ever saw his face because it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, the true identity of the prisoner remains a mystery; it has been extensively debated by historians, and various theories have been expounded in numerous books and films.\n\nAmong the leading theories are those proposed by writer and philosopher [[Voltaire]]: He claimed in the second edition of his ''Questions sur l'Encyclop\u00e9die'' (1771) that the prisoner wore a mask made of iron rather than of cloth, and that he was the older, illegitimate brother of Louis XIV. What little is known about the historical Man in the Iron Mask is based mainly on correspondence between Saint-Mars and his superiors in Paris. Recent research suggests that his name might have been Eustache Dauger, a man who was involved in several political scandals of the late 17th century, but this assertion has not been proven.\n\nThe [[National Archives of France]] has made available online the original data relating to the inventories of the goods and papers of Saint-Mars (one inventory, of 64 pages, was drawn up at the [[Bastille]] in 1708; the other, of 68 pages, at the [[citadel of Sainte-Marguerite]] in 1691). These documents had been sought in vain for more than a century and were thought to have been lost. They were discovered in 2015, among the 100 million documents of the {{ill|Minutier central des notaires de Paris|fr}}.<ref>Archives nationales de France: salle des inventaires, Archives nationales (accessed 23 January 2017).</ref><ref>Analyse et photographies des documents d\u00e9couverts, https://sergearoles-documents-archives.com/ [archive] (accessed 23 January 2017).</ref> They show that some of the 800 documents in the possession of the jailer Saint-Mars were analysed after his death. These documents confirm the reputed avarice of Saint-Mars, who appears to have diverted the funds paid by the king for the prisoner. They also give a description of a cell occupied by the masked prisoner, which contained only a sleeping mat, but no luxuries, as was previously thought. \n\nWith the scientific support of the [[National Library of France]] collections of ancient textiles, the accuracy of these notary documents discovered in 2015 has allowed the creation of the first virtual reconstruction of the prison of the man in the iron mask.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twincities.com/2010/11/26/bastille-prison-had-5-star-comforts-research-shows/ |title=Bastille prison had 5-star comforts, research shows|publisher=Twin Cities Pioneer Press |date= 2010-11-06|accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask has also appeared in many works of fiction, most prominently in the late 1840s by [[Alexandre Dumas]]. A section of his novel ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]'', the final installment of his [[D'Artagnan Romances|D'Artagnan saga]], features the Man in the Iron Mask. Here the prisoner is forced to wear an iron mask and is portrayed as Louis XIV's identical twin.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\" /> Dumas also presented a review of the popular theories about the prisoner extant in his time in the chapter \"L'homme au masque de fer\" in the sixth volume of his non-fiction ''Crimes C\u00e9l\u00e8bres''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/crimesclbres02dumagoog |title=Crimes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres : Alexandre Dumas : Free Download & Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==Prisoner==\n===Arrest and imprisonment===\nThe earliest surviving records of the masked prisoner are from late July 1669, when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s minister, the [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Marquis de Louvois]], sent a letter to [[B\u00e9nigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars]], governor of the prison of Pignerol, which at the time was part of France. In his letter, Louvois informed Saint-Mars that a prisoner named \"Eustache Dauger\" was due to arrive in the next month or so.\n[[File:Pinerolo 001.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The town of [[Pinerolo]], previously Pignerol, in Piedmont, Italy.]]\n\nLouis XIV instructed Saint-Mars to prepare a cell with multiple doors, one closing upon the other, which were to prevent anyone from the outside listening in. Saint-Mars was to see Dauger only once a day to provide food and whatever else he needed. Dauger was to be told that if he, Dauger, spoke of anything other than his immediate needs he would be killed, but, according to Louvois, the prisoner should not require much since he was \"only a valet\".\n\nHistorians have noted that the name Eustache Dauger was written in a handwriting different from that used in the rest of the letter's text, suggesting that a clerk wrote the letter under Louvois' dictation, while someone else, very likely Louvois, added the name afterward.\n\nDauger was arrested by Captain Alexandre de Vauroy, garrison commander of [[Dunkirk]], and taken to Pignerol, where he arrived in late August. Evidence has been produced to suggest that the arrest was actually made in [[Calais]] and that not even the local governor was informed of the event \u2013 Vauroy's absence being explained away by his hunting for Spanish soldiers who had strayed into France via the [[Spanish Netherlands]].<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\nThe first rumours of the prisoner's identity (specifically as a [[Marshal of France]]) began to circulate at this point.\n\n===Masked man serves as a valet===\n[[File:La masque de fer.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Illustration, c. 1872]]\n[[File:Masque de fer selon Warin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''L'Homme au masque de fer'', by [[Jean-Joseph Regnault-Warin]]]]\nThe prison at Pignerol, like the others at which Dauger was later held, was used for men who were considered an embarrassment to the state and usually held only a handful of prisoners at a time.\n\nSaint-Mars' other prisoners at Pignerol included Count [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]], an Italian diplomat who had been kidnapped and jailed for double-crossing the French over the purchase of the important fortress town of [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]] on the Italian border. There was [[Nicolas Fouquet]], Marquis of Belle-\u00cele, a former superintendent of finances who had been jailed by Louis XIV on the charge of embezzlement, and the [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Marquis de Lauzun]], who had become engaged to the [[Anne, Duchess of Montpensier|Duchess of Montpensier]], a cousin of the king, without the king's consent. Fouquet's cell was above that of Lauzun.\n\nIn his letters to Louvois, Saint-Mars describes Dauger as a quiet man, giving no trouble, \"disposed to the will of God and to the king\", compared to his other prisoners, who were always complaining, constantly trying to escape, or simply mad.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\nDauger was not always isolated from the other prisoners. Wealthy and important ones usually had manservants; Fouquet for instance was served by a man called La Rivi\u00e8re. These servants, however, would become as much prisoners as their masters and it was thus difficult to find people willing to volunteer for such an occupation. Because La Rivi\u00e8re was often ill, Saint-Mars applied for permission for Dauger to act as servant for Fouquet. In 1675, Louvois gave permission for such an arrangement on condition that he was to serve Fouquet only while La Rivi\u00e8re was unavailable and that he was not to meet anyone else; for instance, if Fouquet and Lauzun were to meet, Dauger was not to be present.\n\nIt is an important point that the man in the mask served as a valet. Fouquet was never expected to be released; thus, meeting Dauger was no great matter, but Lauzun was expected to be set free eventually, and it would have been important not to have him spread rumours of Dauger's existence. Historians have also argued that 17th-century protocol made it unthinkable that a man of royal blood would serve as a manservant, casting some doubt on speculation that Dauger was in some way related to the king.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\">''The Man in the Iron Mask'', [[Timewatch]] TV documentary presented by [[Henry Lincoln]], [[BBC]], 1988</ref>\n\nAfter Fouquet's death in 1680, Saint-Mars discovered a secret hole between Fouquet and Lauzun's cells. He was sure that they had communicated through this hole without detection by him or his guards and thus that Lauzun must have been made aware of Dauger's existence. Louvois instructed Saint-Mars to move Lauzun to Fouquet's cell and to tell him that Dauger and La Rivi\u00e8re had been released.\n\n===Other prisons===\n[[File:Exilles02.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[Fortress of Exilles]]]]\n[[File:Lerins-iron mask prison.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite]]]]\nLauzun was freed in 1681. Later that same year, Saint-Mars was appointed governor of the prison of the [[Exilles Fort|Exiles Fort]] (now [[Exilles]] in Italy). He went there, taking Dauger and La Rivi\u00e8re with him. La Rivi\u00e8re's death was reported in January 1687; in May, Saint-Mars and Dauger moved to [[\u00cele Sainte-Marguerite|Sainte-Marguerite]], one of the [[L\u00e9rins Islands]], half a mile offshore from Cannes.\n\nIt was during the journey to Sainte-Marguerite that rumors spread that the prisoner was wearing an iron mask. Again, he was placed in a cell with multiple doors.\n\nOn 18 September 1698, Saint-Mars took up his new post as governor of the [[Bastille]] prison in Paris, bringing Dauger with him. He was placed in a solitary cell in the prefurnished third chamber of the Bertaudi\u00e8re tower. The prison's second-in-command, de Rosarges, was to feed him. Lieutenant du Junca, another officer of the Bastille, noted that the prisoner wore \"a mask of black velvet\".\n\nThe masked prisoner died on 19 November 1703 and was buried the next day under the name of Marchioly.\n\nIn 1711, King Louis's sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine]], sent a letter to her aunt, [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia, Electress of Hanover]], stating that the prisoner had \"two [[musketeers]] at his side to kill him if he removed his mask\". She described him as very devout, and stated that he was well treated and received everything he desired. However, the prisoner had already been dead for eight years by that point and the Princess had not necessarily seen him for herself; rather, she was quite likely reporting rumours she had heard at court.\n\n==Popular interest==\nThe fate of the mysterious prisoner \u2013 and the extent of the apparent precautions his jailers took \u2013 created significant interest in his story and gave birth to many legends. Many theories exist and several books have been written about the case. Some were presented after the existence of the letters was widely known. Still later commentators have presented their own theories, possibly based on embellished versions of the original tale.\n\nTheories about his identity popular during his time included that he was a Marshal of France; the English [[Henry Cromwell]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Dumas|first= Alexandre|title= Celebrated Crimes|volume= 6|page=[https://archive.org/details/celebratedcrimes06duma/page/2008 2008] |date=1910|url= https://archive.org/details/celebratedcrimes06duma}}</ref> son of [[Oliver Cromwell]]; or [[Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Beaufort]]. Later, many people such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Alexandre Dumas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/2751 |title=Gutenberg.org |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-09-22 |accessdate=2018-01-31}}</ref> suggested other theories about the man in the mask.\n\n==Candidates==\n\n===King's relative===\n[[Voltaire]] claimed that the prisoner was a son of [[Anne of Austria]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]], and therefore an illegitimate half-brother of [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. However, the sincerity of this claim is uncertain.\n\n==== King's twin brother ====\nIn his history essay ''Le Masque de fer'',<ref name=\"Marcel Pagnol\">{{cite book |title=Le Masque de fer |last=Pagnol |first=Marcel |publisher=\u00c9ditions de Provence |year=1965 |pages=chapters 11 & 12}}</ref> French novelist [[Marcel Pagnol]], supporting his theory in particular on the circumstances of King Louis XIV's birth, claims that the Man in the Iron mask was indeed a twin but born second, and hence the younger, and would have been hidden in order to avoid any dispute over the throne holder.<ref name=\"Marcel Pagnol\"/> {{efn|To make the context clearer, note that at the time there was a controversy over which one of twins was the elder: The one born first, or the one born second, who was then thought to have been conceived first.}}\n\nThe historians who reject this theory (including [[:fr:Jean-Christian Petitfils|Jean-Christian Petitfils]]), highlight the conditions of childbirth for the queen: It usually took place in the presence of multiple witnesses \u2013 the main court's figures. But according to Marcel Pagnol, right after the birth of the future Louis XIV, King Louis XIII took his whole court to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|''Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain'']]'s chapel to celebrate a ''[[Te Deum]]'' in great pomp, contrary to the common practice of celebrating it several days before childbirth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Suppl\u00e9ment au Corps Universel Diplomatique |volume=IV |page=176 |editor=Dumont, Jean |editor-link=Jean Dumont (publicist)}}</ref>\n\nAlso supporting the theory of King Louis XIV's twin, a thorough examination of the French Kings' genealogy shows many twin births, in the [[Capetian dynasty]], as well as in the [[House of Valois]], [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], and the [[House of Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Yann |last=Kermabon |article=Courrier des lecteurs |title-link=:fr:Historia (revue) |title=Revue Historia |date=October 1998}}</ref>\n\n[[Alexandre Dumas]] explored a similar theory in his book ''[[The Vicomte de Bragelonne]]'', where the prisoner was instead an identical twin of Louis XIV. This book has served as the basis \u2013 even if loosely adapted \u2013 for many [[The Man in the Iron Mask (film)|film versions]] of the story.\n\nAccording to Marcel Pagnol\u2019s theory, this twin was then born in 1638 and grew up on the Island of [[Jersey]] under the name [[James de la Cloche]]. He would later conspire with [[Roux de Marcilly]] against King Louis XIV, and hypothetically was arrested in Calais in 1669.\n\n==== King's father ====\nHugh Ross Williamson<ref name=\"Williamson2002\">{{cite book|title=Who Was The Man In the Iron Mask? and Other Historical Mysteries|first=Hugh Ross|last=Williamson|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=0-14-139097-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/whowasmaninironm00ross}}</ref> argues that the man in the iron mask was the natural father of Louis XIV. According to this theory, the \"miraculous\" birth of Louis XIV in 1638 would have come after [[Louis XIII]] had been estranged from his wife [[Anne of Austria]] for 14 years.\n\nThe theory then suggests that [[Cardinal Richelieu]], the king's minister, had arranged for a substitute, probably an illegitimate son or grandson of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], to become intimate with the queen and father an heir in the king's stead. At the time, the [[heir presumptive]] was Louis XIII's brother [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], who was Richelieu's enemy. If Gaston became king, Richelieu would quite likely have lost both his job as minister and his life, and so it was in his best interests to thwart Gaston's ambitions.\n\nSupposedly the substitute father then left for the [[New France|Americas]] but in the 1660s returned to France with the aim of extorting money for keeping his secret, and was promptly imprisoned. This theory would explain the secrecy surrounding the prisoner, whose true identity would have destroyed the legitimacy of Louis XIV's claim to the throne had it been revealed.\n\nThis theory was first disputed by British politician [[Hugh Cecil, 1st Baron Quickswood]]. He said the idea has no historical basis and is hypothetical. Williamson held that to say it is a guess with no solid historical basis is merely to say that it is like every other theory on the matter, although it makes more sense than any of the other theories. There is no known evidence that is incompatible with it, even the age of the prisoner, which Cecil had considered a weak point; and it explains every aspect of the mystery.<ref name=\"Williamson2002\" />\n\n===French general===\n{{See also|Great Cipher#The Man in the Iron Mask}}\n\nIn 1890, Louis Gendron, a French military historian, came across some coded letters and passed them on to [[\u00c9tienne Bazeries]] in the French Army's cryptographic department. After three years Bazeries managed to read some messages in the [[Great Cipher]] of Louis XIV. One of them referred to a prisoner and identified him as General {{ill|Vivien de Bulonde|fr|Vivien l'Abb\u00e9 de Bulonde}}. One of the letters written by Louvois made specific reference to de Bulonde's crime.\n\nAt the [[Siege of Cuneo (1691)|Siege of Cuneo]] in 1691, Bulonde was concerned about enemy troops arriving from Austria and ordered a hasty withdrawal, leaving behind his munitions and wounded men. Louis XIV was furious and in another of the letters specifically ordered him \"to be conducted to the fortress at Pignerol where he will be locked in a cell and under guard at night, and permitted to walk the battlements during the day with a 330 309.\" It has been suggested that the 330 stood for ''masque'' and the 309 for full stop. However, in 17th-century French ''avec un masque'' would mean \"in a mask\".\n\nSome believe that the evidence of the letters means that there is now little need of an alternative explanation for the man in the mask. Other sources, however, claim that Bulonde's arrest was no secret and was actually published in a newspaper at the time and that he was released after just a few months. His death is also recorded as happening in 1709, six years after that of the man in the mask.<ref name=\"Noone\">''The Man Behind the Iron Mask'' by John Noone, 1988 {{ISBN|0750906790}}</ref>\n\n===Valet===\nIn 1801, revolutionary legislator Pierre Roux-Fazillac stated that the tale of the masked prisoner was an amalgamation of the fates of two separate prisoners, [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]] (see below) and an imprisoned valet named \"Eustache d'Auger\".\n\n[[Andrew Lang|Lang]] (1903)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Valet's Tragedy and Other Stories |year=1903 |author-link=Andrew Lang |first=Andrew |last=Lang}}</ref> presented a theory that \"Eustache d'Auger\" was a prison pseudonym of a man called \"Martin\", valet of the [[Huguenot]] [[Roux de Marcilly]]. After his master's execution in 1669 the valet was taken to France, possibly by abduction. A letter from the French Foreign minister has been found rejecting an offer to arrest Martin: He was simply not important.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Man in the Iron Mask |first=Harry |last=Thompson |page=77}}</ref>\n\nNoone (1988)<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Noone |title=The Man behind the Mask |page=272 |year=1988}}</ref> pointed out that the minister was concerned Dauger should not communicate, rather than that his face should be concealed. Later, St. Mars elaborated upon instructions that the prisoner should not be seen during transportation. The idea of keeping d'Auger in a velvet mask was St. Mars' own, to increase his self importance. What d'Auger had seen or done is still a mystery.\n\n===Son of Charles II===\nBarnes (1908)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Man of the Mask |year=1908 |first=Arthur |last=Barnes}}</ref> presents [[James de la Cloche]], the alleged illegitimate son of the reluctant Protestant [[Charles II of England]], who would have been his father's secret intermediary with the Catholic court of France.\n\nOne of Charles's confirmed illegitimate sons, the [[James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth|Duke of Monmouth]], has also been proposed as the man in the mask. A Protestant, he led [[Monmouth Rebellion|a rebellion]] against his uncle, the Catholic [[James II of England|King James II]]. The rebellion failed and Monmouth was executed in 1685. But in 1768, a writer named Saint-Foix claimed that another man was executed in his place and that Monmouth became the masked prisoner, it being in Louis XIV's interests to assist a fellow Catholic like James who would not necessarily want to kill his own nephew. Saint-Foix's case was based on unsubstantiated rumors and allegations that Monmouth's execution was faked.<ref name=\"Noone\"/>\n\n===Italian diplomat===\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2019}}\nAnother candidate, much favored in the 1800s, was Fouquet's fellow prisoner Count [[Ercole Antonio Mattioli]] (or Matthioli). He was an Italian diplomat who acted on behalf of debt-ridden [[Charles IV, Duke of Mantua]] in 1678, in selling [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]], a strategic fortified town near the border with France. A French occupation would be unpopular, so discretion was essential, but Mattioli leaked the details to France's Spanish enemies, after pocketing his commission once the sale had been concluded, and they made a bid of their own before the French forces could occupy the town. Mattioli was kidnapped by the French and thrown into nearby Pignerol in April 1679. The French took possession of Casale two years later.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\n[[George Agar Ellis]] reached the conclusion that Mattioli was the state prisoner commonly called The Iron Mask when he reviewed documents extracted from French archives in the 1820s. His book,<ref>George Agar Ellis, The true history of the State Prisoner commonly called the Iron Mask, here identified with Count E.A. Mattioli, extracted from documents in the French archives (London, J. Murray, 1826)</ref> published in English in 1826, was translated into French and published in 1830. German historian Wilhelm Broecking came to the same conclusion independently seventy years later.  [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]]' ''[[Chambers Book of Days|Book of Days]]'' supports the claim and places Matthioli in the Bastille for the last 13 years of his life.\n\nSince that time, letters sent by Saint-Mars, which earlier historians missed, indicate that Mattioli was only held at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite and was not at Exilles or the Bastille and, therefore, it is argued that he can be discounted.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\" />\n\n===Eustache Dauger de Cavoye===\nIn his letter to Saint-Mars announcing the imminent arrival of the prisoner who would become the \"man in the iron mask,\" Louvois gave his name as \"Eustache Dauger\" and historians have found evidence that a \"Eustache Dauger\" was living in France at the time and was involved in scandalous and embarrassing events involving people in high places known as [[Affair of the Poisons|l'Affaire des Poisons]]. His full name was Eustache Dauger de Cavoye.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\n====Early life====\nRecords indicate that he was born on 30 August 1637, the son of Fran\u00e7ois Dauger, a captain in [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s guards. Fran\u00e7ois was married to Marie de S\u00e9rignan and they had 11 children, nine of whom survived into adulthood. When Fran\u00e7ois and his two eldest sons were killed in battle, Eustache became the nominal head of the family.\n\n====Disgrace====\nIn April 1659, Eustache and Guiche were invited to an Easter weekend party at the castle of Roissy-en-Brie. By all accounts it was a debauched affair of merry-making, with the men involved in all sorts of sordid activities, including attacking a man who claimed to be [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s attorney. It was also claimed,{{By whom|date=July 2010}} among other things, that a [[black mass]] was enacted and that a pig was baptized as carp in order to allow them to eat pork on Good Friday.\n\nWhen news of these events became public, an inquiry was held and the various perpetrators jailed or exiled. There is no record as to what happened to Dauger, but in 1665, near the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], he allegedly killed a young [[Page (occupation)|page boy]] in a drunken brawl involving the Duc de Foix. The two men claimed that they had been provoked by the boy, who was drunk, but the fact that the killing took place near a castle where the king was staying meant that this was not a good enough explanation, and as a result, Dauger was forced to resign his [[Commissioned officers|commission]].\n\nDauger's mother died shortly afterwards. In her will, written a year previously, she passed over her eldest surviving sons Eustache and Armand, leaving the bulk of the estate to their younger brother Louis. Eustache was restricted in the amount of money to which he had access, having built up considerable debts, and left with barely enough for \"food and upkeep\".{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n====Affair of the Poisons====\n{{main|Affair of the Poisons}}\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}\nIn the 1930s, historian Maurice Duvivier linked Eustache Dauger de Cavoye to the [[Poison affair|Affair of the Poisons]], a notorious scandal of 1677\u20131682 in which people in high places were accused of being involved in [[black mass]] and poisonings. An investigation had been launched, but Louis XIV had instigated a cover-up when it appeared that his mistress [[Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]] was involved.<ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\nThe records show that during the inquiry the investigators were told about a supplier of poisons, a surgeon named Auger, and Duvivier became convinced that Dauger de Cavoye, disinherited and short of money, had become Auger, the supplier of poisons, and subsequently Dauger, the man in the mask.\n\nIn a letter sent by Louvois to Saint-Mars shortly after Fouquet's death while in prison (with Dauger acting as his valet), the minister adds a note in his own handwriting, asking how Dauger performed certain acts that Saint-Mars had mentioned in a previous correspondence (now lost) and \"how he got the drugs necessary to do so\". Duvivier suggested that Dauger may have poisoned Fouquet as part of a complex power struggle between Louvois and his rival [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]].\n\n====Dauger in prison====\n{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}\nHowever, evidence has emerged that Dauger de Cavoye actually died in the [[Prison Saint-Lazare]], an asylum run by monks which many families used in order to imprison their \"[[black sheep]]\". Documents have survived indicating that Dauger de Cavoye was held at Saint-Lazare in Paris at about the same time that Dauger, the man in the mask, was taken into custody in Pignerol, hundreds of miles away in the south.\n\nThese include a letter sent to Dauger de Cavoye's sister, the Marquise de Fabr\u00e8gues, dated 20 June 1678, which is filled with self-pity as Eustache complains about his treatment in prison, where he has been held for 10 years, and how he was deceived by their brother Louis and Cl\u00e9rac, their brother-in-law and the manager of Louis' estate. A year later, he wrote a letter to the king, outlining the same complaints and making a similar request for freedom. The best the king would do, however, was to send a letter to the head of Saint-Lazare telling him that \"M. de Cavoye should have communication with no one at all, not even with his sister, unless in your presence or in the presence of one of the priests of the mission\". The letter was signed by the king and Colbert.\n\nA poem written by Louis-Henri de Lom\u00e9nie de Brienne, an inmate at the time, indicates that Eustache Dauger de Cavoye died as a result of heavy drinking in the late 1680s. Historians consider all this proof enough that he was not involved in any way with the man in the mask.<ref name=\"BBCdocu\" /><ref name=\"Noone\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Literature===\n* [[Alfred de Vigny]], \"The Prison\" (1821),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Prison_(Vigny) |title=La Prison (Vigny) |via=Wikisource |language=fr|publisher=Fr.wikisource.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-31}}</ref> a long poem describing the final events in the life of the Man in the Iron Mask. An aged priest is called to offer the last rites of the Catholic Church to a mysterious prisoner. After an involved process to ensure the prisoner's anonymity, the priest is introduced to the dying prisoner, who is addressed as \"my prince\" by the jailer. The priest realizes in the dim light that the prisoner wears an iron mask, and recalls the tales he heard in his youth. The prisoner rejects the priest's efforts, even after the priest promises that his lifelong incarceration has already opened Heaven to him if he would only embrace God. The prisoner dies without repenting. The priest continues to pray for the man for several hours, and is horrified to see that the corpse continues to wear the mask underneath the shroud, denied release even in death.\n* [[Alexandre Dumas]], ''[[The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later#Part Three: ''The Man in the Iron Mask'' (Chapters 181\u2013269)|The Vicomte de Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]]'' (1847\u20131850), the final section of which is titled ''The Man in the Iron Mask'' (French: {{lang|fr|L'homme au masque de fer}})\n* [[Henry Vizetelly]], ''The Man With the Iron Mask'' (1870)\n* [[Juliette Benzoni]], ''Secret d'etat''\n* Louis-C\u00e9sar, ''Cassandra Palmer'' series\n* [[Algis Budrys]]'s 1958 science-fiction novel ''[[Who?
