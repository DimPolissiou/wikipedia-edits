The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) was the first to assemble many carriers into a single task force, known as ''[[Kido Butai]]''.  This task force was used with devastating effect in the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].  [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]].  In contrast, the [[United States Navy]] deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own [[cruiser]] and [[destroyer]] escorts.  These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway.  By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers.  These groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle unit of the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]].\n\nWith the construction of the large \"[[supercarrier]]s\" of the [[Cold War era]], the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived.  During the Cold War, the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect [[Atlantic]] supply routes between the [[United States]] and its allies in [[NATO]] [[Europe]], while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task.  Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely.  However, a primary mission of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s [[attack submarine]]s was to track every allied battle group and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers.  Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.\n\n== Carrier battle groups in crises ==\nIn the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|centuries]], most uses of carrier battle groups by the United States as well as that of other Western nations have been in situations where their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces.  During the Cold War, an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using numerous [[antiship missile]]s.\n\n===1956 Suez Crisis===\nBritish and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan war===\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]], India used its carrier strike group centered on {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}} to impose a naval blockade upon East Pakistan. Air strikes were carried out initially on shipping in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbors, sinking or incapacitating most ships there. Further strikes were carried out on Cox's Bazar from 60 nautical miles (110&nbsp;km) offshore. On the evening of 4 December, the air group struck Chittagong Harbour. Later strikes targeted Khulna and the Port of Mongla. Air strikes continued until 10 December 1971.\n\n===1982 Falklands War===\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Both {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} took part in the [[Falklands War]].\n|total_width = 450\n\n|image1 = PALVdeMayoV-2.jpg\n|width1 = 1024\n|height1 = 718\n|alt1 = ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo''\n\n|image2 = HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg\n|width2 = 2820\n|height2 = 1850\n|alt2 = HMS ''Invincible''\n}}\n\nThe first attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier battle group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]]. This was the last conflict so far in which opposing belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], originally built in the [[United Kingdom]] as HMS Venerable and later served with the [[Netherlands]] (1948-1968).\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].\n\n===Gulf of Sidra===\nCarrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the \"[[Line of Death]]\" proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].\n\n===2011 military intervention in Libya===\nDuring the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[French Navy]] deployed its aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, off [[Libya]]. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' was accompanied by several frigates as {{ship|French frigate|Forbin|D620|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Dupleix|D641|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Aconit|F 713|2}}, the replenishment tanker ''[[Durance-class tanker|Meuse]]'' and two {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} nuclear attack submarines.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=6007194&c=EUR&s=AIR</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy Battle Groups==\n===Carrier strike group===\n[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|USS ''George Washington'' [[Carrier Strike Group]] sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006.

The Carrier Battle Group (Groupe A\u00e9ronaval, GAN, in French) of the [[Force d'Action Navale]] is usually composed, in addition to the aircraft carrier, of:\n*a [[carrier air wing]] (Groupe A\u00e9rien Embarqu\u00e9, GAE, in French), a complement composed of about 60 aircraft:\n**[[Dassault Rafale|Rafale F3]] (up to 30)\n**[[E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C Hawkeye]] (2)\n**[[Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin|SA365 Dauphin]] (3) for RESCO and [[Eurocopter EC725|EC725 Caracal]] for CSAR (2)\n*one {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine}}\n*two anti-submarine destroyers (currently [[FREMM multipurpose frigate|FREMM ASM]] or {{sclass-|Georges Leygues|frigate|4}})\n*one or two anti-air destroyers ({{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|5}} or {{sclass-|Cassard|frigate|4}})\n*one stealth frigate in forward patrol (usually a {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}})\n*one supply ship (currently a {{sclass-|Durance|tanker|2}})\n\nThis group is commanded by a rear admiral ([[Counter Admiral|contre-amiral]], in French) on board the aircraft carrier. The commanding officer of the air group (usually a {{lang|fr|capitaine de fr\u00e9gate}}\u2014equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains.\n\nFrance also operates three {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|2}}s. While incapable of operating fixed-winged aircraft, they function as helicopter carriers and form the backbone of France's amphibious force. These ships are typically escorted by the same escorts the ''Charles De Gaulle'' uses.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Indian Navy flotilla of Western Fleet escort INS Vikramaditya (R33) and INS Viraat (R22) in the Arabian Sea.jpg|thumb|A flotilla from the Indian Navy's [[Western Naval Command|Western Fleet]] escorts the aircraft carriers [[INS Viraat (R22)|INS ''Viraat'']] and [[INS Vikramaditya (R33)|INS ''Vikramaditya'']] through the Arabian Sea in 2014.]] \nThe [[Indian Navy]] has been operating carrier battle groups since 1961, with its first carrier battle group formed around the now decommissioned {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}}.<ref name=ht9j14>{{cite news|title=INS Vikramaditya will create waves for India |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |accessdate=9 January 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=9 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109051144/http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2014 }}</ref> As of 2017, the Indian Navy operates one carrier battle group centered on {{INS|Vikramaditya}}.

Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fueling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.\n\n==Debate on future viability==\nThere is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched firepower and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] or even hypersonic flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/are-the-us-navy-supercarriers-useless-1484497670|title=The future of naval warfare: Are US supercarriers useless?|first=Jesus|last=Diaz|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as [[Cooperative Engagement Capability]] (CEC), DEW technology and missile technology.\n\nHowever, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations, whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.\n\nThe [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed. This precedent was established during [[World War II]] in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].\n\nRegardless of the debate over viability, the United States has made a major investment in the development of a new carrier class\u2014the {{sclass-|Gerald R.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) was the first to assemble many carriers into a single task force, known as ''[[Kido Butai]]''.  This task force was used with devastating effect in the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]].  [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]].  In contrast, the [[United States Navy]] deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own [[cruiser]] and [[destroyer]] escorts.  These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway.  By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers.  These groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle unit of the [[United States Third Fleet|U.S. Third]] and [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleets]].\n\nWith the construction of the large \"[[supercarrier]]s\" of the [[Cold War era]], the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived.  During the Cold War, the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect [[Atlantic]] supply routes between the [[United States]] and its allies in [[NATO]] [[Europe]], while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task.  Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely.  However, a primary mission of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s [[attack submarine]]s was to track every allied battle group and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers.  Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.\n\n== Carrier battle groups in crises ==\nIn the late [[20th century|20th]] and early [[21st century|centuries]], most uses of carrier battle groups by the United States as well as that of other Western nations have been in situations where their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces.  During the Cold War, an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using numerous [[antiship missile]]s.\n\n===1956 Suez Crisis===\nBritish and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan war===\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]], India used its carrier strike group centered on {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}} to impose a naval blockade upon East Pakistan. Air strikes were carried out initially on shipping in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbors, sinking or incapacitating most ships there. Further strikes were carried out on Cox's Bazar from 60 nautical miles (110&nbsp;km) offshore. On the evening of 4 December, the air group struck Chittagong Harbour. Later strikes targeted Khulna and the Port of Mongla. Air strikes continued until 10 December 1971.\n\n===1982 Falklands War===\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Both {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} took part in the [[Falklands War]].\n|total_width = 450\n\n|image1 = PALVdeMayoV-2.jpg\n|width1 = 1024\n|height1 = 718\n|alt1 = ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo''\n\n|image2 = HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg\n|width2 = 2820\n|height2 = 1850\n|alt2 = HMS ''Invincible''\n}}\n\nThe first attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier battle group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]]. This was the last conflict so far in which opposing belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], originally built in the [[United Kingdom]] as HMS Venerable and later served with the [[Netherlands]] (1948-1968).\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].\n\n===Gulf of Sidra===\nCarrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the \"[[Line of Death]]\" proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].\n\n===2011 military intervention in Libya===\nDuring the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[French Navy]] deployed its aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, off [[Libya]]. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' was accompanied by several frigates as {{ship|French frigate|Forbin|D620|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Dupleix|D641|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Aconit|F 713|2}}, the replenishment tanker ''[[Durance-class tanker|Meuse]]'' and two {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} nuclear attack submarines.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=6007194&c=EUR&s=AIR</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy Battle Groups==\n===Carrier strike group===\n[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|USS ''George Washington'' [[Carrier Strike Group]] sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006.

The commanding officer of the air group (usually a {{lang|fr|capitaine de fr\u00e9gate}}\u2014equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains.\n\nFrance also operates three {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|2}}s. While incapable of operating fixed-winged aircraft, they function as helicopter carriers and form the backbone of France's amphibious force. These ships are typically escorted by the same escorts the ''Charles De Gaulle'' uses.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Indian Navy flotilla of Western Fleet escort INS Vikramaditya (R33) and INS Viraat (R22) in the Arabian Sea.jpg|thumb|A flotilla from the Indian Navy's [[Western Naval Command|Western Fleet]] escorts the aircraft carriers [[INS Viraat (R22)|INS ''Viraat'']] and [[INS Vikramaditya (R33)|INS ''Vikramaditya'']] through the Arabian Sea in 2014.]] \nThe [[Indian Navy]] has been operating carrier battle groups since 1961, with its first carrier battle group formed around the now decommissioned {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}}.<ref name=ht9j14>{{cite news|title=INS Vikramaditya will create waves for India |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |accessdate=9 January 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=9 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109051144/http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2014 }}</ref> As of 2017, the Indian Navy operates one carrier battle group centered on {{INS|Vikramaditya}}.

Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fueling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.\n\n==Debate on future viability==\nThere is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched firepower and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] or even hypersonic flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/are-the-us-navy-supercarriers-useless-1484497670|title=The future of naval warfare: Are US supercarriers useless?|first=Jesus|last=Diaz|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as [[Cooperative Engagement Capability]] (CEC), DEW technology and missile technology.\n\nHowever, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations, whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.\n\nThe [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed. This precedent was established during [[World War II]] in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].\n\nRegardless of the debate over viability, the United States has made a major investment in the development of a new carrier class\u2014the {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier|}}s (formerly designated CVN-X, or the X Carrier)\u2014to replace the existing {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier}}s. The new ''Ford''-class carriers are designed to be modular and are easily adaptable as technology and equipment needed on board changes.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvx.htm CVX Next Generation Aircraft Carrier], globalsecurity.org</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Amphibious ready group]]\n*[[Expeditionary Strike Group]]\n*[[Naval tactics]]\n*[[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal |last= Morua |first= Michael L. |date= 21 March 2000 |title= The Carrier Battle Group Force: An Operator's Perspective |journal= Engineering the Total Ship (ETS) 2000 Symposium |publisher= [[National Institute of Standards & Technology]]|location= [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]] |id= ADA376409 |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA376409&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2010-10-28 |quote=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Naval units}}\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/batgru.htm Carrier Battle Group] \u2013 GlobalSecurity.org\n* [http://gonavy.jp/CVLocation.html Current global location of active, proposed, and decommissioned carriers]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carrier Battle Group}}\n[[Category:Escort ships| ]]\n[[Category:Aircraft carriers]]\n[[Category:Naval warfare]]\n[[Category:Naval units and formations by size]]\n[[Category:Naval units and formations]]\n", "name_user": "TheArmchairSoldier", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnited Kingdom", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_battle_group"}

A mother and her young daughter ([[Ghyslaine C\u00f4t\u00e9]] and Catherine P\u00e9pin) wait for a man to arrive. An elegant older woman ([[Huguette Oligny]]) catches the eye of another older diner ({{Interlanguage link multi|G\u00e9rard Poirier|fr|lt=G\u00e9rard Poirier}}). Outside the caf\u00e9 a lovers' [[Disagreement|quarrel]] is going on between a young man and woman (David Boutin and {{Interlanguage link multi|Rachel Fontaine|fr|lt=Rachel Fontaine}}).\n\nA man in a jacket ({{Interlanguage link multi|Frank Schorpion|fr|lt=Frank Schorpion}}) sits at a reserved table, and sticks a [[dynamite]] [[time bomb]] underneath it. Told the table is reserved, he rises and makes a phone call using the restaurant's phone, just as two English-speaking [[mafiosi]] (Bruno Di Quenzio and [[Manuel Tadros]]) enter and sit at the same table. The bomber takes out a pack of cigarettes in which he has hidden an instrument for setting the timer remotely, and sets it for five minutes. A sequence of images follows of everyone else lit up with white light.\n\nThe bomber goes outside and rights a trash bin which had been knocked over during the lovers' quarrel. He dumps the remote and departs. Inside, a mafioso receives a phone call, swears in frustration, and both men leave without ordering. The little girl notices something under the reserved table. The quarrellers enter and sit at the table. The older man makes his way towards the older lady but stops short and sits in the booth of the portly man.\n\nThe couple continue their quarrel, the older lady looking at them sympathetically. The little girl, called Jos\u00e9e-Marguerite, watches the bomb, whose timer now reads 3:15. Her mother chides her for staring at other people and she responds that there is something flashing under the table. Her mother looks, but sees only the young man's knee, and asks why the girl is making things up. Jos\u00e9e-Marguerite shrugs.\n\nAs the timer reaches 2:55, the portly man observes the older lady in the reflection of the older man's pocket watch. He notices a flashing red light as well, but is distracted as the older man says \"That woman's dynamite!\" He explains that he is taking his time, not wanting to scare her off, and compares her to [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]]. He needs to make a move quickly after all when she asks for the bill. She only ate a bit of everything in her role as a [[food critic]]. The first waitress declares the meal free, takes the plate, trips as the older man tries to go past her, and finds herself sitting in the booth with the portly man, the dish now in front of him.\n\nThe timer reaches 2:35. The mother leaves the booth to check if her boyfriend is arriving. The portly man decides it is his [[fate]] to eat the cholesterol-heavy meal. Despite her mother telling her to sit quietly, Jos\u00e9e-Marguerite leaves their booth to get a closer look at the bomb. She points at it and asks \"What is that?\" \u2014 but just then her mother arrives and admonishes her. The young woman places her hands on the table with some force and the bomb is half dislodged underneath. She says she is going to the washroom and her boyfriend had better have changed his attitude by the time she gets back.\n\nThe portly man orders coffee and cigarettes. The timer counts down to 0:59, and the older lady rises and whispers advice to the young man on her way out. She pauses and smiles at the older man and he gets up to follow her while the timer counts down to 0:42. He is delayed by a new patron coming through the door \u2014 the mother's awaited boyfriend ({{Interlanguage link multi|Luc Senay|fr|lt=Luc Senay}}). She asks Jos\u00e9e-Marguerite what it was she had wanted to say earlier, but the frustrated girl says it is \"too late\" as the timer counts down to 0:28.\n\nThe young couple are reconciled, which pleases the older lady looking through the window. The older man continues to struggle with the door. The timer counts down from 0:10 to 0:03 \u2014 and stops. The older lady has found the remote in the bin outside. She flips a switch and the timer continues down to 0:01. She flips it again and holds it to her ear and shakes it, finally giving up and throwing it into the bin. She is followed by the older man as she leaves. Inside, the portly man enjoys the older lady's leftovers, Jos\u00e9e-Marguerite meets her mother's boyfriend, the waitresses finally have time to catch up on each other's news, and the young couple kiss passionately.

Many of the members are multi-instrumentalists and trade spots on stage.

After spending three weeks living together with music as the main focus and sharing strong moments with Cuban artists, the group came back to Montreal with the idea of putting together a [[mixtape]] and a show in order to showcase their experience. The night of the concert, the venue quickly packed up and the mixtapes rapidly sold-out. The next day, Nomadic Massive, surprised by the massive turn-out, decided to push the experience even further by participating in any community shows between Montreal and [[Toronto]].\n\nIn 2005, the group launched its first EP, entitled ''Nomad\u2019s Land''. The record was critically acclaimed in the local and international scene, and thanks to their dynamic shows, Nomadic Massive started to create its own niche.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/nomadic_massive-nomads_land|title=Nomadic Massive Nomad's Land|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}</ref> The first single from the EP, \"Nofy\u2019s Peace\", stood out because of its production quality, as well as its naturally universal feel. To this day, more than 3000 copies have been sold, mostly at shows.\n\nAfter this first record and these first shows, the group continued to perform at various events across Canada and even returned to Havana in 2006, to present their new material and their new live show. As contacts kept on multiplying, the group managed in 2008 to independently organize a tour in [[S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]] where their music and community workshops found a new fan base and where they produced a new mixtape with local artists. These out of the ordinary moves caught the attention of [[Outside Music]], who in 2009 offered Nomadic a national distribution deal for their second self-titled album, which sold more than 4500 copies.\n\nIn 2012, the group released a mixtape project entitled ''Supafam'', which came out digitally but also on 300 exclusive cassette tapes that were rapidly sold at the launch party. During that time, the group continued to tour in new territories, such as [[French Guiana|French Guyana]] and the United States.\n\nThe arrival of a new EP in 2013 announced the beginning of an intense tour across [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[France]], inciting the attention of the various buyers in the concert industry.\n\nIn 2016, after years of international touring, the Nomads left their mark on the genre\u2019s most avid fans as they launched a new album on the Coop Les Faux-Monnayeurs label entitled The Big Band Theory, a well-received musical trip into an organic international universe tinted with soul, jazz and funk. \nThis album allowed them to open-up new markets, particularly in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]].\n\nHaving entered their 15th year as a group, Nomadic Massive proved itself to be a true mirror of today\u2019s big cities and the cultural blend they generate. An archetype band of the 21st century, Nomadic represents a local reality but with its eyes on the rest of the world.\n\n==Performance highlights==\n\n* [[Celebrate Brooklyn!]] (New York, NY)\n* [[Grand Performances]] (Los Angeles, CA)\n* [[Webster Hall]] (New York, NY)\n* [[Festival International de Jazz de Montreal|Festival International de Jazz]] (Montr\u00e9al, QC)\n* [[Pal\u00e9o Festival]] (Nyon, Switzerland)\n* Havana World Festival (Havana, Cuba)\n* Say it Loud Festival (Barcelona, Spain)\n* [[Vancouver International Jazz Festival]] (Vancouver, BC)\n* Calgary Folk Festival (Calgary, AB)\n* Lotus Festival (Bloomington, IN)\n* TFF Festival (Rudolstadt, Germany)\n* [[Pan American Games|Pan-Am Games]] (Toronto, ON)\n* [[Festival International|Festival international]] de la Francophonie (Lafayette, LA)\n* [[John F.

Waahli has shared the stage with acts such as [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]], [[Antibalas]], [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey]], [[Georgia Anne Muldrow]], [[Blackalicious]], [[K'naan|K\u2019naan]] and [[Wyclef Jean]]. His musical styles and influences range from traditional, to soul, funk and jazz. He gravitates to the conscious sounds of Native Tongues and affiliates.  He has cited the [[Jungle Brothers]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[De La Soul]], [[J Dilla]], and [[KRS-One]] as inspirations. Beyond his musical influences, Waahli also derives inspiration from the work of Black activists such as [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Malcolm X]].

Sepu has been in the music scene since the age of twelve. It was then that he received his first guitar from his father. He proceeded to become involved in many [[Chile]]an cultural events which served as a training ground for his unique guitar style. He was influenced by the traditional music of the [[Andes]], as well as the blues and the [[psychedelic music]] of the 70s. He eventually discovered that there was a place for his style in the hip-hop genre, where his loops could replace the traditional sample. Hip-hop expanded his musical repertoire as he explored new styles emanating from the diverse cultures in the Montreal music scene. Although his original loops were done on the same classical guitar he received as a child, he opted for a Japanese [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] when the group decided to go with a live band. The electrification of his original sound is what allowed for the evolution into what is now the signature nomadic sound.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nomadicmassive.com/author/alisepu/|title=Ali Sepu, Auteur \u00e0 Nomadic Massive - official website|website=Nomadic Massive - official website|language=fr-FR|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Meryem Saci ===\n'''Meryem Saci''' (also known as '''Meduza Ma\u2019at''') is an [[Algerian people|Algerian]] singer, songwriter and MC.

After spending three weeks living together with music as the main focus and sharing strong moments with Cuban artists, the group came back to Montreal with the idea of putting together a [[mixtape]] and a show in order to showcase their experience. The night of the concert, the venue quickly packed up and the mixtapes rapidly sold-out. The next day, Nomadic Massive, surprised by the massive turn-out, decided to push the experience even further by participating in any community shows between Montreal and [[Toronto]].\n\nIn 2005, the group launched its first EP, entitled ''Nomad\u2019s Land''. The record was critically acclaimed in the local and international scene, and thanks to their dynamic shows, Nomadic Massive started to create its own niche.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/nomadic_massive-nomads_land|title=Nomadic Massive Nomad's Land|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}</ref> The first single from the EP, \"Nofy\u2019s Peace\", stood out because of its production quality, as well as its naturally universal feel. To this day, more than 3000 copies have been sold, mostly at shows.\n\nAfter this first record and these first shows, the group continued to perform at various events across Canada and even returned to Havana in 2006, to present their new material and their new live show. As contacts kept on multiplying, the group managed in 2008 to independently organize a tour in [[S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil]] where their music and community workshops found a new fan base and where they produced a new mixtape with local artists. These out of the ordinary moves caught the attention of [[Outside Music]], who in 2009 offered Nomadic a national distribution deal for their second self-titled album, which sold more than 4500 copies.\n\nIn 2012, the group released a mixtape project entitled ''Supafam'', which came out digitally but also on 300 exclusive cassette tapes that were rapidly sold at the launch party. During that time, the group continued to tour in new territories, such as [[French Guiana|French Guyana]] and the United States.\n\nThe arrival of a new EP in 2013 announced the beginning of an intense tour across [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[France]], inciting the attention of the various buyers in the concert industry.\n\nIn 2016, after years of international touring, the Nomads left their mark on the genre\u2019s most avid fans as they launched a new album on the Coop Les Faux-Monnayeurs label entitled The Big Band Theory, a well-received musical trip into an organic international universe tinted with soul, jazz and funk. \nThis album allowed them to open-up new markets, particularly in [[Europe]] and [[Latin America]].\n\nHaving entered their 15th year as a group, Nomadic Massive proved itself to be a true mirror of today\u2019s big cities and the cultural blend they generate.

He was influenced by the traditional music of the [[Andes]], as well as the blues and the [[psychedelic music]] of the 70s. He eventually discovered that there was a place for his style in the hip-hop genre, where his loops could replace the traditional sample. Hip-hop expanded his musical repertoire as he explored new styles emanating from the diverse cultures in the Montreal music scene. Although his original loops were done on the same classical guitar he received as a child, he opted for a Japanese [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]] when the group decided to go with a live band.

It was directed by [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]], and written by Paul Hernandez, [[Robert Schooley]], and [[Mark McCorkle]]. The film stars [[Kelly Preston]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], and [[Kurt Russell]]. It tells the story about the son of two superheroes who is enrolled in a superhero school where his powers kick in.\n\n==Plot==\nWill Stronghold begins ninth grade at Sky High, a high school that exclusively teaches teenagers with superpowers. Will's parents are The Commander and Jetstream, two of the world's most famous superheroes. Will's best friend, Layla Williams, who happens to have a crush on him, has the power to manipulate plant life. Will is anxious about attending Sky High, located on a floating campus reached by a flying school bus, because, unbeknownst to his parents, he has not developed any super powers. \n\nOn the first day, he and the other ninth graders are harassed by a trio of bullies: Speed, a burly senior with super speed, Lash, a skinny senior with extreme flexibility, and Penny Lent, a senior cheerleader who has the ability to duplicate herself. Because of his lack of powers, Will is assigned to a curriculum for \"Hero Support\" and becomes a [[sidekick]] by Coach Boomer. His classmates include Ethan, who melts into a fluid; Zach, who glows in the dark; Magenta, who transforms into a guinea pig; and Layla, who joins the class in protest against the two-track nature of the school's education system. The class is taught by The Commander's former sidekick, \"All American Boy.\"\n\nWill learns from Nurse Spex that not everybody gets powers, and there are rare cases of those who have both parents having superpowers but do not inherit any superpowers, such as the bus driver, Ron Wilson. The Commander is unaware that his son has been relegated to Hero Support and shows Will his hidden trophy room also known as his \"secret sanctum\". He is particularly proud of the mysterious weapon, \"The Pacifier\", which he took from his science-themed nemesis Royal Pain years ago. Unknown to either of them, Royal Pain, who had been presumed dead, watches them from a hidden camera in one of the other trophies, alongside a maniacal sidekick named Stitches. \n\nAs Will settles into Sky High and makes friends with the other sidekicks, he comes into conflict with pyrokinetic student Warren Peace, whose supervillain father had been imprisoned by The Commander. During a fight between the two, Will eventually manifests super strength, impressing Gwen Grayson, a beautiful and popular technopath who controls machines with her mind. Will is subsequently transferred to the \"Hero\" track, and inevitably becomes popular and unable to hang out with his Hero Support friends. \n\nGwen visits the Stronghold's house and asks Will's parents to attend the [[Homecoming|Homecoming Dance]] to accept an award for Superhero of the Year, which they accept. Later on, while walking to her house, Gwen asks Will out to Homecoming and, to his delight, becomes his girlfriend. Will then begins spending more time with Gwen and her clique of friends, ignoring the sidekicks and Layla, who reveals to Warren that she has loved Will for a long time. \n\nOn the night before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house and uses Speed to steal the Pacifier, which goes unseen by Will when he takes her into the secret sanctum. After Gwen lies to Layla, who shows up to investigate the noise and believes the lie, Will breaks up with Gwen, refusing to attend the dance, even though his parents were invited as honored guests. Later, he looks through his father's old yearbook and sees a student who resembles Gwen holding the Pacifier, which he subsequently discovers has been stolen. Believing that the student is Royal Pain and that Gwen is her daughter, he rushes to the dance.\n\nAt the dance party, Gwen reveals that she is actually Royal Pain herself. During her previous confrontation with the Commander, the Pacifier, which is meant to turn its target into an infant, had malfunctioned, turning her into a baby instead, thus faking her suspected death. Raised by Stitches, she has since waited 17 years for revenge. With the help of Stitches, Speed, Lash, and Penny, she takes over the school, uses the Pacifier to turn Will's parents, the faculty, and students into babies, and plans to turn it into a supervillain academy and raise them as supervillains. \n\nAfter returning to school, Will apologizes to Layla and teams up with Warren, the sidekicks, and Ron Wilson to try to save the day. The sidekicks demonstrate their heroism after Royal Pain sabotages the school's anti-gravity drive and their powers come in handy restarting it. Meanwhile, Will discovers that he has Jetstream's powers of flight when he is thrown off the edge of the school grounds and prevents the campus from falling using his two abilities. \n\nRoyal Pain and her henchmen are defeated and imprisoned in the detention halls and Will's parents, the faculty, and students are returned to their proper ages. His parents thank all of the sidekicks and admit they are heroes. Warren develops a love relationship with Freeze Girl. Will and Layla kiss and a voiceover by Will at the end reveals that they become a couple, he and Warren became best friends, and Ron Wilson gained superhuman powers after falling into a vat of toxic waste, thus becoming a superhero.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as William \"Will\" Theodore Stronghold, a freshman at Sky High, whose parents are the two most famous superheroes \u2014 Commander and Jetstream \u2014 as well as Maxville's top real estate agents in their secret identities.

It was directed by [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]], and written by Paul Hernandez, [[Robert Schooley]], and [[Mark McCorkle]]. The film stars [[Kelly Preston]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Danielle Panabaker]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], and [[Kurt Russell]]. It tells the story about the son of two superheroes who is enrolled in a superhero school where his powers kick in.\n\n==Plot==\nWill Stronghold begins ninth grade at Sky High, a high school that exclusively teaches teenagers with superpowers. Will's parents are The Commander and Jetstream, two of the world's most famous superheroes. Will's best friend, Layla Williams, who happens to have a crush on him, has the power to manipulate plant life. Will is anxious about attending Sky High, located on a floating campus reached by a flying school bus, because, unbeknownst to his parents, he has not developed any super powers. \n\nOn the first day, he and the other ninth graders are harassed by a trio of bullies: Speed, a burly senior with super speed, Lash, a skinny senior with extreme flexibility, and Penny Lent, a senior cheerleader who has the ability to duplicate herself. Because of his lack of powers, Will is assigned to a curriculum for \"Hero Support\" and becomes a [[sidekick]] by Coach Boomer. His classmates include Ethan, who melts into a fluid; Zach, who glows in the dark; Magenta, who transforms into a guinea pig; and Layla, who joins the class in protest against the two-track nature of the school's education system. The class is taught by The Commander's former sidekick, \"All American Boy.\"\n\nWill learns from Nurse Spex that not everybody gets powers, and there are rare cases of those who have both parents having superpowers but do not inherit any superpowers, such as the bus driver, Ron Wilson. The Commander is unaware that his son has been relegated to Hero Support and shows Will his hidden trophy room also known as his \"secret sanctum\". He is particularly proud of the mysterious weapon, \"The Pacifier\", which he took from his science-themed nemesis Royal Pain years ago. Unknown to either of them, Royal Pain, who had been presumed dead, watches them from a hidden camera in one of the other trophies, alongside a maniacal sidekick named Stitches. \n\nAs Will settles into Sky High and makes friends with the other sidekicks, he comes into conflict with pyrokinetic student Warren Peace, whose supervillain father had been imprisoned by The Commander. During a fight between the two, Will eventually manifests super strength, impressing Gwen Grayson, a beautiful and popular technopath who controls machines with her mind. Will is subsequently transferred to the \"Hero\" track, and inevitably becomes popular and unable to hang out with his Hero Support friends. \n\nGwen visits the Stronghold's house and asks Will's parents to attend the [[Homecoming|Homecoming Dance]] to accept an award for Superhero of the Year, which they accept. Later on, while walking to her house, Gwen asks Will out to Homecoming and, to his delight, becomes his girlfriend. Will then begins spending more time with Gwen and her clique of friends, ignoring the sidekicks and Layla, who reveals to Warren that she has loved Will for a long time. \n\nOn the night before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house and uses Speed to steal the Pacifier, which goes unseen by Will when he takes her into the secret sanctum. After Gwen lies to Layla, who shows up to investigate the noise and believes the lie, Will breaks up with Gwen, refusing to attend the dance, even though his parents were invited as honored guests. Later, he looks through his father's old yearbook and sees a student who resembles Gwen holding the Pacifier, which he subsequently discovers has been stolen. Believing that the student is Royal Pain and that Gwen is her daughter, he rushes to the dance.\n\nAt the dance party, Gwen reveals that she is actually Royal Pain herself. During her previous confrontation with the Commander, the Pacifier, which is meant to turn its target into an infant, had malfunctioned, turning her into a baby instead, thus faking her suspected death. Raised by Stitches, she has since waited 17 years for revenge. With the help of Stitches, Speed, Lash, and Penny, she takes over the school and uses the Pacifier to turn Will's parents, the faculty, and students into babies, and plans to turn it into a supervillain academy and raise them as supervillains. \n\nAfter returning to school, Will apologizes to Layla and teams up with Warren, the sidekicks, and Ron Wilson to try to save the day. The sidekicks demonstrate their heroism after Royal Pain sabotages the school's anti-gravity drive and their powers come in handy restarting it. Meanwhile, Will discovers that he has Jetstream's powers of flight when he is thrown off the edge of the school grounds and prevents the campus from falling using his two abilities. \n\nRoyal Pain and her henchmen are defeated and imprisoned in the detention halls and the faculty and students are returned to their proper ages. His parents thank all of the sidekicks and admit they are heroes. Warren develops a love relationship with Freeze Girl. Will and Layla kiss and a voiceover by Will at the end reveals that they become a couple, he and Warren became best friends, and Ron Wilson gained superhuman powers after falling into a vat of toxic waste, thus becoming a superhero.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Angarano]] as William \"Will\" Theodore Stronghold, a freshman at Sky High, whose parents are the two most famous superheroes \u2014 Commander and Jetstream \u2014 as well as Maxville's top real estate agents in their secret identities.
