The find was unprecedented in its size (worldwide) and ushered in an age of [[oil boom|rapid regional development]] and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil-producing states in the U.S., along with [[Oklahoma]] and California; soon the nation overtook the [[Russian Empire]] as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's [[Oil Age]] as the beginning of this era in Texas.<ref>Olson (2001), p. 238</ref>\n\nThe major petroleum strikes that began the rapid growth in petroleum exploration and speculation occurred in [[Southeast Texas]], but soon reserves were found across Texas and wells were constructed in [[North Texas]],  [[East Texas]], and the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in [[West Texas]].  Although limited reserves of oil had been struck during the 19th century, the strike at [[Spindletop]] near Beaumont in 1901 gained national attention, spurring exploration and development that continued through the 1920s and beyond. Spindletop and the Joiner strike in East Texas, at the outset of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], were the key strikes that launched this era of change in the state.\n\nThis period had a transformative effect on Texas.

The early exploration and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited exploration and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in oil production.<ref name=\"HOT: 1920s\"/> The [[Glenn Pool Oil Reserve|Glenn Pool]] strike near [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s.<ref>Maugeri (2007), p. 15.</ref> Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, it was still a major producer.<ref>Malone (1989), p. 35.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1910s and 1920s, oil exploration and production continued to expand and stabilize.

This new oil field helped to revive Dallas's economy during the Great Depression, but sharply decreased interest in West Texas as the new supply led to another major drop in oil prices. The uncontrolled production in the eastern field destabilized the state's oil industry, which had been trying to control production levels to stabilize prices.<ref name=\"Olien 2000, p. 188\"/> Overproduction in East Texas was so great that then-governor [[Ross S. Sterling|Ross Sterling]] attempted to shut down many of the wells. During one of the forced closures, he ordered the [[Texas National Guard]] to enforce the shutdown. These efforts at controlling production, intended to protect both the independent operators and the major producers, were largely unsuccessful at first and led to widespread oil smuggling. In the later 1930s, the federal government intervened and brought production to sustainable levels, leading to a stabilization of price fluctuation.<ref>Burrough (2009), p. 77</ref> The income provided by the stabilization allowed less populated West Texas and the Panhandle to be more fully explored and exploited.<ref name=\"HOT: Oil and Gas\"/>\n\n===Emergence of an industry===\n[[File:YatesOilfieldNASA.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph looking down on hilly, treeless terrain with a town to the upper right and the thin line of a river crossing up and down on the right|Satellite view of the Yates Oil Field in West Texas.

The find was unprecedented in its size (worldwide) and ushered in an age of [[oil boom|rapid regional development]] and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil-producing states in the U.S., along with [[Oklahoma]] and California; soon the nation overtook the [[Russian Empire]] as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's [[Oil Age]] as the beginning of this era in Texas.<ref>Olson (2001), p. 238</ref>\n\nThe major petroleum strikes that began the rapid growth in petroleum exploration and speculation occurred in [[Southeast Texas]], but soon reserves were found across Texas and wells were constructed in [[North Texas]],  [[East Texas]], and the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in [[West Texas]].  Although limited reserves of oil had been struck during the 19th century, the strike at [[Spindletop]] near Beaumont in 1901 gained national attention, spurring exploration and development that continued through the 1920s and beyond. Spindletop and the Joiner strike in East Texas, at the outset of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], were the key strikes that launched this era of change in the state.\n\nThis period had a transformative effect on Texas.

The situation led exploration to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in oil production.<ref name=\"HOT: 1920s\"/> The [[Glenn Pool Oil Reserve|Glenn Pool]] strike near [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s.<ref>Maugeri (2007), p. 15.</ref> Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, it was still a major producer.<ref>Malone (1989), p. 35.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1910s and 1920s, oil exploration and production continued to expand and stabilize.

This new oil field helped to revive Dallas's economy during the Great Depression, but sharply decreased interest in West Texas as the new supply led to another major drop in oil prices. The uncontrolled production in the eastern field destabilized the state's oil industry, which had been trying to control production levels to stabilize prices.<ref name=\"Olien 2000, p. 188\"/> Overproduction in East Texas was so great that then-governor [[Ross S. Sterling|Ross Sterling]] attempted to shut down many of the wells. During one of the forced closures, he ordered the [[Texas National Guard]] to enforce the shutdown. These efforts at controlling production, intended to protect both the independent operators and the major producers, were largely unsuccessful at first and led to widespread oil smuggling. In the later 1930s, the federal government intervened and brought production to sustainable levels, leading to a stabilization of price fluctuation.<ref>Burrough (2009), p. 77</ref> The income provided by the stabilization allowed less populated West Texas and the Panhandle to be more fully explored and exploited.<ref name=\"HOT: Oil and Gas\"/>\n\n===Emergence of an industry===\n[[File:YatesOilfieldNASA.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph looking down on hilly, treeless terrain with a town to the upper right and the thin line of a river crossing up and down on the right|Satellite view of the Yates Oil Field in West Texas.

Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state would lead to a loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of [[antitrust]] lawsuits by the state [[Attorney General]] starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.<ref>Hinton (2002), p. 53-54</ref>\n\nThe mistrust of Standard Oil was partially the result of a suspicion toward ''[[carpetbaggers]]'', which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions.

The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. Parallel to this, the clearing of fields for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction, all of which followed major logging activities in the 19th century, destroyed most of the once dense forest lands in the state.<ref name=\"Jefferson County\"/><ref name=\"HOT: Lumber industry\">{{Handbook of Texas | name=Lumber Industry | id=drl02 | author=Maxwell, Robert S. | retrieved=November 6, 2009}} Texas State Historical Association.</ref><ref>Cozine (2004) pp. 52\u201358.</ref> Later environmental management efforts helped restore some of the forest lands but they remain a shadow of what they were before statehood.\n\nIndustrial activities, which had little regulation, created substantial air pollution.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 976, up from 952 in 2000. It is on northwestern [[Popof Island]], one of the [[Shumagin Islands]], off the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It is the [[County seat|borough seat]] of Aleutians East Borough, and is near the entrance to the [[Bering Sea]].\n\nThe Aleutians East Borough School District is in Southwestern Alaska along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain The District was formed in 1988 from smaller districts that consolidated and formed a Borough with taxing authority. The Borough and District boundaries are the same, and stretch over approximately {{convert|15000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of roadless, mostly treeless tundra, from the middle of the Alaska Peninsula to the north and east, going southwest out to Akutan just east of [[Dutch Harbor]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fishing village of Sand Point, Popof Island, Alaska, nd (COBB 146).jpeg|thumb|Undated photograph of Sand Point by [[John Nathan Cobb]] (died 1930)]]\nSand Point was founded by a San Francisco fishing company in 1898 as a cod fishing station and trading post. [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s and Scandinavians were among the early residents. Gold mining was briefly a part of the economy during the early 1900s. Fishing remains an important industry, as Sand Point is home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the Aleutian Chain.\n\n==Description==\nAlmost half the inhabitants are of [[Aleut people|Aleut]] descent - mainly from the Qagan Tayagungin tribe, and support themselves by fishing and [[fish processing]]. There is a cold storage and fish-processing plant owned and operated by Trident Seafoods and Peter Pan has a support facility. There is an airport with a {{convert|5200|ft|m|sigfig=2}} paved runway and daily flights (weather permitting) to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], {{convert|575|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} to the northeast.\n\nThe town is above the [[treeline]], and there is a small herd of 120 [[bison]] (first introduced in the 1930s) which provides some meat for the island's inhabitants. It is notorious for the high winds caused by the meeting of cold air flows from the [[Bering Sea]] with the warm air over the [[Japan Current]]. It has a [[maritime climate]], with temperature averages ranging from {{convert|\u22129|to|76|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, an average snowfall of {{convert|52|in|cm}} and an average rainfall of {{convert|33|in|cm}}.\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox]] St. Nicholas Chapel was built in Sand Point in 1933.<ref name=\"communitydb\">[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Sand%20Point \"Alaska Community Database, Community Information Summaries - Sand Point\"].

Often it is difficult to obtain a plane ticket off of the island with costs occasionally reaching $1200 for a round-trip ticket.\n\nCargo service to Sand Point is available on PenAir and [[Alaska Central Express]] (ACE) Air Cargo.  PenAir has cargo flights to Sand Point six mornings a week.  ACE Air Cargo flies to Sand Point several days a week.  \n[http://www.coastaltransportation.com/ ''Coastal Transportation''] is a Seattle-based marine carrier that provides weekly year-around service to communities throughout the Aleutians, including Sand Point.\n\nDuring the summer and into the fall, the Alaska Marine Highway operates the [[MV Tustumena|Tustumena]]. The Tustumena stops in Sand Point four times per month. From Sand Point the ferry goes to King Cove, Cold Bay, False Pass and Dutch Harbor. The ship has staterooms and dining room service. The ferry takes cars and trucks. As of 2017 ferry delays have been common.\n\nIn Sand Point, rental cars are available from the Harbor Cafe and the Marine View Bed & Breakfast.\n\n==Wind Power==\nIn 2012, two .5MW wind turbines were installed with blade diameters of 19.5 meters and a height of 59.5 meters.\n\n==Activities==\nMany people enjoy hunting for [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] and [[American bison|buffalo]].  [[Commercial fishing|Commercial]] and [[Recreational fishing|pole fishing]] are enjoyable pastimes for the residents of Sand Point. [[Boating]]  and riding [[all-terrain vehicle]]s (ATVs) are popular pastimes as well. There is an annual Silver Salmon Derby in which contestants try to catch the largest fish to earn a cash prize. Adults can play [[Bingo (U.S.)|Bingo]] and [[Pull-tab|pull tabs]] on Sunday. The [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] offers after-school activities.\nMany adults spend their time at the local tavern and lounge both owned and operated by the Shumagin Corporation. Due to the small community and the lack of entertainment, many newcomers find themselves leaving. This includes many of the teachers.\n\n==Fishing industry==\nLike most Aleutian communities, commercial fishing drives the local economy. The Aleutians' largest fishing fleet is based in Sand Point.<ref name=\"communitydb\" /> [[Trident Seafoods]] has a major [[Pacific cod]], [[pollock]], [[salmon]] and [[halibut]] [[Fish processing|processing plant]], and provides fuel and other services. Peter Pan Seafoods owns a storage and transfer facility. In 1991, New West Fisheries had a [[Factory ship|floating processor]] near the city dock for [[Pacific cod]] processing. Residents in Sand Point have to acquire commercial fishing permits to participate in the fisheries.\n\nThe city completed a major rehabilitation of the Robert E. Galovin Small Boat Harbor in the summer of 2014. The harbor can hold more than 150 boats in permanent slips, as well as transient vessels. There is also a new boat harbor on the waterfront next to the small boat harbor and City dock. This harbor was built by the Borough and Army Corps of Engineers, but does not have any floats.\n\n==Business and shopping==\nThe AC Store ([[Alaska Commercial Company]]) provides groceries, apparel, motorized vehicles such as ATVs, and toiletries. Small local stores provide goods like hardware, toys, groceries, and electronics. There is a small selection of restaurants in the town. Alcohol can be purchased at two locations. A [[bed and breakfast]] is near the Trident bunkhouses. Cut R' Loose Coffee provides espresso and other specialty drinks to the local community.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Radio===\n* [[KSDP (AM)|KSDP]] 830 AM (Local NPR and APRN affiliate) (non-commercial community service)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Sand Point, Alaska}}\n\n{{Coord|display=title|55.336593|-160.493234}}\n{{Alaska borough seats}}\n{{Aleutians East Borough, Alaska}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Borough seats in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Aleutians East Borough, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1898]]\n[[Category:Shumagin Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|City in Alaska, United States}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Sand Point\n|settlement_type          = [[City (Alaska)|City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = <!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = SDP Aerial 2.jpg\n|image_caption            = Sand Point from the air\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = <!-- Maps -->\n|pushpin_map  = Alaska#North America\n|pushpin_map_caption  = Location in Alaska\n|image_map              = \n|mapsize                 = \n|map_caption            = <!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = Country\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Alaska]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|Borough]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Aleutians East Borough, Alaska|Aleutians East]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = Mayor/Council\n|leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name              = Glen Gardner, Jr.<ref>{{Cite book|title=2015 Alaska Municipal Officials Directory|location=Juneau|publisher=Alaska Municipal League|year=2015|page=138}}</ref>\n|leader_title1            = [[Alaska Senate|State senator]]\n|leader_name1             = [[Lyman Hoffman]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n|leader_title2            = [[Alaska House of Representatives|State rep.]]\n|leader_name2             = [[Bryce Edgmon]] (D)\n|established_title        = [[Municipal corporation|Incorporated]]\n|established_date         = September 1, 1966<ref>{{cite book|title=1996 Alaska Municipal Officials Directory|location=[[Juneau]]|publisher=Alaska Municipal League/[[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs]]|date=January 1996|page=132}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|area_footnotes           = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2018 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2018_Gazetteer/2018_gaz_place_02.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Jul 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 78.46\n|area_land_km2            = 20.44\n|area_water_km2           = 58.01\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 30.29\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 7.89\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 22.40\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_footnotes     = <ref name=\"Census2010\">{{cite web|title=2010 City Population and Housing Occupancy Status|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST13&prodType=table|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>\n|population_total         = 976\n|population_density_km2   = 55.76\n|population_density_sq_mi = 144.41\n|timezone                 = [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska (AKST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -9\n|timezone_DST             = AKDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -8\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = 12\n|elevation_ft             = 39\n|coordinates              = {{coord|55|20|12|N|160|29|36|W|region:US-AK|display=inline}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 99661\n|area_code                = [[Area code 907|907]]\n|area_code_type           = [[North American Numbering Plan|Area code]]\n|GNIS_id                  = 1419182\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 02-67020\n|blank1_name              = \n|blank1_info              = \n|website                  = [http://www.sandpointak.com/ sandpointak.com]\n|footnotes                = \n|pop_est_as_of = 2018\n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|population_est = 1140\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n}}\n\n'''Sand Point''', also known as '''Popof Island''', is a city in [[Aleutians East Borough, Alaska]], United States. At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 976, up from 952 in 2000. It is on northwestern [[Popof Island]], one of the [[Shumagin Islands]], off the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. It is the [[County seat|borough seat]] of Aleutians East Borough, and is near the entrance to the [[Bering Sea]].\n\nThe Aleutians East Borough School District is in Southwestern Alaska along the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Chain The District was formed in 1988 from smaller districts that consolidated and formed a Borough with taxing authority. The Borough and District boundaries are the same, and stretch over approximately {{convert|15000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of roadless, mostly treeless tundra, from the middle of the Alaska Peninsula to the north and east, going southwest out to Akutan just east of [[Dutch Harbor]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fishing village of Sand Point, Popof Island, Alaska, nd (COBB 146).jpeg|thumb|Undated photograph of Sand Point by [[John Nathan Cobb]] (died 1930)]]\nSand Point was founded by a San Francisco fishing company in 1898 as a cod fishing station and trading post. [[Aleut people|Aleut]]s and Scandinavians were among the early residents. Gold mining was briefly a part of the economy during the early 1900s. Fishing remains an important industry, as Sand Point is home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the Aleutian Chain.\n\n==Description==\nAlmost half the inhabitants are of [[Aleut people|Aleut]] descent - mainly from the Qagan Tayagungin tribe, and support themselves by fishing and [[fish processing]]. There is a cold storage and fish-processing plant owned and operated by Trident Seafoods and Peter Pan has a support facility. There is an airport with a {{convert|5200|ft|m|sigfig=2}} paved runway and daily flights (weather permitting) to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], {{convert|575|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} to the northeast.\n\nThe town is above the [[treeline]], and there is a small herd of 120 [[bison]] (first introduced in the 1930s) which provides some meat for the island's inhabitants. It is notorious for the high winds caused by the meeting of cold air flows from the [[Bering Sea]] with the warm air over the [[Japan Current]]. It has a [[maritime climate]], with temperature averages ranging from {{convert|\u22129|to|76|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, an average snowfall of {{convert|52|in|cm}} and an average rainfall of {{convert|33|in|cm}}.\n\nThe [[Russian Orthodox]] St. Nicholas Chapel was built in Sand Point in 1933.<ref name=\"communitydb\">[http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Sand%20Point \"Alaska Community Database, Community Information Summaries - Sand Point\"].

The [[Boys & Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] offers after-school activities.\nMany adults spend their time at the local tavern and lounge both owned and operated by the Shumagin Corporation. Due to the small community and the lack of entertainment, many newcomers find themselves leaving. This includes many of the teachers.\n\n==Fishing industry==\nLike most Aleutian communities, commercial fishing drives the local economy. The Aleutians' largest fishing fleet is based in Sand Point.<ref name=\"communitydb\" /> [[Trident Seafoods]] has a major [[Pacific cod]], [[pollock]], [[salmon]] and [[halibut]] [[Fish processing|processing plant]], and provides fuel and other services. Peter Pan Seafoods owns a storage and transfer facility. In 1991, New West Fisheries had a [[Factory ship|floating processor]] near the city dock for [[Pacific cod]] processing. Residents in Sand Point have to acquire commercial fishing permits to participate in the fisheries.\n\nThe city completed a major rehabilitation of the Robert E. Galovin Small Boat Harbor in the summer of 2014. The harbor can hold more than 150 boats in permanent slips, as well as transient vessels.

He received his college degree from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]], finishing with degrees in mechanical engineering and [[French language|French]], with a minor in [[piano]].<ref name=brhp/> At Carnegie Mellon, he served as a resident assistant, studied abroad, and was an active [[intramural sports]] participant.<ref name=cmu>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmu.edu/commencement/event/main-ceremony/keynote.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513194526/http://www.cmu.edu/commencement/event/main-ceremony/keynote.html|url-status=dead|title=Speakers & Honorees-Commencement Weekend - Carnegie Mellon University<!-- Bot generated title -->|archivedate=May 13, 2011}}</ref><ref name=brhp/>{{rp|343}} He also worked as a rafting guide during the summer.<ref name=brhp/>{{rp|42}}\n\nRalston worked as a mechanical engineer with [[Intel]] in [[Ocotillo, Arizona|Ocotillo]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] for five years, but found himself burned out by working in a large corporation. During his time as an engineer he had built up skills in mountaineering, and in 2002 he quit in order to climb [[Denali]]. He moved to [[Aspen, Colorado]] in order to pursue a life of climbing mountains.<ref name=brhp/>{{rp|72}}\n\nRalston began working towards his goal of climbing all of Colorado's \"[[fourteener]]s\" \u2014 peaks over {{convert|14000|ft|m|round=10}} altitude, of which there are 59 \u2014 solo and during winter (a feat that had never been recorded before). In 2003, he was caught in a Grade 5 [[avalanche]] on Resolution Peak, Colorado with his [[skiing]] partners Mark Beverly and Chadwick Spencer. No one was seriously injured, but his friends did not speak to him in the aftermath, causing him to reevaluate his approach to risk management.<ref name=brhp/>{{rp|141}}\n\n==Canyoneering accident==\nOn April 26, 2003, Aron Ralston was canyoneering alone through [[Bluejohn Canyon]], in eastern [[Wayne County, Utah|Wayne County]], [[Utah]], just south of the [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]] unit of [[Canyonlands National Park]]. While he was descending the lower stretches of the [[slot canyon]], a suspended boulder became dislodged while he was climbing down from it. The rock smashed his right hand, and then crushed his right hand against the canyon wall.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2010/11/aron-ralston-the-real-story.html | website=Los Angeles Times | title=Aron Ralston \u2013 the Real Story |publisher=The Times |date=May 3, 2003 |author1=Stephanie Simon |author2=J.

His efforts were futile as he was unable to free his arm from the 800&nbsp;lb (360&nbsp;kg) chockstone. After three days of trying to lift and break the boulder, the [[dehydrated]] and [[Delirium|delirious]] Ralston prepared to [[amputate]] his trapped arm at a point on the mid-[[forearm]] in order to escape. After having experimented with [[tourniquet]]s and having made exploratory superficial cuts to his forearm, he realized, on the fourth day, that in order to free his arm he would have to cut through the bones in it, but the tools available were insufficient to do so.<ref name=brhp/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1821786/aron-ralston-between-rock-and-hardest-place|title=Aron Ralston - Between a Rock and the Hardest Place|first=Mark|last=Jenkins|date=August 1, 2003|website=Outside Online}}</ref>\n\nAfter running out of food and water on the fifth day, Ralston decided to [[Urophagia|drink his own urine]]. He carved his name, date of birth and presumed date of death into the sandstone canyon wall, and videotaped his last goodbyes to his family. He did not expect to survive the night, but as he attempted to stay warm he began hallucinating and had a vision of himself playing with a future child while missing part of his right arm.

He did so, then amputated his forearm with his [[multi-tool]], using the dull two-inch knife and pliers for the tougher tendons. The process took an hour, during which time he used tubing from a CamelBak as a tourniquet, taking care to leave major arteries until last. The manufacturer of the multi-tool was never named, but Ralston said \"it was not a [[Leatherman]] but what you'd get if you bought a $15 flashlight and got a free [[Multi-tool|multi-use tool]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/nation/20030509climbernat2.asp|title=CMU grad describes cutting off his arm to save his life|accessdate=2007-03-21 | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first=J.

In 2003, he was caught in a Grade 5 [[avalanche]] on Resolution Peak, Colorado with his [[skiing]] partners Mark Beverly and Chadwick Spencer.

His efforts were futile as he was unable to free his arm from the 800&nbsp;lb (360&nbsp;kg) chockstone. After three days of trying to lift and break the boulder, the [[dehydrated]] and [[Delirium|delirious]] Ralston prepared to [[amputate]] his trapped arm at a point on the mid-[[forearm]] in order to escape. After having experimented with [[tourniquet]]s and having made exploratory superficial cuts to his forearm, he realized, on the fourth day, that in order to free his arm he would have to cut through the bones in it, but the tools available were insufficient to do so.<ref name=brhp/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1821786/aron-ralston-between-rock-and-hardest-place|title=Aron Ralston - Between a Rock and the Hardest Place|first=Mark|last=Jenkins|date=August 1, 2003|website=Outside Online}}</ref>\n\nAfter running out of food and water on the fifth day, Ralston decided to [[Urophagia|drink his own urine]]. He carved his name, date of birth and presumed date of death into the sandstone canyon wall, and videotaped his last goodbyes to his family.

According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]\nBy the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale.

The refurbished [[Imperial Theatre, Saint John|Imperial]] and [[Capitol Theatre (Moncton)|Capitol]] Theatres are found in Saint John and Moncton, respectively; the more modern [[The Playhouse (Fredericton)|Playhouse]] is in Fredericton.\n\n====Visual arts====\n[[File:Owens Art Gallery, Mount A.jpg|thumb|The Owns Art Gallery at [[Mount Allison University]] is the oldest [[university museum|university-operated art gallery]] in Canada.]]\nMount Allison University in Sackville began offering classes in 1854. The program came into its own under [[John A. Hammond]], from 1893 to 1916. [[Alex Colville]] and [[Lawren Harris]] later studied and taught art there, and both [[Christopher Pratt]] and [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]] were trained at Mount Allison. The university also opened an art gallery in 1895 and is named for its patron, John Owens of Saint John. The art gallery at Mount Allison University is presently the oldest [[university museum|university-operated art gallery]] in Canada. Modern New Brunswick artists include landscape painter [[Jack Humphrey]], sculptor [[Claude Roussel]], and [[Miller Brittain]]. The province is also home to the [[Beaverbrook Art Gallery]], which was designated as the provincial art gallery in 1994.\n\n===Literature===\n[[Julia Catherine Beckwith]], born in Fredericton, was Canada's first published novelist. Poet [[Bliss Carman]] and his cousin [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] were some of the first Canadians to achieve international fame for letters. [[Antonine Maillet]] was the first non-European winner of France's [[Prix Goncourt]]. Other modern writers include [[Alfred Bailey]], [[Alden Nowlan]], [[John Thompson (poet)|John Thompson]], [[Douglas Lochhead]], [[K. V. Johansen]], [[David Adams Richards]], [[Raymond Fraser]], and [[France Daigle]]. A recent New Brunswick Lieutenant-Governor, [[Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gilde Chiasson]], is a poet and playwright. [[The Fiddlehead]], established in 1945 at University of New Brunswick, is Canada's oldest literary magazine.\n\n===Media===\nNew Brunswick has four daily newspapers: the ''[[Times & Transcript]]'', serving eastern New Brunswick; the ''[[Telegraph-Journal]]'', based in Saint John and distributed province-wide; ''[[The Daily Gleaner]]'', based in Fredericton; and ''[[L'Acadie Nouvelle]]'', based in Caraquet. The three English-language dailies and the majority of the weeklies are owned and operated by [[Brunswick News]]\u2014which is privately owned by [[James K. Irving]]. Due to its dominant position, critics have accused Brunswick News of being biased towards the Irving Group of Companies, including its reluctance to publish stories that are critical of the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2009/06/17/hot_scoop_burns_reporter_at_irving_paper.html|title=Hot scoop burns reporter at Irving paper|website=Toronto Star|language=en|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/prb9935-e.htm#A.%20The%20Daveytxt|title=Newspaper ownership in Canada: an overview of the Davey Committee and Kent Commission studies (PRB 99-35E)|publisher=Government of Canada|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/07/06/news/irvings-media-monopoly-and-its-consequences|title=The Irvings' media monopoly and its consequences|last=Livesey |first=Bruce |date=2016-07-06|website=National Observer|language=en|access-date=2019-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Media convergence, acquisitions and sales in Canada|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2010/04/29/f-media-ownership-canada.html|work=CBC News|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] has anglophone television and radio operations in Fredericton.

According to the [[Constitution of Canada]], New Brunswick is the only bilingual province. About two-thirds of the population declare themselves anglophones, and one third francophones. One-third of the population describes themselves as bilingual. Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas, mostly in [[Greater Moncton]], [[Greater Saint John]] and the capital [[Fredericton]].\n\nUnlike the other [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]], New Brunswick's terrain is mostly forested uplands, with much of the land further from the coast, giving it a harsher climate. New Brunswick is 83% forested and less densely populated than the rest of the Maritimes.\n\nBeing relatively close to [[Europe]], New Brunswick was among the first places in [[North America]] to be explored and settled by Europeans, starting with the French in the early 1600s, who displaced the indigenous [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], and [[Passamaquoddy]] peoples. The French settlers were themselves later displaced when the area became part of the [[British Empire]]. In 1784, after an influx of refugees from the [[American Revolutionary War]], the province was partitioned from [[Nova Scotia]]. In 1785 [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] became the first incorporated city in what is now Canada.<ref name=\"CanEncycl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/saint-john/ |title=Saint John, NB |website=Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}</ref> The province prospered in the early 1800s and the population grew rapidly, reaching about a quarter of a million by mid-century. In 1867, New Brunswick was one of four founding provinces of the [[Canadian Confederation]], along with [[Nova Scotia]] and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]).\n\nAfter Confederation, wooden shipbuilding and lumbering declined, while [[protectionism]] disrupted trade ties with New England. The mid-1900s found New Brunswick to be one of the poorest regions of Canada, now mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments]] and improved support for rural areas. As of 2002, provincial [[gross domestic product]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provincial Gross Domestic Product by Industry|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=19 November 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205053036/http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/Statcan/15-203-XIB/0000115-203-XIE.pdf|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTourism accounts for about 9% of the labour force directly or indirectly.

Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]] at the isthmus in 1751.\n\nFrom 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beaus\u00e9jour|captured Fort Beaus\u00e9jour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and \u00cele-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].\n\n====British colony====\nContinental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763.

This policy prioritized the creation of a COVID-19 testing and consultation system based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the government's existing 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that is separate from the civilian hospital system.  The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them.  By regulating COVID-19 testing at the national level, the Abe Administration integrated the activities of the national government, the local governments, medical professionals, business operators, and the public in treating the disease.\n\nOn 1 February, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] instructed the municipal and prefectural governments to establish specialized COVID-19 consultation centres and outpatient wards at their local public health facilities by the first half of the month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20200203/k00/00m/040/227000c|title=\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u300c\u5e30\u56fd\u8005\u30fb\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u76f8\u8ac7\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3078 \u5c02\u9580\u5916\u6765\u3078\u306e\u53d7\u8a3a\u3092\u4fc3\u3059|last=|first=|date=2020-02-03|website=\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e (Mainichi)|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>  Such wards would provide medical examinations and testing for suspected carriers of the disease to protect general hospitals from infection.\n\nOn 5 February, PM Abe announced during the Fifth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would begin preparations to strengthen COVID-19 testing capabilities at the NIID and 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that are designated by the government as official testing sites.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April.

After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].

After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters.

Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties \u2013 including the [[Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan]], and [[Democratic Party for the People]] \u2013 voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/05/national/japan-lawmakers-coronavirus-crisis-state-of-emergency-clause-rights/#.XmFZMpNKgUE \"Lawmakers slammed for using coronavirus to justify emergency clause for Japan's Constitution, curbing rights\"].

The following is a list of software and technology features that can be found on the Facebook website and mobile app and are available to users of the [[social media]] site.\n\n== Facebook structure ==\n=== News Feed ===\n{{Main|News Feed}}\nThe news feed is the primary system through which users are exposed to content posted on the network. Using a secret method (initially known as [[EdgeRank]]), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Robinson|last1=Meyer|title=Everything We Know About Facebook's Secret Mood Manipulation Experiment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/|newspaper=The Atlantic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed|title=Facebook for Business|work=Facebook for Business|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 2006, [[Ruchi Sanghvi]] announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011 Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first.\n\nInitially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as \"Facebook-Stalking\". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator [[Mark Zuckerberg]] issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way.\n\nWith the introduction of the \"New Facebook\" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, Facebook announced a redesigned newsfeed.\n\n=== Friends ===\n{{Also|Friending}}\n\n\"Friending\" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a \"friend request\" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the \"Not Now\" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The \"Not Now\" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date.\n\nIt is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as \"unfriending\" by Facebook.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=172936839431357 | title = How do I unfriend or delete a friend? | publisher = Facebook }}</ref> Many Facebook users also refer to the process as \"de-friending\".<ref name=\"PHILIP GALANES\">{{ cite news | last= GALANES | first= PHILIP | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/fashion/24social.html | title= De-Friend Me?

This was discontinued due to privacy concerns and changes to the API.\n\n=== Wall ===\nThe Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see his or her full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed.\n\nIn July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only.<ref>{{cite web | last = Der | first = Kevin | url = http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 | title = Facebook is off-the-wall | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}</ref> In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts.

Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones.\n\n=== {{anchor|Facebook Groups}}Groups ===\n[[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] advertising Canberra in the city news feed]]\nFacebook Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items.\n\nGroups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have three different levels of privacy settings:\n* \"Open\" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining.\n* \"Secret\" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/help/220336891328465|title = What are the privacy options for groups?|date = |accessdate = |website = Facebook Help Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nPreviously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130 |title=New Groups: Stay Closer to Groups of People in Your Life |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> Version 1 or \"new\" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an \"open\" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/migrations/completed-changes#july_2013 |title=Facebook Migrations: Removing 'version' field for Groups |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Events ===\nFacebook events are a way for members to let friends know about upcoming events in their community and to organize social gatherings. Events require an event name, network, host name, event type, start time, location, and a guest list of friends invited. Events can be public or private. Private events cannot be found in searches and are by invitation only. People who have not been invited cannot view a Private event's description, Wall, or photos. They also will not see any Feed stories about the event. When setting up an event the user can choose to allow friends to upload photos or videos. Note that unlike real world events, all events are treated as separate entities (when the reality is some events sit inside other events, going to one event would preclude going to another, and so on).\n\nIn February 2011, Facebook began to use the [[HCalendar|hCalendar microformat]] to mark up events, and the [[HCard|hCard microformat]] for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications. Third parties facilitate events to be exported from Facebook pages to the [[iCalendar]]-format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Wallflux/status/161419742261936128 |title=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketplace ===\nIn 2007, Facebook introduced the Facebook Marketplace, allowing users to post classified ads within sale, housing, and jobs categories.<ref name=\"tc-marketplace\">{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook launches Marketplace, a friendlier Craigslist |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/facebook-marketplace-2/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref> However, the feature never gained traction, and in 2009, control was transferred to [[Oodle, Inc.|Oodle]], the platform powering the functionality.

Launched on May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on Facebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices.\n\nFacebook Platform Statistics as of May 2010:\n* More than one million developers and entrepreneurs from more than 180 countries\n* More than 550,000 active applications currently on Facebook Platform\n* Every month, more than 70% of Facebook users engage with Platform applications\n* More than 250,000 websites have integrated with Facebook Platform\n* More than 100 million Facebook users engage with Facebook on external websites every month\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Facebook changed the way in which the popularity of applications is measured, to give attention to the more engaging applications, following criticism that ranking applications only by the number of people who had installed the application was giving an advantage to the highly [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], yet useless applications. Tech blog [[Valleywag]] has criticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a \"cornucopia of uselessness\". Others have called for limiting third-party applications so the Facebook \"user experience\" is not degraded.\n\nPrimarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly been employed by numerous Facebook application developers. [[Stanford University]] even offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W: \"Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook\". Numerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked amongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million users in a month.\n\n=== Facebook Questions ===\nIn May 2010, Facebook began testing Questions, which is expected to compete with services such as [[Yahoo!

Facebook also said it was supporting an emerging encapsulation mechanism known as [[Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol]] (LISP), which separates Internet addresses from endpoint identifiers to improve the scalability of IPv6 deployments. \"Facebook was the first major Web site on LISP (v4 and v6)\", Facebook engineers said during their presentation.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Facebook said that using LISP allowed them to deploy IPv6 services quickly with no extra cost. Facebook's IPv6 services are available at www.v6.facebook.com m.v6.facebook.com, www.lisp6.facebook.com and m.lisp6.facebook.com.<ref name=\"duffy\"/> In addition, Facebook enabled IPv6 on its main domain names during [[World IPv6 Launch]].\n\n=== Listen with Friends ===\nListen with Friends allows Facebook users to listen to music and discuss the tunes using Facebook Chat with friends at the same time.

However, Facebook was still not entirely convinced, using a \"hybrid\" solution of [[Native (computing)|native computing code]] as a sort of \"picture frame\" for its mobile website. ''[[Mashable]]'' described it as a \"one-size-fits-all nightmare\".<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" /> In October 2011, Apple updated its iOS app with support for [[iPad]], adding larger photos and enabling more functionality, including the ability to post status updates and photos.<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" /> Finally, in 2012, the company relaunched its Android and iOS apps, going mobile-first and putting all of its resources into making an optimized experience for smartphones, including significant speed improvements.<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" /> In the years since, the company has increasingly expanded the feature set of its apps, dedicating more resources and seeing its userbase shifting from the mobile web to its apps.<ref name=\"Mashable mobile history\" />\n\nThird-party companies also created Facebook apps for their platforms.

Using a secret method (initially known as [[EdgeRank]]), Facebook selects a handful of updates to actually show users every time they visit their feed, out of an average of 1500 updates they can potentially receive.<ref>{{cite news|first1=Robinson|last1=Meyer|title=Everything We Know About Facebook's Secret Mood Manipulation Experiment|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/|newspaper=The Atlantic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/business/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed|title=Facebook for Business|work=Facebook for Business|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn September 6, 2006, [[Ruchi Sanghvi]] announced a new home page feature called News Feed. Originally, when users logged into Facebook, they were presented with a customizable version of their own profile. The new layout, by contrast, created an alternative home page in which users saw a constantly updated list of their friends' Facebook activity. News Feed highlights information that includes profile changes, upcoming events, and birthdays, among other updates. This has enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause. News Feed also shows conversations taking place between the walls of a user's friends. An integral part of the News Feed interface is the Mini Feed, a news stream on the user's profile page that shows updates about that user. Unlike in the News Feed, the user can delete events from the Mini Feed after they appear so that they are no longer visible to profile visitors. In 2011 Facebook updated the News Feed to show top stories and most recent stories in one feed, and the option to highlight stories to make them top stories, as well as to un-highlight stories. In response to users' criticism, Facebook later updated the News Feed to allow users to view recent stories first.\n\nInitially, the addition of the News Feed caused some discontent among Facebook users. Many users complained that the News Feed was too cluttered with excess information. Others were concerned that the News Feed made it too easy for other people to track activities like changes in relationship status, events, and conversations with other users. This tracking is often casually referred to as \"Facebook-Stalking\". In response to this dissatisfaction, creator [[Mark Zuckerberg]] issued an apology for the site's failure to include appropriate customizable privacy features. Thereafter, users were able to control what types of information were shared automatically with friends. Currently, users may prevent friends from seeing updates about several types of especially private activities, although other events are not customizable in this way.\n\nWith the introduction of the \"New Facebook\" in early February 2010 came a complete redesign of the pages, several new features and changes to News Feeds. On their personal Feeds (now integrated with Walls), users were given the option of removing updates from any application as well as choosing the size they show up on the page. Furthermore, the community feed (containing recent actions by the user's friends) contained options to instantly select whether to hear more or less about certain friends or applications.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, Facebook announced a redesigned newsfeed.\n\n=== Friends ===\n{{Also|Friending}}\n\n\"Friending\" someone on the platform is the act of sending another user a \"friend request\" on Facebook. The two people are Facebook friends once the receiving party accepts the friend request. In addition to accepting the request, the user has the option of declining the friend request or hiding it using the \"Not Now\" feature. Deleting a friend request removes the request, but does allow the sender to resend it in the future. The \"Not Now\" feature hides the request but does not delete it, allowing the receiver to revisit the request at a later date.\n\nIt is also possible to remove a user from one's friends, which is referred to as \"unfriending\" by Facebook.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=172936839431357 | title = How do I unfriend or delete a friend? | publisher = Facebook }}</ref> Many Facebook users also refer to the process as \"de-friending\".<ref name=\"PHILIP GALANES\">{{ cite news | last= GALANES | first= PHILIP | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/fashion/24social.html | title= De-Friend Me?

This was discontinued due to privacy concerns and changes to the API.\n\n=== Wall ===\nThe Wall is the original profile space where Facebook users' content until December 2011 was displayed. It allowed the posting of messages, often short or temporal notes, for the user to see while displaying the time and date the message was written. A user's Wall is visible to anyone with the ability to see his or her full profile, and friends' Wall posts appear in the user's News Feed.\n\nIn July 2007, Facebook allowed users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas previously the Wall was limited to text only.<ref>{{cite web | last = Der | first = Kevin | url = http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=3532972130 | title = Facebook is off-the-wall | accessdate = 2007-07-30 }}</ref> In May 2008, the Wall-to-Wall for each profile was limited to only 40 posts. Facebook later allowed users to insert HTML code in boxes attached to the wall via apps like Static FBML which has allowed marketers to track use of their fan pages with Google Analytics.\n\nThe concept of tagging in status updates, an attempt to imitate Twitter,<ref name=Parr>{{cite web | last = Parr | first = Ben | url = http://mashable.com/2009/09/14/facebook-status-tagging-live/ | title = BREAKING: Facebook Introduces @Mentions in Status Updates | publisher = [[Mashable]] | date = 2009-09-10 | accessdate = 2013-08-07 }}</ref> began September 14, 2009.

This included when information was changed, when they changed their profile picture, and when they connected with new people, among other things.\n\nThe Wall has been replaced by the Timeline profile layout, which was introduced in December 2011.\n\n=== Timeline ===\nIn September 2011, Facebook introduced \"Timeline\" at its [[Facebook F8|developer conference]], intended to revamp users' profiles in order to show content based on year, month and date. \"Cover\" photos were introduced, taking up a significant portion of the top of pages, and a redesigned display of personal information such as friends, likes and photos appeared on the left-hand side, while story posts appeared on the right. The new design introduced flexible sizing for story posts in the feed, along with more prominent location and photo placement. The Timeline also encouraged scrolling, with constantly loading story posts of users' pasts.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Schulman |title=Facebook Timeline preview and photos: a personal tour |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/09/22/facebook-timeline |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Nancy |last=Messieh |title=New to Facebook\u2019s Timeline?

Examples include: a message being shared on the user's wall or a comment on a picture of the user or on a picture that the user has previously commented on. Initially, notifications for events were limited to one per event; these were eventually grouped category wise. For instance, 10 users having liked a user's picture now count for one notification, whereas in the earlier stages, these would have accounted for ten separate notifications. The number of notifications can be changed in the settings section, to a maximum of 99. There is a red notification counter at the top of the page, which if clicked displays the most recent ones.\n\n=== {{anchor|Facebook Groups}}Groups ===\n[[File:Facebook advertising.jpg|thumb|Human billboard at the [[National Multicultural Festival]] advertising Canberra in the city news feed]]\nFacebook Groups can be created by individual users. Groups allow members to post content such as links, media, questions, events, editable documents, and comments on these items.\n\nGroups are used for collaboration and allow discussions, events, and numerous other activities. They are a way of enabling a number of people to come together online to share information and discuss specific subjects. They are increasingly used by clubs, companies and public sector organizations to engage with stakeholders, be they members of the public, employees, members, service users, shareholders or customers. Groups can have three different levels of privacy settings:\n* \"Open\" means both the group, its members and their comments are visible to the public (which includes non-members) but they cannot interact without joining.\n* \"Secret\" means that nothing can be viewed by the public unless a member specifically invites another user to join the group.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/help/220336891328465|title = What are the privacy options for groups?|date = |accessdate = |website = Facebook Help Center|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nPreviously, in October 2010, there were version 0 (legacy) and version 1 (current) groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130 |title=New Groups: Stay Closer to Groups of People in Your Life |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref> Version 1 or \"new\" groups can contain the name of the group in their URL if the email-address of the group is set. Groups do not have a RSS feed to export the wall or the member list, such as Pages or Events have, but third parties provide such service if the group is set to an \"open\" privacy setting. All groups have since been migrated to a single design.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/migrations/completed-changes#july_2013 |title=Facebook Migrations: Removing 'version' field for Groups |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\n=== Events ===\nFacebook events are a way for members to let friends know about upcoming events in their community and to organize social gatherings. Events require an event name, network, host name, event type, start time, location, and a guest list of friends invited. Events can be public or private. Private events cannot be found in searches and are by invitation only. People who have not been invited cannot view a Private event's description, Wall, or photos. They also will not see any Feed stories about the event. When setting up an event the user can choose to allow friends to upload photos or videos. Note that unlike real world events, all events are treated as separate entities (when the reality is some events sit inside other events, going to one event would preclude going to another, and so on).\n\nIn February 2011, Facebook began to use the [[HCalendar|hCalendar microformat]] to mark up events, and the [[HCard|hCard microformat]] for the events' venues, enabling the extraction of details to users' own calendar or mapping applications. Third parties facilitate events to be exported from Facebook pages to the [[iCalendar]]-format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Wallflux/status/161419742261936128 |title=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=2013-06-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Marketplace ===\nIn 2007, Facebook introduced the Facebook Marketplace, allowing users to post classified ads within sale, housing, and jobs categories.<ref name=\"tc-marketplace\">{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Constine |title=Facebook launches Marketplace, a friendlier Craigslist |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/facebook-marketplace-2/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=October 3, 2016 |accessdate=June 4, 2017}}</ref> However, the feature never gained traction, and in 2009, control was transferred to [[Oodle, Inc.|Oodle]], the platform powering the functionality.

The trend became popular in February 2009, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussing its sudden surge, noting that nearly five million notes were created for the purpose, a doubling of the feature's use in the previous week and larger than any other week in Facebook's history.<ref>{{cite web |first=Douglas |last=Quenqua |title=Ah, Yes, More About Me?

Launched on May 24, 2007, Facebook Platform has evolved from enabling development just on Facebook.com to one also supporting integration across the web and devices.\n\nFacebook Platform Statistics as of May 2010:\n* More than one million developers and entrepreneurs from more than 180 countries\n* More than 550,000 active applications currently on Facebook Platform\n* Every month, more than 70% of Facebook users engage with Platform applications\n* More than 250,000 websites have integrated with Facebook Platform\n* More than 100 million Facebook users engage with Facebook on external websites every month\n\nOn August 29, 2007, Facebook changed the way in which the popularity of applications is measured, to give attention to the more engaging applications, following criticism that ranking applications only by the number of people who had installed the application was giving an advantage to the highly [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], yet useless applications. Tech blog [[Valleywag]] has criticized Facebook Applications, labeling them a \"cornucopia of uselessness\". Others have called for limiting third-party applications so the Facebook \"user experience\" is not degraded.\n\nPrimarily attempting to create viral applications is a method that has certainly been employed by numerous Facebook application developers. [[Stanford University]] even offered a class in the Fall of 2007, entitled, Computer Science (CS) 377W: \"Create Engaging Web Applications Using Metrics and Learning on Facebook\". Numerous applications created by the class were highly successful, and ranked amongst the top Facebook applications, with some achieving over 3.5 million users in a month.\n\n=== Facebook Questions ===\nIn May 2010, Facebook began testing Questions, which is expected to compete with services such as [[Yahoo!
