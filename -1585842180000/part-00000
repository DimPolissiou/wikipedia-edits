It is located on the north side of the current [[Sierra Madre Blvd]] at Hermosa. In 1890 Sierra Madre Blvd was a dirt street called Central Avenue. Old North Church is currently owned by its builder, Sierra Madre Congregational Church. The Old North Church is closely linked with the early settlement of Sierra Madre.<ref name=\"smccnet\">{{cite web|url=http://christchurchsm.org/about/|title=christchurchsm.org/about/, Sierra Madre Congregational Church-(SMCC), Church History, EARLY YEARS|author=|date=|website=smccnet.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>  The community of Sierra Madre was established in the fall of 1881. Sierra Madre Congregational Church started as a [[Sunday School]] class in February 1882. Without a building of its own, the church originally met in the city's original 1882 [[one-room school]]house at the corner of Hermosa and Live Oak, now called [[Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena)|Orange Grove]]. To use the schoolhouse as a church on Sunday mornings, the [[pump organ]], [[Hymnal|hymnbooks]], and winter [[firewood]] were transported to the schoolhouse by the attendees. The following years the Church met in the original [[City Hall]] at the corner Baldwin and Central Ave (Sierra Madre), then the original city [[library]] (1889), located at the current library site.  With the completion of the Old North Church in 1890, the church had its own meeting spot. Congregational Church of Sierra Madre was officially established on March 27, 1886 as a [[nondenominational church]] [[congregational church]], with 13 founding members, called ''First Congregational Church of Sierra Madre'' then. One of the 13 founding members was Mrs. Annetta M. Carter, wife of the city founder Nathaniel Coburn Carter. From 1908 to 1910 the Old North Church was expanded with the addition of new meeting rooms.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/histprop/191.pdf|title=Sierra Madre Historical Preservation Society, Old North Church|author=|date=|website=smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/photo-gallery.html|title=Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www.smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Church's second, and current, main building was built across the street. Construction of the new building started in 1926 with Pritchard Hall and was completed in 1928 with the new sanctuary dedicated on June 17, 1928. The sanctuary cornerstone was laid on Feb. 19, 1928.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /> The 1928 Church building is also a Sierra Madre designated historical landmark, as site #39.

It is located on the north side of the current [[Sierra Madre Blvd]] at Hermosa. In 1890 Sierra Madre Blvd was a dirt street called Central Avenue.

The Old North Church is closely linked with the early settlement of Sierra Madre.<ref name=\"smccnet\">{{cite web|url=http://christchurchsm.org/about/|title=christchurchsm.org/about/, Sierra Madre Congregational Church-(SMCC), Church History, EARLY YEARS|author=|date=|website=smccnet.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>  The community of Sierra Madre was established in the fall of 1881. Sierra Madre Congregational Church started as a [[Sunday School]] class in February 1882. Without a building of its own, the church originally met in the city's original 1882 [[one-room school]]house at the corner of Hermosa and Live Oak, now called [[Orange Grove Boulevard (Pasadena)|Orange Grove]]. To use the schoolhouse as a church on Sunday mornings, the [[pump organ]], [[Hymnal|hymnbooks]], and winter [[firewood]] were transported to the schoolhouse by the attendees. The following years the Church met in the original [[City Hall]] at the corner Baldwin and Central Ave (Sierra Madre), then the original city [[library]] (1889), located at the current library site.  With the completion of the Old North Church in 1890, the church had its own meeting spot. Congregational Church of Sierra Madre was officially established on March 27, 1886 as a [[nondenominational church]] [[congregational church]], with 13 founding members, called ''First Congregational Church of Sierra Madre'' then. One of the 13 founding members was Mrs. Annetta M. Carter, wife of the city founder Nathaniel Coburn Carter. From 1908 to 1910 the Old North Church was expanded with the addition of new meeting rooms.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/histprop/191.pdf|title=Sierra Madre Historical Preservation Society, Old North Church|author=|date=|website=smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhps.org/photo-gallery.html|title=Photo Gallery|author=|date=|website=www.smhps.org|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Church's second, and current, main building was built across the street.

The sanctuary cornerstone was laid on Feb. 19, 1928.<ref name=\"smccnet\" /> The 1928 Church building is also a Sierra Madre designated historical landmark, as site #39.

After his death, some of Ashman's songs were included in another Disney film, ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992).\n\n==Early life and education==\nAshman was born in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, the son of Shirley Thelma (n\u00e9e Glass) and Raymond Albert Ashman, an ice cream cone manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Howard-Ashman.html |title=Howard Ashman Biography (1950\u20131991) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> His family was [[Jewish]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie|title=Don Hahn interview: Beauty And The Beast, Howard Ashman, The Lion King, South Park and Frankenweenie|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/broward/fl-jjbs-beauty-0615-20160613-story.html|title='Beauty' cast member proud of her Jewish roots|last=Glassman|first=Marvin|work=Jewish Journal|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Ashman first studied at [[Boston University]] and [[Goddard College]] (with a stop at [[Tufts University]]'s Summer Theater) and then went on to earn his master's degree from [[Indiana University]] in 1974.\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating from Indiana in 1974 he moved to New York and worked as an editor at [[Grosset & Dunlap]]. His first two plays, ''Cause Maggie's Afraid of the Dark'' and ''Dreamstuff'', were met with mixed reviews. His play ''The Confirmation'' was produced in 1977 at Princeton's McCarter Theater and starred [[Herschel Bernardi]]. In 1977 he became the artistic director of the WPA Theater in New York. He met future collaborator [[Alan Menken]] at the [[BMI Workshop]], where he was classmates with [[Maury Yeston]] and [[Ed Kleban]], among others. He first worked with Menken on the 1979 musical ''[[Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'', adapted from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut]]'s [[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater|novel of the same name]].<ref name=\"VF\"/> They also collaborated on ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' with Ashman as director, lyricist, and librettist, winning the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]]. He also directed the workshop of ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'' by Yeston at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], and after asking why Guido's wife stays with him after she knows he has not been faithful, inspired Yeston to write \"My Husband Makes Movies\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGSajDdVRp8|title=ATW's Working in the Theatre #67 Playscript (Winter 1982)|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nAshman was director, lyricist and bookwriter for the 1986 Broadway musical ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' (music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]]).<ref name=\"VF\"/> Also in 1986, Ashman wrote the screenplay for the [[Frank Oz]]\u2013directed film adaptation of his musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as well as contributing the lyrics for two new songs, \"Some Fun Now\" and \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\" the latter of which received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 1986, Ashman was brought in to write lyrics for a song in Disney's ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While there, he was told about another project that they had been working on for a couple years. The film was ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', Disney's first fairy tale in 30 years. Ashman, along with [[Alan Menken]], wrote all of the songs for the film. Ashman became a driving force during the early years of the [[Disney Renaissance]]. He would hold story meetings and said the animation and musical styles were made for each other which is why Disney needed to continue making musical movies.<ref name=\"VF\"/> He also made strong choices in casting actors with strong musical theater and acting backgrounds. ''The Little Mermaid'' was released in November 1989 and it was an enormous success. Ashman and Menken received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations and three [[Academy Award]] nominations including two for \"[[Kiss the Girl|Kiss The Girl]]\" and \"[[Under The Sea]]\" with Ashman winning both awards for the latter.\n\nIn 1988, while working on ''The Little Mermaid'', Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' to Disney. After he wrote a group of songs with partner [[Alan Menken]], and a [[film treatment]], a screenplay was written by [[Linda Woolverton]], who had worked on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2005/aladdin-crew-reunion/|title=Aladdin: Crew Reunion|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> Directors [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] then joined the production, and the story underwent many changes, with some elements of the original treatment being dropped. Out of the 16 songs written for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', three of Ashman's songs ended up in the finished film, which was released after his death.\n\nDuring early production of ''Aladdin'', Ashman and Menken were approached to help reinvigorate and save the production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', which was going nowhere as a non-musical. Ashman, wishing to focus on ''Aladdin'' and his health, reluctantly agreed. It was at this time that his health began to decline due to his illness. Regardless, he completed lyrical work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' before succumbing to AIDS. The film was released mere months after his death and is dedicated to him.\n\nAlong with Menken, Ashman was the co-recipient of two [[Grammy Award]]s, two Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards. Upon receiving his second Academy Award posthumously, William P. \"Bill\" Lauch, his partner, accepted the award in his stead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://listverse.com/2011/12/01/top-10-notable-people-who-died-from-aids/|title=Top 10 Notable People Who Died From AIDS \u2013 Listverse|date=2011-12-01|work=Listverse|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nOn the night of the [[62nd Academy Awards]], Ashman told Menken that they needed to talk when they got back to New York, where he revealed to Menken that he was sick, and was [[HIV]] positive. He had been diagnosed in 1988, halfway through production of ''The Little Mermaid''. During the making of ''Beauty and the Beast'', the Disney animators were flown to work with Ashman at his home in [[Fishkill, New York]]. He grew weaker but he remained productive and continued to write songs. After the first screening for ''Beauty and the Beast'' on March 10, 1991, the animators visited Ashman in the hospital. He weighed 80 pounds, had lost his sight, and could barely speak. The animators and producer [[Don Hahn]] told him that the film was incredibly well received by the press. On the early morning of March 14, Ashman, age 40, died from a [[heart failure]] caused by the HIV disease, in New York City''.''<ref name=\"times\">{{cite news|first=Eleanor|last=Blau|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/obituaries/howard-ashman-is-dead-at-40-writer-of-little-shop-of-horrors.html|title=Howard Ashman Is Dead at 40; Writer of 'Little Shop of Horrors'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=March 15, 1991}}</ref> ''Beauty and the Beast'' is dedicated  \"To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.

After his death, some of Ashman's songs were included in another Disney film, ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992).\n\n==Early life and education==\nAshman was born in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, the son of Shirley Thelma (n\u00e9e Glass) and Raymond Albert Ashman, an ice cream cone manufacturer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Howard-Ashman.html |title=Howard Ashman Biography (1950\u20131991) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-14}}</ref> His family was [[Jewish]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie|title=Don Hahn interview: Beauty And The Beast, Howard Ashman, The Lion King, South Park and Frankenweenie|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/florida-jewish-journal/news/broward/fl-jjbs-beauty-0615-20160613-story.html|title='Beauty' cast member proud of her Jewish roots|last=Glassman|first=Marvin|work=Jewish Journal|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Ashman first studied at [[Boston University]] and [[Goddard College]] (with a stop at [[Tufts University]]'s Summer Theater) and then went on to earn his master's degree from [[Indiana University]] in 1974.\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating from Indiana in 1974 he moved to New York and worked as an editor at [[Grosset & Dunlap]]. His first two plays, ''Cause Maggie's Afraid of the Dark'' and ''Dreamstuff'', were met with mixed reviews. His play ''The Confirmation'' was produced in 1977 at Princeton's McCarter Theater and starred [[Herschel Bernardi]]. In 1977 he became the artistic director of the WPA Theater in New York. He met future collaborator [[Alan Menken]] at the [[BMI Workshop]], where he was classmates with [[Maury Yeston]] and [[Ed Kleban]], among others. He first worked with Menken on the 1979 musical ''[[Kurt Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]'', adapted from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut]]'s [[God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater|novel of the same name]].<ref name=\"VF\"/> They also collaborated on ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' with Ashman as director, lyricist, and librettist, winning the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics]]. He also directed the workshop of ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'' by Yeston at the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]], and after asking why Guido's wife stays with him after she knows he has not been faithful, inspired Yeston to write \"My Husband Makes Movies\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGSajDdVRp8|title=ATW's Working in the Theatre #67 Playscript (Winter 1982)|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\nAshman was director, lyricist and bookwriter for the 1986 Broadway musical ''[[Smile (musical)|Smile]]'' (music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]]).<ref name=\"VF\"/> Also in 1986, Ashman wrote the screenplay for the [[Frank Oz]]\u2013directed film adaptation of his musical ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', as well as contributing the lyrics for two new songs, \"Some Fun Now\" and \"Mean Green Mother From Outer Space,\" the latter of which received an Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn 1986, Ashman was brought in to write lyrics for a song in Disney's ''[[Oliver & Company]]''. While there, he was told about another project that they had been working on for a couple years. The film was ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', Disney's first fairy tale in 30 years. Ashman, along with [[Alan Menken]], wrote all of the songs for the film. Ashman became a driving force during the early years of the [[Disney Renaissance]]. He would hold story meetings and said the animation and musical styles were made for each other which is why Disney needed to continue making musical movies.<ref name=\"VF\"/> He also made strong choices in casting actors with strong musical theater and acting backgrounds. ''The Little Mermaid'' was released in November 1989 and it was an enormous success. Ashman and Menken received two [[Golden Globe]] nominations and three [[Academy Award]] nominations including two for \"[[Kiss the Girl|Kiss The Girl]]\" and \"[[Under The Sea]]\" with Ashman winning both awards for the latter.\n\nIn 1988, while working on ''The Little Mermaid'', Ashman pitched the idea of an animated musical adaptation of ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' to Disney. After he wrote a group of songs with partner [[Alan Menken]], and a [[film treatment]], a screenplay was written by [[Linda Woolverton]], who had worked on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animatedviews.com/2005/aladdin-crew-reunion/|title=Aladdin: Crew Reunion|publisher=Animated Views|accessdate=2009-05-31}}</ref> Directors [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] then joined the production, and the story underwent many changes, with some elements of the original treatment being dropped. Out of the 16 songs written for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', three of Ashman's songs ended up in the finished film, which was released after his death.\n\nDuring early production of ''Aladdin'', Ashman and Menken were approached to help reinvigorate and save the production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', which was going nowhere as a non-musical. Ashman, wishing to focus on ''Aladdin'' and his health, reluctantly agreed. It was at this time that his health began to decline due to his illness. Regardless, he completed lyrical work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' before succumbing to AIDS. The film was released mere months after his death and is dedicated to him.\n\nAlong with Menken, Ashman was the co-recipient of two [[Grammy Award]]s, two Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards. Upon receiving his second Academy Award posthumously, William P. \"Bill\" Lauch, his partner, accepted the award in his stead.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://listverse.com/2011/12/01/top-10-notable-people-who-died-from-aids/|title=Top 10 Notable People Who Died From AIDS \u2013 Listverse|date=2011-12-01|work=Listverse|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nOn the night of the [[62nd Academy Awards]], Ashman told Menken that they needed to talk when they got back to New York, where he revealed to Menken that he was was sick, and was [[HIV]] positive. He had been diagnosed in 1988, halfway through production of ''The Little Mermaid''. During the making of ''Beauty and the Beast'', the Disney animators were flown to work with Ashman at his home in [[Fishkill, New York]]. He grew weaker but he remained productive and continued to write songs. After the first screening for ''Beauty and the Beast'' on March 10, 1991, the animators visited Ashman in the hospital. He weighed 80 pounds, had lost his sight, and could barely speak. The animators and producer [[Don Hahn]] told him that the film was incredibly well received by the press. On the early morning of March 14, Ashman, age 40, died from a [[heart failure]] caused by the HIV disease, in New York City''.''<ref name=\"times\">{{cite news|first=Eleanor|last=Blau|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/15/obituaries/howard-ashman-is-dead-at-40-writer-of-little-shop-of-horrors.html|title=Howard Ashman Is Dead at 40; Writer of 'Little Shop of Horrors'|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[New York Times Company]]|location=New York City|date=March 15, 1991}}</ref> ''Beauty and the Beast'' is dedicated  \"To our friend Howard, who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul, we will be forever grateful.
