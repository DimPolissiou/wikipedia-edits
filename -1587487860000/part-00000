Being one of the twenty-three [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the Syriac Catholic Church has full autonomy and is a self-governed ''[[sui iuris]]'' Church while it is in full communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome. The Syriac Catholic Church traces its history to the earliest days of [[Christianity]]. After the Calcedonian Schism the Church of Antioch became part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and was known as the Syriac Orthodox Church, while a new Antiochian Patriarchate was established to fill its place by the churches which accepted the Council of Calcedon. The Syriac Orthodox Church came into full communion with the Holy See and the modern Syriac Orthodox Church is a result of those that did not want to join the [[Catholic Church]]. Therefore the Syriac Catholic Church is the continuation of the original Church of Antioch.\n\nThe Church is headed by [[Mar|Mor]] [[Ignatius Joseph III Younan]], who has been the Patriarch since 2009. Its Patriarch of [[Antioch]] has the title of [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch and all the East of the Syriacs]]<ref name=antioch>The title of [[Patriarch of Antioch]] is also used/claimed by four other churches, two Orthodox and two other Eastern Catholic; in 1964 the Latin titular patriarchate was abolished.</ref> and resides in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].\n\n[[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries began to work among the Syriac Orthodox in [[Aleppo]] in 1626. So many of them were received into communion with Rome in 1662, when the Patriarchate had fallen vacant, and the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]], as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan\u2019s death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, one being the uncle of the other, representing the two parties (one pro-Catholic, the other anti-Catholic). But when the Catholic Patriarch died in 1702, this very brief line of Catholic Patriarchs upon the Syriac Church's See of Antioch died out with him.\n\nLater, in 1782, the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] of [[Aleppo]] as Patriarch. Shortly after he was enthroned, he declared himself Catholic and in unity with the Pope of Rome. Since Jarweh, there has been an unbroken succession of [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Syriac Catholic Patriarchs]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Syriac Catholic Church ({{lang-syc|\u0725\u0715\u072c\u0710 \u0723\u0718\u072a\u071d\u071d\u072c\u0710 \u0729\u072c\u0718\u0720\u071d\u0729\u071d\u072c\u0710|\u02bf\u012a\u1e6fo Suryay\u1e6fo Qa\u1e6fol\u012bqay\u1e6fo}}) is sometimes also called the Syrian Catholic Church. Furthermore, it is sometimes referred by its patriarchate, the [[Syriac Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch]]. See also: [[Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-Crusades period===\nThe Syriac Catholic Church claims its origin through [[Saint Peter]] prior to his departure to Rome, and extends its roots back to the origins of [[Christianity]] in the [[Orient]]; in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] we are told that it is in Antioch where the followers of [[Jesus]] for the first time were called \"Christians\" (Acts 11:26).\n\nIn the time of the first [[Ecumenical Councils]], the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] held the [[ecclesiastical]] authority over the [[Diocese of the Orient]], which was to be extended from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. Its scholarly mission in both languages: the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] was to provide the world and the Universal Church with eminent saints, scholars, hermits, martyrs and pastors. Among these great people are [[Saint Ephrem]] (373), Doctor of the Church, and [[Saint Jacob of Sarug]] (521).\n\n=== During the Crusades ===\nDuring the [[Crusade]]s there were many examples of warm relations between Catholic and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] bishops. Some of these bishops favored union with Rome, but there was no push to unify until a decree of union between the Syriac Orthodox and Rome was signed at the [[Council of Florence]] September 30, 1444 - but the effects of this decree were rapidly annulled by opponents of it in the Syriac Church's hierarchy.\n\n===Split with the Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries evangelizing in [[Aleppo]] caused some local Syriac Orthodox faithful to form a pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1667, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]], a supporter of union with the [[Catholic Church]], was elected as Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church.<ref>lexicorient.com/e.o/syr_cath.htm</ref> This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan\u2019s death in 1677, two opposing patriarchs were elected, with the Pro-Catholic one being the uncle of Andrew Akijan. However, when the Catholic Patriarch died in 1702, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government supported the Syriac Orthodoxy's agitation against the Syriac Catholics, and throughout the 18th century the Syriac Catholics underwent suffering and much persecution. Due to this, there were long periods when no Syriac Catholic bishops were functioning, so a Patriarch could not be elected, and the community was forced to go entirely underground. However, in 1782, the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] of [[Aleppo]] as Patriarch. Shortly after he was enthroned, he declared himself Catholic and in unity with the Pope of Rome. After this declaration, Jarweh took refuge in Lebanon and built the still-extant [[monastery]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] at [[Sharfeh, Harissa, Lebanon|Sharfeh]], and by that act became the Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. Since Jarweh, there has been an unbroken succession of [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Syriac Catholic Patriarchs]], which is known as the ''Ignatius'' Line.\n\n===After the split up until modern times===\nIn 1829 the Ottoman government granted legal recognition to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], and in 1845 the Syriac Catholic Church was also granted its own civil emancipation. Meanwhile, the residence of the Patriarch was shifted to Aleppo in 1831. However, after the [[Massacre of Aleppo (1850)|Massacre of Aleppo in 1850]], the Patriarchal See was shifted to [[Mardin]] in 1854.\n\nAfter becoming officially recognized by the Ottoman Government in 1845 the Syriac Catholic Church expanded rapidly. However, The expansion was ended by the persecutions and massacres that took place during the [[Assyrian genocide]] of [[World War I]]. After that, the Syriac Catholic Patriarchal See was moved to Beirut away from Mardin, to which many Ottoman Christians had fled the Genocide. In addition to its see in Beirut, The patriarchal seminary and printing house are located at [[Sharfeh Monastery]] in [[Sharfeh, Harissa, Lebanon|Sharfeh]], [[Lebanon]].\n\n== Organization ==\n\n===Leadership===\n{{As of|2013}}, the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] (an Ancient major see, where several Catholic and Orthodox Patriarchates nominally reside) was Moran [[Mar|Mor]] [[Ignatius Joseph III Younan]], resident in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The Syriac Catholic Patriarch always takes the name \"Ignatius\" in addition to another name.\n\nIn modern history the leaders of the Syriac Catholic Church have been: [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Patriarch Michael III Jarweh]], [[Archbishop Clemens Daoud]], [[Ignatius Ephrem II Rahmani|Patriarch Ephrem Rahmani]], [[Vicomte de Tarrazi]], [[Monsignor Ishac Armaleh]], [[Ignatius Gabriel I Tappouni]], [[Chorbishop Gabriel Khoury-Sarkis]], [[Ignatius Antony II Hayyek]], [[Ignatius Moses I Daoud]], [[Ignatius Peter VIII Abdalahad]], and Ignatius Joseph III Yonan.\nEminent Syriac saints, scholars, hermits, martyrs and pastors since 1100 also include [[Dionysius Bar Salibi]] (1171), [[Gregorius X Bar Hebraeus]] (1286) and more recently Bishop Mor [[Flavianus Michael Malke]].\n\nThe Syriac Church leadership has produced a variety of scholarly writings in a variety of topics. For example, Patriarch Ephrem Rahmani was widely praised for his work in Syriac and is responsible for [[Pope Benedict XV]] recognising [[Saint Ephrem]] as a Doctor of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_05101920_principi-apostolorum-petro_en.html|title=Principi Apostolorum Petro (October 5, 1920) - BENEDICT XV|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref> Likewise [[Ignatius Behnam II Benni|Patriarch Ignatius Behnam II Beni]] is known for imploring eastern theology to defend the Primacy of [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/a546936000bennuoft|title=The tradition of the Syriac Church of Antioch : concerning the primacy and the prerogatives of St. Peter and of his successors the Roman pontiffs|first1=Cyril Benham|last1=Benni|first2=Joseph|last2=Gagliardi|date=1 January 1871|publisher=London : Burns, Oates|accessdate=5 September 2016|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch and all the East of the Syriacs]] presides upon the Patriarchal Eparchy of Beirut and leads spiritually all the Syriac Catholic Community around the world.\n\nThe community includes two [[archdiocese]]s in [[Iraq]], four in [[Syria]], one in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], a [[Apostolic vicariate|Patriarchal Vicariate]] in Israel, a Patriarchal Vicariate in [[Turkey]] and the Eparchy of Our Lady of Deliverance in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\n=== Current jurisdictions ===\nThe Syriac Catholic Church was formally united with the Holy See of Rome in 1781.\n\n;Middle East diocesan jurisdictions\n* [[Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch]] \n** [[Syriac Catholic Patriarchal Eparchy of Beirut]], Lebanon\n* Metropolitan [[Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus]], Syria (without suffragan)\n* Metropolitan [[Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Homs]], Syria (without suffragan;

This rite is clearly distinct from the Greek Byzantine rite of Antioch of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholics]] and their [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Orthodox]] counterparts. Syriac Catholic priests were traditionally bound to [[celibacy]] by the Syriac Catholic local Synod of Sharfeh in 1888, but there are now a number of married priests.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Syriac Catholic church is very similar to their [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Orthodox Counterparts]]\n\n=== Distinction between the Anaphora and the Liturgy ===\nOften when compared with the [[Latin Church]] the meaning of Anaphora and Liturgy can be mixed up. However, there is a clear distinction in the Syriac Church. The Liturgy of St James the Just is the skeleton of the whole [[Mass (liturgy)|Qurbono Qadisho]] with all the prayers before the Anaphora being exactly the same no-matter which anaphora used. The Liturgy of St James the Just comprises:\n\n#The First Service\n##[[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis]]\n#The Second Service\n##Reading from the Holy Books\n###[[Trisagion|The Trisagion]]\n###Antiphon before the [[Pauline epistles|Pauline Epistle]] (Galatians 1:8-9)\n###The [[Pauline epistles|Epistle]] of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]\n#The Third Service\n##The Husoyo (Liturgy of Absolution)\n###The Proemion\n###The Sedro (Main Prayer)\n###The Etro (Fragrance/incense prayer)\n#The Anaphora\n##The Kiss of peace\n##Veiling and placing of the hands prayer\n##The Dialogue\n##Preface\n##[[Sanctus]] (Qadish)\n##Words of Institution\n##[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|Anamnesis]]\n##[[Epiclesis]]\n##Petitions\n##Fracturing\n##Liturgy of Repentance\n###[[Lord's Prayer]] (Abun dbashmayo)\n##Invitation to Holy Communion\n##The Procession of the Holy Mysteries\n##Prayer of Thanksgiving\n##The Dismissal of the Faithful\n\nIn the books of the Patriarchal Sharfet seminary, this order is clearly strict, with the Deacon and Congregation prayer being the same no matter which Anaphora is used. The only prayer that changes when a different Anaphora is used is that of the priest.\n\n=== Liturgical Paraphernalia ===\n\n==== Fans ====\n{{furtherinformation|Liturgical fan in Eastern Christianity}}\nThe Syriac Catholic Church uses [[Flabellum|fans]] with bells on them and engraved with seraphim during the Qurbono. Usually someone in the minor orders would shake these fans behind a Bishop to symbolise the [[Seraph]]im. They are also used during the consecration where two men would shake them over the altar during moments in the epliclesis and words of institution when the priest says \"he took and broke\" and \"this is my body/blood\".\n\n[[File:Ripidion 20060314.jpg|thumbnail|The Syriac Catholic Fans look similar to this but with bells on the edges]]\n\n==== Thurible ====\nThe [[thurible]] of the Syriac Catholic Church consists of 9 bells, representing the 9 levels of angels.\n\n==== Liturgical Symbols ====\nLiturgical symbols are used when a bishop is not present and used at similar times to when the fans are used.\n\n=== Liturgy of the Hours ===\nThe [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is exactly the same as in the [[Jacobite Church|Syriac Orthodox]]. There are two versions of this the Phenqitho and the Shhimo. The former is the more complicated 7 volume version. While the latter is the simple version.\n{{Further | Syriac_Orthodox_Church#Worship}}\n\n=== Liturgical ranking ===\nLikewise the ranking of clerics in the Syriac Church is extremely similar to that of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church#Ranks of priesthood|Syriac Orthodox Church]]. The most notable differences are:\n* Not all celibate Priests take on monastic vows. In the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] all celibate priests are [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|monks]].\n* There is a solid distinction between the major orders and minor orders in the Syriac Catholic Church:\n* A man is tonsured as soon as he receives his first minor order of [[Cantor (church)|Mzamrono (Cantor)]].\n\n====Major Orders====\n* [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]]\n* [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Kahno (Priest)]]\n* [[Deacons|Mshamshono (Deacon)]]\n\n====Minor Orders====\n* [[Subdeacon|Afudyaqno (Sub-deacon)]]\n* [[Reader (liturgy)|Quroyo (Lector)]]\n* [[Cantor (church)|Mzamrono (Cantor)]]\n\n{{Further | Syriac Orthodox Church#Ranks_of_priesthood}}\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe liturgical language of the Syriac Catholic Church, [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is a dialect of [[Aramaic]]. The [[Mass (liturgy)|Qurbono Qadisho]] (literally: Holy Mass or Holy Offering/Sacrifice) of the Syriac Church uses a variety of [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphoras]], with the [[Anaphora of the 12 Apostles]] being the one mostly in use with the Liturgy of St [[James the Just]].\n\nTheir ancient [[semitic languages|semitic]] language is known as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (or \"Syriac\" after the time of Christ since the majority of people who spoke this language belonged to the province of \"Syria\"). It is the language spoken by Jesus, Mary and the Apostles. Many of the ancient hymns of the Church are still maintained in this native tongue although several have been translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and other languages.\n\nSyriac is still spoken in some few communities in eastern [[Syria]] and northern [[Iraq]], but for most Arabic is the vernacular language.\n\n== Martyrs ==\nThroughout the History of the Syriac Church there have been many martyrs. A recent example is [[Flavianus Michael Malke]] during the 1915 [[Assyrian Genocide]].\n\n=== Syriac Catholics in Iraq ===\n{{Further|2010 Baghdad church attack}}\nOn 31 October 2010, 58 Iraqi Syriac Catholics were killed by Muslim extremists while attending Sunday Divine Liturgy, 78 others were wounded.

''Syriac Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch'', is an [[Eastern Catholic]] [[Christian Church]] in the [[Levant]] that uses the [[West Syriac Rite]] liturgy and has many practices and rites in common with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Being one of the twenty-three [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], the Syriac Catholic Church has full autonomy and is a self-governed ''[[sui iuris]]'' Church while it is in full communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome. The Syriac Catholic Church traces its history to the earliest days of [[Christianity]]. After the Calcedonian Schism the Church of Antioch became part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and was known as the Syriac Orthodox Church, while a new Antiochian Patriarchate was established to fill its place by the churches which accepted the Council of Calcedon. The Syriac Orthodox Church came into full communion with the Holy See and the modern Syriac Orthodox Church is a result of those that did not want to join the [[Catholic Church]]. Therefore the Syriac Catholic Church is the continuation of the original Church of Antioch.\n\nThe Church is headed by [[Mar|Mor]] [[Ignatius Joseph III Younan]], who has been the Patriarch since 2009. Its Patriarch of [[Antioch]] has the title of [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch and all the East of the Syriacs]]<ref name=antioch>The title of [[Patriarch of Antioch]] is also used/claimed by four other churches, two Orthodox and two other Eastern Catholic; in 1964 the Latin titular patriarchate was abolished.</ref> and resides in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]].\n\n[[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries began to work among the Syriac Orthodox in [[Aleppo]] in 1626. So many of them were received into communion with Rome in 1662, when the Patriarchate had fallen vacant, and the Catholic party was able to elect one of its own, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]], as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan\u2019s death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, one being the uncle of the other, representing the two parties (one pro-Catholic, the other anti-Catholic). But when the Catholic Patriarch died in 1702, this very brief line of Catholic Patriarchs upon the Syriac Church's See of Antioch died out with him.\n\nLater, in 1782, the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] of [[Aleppo]] as Patriarch. Shortly after he was enthroned, he declared himself Catholic and in unity with the Pope of Rome. Since Jarweh, there has been an unbroken succession of [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Syriac Catholic Patriarchs]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Syriac Catholic Church ({{lang-syc|\u0725\u0715\u072c\u0710 \u0723\u0718\u072a\u071d\u071d\u072c\u0710 \u0729\u072c\u0718\u0720\u071d\u0729\u071d\u072c\u0710|\u02bf\u012a\u1e6fo Suryay\u1e6fo Qa\u1e6fol\u012bqay\u1e6fo}}) is sometimes also called the Syrian Catholic Church. Furthermore, it is sometimes referred by its patriarchate, the [[Syriac Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch]]. See also: [[Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-Crusades period===\nThe Syriac Catholic Church claims its origin through [[Saint Peter]] prior to his departure to Rome, and extends its roots back to the origins of [[Christianity]] in the [[Orient]]; in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] we are told that it is in Antioch where the followers of [[Jesus]] for the first time were called \"Christians\" (Acts 11:26).\n\nIn the time of the first [[Ecumenical Councils]], the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] held the [[ecclesiastical]] authority over the [[Diocese of the Orient]], which was to be extended from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Persian Gulf]]. Its scholarly mission in both languages: the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] was to provide the world and the Universal Church with eminent saints, scholars, hermits, martyrs and pastors. Among these great people are [[Saint Ephrem]] (373), Doctor of the Church, and [[Saint Jacob of Sarug]] (521).\n\n=== During the Crusades ===\nDuring the [[Crusade]]s there were many examples of warm relations between Catholic and [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] bishops. Some of these bishops favored union with Rome, but there was no push to unify until a decree of union between the Syriac Orthodox and Rome was signed at the [[Council of Florence]] September 30, 1444 - but the effects of this decree were rapidly annulled by opponents of it in the Syriac Church's hierarchy.\n\n===Split with the Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[Jesuit]] and [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionaries evangelizing in [[Aleppo]] caused some local Syriac Orthodox faithful to form a pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. In 1667, [[Ignatius Andrew Akijan|Andrew Akijan]], a supporter of union with the [[Catholic Church]], was elected as Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church.<ref>lexicorient.com/e.o/syr_cath.htm</ref> This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan\u2019s death in 1677, two opposing patriarchs were elected, with the Pro-Catholic one being the uncle of Andrew Akijan. However, when the Catholic Patriarch died in 1702, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government supported the Syriac Orthodoxy's agitation against the Syriac Catholics, and throughout the 18th century the Syriac Catholics underwent suffering and much persecution. Due to this, there were long periods when no Syriac Catholic bishops were functioning, so a Patriarch could not be elected, and the community was forced to go entirely underground. However, in 1782, the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael Jarweh]] of [[Aleppo]] as Patriarch. Shortly after he was enthroned, he declared himself Catholic and in unity with the Pope of Rome. After this declaration, Jarweh took refuge in Lebanon and built the still-extant [[monastery]] of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] at [[Sharfeh, Harissa, Lebanon|Sharfeh]], and by that act became the Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. Since Jarweh, there has been an unbroken succession of [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Syriac Catholic Patriarchs]], which is known as the ''Ignatius'' Line.\n\n===After the split up until modern times===\nIn 1829 the Ottoman government granted legal recognition to the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], and in 1845 the Syriac Catholic Church was also granted its own civil emancipation. Meanwhile, the residence of the Patriarch was shifted to Aleppo in 1831. However, after the [[Massacre of Aleppo (1850)|Massacre of Aleppo in 1850]], the Patriarchal See was shifted to [[Mardin]] in 1854.\n\nAfter becoming officially recognized by the Ottoman Government in 1845 the Syriac Catholic Church expanded rapidly. However, The expansion was ended by the persecutions and massacres that took place during the [[Assyrian genocide]] of [[World War I]]. After that, the Syriac Catholic Patriarchal See was moved to Beirut away from Mardin, to which many Ottoman Christians had fled the Genocide. In addition to its see in Beirut, The patriarchal seminary and printing house are located at [[Sharfeh Monastery]] in [[Sharfeh, Harissa, Lebanon|Sharfeh]], [[Lebanon]].\n\n== Organization ==\n\n===Leadership===\n{{As of|2013}}, the [[Patriarch of Antioch]] (an Ancient major see, where several Catholic and Orthodox Patriarchates nominally reside) was Moran [[Mar|Mor]] [[Ignatius Joseph III Younan]], resident in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The Syriac Catholic Patriarch always takes the name \"Ignatius\" in addition to another name.\n\nIn modern history the leaders of the Syriac Catholic Church have been: [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Patriarch Michael III Jarweh]], [[Archbishop Clemens Daoud]], [[Ignatius Ephrem II Rahmani|Patriarch Ephrem Rahmani]], [[Vicomte de Tarrazi]], [[Monsignor Ishac Armaleh]], [[Ignatius Gabriel I Tappouni]], [[Chorbishop Gabriel Khoury-Sarkis]], [[Ignatius Antony II Hayyek]], [[Ignatius Moses I Daoud]], [[Ignatius Peter VIII Abdalahad]], and Ignatius Joseph III Yonan.\nEminent Syriac saints, scholars, hermits, martyrs and pastors since 1100 also include [[Dionysius Bar Salibi]] (1171), [[Gregorius X Bar Hebraeus]] (1286) and more recently Bishop Mor [[Flavianus Michael Malke]].\n\nThe Syriac Church leadership has produced a variety of scholarly writings in a variety of topics. For example, Patriarch Ephrem Rahmani was widely praised for his work in Syriac and is responsible for [[Pope Benedict XV]] recognising [[Saint Ephrem]] as a Doctor of the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_05101920_principi-apostolorum-petro_en.html|title=Principi Apostolorum Petro (October 5, 1920) - BENEDICT XV|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref> Likewise [[Ignatius Behnam II Benni|Patriarch Ignatius Behnam II Beni]] is known for imploring eastern theology to defend the Primacy of [[Rome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/a546936000bennuoft|title=The tradition of the Syriac Church of Antioch : concerning the primacy and the prerogatives of St. Peter and of his successors the Roman pontiffs|first1=Cyril Benham|last1=Benni|first2=Joseph|last2=Gagliardi|date=1 January 1871|publisher=London : Burns, Oates|accessdate=5 September 2016|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe [[List of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch|Patriarch of Antioch and all the East of the Syriacs]] presides upon the Patriarchal Eparchy of Beirut and leads spiritually all the Syriac Catholic Community around the world.\n\nThe community includes two [[archdiocese]]s in [[Iraq]], four in [[Syria]], one in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]], a [[Apostolic vicariate|Patriarchal Vicariate]] in Israel, a Patriarchal Vicariate in [[Turkey]] and the Eparchy of Our Lady of Deliverance in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].\n\n=== Current jurisdictions ===\nThe Syriac Catholic Church was formally united with the Holy See of Rome in 1781.\n\n;Middle East diocesan jurisdictions\n* [[Syriac Catholic Patriarch of Antioch]] \n** [[Syriac Catholic Patriarchal Eparchy of Beirut]], Lebanon\n* Metropolitan [[Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus]], Syria (without suffragan)\n* Metropolitan [[Syriac Catholic Archeparchy of Homs]], Syria (without suffragan;

This rite is clearly distinct from the Greek Byzantine rite of Antioch of the [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkite Catholics]] and their [[Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch|Orthodox]] counterparts. Syriac Catholic priests were traditionally bound to [[celibacy]] by the Syriac Catholic local Synod of Sharfeh in 1888, but there are now a number of married priests.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Syriac Catholic church is very similar to their [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Orthodox Counterparts]]\n\n=== Distinction between the Anaphora and the Liturgy ===\nOften when compared with the [[Latin Church]] the meaning of Anaphora and Liturgy can be mixed up. However, there is a clear distinction in the Syriac Church. The Liturgy of St James the Just is the skeleton of the whole [[Mass (liturgy)|Qurbono Qadisho]] with all the prayers before the Anaphora being exactly the same no-matter which anaphora used. The Liturgy of St James the Just comprises:\n\n#The First Service\n##[[Liturgy of Preparation|Prothesis]]\n#The Second Service\n##Reading from the Holy Books\n###[[Trisagion|The Trisagion]]\n###Antiphon before the [[Pauline epistles|Pauline Epistle]] (Galatians 1:8-9)\n###The [[Pauline epistles|Epistle]] of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]\n#The Third Service\n##The Husoyo (Liturgy of Absolution)\n###The Proemion\n###The Sedro (Main Prayer)\n###The Etro (Fragrance/incense prayer)\n#The Anaphora\n##The Kiss of peace\n##Veiling and placing of the hands prayer\n##The Dialogue\n##Preface\n##[[Sanctus]] (Qadish)\n##Words of Institution\n##[[Anamnesis (Christianity)|Anamnesis]]\n##[[Epiclesis]]\n##Petitions\n##Fracturing\n##Liturgy of Repentance\n###[[Lord's Prayer]] (Abun dbashmayo)\n##Invitation to Holy Communion\n##The Procession of the Holy Mysteries\n##Prayer of Thanksgiving\n##The Dismissal of the Faithful\n\nIn the books of the Patriarchal Sharfet seminary, this order is clearly strict, with the Deacon and Congregation prayer being the same no matter which Anaphora is used. The only prayer that changes when a different Anaphora is used is that of the priest.\n\n=== Liturgical Paraphernalia ===\n\n==== Fans ====\n{{furtherinformation|Liturgical fan in Eastern Christianity}}\nThe Syriac Catholic Church uses [[Flabellum|fans]] with bells on them and engraved with seraphim during the Qurbono. Usually someone in the minor orders would shake these fans behind a Bishop to symbolise the [[Seraph]]im. They are also used during the consecration where two men would shake them over the altar during moments in the epliclesis and words of institution when the priest says \"he took and broke\" and \"this is my body/blood\".\n\n[[File:Ripidion 20060314.jpg|thumbnail|The Syriac Catholic Fans look similar to this but with bells on the edges]]\n\n==== Thurible ====\nThe [[thurible]] of the Syriac Catholic Church consists of 9 bells, representing the 9 levels of angels.\n\n==== Liturgical Symbols ====\nLiturgical symbols are used when a bishop is not present and used at similar times to when the fans are used.\n\n=== Liturgy of the Hours ===\nThe [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is exactly the same as in the [[Jacobite Church|Syriac Orthodox]]. There are two versions of this the Phenqitho and the Shhimo. The former is the more complicated 7 volume version. While the latter is the simple version.\n{{Further | Syriac_Orthodox_Church#Worship}}\n\n=== Liturgical ranking ===\nLikewise the ranking of clerics in the Syriac Church is extremely similar to that of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church#Ranks of priesthood|Syriac Orthodox Church]]. The most notable differences are:\n* Not all celibate Priests take on monastic vows. In the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] all celibate priests are [[Monk#Eastern Christianity|monks]].\n* There is a solid distinction between the major orders and minor orders in the Syriac Catholic Church:\n* A man is tonsured as soon as he receives his first minor order of [[Cantor (church)|Mzamrono (Cantor)]].\n\n====Major Orders====\n* [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishop]]\n* [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Kahno (Priest)]]\n* [[Deacons|Mshamshono (Deacon)]]\n\n====Minor Orders====\n* [[Subdeacon|Afudyaqno (Sub-deacon)]]\n* [[Reader (liturgy)|Quroyo (Lector)]]\n* [[Cantor (church)|Mzamrono (Cantor)]]\n\n{{Further | Syriac Orthodox Church#Ranks_of_priesthood}}\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe liturgical language of the Syriac Catholic Church, [[Syriac language|Syriac]], is a dialect of [[Aramaic]]. The [[Mass (liturgy)|Qurbono Qadisho]] (literally: Holy Mass or Holy Offering/Sacrifice) of the Syriac Church uses a variety of [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Anaphoras]], with the [[Anaphora of the 12 Apostles]] being the one mostly in use with the Liturgy of St [[James the Just]].\n\nTheir ancient [[semitic languages|semitic]] language is known as [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] (or \"Syriac\" after the time of Christ since the majority of people who spoke this language belonged to the province of \"Syria\"). It is the language spoken by Jesus, Mary and the Apostles. Many of the ancient hymns of the Church are still maintained in this native tongue although several have been translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and other languages.\n\nSyriac is still spoken in some few communities in eastern [[Syria]] and northern [[Iraq]], but for most Arabic is the vernacular language.\n\n== Martyrs ==\nThroughout the History of the Syriac Church there have been many martyrs. A recent example is [[Flavianus Michael Malke]] during the 1915 [[Assyrian Genocide]].\n\n=== Syriac Catholics in Iraq ===\n{{Further|2010 Baghdad church attack}}\nOn 31 October 2010, 58 Iraqi Syriac Catholics were killed by Muslim extremists while attending Sunday Divine Liturgy, 78 others were wounded. The attack by [[Islamic State of Iraq]] on the congregation of [[2010 Baghdad church attack|Our Lady of Deliverance Syriac Catholic Church]] was the bloodiest single attack on an Iraqi Christian church in recent history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html|title=Iraqi Forces Storm a Church With Hostages in a Day of Bloodshed|last=Leland|first=John|date=2010-10-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-18|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTwo priests, Fathers Saad Abdallah Tha'ir and Waseem Tabeeh, were killed.<ref>[http://www.undergroundfr.org/action_filrouge.php article at undergroundfr.org], 2010-11-03 (in French), Retrieved on 2010-11-04. \"Trois pr\u00eatres (Saad Abdallah Tha'ir, Waseem Tabeeh et Raphael Qatin) et des dizaines de chr\u00e9tiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9s.\"</ref> Another, Father Qatin, was seriously wounded but recovered.<ref>[http://www.aed-france.org/actualite/a-la-une/2010/11/05/erratum-le-pere-raphael-qatin-nest-pas-decede/ \"erratum: le p\u00e8re Raphael Qatin n\u2019est pas d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107205006/http://www.aed-france.org/actualite/a-la-une/2010/11/05/erratum-le-pere-raphael-qatin-nest-pas-decede/ |date=2010-11-07 }} ''aed-france.org''\n2010-11-05 (in French).
