Mitchell]] a plan for attacking large bootlegging gangs with small teams of Prohibition agents working under special [[United States Attorney|United States attorneys]]. Neither Mellon nor Mitchell moved to implement Hoover's plan until attorney [[Frank J. Loesch]] of the [[Chicago Crime Commission]] approached the president in March 1930, asking his help in bringing down Al Capone. Hoover, facing the political fallout of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], instructed his administration to make the Capone case a priority.<ref name=\"Collins & Schwartz\" />{{Rp|195-196, 239-241}}\n\nAt that time, Capone was already under investigation by agents from the Treasury's [[IRS|Bureau of Internal Revenue]]. In 1929, an investigation led by U.S. attorney [[George E. Q. Johnson]] into a [[Chicago Heights]] bootlegging gang allied with the Capone mob had uncovered financial records suggesting members of the Chicago Outfit could be found guilty of [[Tax evasion|evading]] [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]]. Agents of the Treasury Department's Intelligence Unit, serving under [[Elmer Irey]], used this evidence to convict Capone's brother [[Ralph Capone|Ralph]] of tax fraud in April 1930, but they lacked sufficient evidence to charge Capone when Loesch met with Hoover. In June 1930, Special Agent [[Frank J. Wilson]] was placed in charge of this investigation.<ref name=\"Collins & Schwartz\" />{{Rp|158-172, 205-207, 247-250, 262-263, 265-269}}\n\nIn late 1930, Attorney General Mitchell, impatient with Johnson's lack of progress on the Capone case, decided to implement President Hoover's idea for sending a small squad of Prohibition agents to break up the Capone gang.

Neither Mellon nor Mitchell moved to implement Hoover's plan until attorney [[Frank J.

Hoover, facing the political fallout of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], instructed his administration to make the Capone case a priority.<ref name=\"Collins & Schwartz\" />{{Rp|195-196, 239-241}}\n\nAt that time, Capone was already under investigation by agents from the Treasury's [[IRS|Bureau of Internal Revenue]]. In 1929, an investigation led by U.S. attorney [[George E. Q. Johnson]] into a [[Chicago Heights]] bootlegging gang allied with the Capone mob had uncovered financial records suggesting members of the Chicago Outfit could be found guilty of [[Tax evasion|evading]] [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]]. Agents of the Treasury Department's Intelligence Unit, serving under [[Elmer Irey]], used this evidence to convict Capone's brother [[Ralph Capone|Ralph]] of tax fraud in April 1930, but they lacked sufficient evidence to charge Capone when Loesch met with Hoover.

It is in charge of [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel|one of the largest standing armed forces]] in the world with around 1.8 million active duty military personnel and  military reserves. Constitutionally, the position is attached to the office of [[Chairman of the State Affairs Commission|Chairman]] of the [[State Affairs Commission of North Korea|State Affairs Commission]].<ref name=\"CIC\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[Kim Il-sung]] was the first Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army upon the founding of North Korea in 1948 after he was selected to be the [[List of leaders of North Korea|leader of the country]]. He, upon assumption of power, organized the KPA and had the [[Soviet Union]] equip it with modern weapons, tanks, planes, artillery and ships deemed unusable by the Soviets and communist China. During the [[Korean War]], Kim Il-sung, then the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) as well as the [[Premier of North Korea|premier]] of the government and KPA Supreme Commander, took care of the military operations only to be deprived of command by [[China]] in the latter stages. {{clarify|date=May 2017}}. After the war, he resumed command of the KPA even after his election as President of North Korea in 1972. In the 1990s, since he was aged, Kim handed over the post of Supreme Commander of the KPA as well as the chairmanship of the country's [[National Defence Commission]] that supervises military matters to his son and designated heir as the next leader of North Korea, [[Kim Jong-il]] one year before [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|his death]] in 1994. The elder Kim remained as the President of North Korea, General-Secretary of WPK and Chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, a party organ propagating politics in military affairs. After Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il, being the new leader of the country and the KPA Supreme Commander, imposed a ''[[Songun]]'' policy that prioritized the military affairs of the country before anything else. Kim Jong-il on [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death]] in 2011 was succeeded by his son [[Kim Jong-un]], who replaced him as the new leader of the country and military.

He, upon assumption of power, organized the KPA and had the [[Soviet Union]] equip it with modern weapons, tanks, planes, artillery and ships deemed unusable by the Soviets and communist China. During the [[Korean War]], Kim Il-sung, then the [[General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|General Secretary]] of the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (WPK) as well as the [[Premier of North Korea|premier]] of the government and KPA Supreme Commander, took care of the military operations only to be deprived of command by [[China]] in the latter stages. {{clarify|date=May 2017}}. After the war, he resumed command of the KPA even after his election as President of North Korea in 1972. In the 1990s, since he was aged, Kim handed over the post of Supreme Commander of the KPA as well as the chairmanship of the country's [[National Defence Commission]] that supervises military matters to his son and designated heir as the next leader of North Korea, [[Kim Jong-il]] one year before [[Death and state funeral of Kim Il-sung|his death]] in 1994. The elder Kim remained as the President of North Korea, General-Secretary of WPK and Chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, a party organ propagating politics in military affairs. After Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, Kim Jong-il, being the new leader of the country and the KPA Supreme Commander, imposed a ''[[Songun]]'' policy that prioritized the military affairs of the country before anything else. Kim Jong-il on [[Death and state funeral of Kim Jong-il|his death]] in 2011 was succeeded by his son [[Kim Jong-un]], who replaced him as the new leader of the country and military.
