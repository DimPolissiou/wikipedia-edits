{"title_page": "List of Scheduled Monuments in Flintshire", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe '''county of [[Flintshire]]''' is on the north-east coast of Wales, and two ancient border earthworks run through the length of the county. There are 131 [[Scheduled Monument]]s in the post-1996 county of Flintshire. (The [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], with its unusual separate exclave, is now split between the unitary areas of Flintshire, Wrexham and Denbighshire, so would have had considerably more scheduled sites). There are a great many prehistoric sites for such a small county. With only one confirmed [[Neolithic]] site, it is the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] sites that dominate, 67 of them found mainly on the north-west of the county. In the main these are burial mounds with 8 hillforts and other enclosures. From the Early medieval period, [[Offa's Dyke]] has 10 notable sections in the county, whilst the older [[Wat's Dyke]] has 19 scheduled sections. From the post-Norman medieval period, Flintshire offers a very diverse range of monument types: 20 sites, with 10 different site types, including castles, castle mounds, moated sites, chapels and a holy well, field systems, a deserted village and an abbey. In the post-medieval period, there is a packhorse bridge and a lockup, but it is the industrial sites that stand out, especially the water-powered industries in the Greenfield Valley and the Pottery sites in Buckley. Flintshire lies wholly within the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]].\n\nScheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) have statutory protection. It is illegal to disturb the ground surface or any standing remains. The compilation of the list of sites is undertaken by [[Cadw]] Welsh Historic Monuments, which is an executive agency of the National Assembly of Wales.<ref>[http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/historicenvironment/protection/monuments/?lang=en Cadw: Ancient Monuments and Scheduling.] Accessed 25 April 2013</ref> The list of scheduled monuments below is supplied by Cadw<ref>Cadw will send their list as a spreadsheet, or other electronic formats, on request, as indicated at [https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/listed_buildings_and_scheduled_a#incoming-319360 www.whatdotheyknow.com].

Wales}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scheduled monuments, Flintshire}}\n[[Category:Lists of Scheduled Monuments in Wales|Flintshire]]\n[[Category:Scheduled monuments in Flintshire| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe '''county of [[Flintshire]]''' is on the north-east coast of Wales, and two ancient border earthworks run through the length of the county. There are 131 [[Scheduled Monument]]s in the post-1996 county of Flintshire. (The [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]], with its unusual separate exclave, is now split between the unitary areas of Flintshire, Wrexham and Denbighshire, so would have had considerably more scheduled sites). There are a great many prehistoric sites for such a small county. With only one confirmed [[Neolithic]] site, it is the [[Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] sites that dominate, 67 of them found mainly on the north-west of the county. In the main these are burial mounds with 8 hillforts and other enclosures. From the Early medieval period, [[Offa's Dyke]] has 10 notable sections in the county, whilst the older [[Wat's Dyke]] has 19 scheduled sections. From the post-Norman medieval period, Flintshire offers a very diverse range of monument types: 20 sites, with 10 different site types, including castles, castle mounds, moated sites, chapels and a holy well, field systems, a deserted village and an abbey. In the post-medieval period, there is a packhorse bridge and a lockup, but it is the industrial sites that stand out, especially the water-powered industries in the Greenfield Valley and the Pottery sites in Buckley. Flintshire lies wholly within the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]].\n\nScheduled Ancient Monuments (SAMs) have statutory protection. It is illegal to disturb the ground surface or any standing remains. The compilation of the list of sites is undertaken by [[Cadw]] Welsh Historic Monuments, which is an executive agency of the National Assembly of Wales.<ref>[http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/historicenvironment/protection/monuments/?lang=en Cadw: Ancient Monuments and Scheduling.] Accessed 25 April 2013</ref> The list of scheduled monuments below is supplied by Cadw<ref>Cadw will send their list as a spreadsheet, or other electronic formats, on request, as indicated at [https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/listed_buildings_and_scheduled_a#incoming-319360 www.whatdotheyknow.com].

The majestic [[Araucaria araucana|araucaria]], or monkey puzzle tree, also known locally as ''pehu\u00e9n,'' towers above the other trees. Its fruit&mdash;the ''[[pi\u00f1\u00f3n]],'' a type of pine nut&mdash;is still a staple food for the indigenous [[Pehuenche]]s.\n\nA large part of this natural wealth is protected in various national parks ([[Nahuelbuta National Park|Nahuelbuta]], [[Tolhuaca National Park|Tolhuaca]]. [[Conguill\u00edo National Park|Conguill\u00edo]], [[Villarrica National Park|Villarrica]], and [[Huerquehue National Park]]s), or national reserves ([[Malalcahuello-Nalcas|Malalcahuello]], [[Malalcahuello-Nalcas|Las Nalcas]], and [[Alto Biob\u00edo National Reserve|Alto Biob\u00edo]]).\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Early Mapuche resistance===\nThe Araucan\u00eda is the heartland of the indigenous Mapuche people, who resisted both [[Inca]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] attempts at conquest. After the government accomplished the [[occupation of the Araucan\u00eda]], it subdued the people, and since 1885, the territory has been part of Chile. After sending many forces against the Mapuche, the Spanish had earlier ended their losses by establishing the southern border of their colony in this area at the northern banks of the [[Biob\u00edo River]].\n\n===Chilean conquest===\n{{main|Occupation of Araucan\u00eda}}\nFollowing independence, the [[Chilean government]] opted for peaceful relations with the Mapuche. Effective territorial occupation did not begin until 1862. During this time, the government allowed settlers to found new towns and constructed the [[railroad]], [[telegraph]], and roads into the area. After an occupation and sustained military action, Araucan\u00eda was fully incorporated into Chile in 1882. Many cities and towns in Araucan\u00eda were first developed as army outposts during and after the occupation of Araucan\u00eda. The last portions of the region to be reached by the army were [[Lonquimay|Alto Biob\u00edo]] and [[Tolten River]]'s lowlands.\n\nThese are the regions where Mapuche communities have thrived the best since the Chilean conquest. With the construction of the [[Malleco viaduct]] in the 1890s, the region became more accessible. Settlements in southern Chile became more consolidated.\n\n===Granary of Chile===\n{{see also|agriculture in Chile}}\nUntil the mid-20th century, the large agricultural estates (''[[estancias]]'') that were established in Araucan\u00eda were cultivated in wheat, led to its being called the \"Granary of Chile\". With naturally fertile soil and the implementation of modern technology such as tractors, wheat harvests were extraordinarily high, but because the farmers did not perform  [[crop rotation]], and indiscriminate [[logging]] and burning of woodlands was permitted, soils were prone to extensive [[erosion]]. They lost their fertility and much topsoil was lost to erosion.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Villarrica Lake was developed as a tourism area.\n\n===Economic expansion and renewed Mapuche conflict===\n{{see also|Forestry in Chile}}\nWith the return of democracy in Chile in 1990, Mapuche organizations renewed their land claims on certain territories. Rising violence has accompanied what is now called the [[Mapuche conflict]]. [[Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco]] and similar activist groups have sometimes used arson attacks and death threats to back up their claims; other organizations, such as the Consejo de Todas Las Tierras, have sought and enjoyed international support from nongovernmental and their indigenous organizations.\n\n==Demography==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}\nSpanish settlers first arrived in Aracunia (one of two regional names) in the 1550s, but were unable to subdue the indigenous Mapuche.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Chilean government endorsed a large-scale immigration and settlement program for the area. At the time, Chile often endorsed land allotment advertisement to Europeans, notably in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], from where most of the new arrivals came. Beginning in the mid-19th century with the German Revolutions, immigrants were often fleeing political upheaval and poor economies, and seeking a new place to live. Other immigrants were [[Basques]] from northern [[Spain]] or southwest [[France]], and some [[Argentines]] from across the [[Andes]].\n\nThe current population is descended mostly from internal migration from the Central Zone of Chile; to a lesser extent, it consists of descendants of European settlers who arrived during and after the \"pacification of Araucan\u00eda\". The region has the highest proportion of indigenous residents of any in Chile, around 25%, of which the majority is Mapuche people. About 25% of the population is white or ''[[castizo]]'' (another form of'' [[mestizo]]'' (50%) of partial  European-Amerindian descent), and a large proportion of them is at least partially descended from Spanish colonists.\n\nSmaller numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Arab Chileans|Arab]], and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrants, and people of (North) [[North America|American]] and [[Australian]] descent settled in La Araucania in the early 20th century. Temuco has a thriving Chinese, [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], and [[Syrian]] presence, and [[Capit\u00e1n Pastene]] has a largely ethnic [[Italian people|Italian]] community. Villarrica was where several thousand [[Afrikaners]] or Dutch [[South Africa]]ns settled after their expulsion from South Africa following the [[Boer War]] (1899\u20131903). These towns also were influenced by early [[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonists in the 16th century, when the region was nicknamed [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|New Flanders]]. The [[Netherlands]] later ceded it to Spanish colonial rule.<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01338331911915277755802/p0000001.htm \"Holandeses en Valdivia\"], Cervantes Virtual</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/dest.asp?id=holandesesvaldivia \"Navegantes holandeses en Chile\"], Memoria Chilena</ref>\n\nDuring the past three decades, the city of Temuco has had the highest rate of growth in the nation. According to the census of 1970, about 88,000 inhabitants lived in Temuco. In the census of 2000, 30 years later, the population had tripled to 250,000. The resort town of [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]], on [[Lago Villarrica]], has expanded rapidly. It is located next to the fast-growing resort of [[Pucon]], now one of the four largest  [[Tourism|tourist]] destinations of Chile. According to the 2002 census, the most populated cities are: Temuco (260,783, includes Padre Las Casas), Villarrica (45,531), Angol (43,801), Victoria (23,977), Lautaro (18,808), New Imperial (14,980), Collipulli (14,240), Loncoche (14,191), and Traigu\u00e9n (14,140).\n\n==Economy==\nUntil recently, Araucan\u00eda was dependent on [[cereal]] farming and was known as Chile\u2019s granary. Agriculture has become highly diversified; wheat is still the main crop, but production of oats, grapes, and lupines has increased significantly, and fruit and flower growing are also emerging.\n\nThe main tourism centre in the region is the Villarrica Lake and Puc\u00f3n.\n\n==Municipalities==\nThe region consists of 38 municipalities: \n{{div

The majestic [[Araucaria araucana|araucaria]], or monkey puzzle tree, also known locally as ''pehu\u00e9n,'' towers above the other trees. Its fruit&mdash;the ''[[pi\u00f1\u00f3n]],'' a type of pine nut&mdash;is still a staple food for the indigenous [[Pehuenche]]s.\n\nA large part of this natural wealth is protected in various national parks ([[Nahuelbuta National Park|Nahuelbuta]], [[Tolhuaca National Park|Tolhuaca]]. [[Conguill\u00edo National Park|Conguill\u00edo]], [[Villarrica National Park|Villarrica]], and [[Huerquehue National Park]]s), or national reserves ([[Malalcahuello-Nalcas|Malalcahuello]], [[Malalcahuello-Nalcas|Las Nalcas]], and [[Alto Biob\u00edo National Reserve|Alto Biob\u00edo]]).\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}\n\n===Early Mapuche resistance===\nThe Araucan\u00eda is the heartland of the indigenous Mapuche people, who resisted both [[Inca]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] attempts at conquest. After the government accomplished the [[occupation of the Araucan\u00eda]], it subdued the people, and since 1885, the territory has been part of Chile. After sending many forces against the Mapuche, the Spanish had earlier ended their losses by establishing the southern border of their colony in this area at the northern banks of the [[Biob\u00edo River]].\n\n===Chilean conquest===\n{{main|Occupation of Araucan\u00eda}}\nFollowing independence, the [[Chilean government]] opted for peaceful relations with the Mapuche. Effective territorial occupation did not begin until 1862. During this time, the government allowed settlers to found new towns and constructed the [[railroad]], [[telegraph]], and roads into the area. After an occupation and sustained military action, Araucan\u00eda was fully incorporated into Chile in 1882. Many cities and towns in Araucan\u00eda were first developed as army outposts during and after the occupation of Araucan\u00eda. The last portions of the region to be reached by the army were [[Lonquimay|Alto Biob\u00edo]] and [[Tolten River]]'s lowlands.\n\nThese are the regions where Mapuche communities have thrived the best since the Chilean conquest. With the construction of the [[Malleco viaduct]] in the 1890s, the region became more accessible. Settlements in southern Chile became more consolidated.\n\n===Granary of Chile===\n{{see also|agriculture in Chile}}\nUntil the mid-20th century, the large agricultural estates (''[[estancias]]'') that were established in Araucan\u00eda were cultivated in wheat, led to its being called the \"Granary of Chile\". With naturally fertile soil and the implementation of modern technology such as tractors, wheat harvests were extraordinarily high, but because the farmers did not perform  [[crop rotation]], and indiscriminate [[logging]] and burning of woodlands was permitted, soils were prone to extensive [[erosion]]. They lost their fertility and much topsoil was lost to erosion.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Villarrica Lake was developed as a tourism area.\n\n===Economic expansion and renewed Mapuche conflict===\n{{see also|Forestry in Chile}}\nWith the return of democracy in Chile in 1990, Mapuche organizations renewed their land claims on certain territories. Rising violence has accompanied what is now called the [[Mapuche conflict]]. [[Coordinadora Arauco-Malleco]] and similar activist groups have sometimes used arson attacks and death threats to back up their claims; other organizations, such as the Consejo de Todas Las Tierras, have sought and enjoyed international support from nongovernmental and their indigenous organizations.\n\n==Demography==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2012}}\nSpanish settlers first arrived in Aracunia (one of two regional names) in the 1550s, but were unable to subdue the indigenous Mapuche.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Chilean government endorsed a large-scale immigration and settlement program for the area. At the time, Chile often endorsed land allotment advertisement to Europeans, notably in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], from where most of the new arrivals came. Beginning in the mid-19th century with the German Revolutions, immigrants were often fleeing political upheaval and poor economies, and seeking a new place to live. Other immigrants were [[Basques]] from northern [[Spain]] or southwest [[France]], and some [[Argentines]] from across the [[Andes]].\n\nThe current population is descended mostly from internal migration from the Central Zone of Chile; to a lesser extent, it consists of descendants of European settlers who arrived during and after the \"pacification of Araucan\u00eda\". The region has the highest proportion of indigenous residents of any in Chile, around 25%, of which the majority is Mapuche people. About 25% of the population is white or ''[[castizo]]'' (another form of'' [[mestizo]]'' (50%) of partial  European-Amerindian descent), and a large proportion of them is at least partially descended from Spanish colonists.\n\nSmaller numbers of [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Koreans|Korean]], [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Arab Chileans|Arab]], and [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrants, and people of (North) [[North America|American]] and [[Australian]] descent settled in La Araucania in the early 20th century. Temuco has a thriving Chinese, [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], and [[Syrian]] presence, and [[Capit\u00e1n Pastene]] has a largely ethnic [[Italian people|Italian]] community. Villarrica was where several thousand [[Afrikaners]] or Dutch [[South Africa]]ns settled after their expulsion from South Africa following the [[Boer War]] (1899\u20131903). These towns also were influenced by early [[Dutch people|Dutch]] colonists in the 16th century, when the region was nicknamed [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|New Flanders]]. The [[Netherlands]] later ceded it to Spanish colonial rule.<ref>[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01338331911915277755802/p0000001.htm \"Holandeses en Valdivia\"], Cervantes Virtual</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/dest.asp?id=holandesesvaldivia \"Navegantes holandeses en Chile\"], Memoria Chilena</ref>\n\nDuring the past three decades, the city of Temuco has had the highest rate of growth in the nation. According to the census of 1970, about 88,000 inhabitants lived in Temuco. In the census of 2000, 30 years later, the population had tripled to 250,000. The resort town of [[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]], on [[Lago Villarrica]], has expanded rapidly. It is located next to the fast-growing resort of [[Pucon]], now one of the four largest  [[Tourism|tourist]] destinations of Chile. According to the 2002 census, the most populated cities are: Temuco (260,783, includes Padre Las Casas), Villarrica (45,531), Angol (43,801), Victoria (23,977), Lautaro (18,808), New Imperial (14,980), Collipulli (14,240), Loncoche (14,191), and Traigu\u00e9n (14,140).\n\n==Economy==\nUntil recently, Araucan\u00eda was dependent on [[cereal]] farming and was known as Chile\u2019s granary. Agriculture has become highly diversified; wheat is still the main crop, but production of oats, grapes, and lupines has increased significantly, and fruit and flower growing are also emerging.\n\nThe main tourism centre in the region is the Villarrica Lake and Puc\u00f3n.\n\n==Municipalities==\nThe region consists of 38 municipalities: \n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Angol]]\n*[[Carahue]]\n*[[Cholchol]]\n*[[Collipulli]]\n*[[Cunco, Chile|Cunco]]\n*[[Curacaut\u00edn]]\n*[[Curarrehue]]\n*[[Ercilla, Chile|Ercilla]]\n*[[Freire, Chile|Freire]]\n*[[Galvarino, Chile|Galvarino]]\n*[[Gorbea, Chile|Gorbea]]\n*[[Lautaro, Chile|Lautaro]]\n*[[Loncoche]]\n*[[Lonquimay]]\n*[[Los Sauces]]\n*[[Lumaco]]\n*[[Melipeuco]]\n*[[Nueva Imperial]]\n*[[Padre Las Casas, Chile|Padre Las Casas]]\n*[[Perquenco]]\n*[[Pitrufqu\u00e9n]]\n*[[Puc\u00f3n]]\n*[[Pur\u00e9n]]\n*[[Renaico]]\n*[[Saavedra, Chile|Saavedra]]\n*[[Temuco]]\n*[[Teodoro Schmidt, Chile|Teodoro Schmidt]]\n*[[Tolt\u00e9n]]\n*[[Traigu\u00e9n]]\n*[[Victoria, Chile|Victoria]]\n*[[Vilc\u00fan]]\n*[[Villarrica, Chile|Villarrica]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Araucana]] breed from this area\n*[[Araucanization]]\n*[[Arauco War]]\n*[[Occupation of the Araucan\u00eda]]\n*[[Kingdom of Araucania and Patagonia]]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = La Araucan\u00eda Region\n| Northwest = \n| North = [[B\u00edo B\u00edo Region]]\n| Northeast = \n| East = [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province]]<br>([[Argentina]])\n| Southeast = \n| South = [[Los R\u00edos Region]] \n| Southwest = \n| West = [[Pacific Ocean]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gorearaucania.cl/ Gobierno Regional de la La Araucan\u00eda], Official website {{in lang|es}}\n* [http://www.araucania.org/ Kingdom of La Araucania and Patagonia], website\n\n{{Regions_of_Chile}}\n{{Communes in La Araucan\u00eda Region}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Araucania Region}}\n[[Category:La Araucan\u00eda Region| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of Chile]]\n", "name_user": "Crist\u00f3balrguacl", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araucan%C3%ADa_Region"}

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}|order=flip}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

[[Thai Airways International]] cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's [[fuel fraction]] just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, [[Air France-KLM]] SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340 as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\".<ref>Michaels, Daniel.

The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. [[Lufthansa]], which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340 more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue.<ref name=\"reedbusinessinformationlimited\"/><ref>Haria, Rupa. \"Weight in Waiting.\" ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 14 April 2014. pp. 54-55.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Snecma]] announced that they planned to use the A340 as a flying testbed for the development of a new [[Propfan|open rotor engine]]. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel. The B9 was therefore considered a replacement for the DC-10 and the [[Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=17 October 1981|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1981/1981%20-%203243.html|accessdate=23 January 2011|title=Commercial Aircraft of the World part 2|journal=Flight International}}</ref>\n\nTo differentiate the programme from the SA studies, the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11 (TA standing for \"twin aisle\"), respectively.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\">{{harnvb|Eden|2008|p=30}}</ref> In an effort to save development costs, it was decided that the two would share the same [[wing]] and [[airframe]]; the projected savings were estimated at US$500&nbsp;million (about \u00a3490 million or \u20ac495 million).<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=22}}</ref> The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing bending relief.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km}}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km}} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

[[Thai Airways International]] cancelled its 17-hour, nonstop Bangkok\u2013New York/JFK route on 1 July 2008, and placed its four A340-500s for sale. While short flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel-thirsty take-offs and landings, ultra-long flights require completely full fuel tanks. The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft's [[fuel fraction]] just to take off and to stay airborne. In 2008, [[Air France-KLM]] SA's chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340 as a \"flying tanker with a few people on board\".<ref>Michaels, Daniel.

The IAG overhaul featured improved conditions and furnishings in the business and economy classes; the business-class capacity was raised slightly while not changing the type's overall operating cost. [[Lufthansa]], which operates both Airbus A340-300s and -600s, concluded that, while it is not possible to make the A340 more fuel efficient, it can respond to increased interest in business-class services by replacing first-class seats with more business-class seats to increase revenue.<ref name=\"reedbusinessinformationlimited\"/><ref>Haria, Rupa. \"Weight in Waiting.\" ''Aviation Week and Space Technology'', 14 April 2014. pp. 54-55.</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Snecma]] announced that they planned to use the A340 as a flying testbed for the development of a new [[Propfan|open rotor engine]]. This test aircraft is forecast to conduct its first flight in 2019. Open rotor engines are typically more fuel-efficient but noisier than conventional turbofan engines; introducing such an engine commercially has been reported as requiring significant legislative changes within engine approval authorities due to its differences from contemporary jet engines.

[[Richard Harris]] was the first to record it in 1968; his version peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and number four on the UK Singles Chart. \"MacArthur Park\" was subsequently covered by numerous artists, including a 1969 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Grammy]]-winning version by country music singer [[Waylon Jennings]], and a number one ''Billboard'' Hot 100 disco arrangement by [[Donna Summer]] in 1978.<ref name=Boucher>Boucher, Geoff.

Webb delivered \"MacArthur Park\" to Howe with \"everything he wanted\", but Howe did not care for the ambitious arrangement or unorthodox lyrics and the song was rejected by the group [[The Association]], for whom it was originally intended.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/11/how-we-made-macarthur-park|title=How we made MacArthur Park|last=Simpson|first=Dave|date=2013-11-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==Jimmy Webb songwriting==\n===Composition===\n\"MacArthur Park\" was written and composed by [[Jimmy Webb]] in the summer and fall of 1967 as part of an intended [[cantata]].

In an interview with ''Newsday'' in October 2014, Webb explained:\n\n{{quote|Everything in the song was visible. There's nothing in it that's fabricated. The old men playing checkers by the trees, the cake that was left out in the rain, all of the things that are talked about in the song are things I actually saw. And so it's a kind of musical collage of this whole love affair that kind of went down in MacArthur Park. ...

The breakup was also the primary influence for \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\", another song written and composed by Webb.<ref name=Boucher/> After his relationship breakup, Webb stayed for a while at the residence of [[Buddy Greco]], upon whose piano the piece was composed and originally dedicated. Greco closed all his shows with this number for forty years.\n\nThe idea to write and compose a classically structured song with several movements that could be played on the radio came from a challenge by music producer [[Bones Howe]], who produced recordings for [[The Association]].<ref name=\"newsweek\"/> The song begins as a poem about love, then moves into a lover's lament. The song consists of four sections or movements:\n# A mid-tempo introduction and opening section, called \"In the Park\" in the original session notes,<ref name=\"contract\"/> is built around piano and harpsichord, with horns and orchestra added. This arrangement accompanies the song's main verses and choruses.\n# A slow tempo and quiet section follows, called \"After the Loves of My Life,\"<ref name=\"contract\"/> also recorded by [[Ed Ames]] on his 1968 LP, ''Ed Ames Sings Apologize''.\n# An up-tempo instrumental section, called \"Allegro\",<ref name=\"contract\"/> is led by drums and percussion, punctuated by horn riffs, and builds to an orchestral climax.\n# A mid-tempo reprise of the first section, concludes with the final choruses and climax.\n\n==Richard Harris original version==\n===Background and release===\n\"MacArthur Park\" was first recorded by [[Richard Harris]], after he met the composer at a [[fundraiser]] in [[East Los Angeles, California]] in late 1967. Webb had been invited to provide the musical backdrop at the piano. Out of the blue, Harris, who had just starred in the film ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' and had performed several musical numbers in it, suggested to Webb that he wanted to release a record. At first, Webb did not take Harris seriously, but later he received a telegram from Harris requesting that Webb \"come to London and make a record\".<ref name=Boucher/> Webb flew to London and played Harris a number of songs for the project, but none seemed to fit Harris for his pop music debut. The last song that Webb played for Harris was \"MacArthur Park\".<ref name=Boucher/>\n\nThe track was recorded on December 21, 1967, at Armin Steiner's Sound Recorders in [[Hollywood]]. String, woodwind, and brass overdubs were recorded over two sessions on December 29 and 30.<ref name=\"contract\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wreckingcrewfilm.com/afmcontracts/Harris,Richard_MacArthurPark.pdf | title=Harris, Richard MacArthur Park \u2013 Phonograph Recording Contract | publisher=[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]] | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref>\nThe musicians in the original studio recording included members of the famous [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|\"Wrecking Crew\"]] of Los Angeles-based studio musicians who played on many of the hit records of the 1960s and 1970s. Personnel used included [[Hal Blaine]] on drums, [[Larry Knechtel]] on keyboards, [[Joe Osborn]] on bass guitar, and [[Tommy Tedesco]] and [[Mike Deasy]] on guitars,<ref name=\"contract\"/> along with Webb himself on harpsichord.\n\nThe song was included on Harris's album ''[[A Tramp Shining]]'' in 1968 and selected for release as a [[Single (music)|single]], an unusual choice, given the song's length and complex structure.

The song reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week of November 11, 1978, for  3 weeks, and earned Summer her first nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Summer was also nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Female at the American Music Awards where her album ''Live and More'' took the award for Favorite Disco Album. She became the first female artist of the modern era to have the number one single and album simultaneously on the ''Billboard'' pop charts (the week of November 11, 1978).\n\nItalian producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] would recall that he and his collaborator [[Pete Bellotte]] had been interested in the concept of either remixing a track \u2013 as yet undecided on \u2013 which had been a hit in the 1960s or else remaking a 1960s hit as a dance track: Moroder \u2013 \"I remember that I was driving in{{small|...}} on the Hollywood Freeway, and I heard the original song [i.e. \"MacArthur Park\" by Richard Harris] on the radio. I thought: 'That's it \u2013 that's the song we've been looking for almost a year.'\" Moroder asked [[Neil Bogart]], president of [[Casablanca Records]], to provide him with a copy of the Richard Harris version of \"MacArthur Park\" to serve as basis for Moroder's envisioned discofied reinvention: Bogart obliged with an [[8-track tape]] containing Harris' version, which Moroder had to specially buy an 8-track player to hear.<ref name=\"Red Bull\">{{cite web| url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/04/key-tracks-macarthur-park| title=Key Tracks: Donna Summer's \"MacArthur Park\"| website=RedBullMusicAcademy.com| accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMoroder readily identified \"MacArthur Park\" as (quote) \"a great song for Donna \u2013 with all those high notes, it was perfect [for her]{{small|...}}First, I [located] a key that she could sing really high, but still with a big voice \u2013 that took an hour or two. I played a little piano and she sang it with my accompaniment. We found a key and we had Greg Mathieson do the arrangement \u2013 and then I did something very special\" \u2013 that \"something very special\" being Moroder's recording of his own voice to form a choir heard behind Summer on the song's chorus: \"I recorded about 20 seconds of all the notes, which I was able to sing on a 24-track. I made a loop of those notes, and put that loop in the [Solid State Logic] desk. I could form eight chords by having C-E-G right on the group. I played the chords by moving the track according to the chord that I needed.\" Of basing a discofied arrangement on the template for Webb's arrangement on the Harris version Moroder would recall: \"To be honest, it was a very difficult song to [arrange], especially the brass, but we had the best musicians in town.\"<ref name=\"Red Bull\" />\n\nSummer's recording of \"MacArthur Park\", included as part of the \"MacArthur Park Suite\" on her double album ''[[Live and More]]'', was eight minutes and forty seconds long. The shorter seven-inch vinyl single version \u2013 which omits the song's balladic second movement \u2013 afforded Summer her first #1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], also becoming the last of seven hit versions of compositions by Jimmy Webb to reach the Top Ten on the Hot 100, with \"MacArthur Park\" by Donna Summer being the only recording of a Webb composition to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe nearly 18-minute [[medley (music)|musical medley]] \"MacArthur Park Suite\" incorporated the original songs \"One of a Kind\" and \"[[Heaven Knows (Donna Summer song)|Heaven Knows]]\", the latter being issued as the second single off ''Live and More''. This medley was also sold as a 12-inch (30&nbsp;cm) vinyl recording, and it stayed at number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]{{'}}''s [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart for five weeks in 1978.\n\nThe versions of this medley in ''Live and More'' and in the 12-inch recording are notably different in the presentation of the two original songs. In the 12-inch version, \"Heaven Knows\" was extended to incorporate the instrumental string introduction and the bridge horn solo of the single version for radio stations, but left out the second verse and \"One of a Kind\" was trimmed of a large part of the instrumental break but included the second verse. Lyrically, Summer's rendition is also curious, in that it adds the word \"Chinese\" to clarify what type of checkers were being played.\n\n\"MacArthur Park Suite\" was not included on the [[Compact Disc|compact disc]] version of ''Live and More'' because of early CD limitations; however, the album version is available on 1987's ''[[The Dance Collection: A Compilation of Twelve Inch Singles]].'' The 12\" Special One-Sided Disco DJ Single has been digitally remastered and included on the ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]'' digipak double CD release.  In 2012, \"Live and More\" was remastered in Japan and included the original Lp version of the \"MacArthur Park Suite\".\n\nIn 2013, the song was remixed by [[Laidback Luke]] for the Donna Summer remix album ''[[Love To Love You Donna]]'' (it was also remixed by [[Ralphi Rosario]] and [[Frank Lamboy]]), which was released to dance clubs all over America, having a successful peaking at No.&nbsp;1, giving Summer her first posthumous No.&nbsp;1 and her twentieth No.&nbsp;1 overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/163401-donna-summers-macarthur-park-2013-remix-1-a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720151423/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/163401-donna-summers-macarthur-park-2013-remix-1-a.html |archivedate=July 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Chart (1978\u201379)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|artist=Donna Summer|chartid=0039a}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|1|chartid=0032}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadadance|1|chartid=4638}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|7|artist=Donna Summer|song=MacArthur Park|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|8|artist=Donna Summer|song=MacArthur Park}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|9|artist=Donna Summer|year=1978|week=47}}\n|-\n|Spain Singles ([[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|Promusicae]])<ref name=\"SSs\">{{cite book|author=Fernando Salaverri|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st|date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n|Spain Radio ([[Los 40]])<ref name=\"SSs\" />\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n| UK\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Donna Summer}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|24|artist=Donna Summer}}\n|-\n| U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Disco Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Cash Box]]'' Top 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Chart (2013)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n| U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Dance Club Songs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2013-12-28/dance-club-play-songs|title=Hot Dance Club Songs |work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date= December 28, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboarddanceelectronic|20|artist=Donna Summer}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (1978)\n!Rank\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Australia <ref name=\"australian-charts.com\">{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=40275 |title=Forum \u2013 Top 100 End of Year AMR Charts \u2013 1980s (ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts) |website=Australian-charts.com |accessdate=2016-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006134948/http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=40275 |archivedate=2014-10-06 }}</ref>\n|96\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Canada (''RPM'') Top Singles <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0070a&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=o5r2l6umlaoj7j14trflhtut74 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134819/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0070a&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=o5r2l6umlaoj7j14trflhtut74 |archive-date=2016-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|33\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|US ''Cash Box'' <ref>{{cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1978YESP.html |title=Cashbox Top 100 |date=December 30, 1978 |publisher=Cash Box Archives |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929211008/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1978YESP.html |archive-date=September 29, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|27\n|-\n|[[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1979|US Top Pop Singles (''Billboard'')]]<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 22, 1979 |title=1979 Talent in Action \u2013 Year End Charts : Pop Singles |page=TIA-10 |journal=Billboard |volume=91 |issue=51 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|}\n\n====All-time charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

This arrangement accompanies the song's main verses and choruses.\n# A slow tempo and quiet section follows, called \"After the Loves of My Life,\"<ref name=\"contract\"/> also recorded by [[Ed Ames]] on his 1968 LP, ''Ed Ames Sings Apologize''.\n# An up-tempo instrumental section, called \"Allegro\",<ref name=\"contract\"/> is led by drums and percussion, punctuated by horn riffs, and builds to an orchestral climax.\n# A mid-tempo reprise of the first section, concludes with the final choruses and climax.\n\n==Richard Harris original version==\n===Background and release===\n\"MacArthur Park\" was first recorded by [[Richard Harris]], after he met the composer at a [[fundraiser]] in [[East Los Angeles, California]] in late 1967. Webb had been invited to provide the musical backdrop at the piano. Out of the blue, Harris, who had just starred in the film ''[[Camelot (film)|Camelot]]'' and had performed several musical numbers in it, suggested to Webb that he wanted to release a record. At first, Webb did not take Harris seriously, but later he received a telegram from Harris requesting that Webb \"come to London and make a record\".<ref name=Boucher/> Webb flew to London and played Harris a number of songs for the project, but none seemed to fit Harris for his pop music debut. The last song that Webb played for Harris was \"MacArthur Park\".<ref name=Boucher/>\n\nThe track was recorded on December 21, 1967, at Armin Steiner's Sound Recorders in [[Hollywood]]. String, woodwind, and brass overdubs were recorded over two sessions on December 29 and 30.<ref name=\"contract\">{{cite web | url=http://www.wreckingcrewfilm.com/afmcontracts/Harris,Richard_MacArthurPark.pdf | title=Harris, Richard MacArthur Park \u2013 Phonograph Recording Contract | publisher=[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]] | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}</ref>\nThe musicians in the original studio recording included members of the famous [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|\"Wrecking Crew\"]] of Los Angeles-based studio musicians who played on many of the hit records of the 1960s and 1970s.

The song reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week of November 11, 1978, for  3 weeks, and earned Summer her first nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Summer was also nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Female at the American Music Awards where her album ''Live and More'' took the award for Favorite Disco Album. She became the first female artist of the modern era to have the number one single and album simultaneously on the ''Billboard'' pop charts (the week of November 11, 1978).\n\nItalian producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] would recall that he and his collaborator [[Pete Bellotte]] had been interested in the concept of either remixing a track \u2013 as yet undecided on \u2013 which had been a hit in the 1960s or else remaking a 1960s hit as a dance track: Moroder \u2013 \"I remember that I was driving in{{small|...}} on the Hollywood Freeway, and I heard the original song [i.e. \"MacArthur Park\" by Richard Harris] on the radio. I thought: 'That's it \u2013 that's the song we've been looking for almost a year.'\" Moroder asked [[Neil Bogart]], president of [[Casablanca Records]], to provide him with a copy of the Richard Harris version of \"MacArthur Park\" to serve as basis for Moroder's envisioned discofied reinvention: Bogart obliged with an [[8-track tape]] containing Harris' version, which Moroder had to specially buy an 8-track player to hear.<ref name=\"Red Bull\">{{cite web| url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2016/04/key-tracks-macarthur-park| title=Key Tracks: Donna Summer's \"MacArthur Park\"| website=RedBullMusicAcademy.com| accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\nMoroder readily identified \"MacArthur Park\" as (quote) \"a great song for Donna \u2013 with all those high notes, it was perfect [for her]{{small|...}}First, I [located] a key that she could sing really high, but still with a big voice \u2013 that took an hour or two. I played a little piano and she sang it with my accompaniment. We found a key and we had Greg Mathieson do the arrangement \u2013 and then I did something very special\" \u2013 that \"something very special\" being Moroder's recording of his own voice to form a choir heard behind Summer on the song's chorus: \"I recorded about 20 seconds of all the notes, which I was able to sing on a 24-track. I made a loop of those notes, and put that loop in the [Solid State Logic] desk. I could form eight chords by having C-E-G right on the group. I played the chords by moving the track according to the chord that I needed.\" Of basing a discofied arrangement on the template for Webb's arrangement on the Harris version Moroder would recall: \"To be honest, it was a very difficult song to [arrange], especially the brass, but we had the best musicians in town.\"<ref name=\"Red Bull\" />\n\nSummer's recording of \"MacArthur Park\", included as part of the \"MacArthur Park Suite\" on her double album ''[[Live and More]]'', was eight minutes and forty seconds long. The shorter seven-inch vinyl single version \u2013 which omits the song's balladic second movement \u2013 afforded Summer her first #1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], also becoming the last of seven hit versions of compositions by Jimmy Webb to reach the Top Ten on the Hot 100, with \"MacArthur Park\" by Donna Summer being the only recording of a Webb composition to top the Hot 100.\n\nThe nearly 18-minute [[medley (music)|musical medley]] \"MacArthur Park Suite\" incorporated the original songs \"One of a Kind\" and \"[[Heaven Knows (Donna Summer song)|Heaven Knows]]\", the latter being issued as the second single off ''Live and More''. This medley was also sold as a 12-inch (30&nbsp;cm) vinyl recording, and it stayed at number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]{{'}}''s [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart for five weeks in 1978.\n\nThe versions of this medley in ''Live and More'' and in the 12-inch recording are notably different in the presentation of the two original songs. In the 12-inch version, \"Heaven Knows\" was extended to incorporate the instrumental string introduction and the bridge horn solo of the single version for radio stations, but left out the second verse and \"One of a Kind\" was trimmed of a large part of the instrumental break but included the second verse. Lyrically, Summer's rendition is also curious, in that it adds the word \"Chinese\" to clarify what type of checkers were being played.\n\n\"MacArthur Park Suite\" was not included on the [[Compact Disc|compact disc]] version of ''Live and More'' because of early CD limitations; however, the album version is available on 1987's ''[[The Dance Collection: A Compilation of Twelve Inch Singles]].'' The 12\" Special One-Sided Disco DJ Single has been digitally remastered and included on the ''[[Bad Girls (Donna Summer album)|Bad Girls]]'' digipak double CD release.  In 2012, \"Live and More\" was remastered in Japan and included the original Lp version of the \"MacArthur Park Suite\".\n\nIn 2013, the song was remixed by [[Laidback Luke]] for the Donna Summer remix album ''[[Love To Love You Donna]]'' (it was also remixed by [[Ralphi Rosario]] and [[Frank Lamboy]]), which was released to dance clubs all over America, having a successful peaking at No.&nbsp;1, giving Summer her first posthumous No.&nbsp;1 and her twentieth No.&nbsp;1 overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/163401-donna-summers-macarthur-park-2013-remix-1-a.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720151423/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/163401-donna-summers-macarthur-park-2013-remix-1-a.html |archivedate=July 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Chart performance===\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Weekly charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Chart (1978\u201379)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|artist=Donna Summer|chartid=0039a}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|1|chartid=0032}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadadance|1|chartid=4638}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Ireland2|7|artist=Donna Summer|song=MacArthur Park|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch100|8|artist=Donna Summer|song=MacArthur Park}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Dutch40|9|artist=Donna Summer|year=1978|week=47}}\n|-\n|Spain Singles ([[Productores de M\u00fasica de Espa\u00f1a|Promusicae]])<ref name=\"SSs\">{{cite book|author=Fernando Salaverri|title=S\u00f3lo \u00e9xitos: a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o, 1959\u20132002|edition=1st|date=September 2005|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Autor-SGAE|location=Spain|isbn=84-8048-639-2}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n|-\n|Spain Radio ([[Los 40]])<ref name=\"SSs\" />\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n| UK\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Donna Summer}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|24|artist=Donna Summer}}\n|-\n| U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play|Hot Disco Singles]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n|U.S. ''[[Cash Box]]'' Top 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Chart (2013)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n| U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Dance Club Songs]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2013-12-28/dance-club-play-songs|title=Hot Dance Club Songs |work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date= December 28, 2013|accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboarddanceelectronic|20|artist=Donna Summer}}\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n====Year-end charts====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Chart (1978)\n!Rank\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Australia <ref name=\"australian-charts.com\">{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=40275 |title=Forum \u2013 Top 100 End of Year AMR Charts \u2013 1980s (ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts) |website=Australian-charts.com |accessdate=2016-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006134948/http://australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=40275 |archivedate=2014-10-06 }}</ref>\n|96\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|Canada (''RPM'') Top Singles <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0070a&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=o5r2l6umlaoj7j14trflhtut74 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-10-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009134819/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?&file_num=nlc008388.0070a&type=1&interval=50&PHPSESSID=o5r2l6umlaoj7j14trflhtut74 |archive-date=2016-10-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|33\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|US ''Cash Box'' <ref>{{cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1978YESP.html |title=Cashbox Top 100 |date=December 30, 1978 |publisher=Cash Box Archives |accessdate=October 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180929211008/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/1978YESP.html |archive-date=September 29, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|27\n|-\n|[[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1979|US Top Pop Singles (''Billboard'')]]<ref>{{cite journal |date=December 22, 1979 |title=1979 Talent in Action \u2013 Year End Charts : Pop Singles |page=TIA-10 |journal=Billboard |volume=91 |issue=51 }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|}\n\n====All-time charts====\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

To this day dela Cruz starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role,  and to get international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]] and underdeveloped intellectual capacities, dela Cruz started exercising with everything he could find, and went on to study martial arts at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes. With their production company Liliw Productions, received his billing name Weng Weng and played supporting roles in their films. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''. By the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Dela Cruz started to collaborate with [[Dolphy]], a major local comic, and appeared in three of his films. Between all this dela Cruz started playing of the role of Agent OO as the lead in the film ''Agent OO'' (1981). \n\nIt was the sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), that launched him to brief but international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world.

To this day dela Cruz starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role,  and to get international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]] and underdeveloped intellectual capacities, dela Cruz started exercising with everything he could find, and went on to study martial arts at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes. With their production company Liliw Productions, received his billing name Weng Weng and played supporting roles in their films. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''. By the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Dela Cruz started to collaborate with [[Dolphy]], a major local comic, and appeared in three of his films. Between all this dela Cruz started playing of the role of Agent OO as the lead in the film ''Agent OO'' (1981). \n\nIt was the sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), that launched him to brief but international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films presented to international distributors. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more film ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally, but shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart, and dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry. Dela Cruz spend the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]]. During his last two year dela Cruz was paralyzed and bed stricken because of a stroke and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nDela Cruz became a cult film icon with the passing of time, and with the arrival of the internet dela Cruz became an online sensation, with people from all over the world looking at the mark he left behind. At that time a lot of information published about dela Cruz was mythos, while some of it was true. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013). The latter was adapted into a book with information that either couldn't fit the film or discovered after its making.\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor.

Some have also said that dela Cruz said he would brag about sexual exploit but never saw his actual girlfriends. Director Dante Pangilinan said that dela Cruz had his first kiss on the set of ''Sila... Sa bawat bangketa'' (1977) after he asked Pangilinan if he could get an onscreen kiss, who said yes. According to him dela Cruz was delighted and nervous at the same time.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nProducer Peter and Cora Caballes published account of their relationship with dela Cruz at the time of his prime went as followed. They said that they adopted dela Cruz ten years prior to the released of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' to help him. Filipino action film star [[Rez Cortez]], Franco Guerrero, and Nelson Anderson, who are critical of the couple, have asserted that with the Caballes dela Cruz was provided shelter, received a per diem that was higher than most salaries considering where dela Cruz from and travelled the world. Countries visited by dela Cruz includes [[France]], and [[United States]]. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAside from Vinarao's account, those who responded to the treatment of dela Cruz's by Caballes in the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]''  and book by the same name is negative. The filmmakers said that when tracking the couple down to be interviewed to present their version of the story and to refute any claims made by others, Peter had passed away in 2007, while Cora said they would have to travel [[California]] to conduct one. When they arrived she was nowhere to be found, and since never responded on the matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=205-217|chapter=The search continues}}</ref>\n\nDela Cruz's brother Celing denies their account by saying he was never paid for his film work with them, and they never adopted him just borrowed him when needed as if dela Cruz would go on a holiday with them. Celing went on to say that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another brother of dela Cruz.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nActor Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. He furthered on saying that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. While working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. Cortez concluded that dela Cruz was probably happy with what he got since, considering where he came from, where he went, and had a great deal of life experiences got out of it he but deserved more.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz had a friendship with contemporary Filipino action film star Franco Guerrero. Guerrero said that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old. Guerrero also said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary.

Anderson's account of the time when both were under contract with Liliw Production describes a great friendship polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone. While many felt that dela Cruz was childlike, Anderson said he was a complex adult. Noticing the potential of dela Cruz, they considered making a film. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see dela Cruz again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref>\n\nDirector Eddie Nicart who directed all of dela Cruz's well known films said the following about him. According to him if dela Cruz would get free from the set, he would immediately go where there is drinks and women, and would always ask about where they could be. Nicart a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script.  Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he knew dela Cruz would become famous.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz's brother said that [[Lotis Key]] is the only Filipino celebrity to attend dela Cruz's funerals in 1992.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref> \n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt. Catral said she helped dela Cruz approach women to introduce himself.

Dela Cruz unintentionally took the spotlights from every local action stars and cinema auteurs, making one appearances a day at the festival performing stunts, with exercise and Martial Arts demonstrations.

In 2010, [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' a documentary film that dealt with the Filipino movie exploitation craze of the 1970s and 1980s, paid a special homage to dela Cruz's movie career. The basis of the first film was the 2007 rough cut of Andrew Leavolds's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' released in 2013, about discovering dela Cruz's life.\n\nResearch made on dela Cruz's career showed the he worked on sixteen films during his career, and most likely [[Lost film|lost]], [[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partly lost]], poorly preserved or in storage.

When dela Cruz trained with him with the stuntmen's organisation SOS Daredevils, like everyone else he had to start back in Karate from white belt and gradually go to black, while teaching dela Cruz how to jump and perform stunts from tall heights.

Obeying the usual rules about not stealing, cheating, hurting, and killing is not enough, or at least not enough for those of us who have the great good fortune to live in material comfort, who can feed, house, and clothe ourselves and our families and still have money or time to spare.

The ultimate aim of the effective altruist project is to do as much good as possible; the current focus on wellbeing rests on the idea that, given the current state of the world and our incredible opportunity to benefit others, the best ways of promoting welfarist value are broadly the same as the best ways of promoting the good.\" (p.&nbsp;18)</ref> \"and more reason to benefit them more, and most reason to benefit them as much as possible, at least [[Defeasibility|defeasibly]] and [[all other things being equal]]\".<ref name=\"EA-IEE\"/> This minimal philosophical core of effective altruism is likely to be supported by a wide variety of views about [[morality]] and [[meta-ethics]].<ref name=\"MacAskill-intro\"/><ref name=\"EA-IEE\"/> For example, the moral theory of [[consequentialism]], including [[utilitarianism]], supports the aim of using resources to benefit others as much as possible, but effective altruism is not necessarily, as has sometimes been said, the same as consequentialism.<ref name=\"MacAskill-intro\"/><ref name=\"EA-IEE\"/>\n\nThere are different views about whether effective altruism entails [[Normative ethics|normative ethical]] claims such as \"we should do the most good we can\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Singer|2015}} expressed a clearly normative view: \"Effective altruism is based on a very simple idea: we should do the most good we can. Obeying the usual rules about not stealing, cheating, hurting, and killing is not enough, or at least not enough for those of us who have the great good fortune to live in material comfort, who can feed, house, and clothe ourselves and our families and still have money or time to spare. Living a minimally acceptable ethical life involves using a substantial part of our spare resources to make the world a better place. Living a fully ethical life involves doing the most good we can.\" (p.&nbsp;vii)</ref><ref name=\"MacAskill-definition\"/>{{rp|12\u201315}} One view says that effective altruism is not a set of normative claims (telling what people \"should do\") but instead is a project, intellectual and practical, of \"trying to figure out how to use resources in whatever way will do the most good with a given unit of resources\" and of putting what has been learned into practice.<ref name=\"MacAskill-definition\"/>{{rp|15}} According to this view, the normative ethical theories of consequentialism, [[egalitarianism]], [[prioritarianism]], [[contractualism]], [[deontological ethics]], [[virtue ethics]], as well as many traditional religious teachings on altruism, can all be compatible with the project of effective altruism.<ref name=\"MacAskill-intro\"/><ref name=\"EA-IEE\"/> Effective altruism is not a ''complete'' philosophy of how to live morally, but effective altruism may be relevant for any view that assumes some reason to promote the good and that assumes that the well-being of others is part of the good.<ref name=\"MacAskill-definition\"/>{{rp|19}}\n\nSome people have reported that the questions and answers posed by the philosophy of effective altruism have helped them learn more about complex problems and gain a deeper sense of meaning as well as a feeling of satisfaction about helping others more effectively.<ref>For example, ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' staff writer and self-identified effective altruist Kelsey Piper wrote: \"You're asked to sacrifice to do good, but in return you get real and important results, as well as a life filled with meaning and purpose.
