In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\" /> This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that \"the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies\".<ref name=\"ITUmeasuring2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf \"Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes\"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).</ref>\n\n===Skills and digital literacy===\nHowever, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment.

By income level, we can categorize the population into two broad income groups\u2019 viz., higher income group and lower income group.<ref>{{Citation|title=The New York Times \u2013 Digitising \u2018The Grey Lady\u2019|date=2015|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9780755695218.ch-003|work=Innovators in Digital News|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78453-416-5|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\"The extent to which income is distributed between people asymmetrically among a population has an impact on the certain different aspects of people's lives\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tiene|first=Drew|date=January 2002|title=Addressing the Global Digital Divide and its Impact on Educational Opportunity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09523980210166440|journal=Educational Media International|volume=39|issue=3-4|pages=212\u2013222|doi=10.1080/09523980210166440|issn=0952-3987}}</ref> Although many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83% of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled \u201cDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption\u201d which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.<ref>https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nDigital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook's guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men . Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not.\n\nOnline platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor . However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.\n\n===Disability gap===\nInequities in [[access to information]] technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Research Center, 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/01/21/americans-living-with-disability-and-their-technology-profile/|title=Americans living with disability and their technology profile|last=NW|first=1615 L.

However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities .\n\nPeople with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016\u201317 and 2017-18 according to a report published by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability|Leonard Cheshire]], a health and welfare charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third|title=Online hate crime against disabled people rises by a third|date=2019-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42964068/katie-price-calls-on-mps-to-make-online-abuse-criminal-offence|title='He can't speak to defend himself, I can'|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \u201cfaking\u201d their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.\n\n===Gender gap===\n{{Main|Gender digital divide}}\n\nA paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. The reasoning for this is that most software engineers and programmers are men, and they communicate their learning software in a way that would match the reception of their recipient. The association of computers in education is normally correlated with the male gender, and this has an impact on the education of computers and technology among women, although it is important to mention that there are plenty of learning software that are designed to help women and girls learn technology. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/digital%20divide%20special%20case%20of%20gender.pdf}}</ref> This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the underrepresentation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley (.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies.{{clarify |date=March 2020 |reason=\"Major companies\", plural, is claimed, but only a single company is mentioned and referenced.}} In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon's machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon's computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10-year period. During this ten-year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G}}</ref>\n\n===LGBTQIA gap===\nA number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as \u2018restricted\u2019, a classification designed to filter out \u2018potentially inappropriate content\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-community-anger-over-youtube-restrictions-which-make-their-videos-invisible|title=LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible|date=2017-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbttech.org/post/the-potential-of-5g-to-reduce-the-digital-divide|title=The potential of 5G to reduce the digital divide|last=Director &amp;amp;amp;|first=Carlos Gutierrez-Deputy|date=2020-01-27|website=lgbttech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Age gap===\n\nOlder adults, those ages 60 and up, face various barriers that contribute to their lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).

They may be unable to afford internet access or lack transportation to use computers in public spaces, the benefits of which would be enhancing their health and reducing their social isolation and depression. Homebound older adults would benefit from internet use by using it to access health information, use telehealth resources, shop and bank online, and stay connected with friends or family using email or social networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Namkee G|last2=DiNitto|first2=Diana M|date=2013-05-02|title=The Digital Divide Among Low-Income Homebound Older Adults: Internet Use Patterns, eHealth Literacy, and Attitudes Toward Computer/Internet Use|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=e93|doi=10.2196/jmir.2645|pmc=3650931|pmid=23639979}}</ref>\n\nThose in more privileged socio-economic positions and with a higher level of education are more likely to have internet access than those older adults living in poverty. Lack of access to the internet inhibits \"capital-enhancing activities\" such as accessing government assistance, job opportunities, or investments.

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. These Facebook Native, Facebook Immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}</ref> conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.\n\n==Overcoming the divide==\n\nAn individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}  Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide?

Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/> Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.\n\nFurthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.<ref name=\":2\">Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay</ref> It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm \"UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters\"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001</ref> .Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.\n\nIn the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) programme launched its Online Volunteering service,<ref>[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]</ref> which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.<ref>Acevedo, Manuel. 2005.

The former describes phenomena such as the divided users' demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites hosts thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.\n\n=== Libraries ===\n[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]\n\nAttempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where deficient access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an \"online indigenous digital library as part of public library services.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4190d9002582db2c23292cf7828d9ca3d273016| journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20139 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}</ref> This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.\n\nTo address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training  assistance and guidance in libraries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50\u201352 }}</ref>\n\nIn nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends.  In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In the early 2000s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded a revitalization project through the [[Kenya National Library Service]].  Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons.

[[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions. ICTs and Internet connectivity enable repeated interactions through access to social networks, chat rooms, and gaming sites.

[[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.<ref name=\"Reilley\" /> Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.\n\nSome of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.<ref name=\"Schradie\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 }}</ref>\n\nOther reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status.

The term \"digital divide\" does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.\n\nThere is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/> This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70\u201375% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/>\n\n===Versus the digital divide===\nThe global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that \"Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world\"<ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.\n\nThe global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.<ref>Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.</ref> This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[North\u2013South divide]] of \"northern\" wealthier nations and \"southern\" poorer ones.\n\n===Obstacles to a solution===\nSome people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:\n\n====Physical access====\nInvolves \"the distribution of ICT devices per capita\u2026and land lines per thousands\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.\n\n====Financial access====\nThe cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\" />\nFinancial access and \"the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap\" <ref>\u201cDigital Divide.\u201d The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.</ref>\n\n====Socio-demographic access====\nEmpirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715\u2013736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/>\n\nWhile a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. In the contexts understudy, women with the prerequisites for access and usage turned out to be more active users of digital tools than men.<ref name=HilbertGend2011 />  In the US, for example, the figures for 2018 show 89% of men and 88% of women use the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/184415/percentage-of-us-adults-who-are-internet-users-by-gender/ |title = U.S. Internet penetration by gender 2000-2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cognitive access====\nIn order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.\n\n====Design access====\nComputers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.<ref>[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.</ref>\n\n====Institutional access====\nIn illustrating institutional access, Wilson states \"the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercaf\u00e9s, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|303}}\n\n====Political access====\nGuillen & Suarez argue that \"democratic political regimes enable faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\" <ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy, and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.

(March 21, 2014). Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm</ref>\n\n*Economic equality \u2013 For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Social mobility \u2013 Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Democracy \u2013 Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142527/http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Economic growth \u2013 It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nWhile these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nUsing previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma & Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, \"internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments\" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.<ref name=James-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54\u201361 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}</ref>{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, [[computer literacy]], and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.\n\nIt has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, \"The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control\" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, \"If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}</ref>\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that \"in developing nations\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: \"invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|111}}\n\nThere are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that \"the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.<ref>Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\nOther proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet caf\u00e9s to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.\n\nAt the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]].

Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>\n\nSome cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]</ref> It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 \"Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration\"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 \"City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities\"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010</ref>\n\n===Free Basics===\n{{Main|Free Basics}}\n\nFree Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a \"human right\", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.\n\n\"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.\n\n===Satellite constellations===\n\nSeveral projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said \"It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.\" Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.\n\n===One Laptop per Child===\n\n[[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\">[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).</ref> This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced \"XO\" laptops (dubbed the \"$100 laptop\", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet\u2014as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\"/>\n\n==World Summit on the Information Society==\n{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}\n\nSeveral of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:<ref name=WSIS-03>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html \"Declaration of Principles\"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003</ref>\n:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.\n:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.\n:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.\n:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.\n:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.\n:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.\n:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.\n:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.\n:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.\n\n==See also==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Achievement gap]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|Civic opportunity gap]]\n* [[Computer technology for developing areas]]\n* [[Digital divide by country]]\n* [[Digital divide in Canada]]\n* [[Digital divide in China]]\n* [[Digital divide in South Africa]]\n* [[Digital divide in Thailand]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Society Day]] (October 17 in India)\n* [[Global Internet usage]]\n* [[Information society]]\n* [[International communication]]\n* [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]\n* [[Internet governance]]\n* [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[NetDay]]\n* [[Rural Internet]]\n\n===Groups devoted to digital divide issues===\n* [[Center for Digital Inclusion]]\n* [[Digital Textbook]] a [[South Korea]]n Project that intends to distribute tablet notebooks to elementary school students.\n* [[Inveneo]]\n* [[TechChange]]\n* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education\n| author = UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Azam, M.

As shown by the Figure, during the mid-2000s, communication capacity was more unequally distributed than during the late 1980s, when only fixed-line phones existed.

In 2001, fixed-line telecommunication penetration reached 70% of society in developed [[OECD]] countries and 10% of the developing world. This resulted in a ratio of 7 to 1 (divide in relative terms) or a difference of 60% (divide in measured in absolute terms). During the next decade, fixed-line penetration stayed almost constant in OECD countries (at 70%), while the rest of the world started a catch-up, closing the divide to a ratio of 3.5 to 1. The lower graph shows the divide not in terms of ICT devices, but in terms of kbit/s per inhabitant. While the average member of developed countries counted with 29 kbit/s more than a person in developing countries in 2001, this difference got multiplied by a factor of one thousand (to a difference of 2900 kbit/s). In relative terms, the fixed-line capacity divide was even worse during the introduction of broadband Internet at the middle of the first decade of the 2000s, when the OECD counted with 20 times more capacity per capita than the rest of the world.<ref name=\"HilbertInfoInequality\" /> This shows the importance of measuring the divide in terms of kbit/s, and not merely to count devices. The International Telecommunications Union concludes that \"the bit becomes a unifying variable enabling comparisons and aggregations across different kinds of communication technologies\".<ref name=\"ITUmeasuring2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/material/2012/MIS2012_without_Annex_4.pdf \"Chapter 5: Measuring communication capacity in bits and bytes\"], in Measuring the report Information Society 2012; ITU (International Telecommunication Union) (2012).</ref>\n\n===Skills and digital literacy===\nHowever, research shows that the digital divide is more than just an access issue and cannot be alleviated merely by providing the necessary equipment.

By income level, we can categorize the population into two broad income groups\u2019 viz., higher income group and lower income group.<ref>{{Citation|title=The New York Times \u2013 Digitising \u2018The Grey Lady\u2019|date=2015|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9780755695218.ch-003|work=Innovators in Digital News|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-78453-416-5|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\"The extent to which income is distributed between people asymmetrically among a population has an impact on the certain different aspects of people's lives\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tiene|first=Drew|date=January 2002|title=Addressing the Global Digital Divide and its Impact on Educational Opportunity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09523980210166440|journal=Educational Media International|volume=39|issue=3-4|pages=212\u2013222|doi=10.1080/09523980210166440|issn=0952-3987}}</ref> Although many groups in society are affected by a lack of access to computers or the internet, communities of color are specifically observed to be negatively affected by the digital divide. This is evident when it comes to observing home-internet access among different races and ethnicities. 81% of Whites and 83% of Asians have home internet access, compared to 70% of Hispanics, 68% of Blacks, 72% of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and 68% of Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders. Although income is a factor in home-internet access disparities, there are still racial and ethnic inequalities that are present among those within lower income groups. 58% of low income Whites are reported to have home-internet access in comparison to 51% of Hispanics and 50% of Blacks. This information is reported in a report titled \u201cDigital Denied: The Impact of Systemic Racial Discrimination on Home-Internet Adoption\u201d which was published by the DC-based public interest group Fress Press. The report concludes that structural barriers and discrimination that perpetuates bias against people of different races and ethnicities contribute to having an impact on the digital divide. The report also concludes that those who do not have internet access still have a high demand for it, and reduction in the price of home-internet access would allow for an increase in equitable participation and improve internet adoption by marginalized groups.<ref>https://www.freepress.net/sites/default/files/legacy-policy/digital_denied_free_press_report_december_2016.pdf</ref>\n\nDigital censorship and algorithmic bias are observed to be present in the racial divide. Hate-speech rules as well as hate speech algorithms online platforms such as Facebook have favored white males and those belonging to elite groups in society over marginalized groups in society, such as women and people of color. In a collection of internal documents that were collected in a project conducted by ProPublica, Facebook's guidelines in regards to distinguishing hate speech and recognizing protected groups revealed slides that identified three groups, each one containing either female drivers, black children, or white men. When the question of which subset group is protected is presented, the correct answer was white men . Minority group language is negatively impacted by automated tools of hate detection due to human bias that ultimately decides what is considered hate speech and what is not.\n\nOnline platforms have also been observed to tolerate hateful content towards people of color but restrict content from people of color. Aboriginal memes on a Facebook page were posted with racially abusive content and comments depicting Aboriginal people as inferior. While the contents on the page were removed by the originators after an investigation conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, Facebook did not delete the page and has allowed it to remain under the classification of controversial humor . However, a post by an African American woman addressing her uncomfortableness of being the only person of color in a small-town restaurant was met with racist and hateful messages. When reporting the online abuse to Facebook, her account was suspended by Facebook for three days for posting the screenshots while those responsible for the racist comments she received were not suspended. Shared experiences between people of color can be at risk of being silenced under removal policies for online platforms.\n\n===Disability gap===\nInequities in [[access to information]] technologies are present among individuals living with a disability in comparison to those who are not living with a disability. According to The Pew Research Center, 54% of households with a person who has a disability have home internet access compared to 81% of households that have home internet access and do not have a person who has a disability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2011/01/21/americans-living-with-disability-and-their-technology-profile/|title=Americans living with disability and their technology profile|last=NW|first=1615 L.

However, there is still a lack of access to technology and home internet access among those who have a cognitive and auditory disability as well. There is a concern of whether or not the increase in the use of information technologies will increase equality through offering opportunities for individuals living with disabilities or whether it will only add to the present inequalities and lead to individuals living with disabilities being left behind in society. Issues such as the perception of disabilities in society, Federal and state government policy, corporate policy, mainstream computing technologies, and real-time online communication have been found to contribute to the impact of the digital divide on individuals with disabilities .\n\nPeople with disabilities are also the targets of online abuse. Online disability hate crimes have increased by 33% across the UK between 2016\u201317 and 2017-18 according to a report published by [[Leonard Cheshire Disability|Leonard Cheshire]], a health and welfare charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/10/online-hate-against-disabled-people-rises-by-a-third|title=Online hate crime against disabled people rises by a third|date=2019-05-10|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Accounts of online hate abuse towards people with disabilities were shared during an incident in 2019 when model Katie Price's son was the target of online abuse that was attributed to him having a disability. In response to the abuse, a campaign was launched by Katie Price to ensure that Britain's MP's held those who are guilty of perpetuating online abuse towards those with disabilities accountable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-42964068/katie-price-calls-on-mps-to-make-online-abuse-criminal-offence|title='He can't speak to defend himself, I can'|website=BBC News|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Online abuse towards individuals with disabilities is a factor that can discourage people from engaging online which could prevent people from learning information that could improve their lives. Many individuals living with disabilities face online abuse in the form of accusations of benefit fraud and \u201cfaking\u201d their disability for financial gain, which in some cases leads to unnecessary investigations.\n\n===Gender gap===\n{{Main|Gender digital divide}}\n\nA paper published by J. Cooper from Princeton University points out that learning technology is designed to be receptive to men instead of women. The reasoning for this is that most software engineers and programmers are men, and they communicate their learning software in a way that would match the reception of their recipient. The association of computers in education is normally correlated with the male gender, and this has an impact on the education of computers and technology among women, although it is important to mention that there are plenty of learning software that are designed to help women and girls learn technology. Overall, the study presents the problem of various perspectives in society that are a result of gendered socialization patterns that believe that computers are a part of the male experience since computers have traditionally presented as a toy for boys when they are children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.pcw.gov.ph/sites/default/files/digital%20divide%20special%20case%20of%20gender.pdf}}</ref> This divide is followed as children grow older and young girls are not encouraged as much to pursue degrees in IT and computer science. In 1990, the percentage of women in computing jobs was 36%, however in 2016, this number had fallen to 25%. This can be seen in the underrepresentation of women in IT hubs such as Silicon Valley (.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/04/why-is-silicon-valley-so-awful-to-women/517788/}}</ref>\n\nThere has also been the presence of algorithmic bias that has been shown in machine learning algorithms that are implemented by major companies.{{clarify |date=March 2020 |reason=\"Major companies\", plural, is claimed, but only a single company is mentioned and referenced.}} In 2015, Amazon had to abandon a recruiting algorithm that showed a difference between ratings that candidates received for software developer jobs as well as other technical jobs. As a result, it was revealed that Amazon's machine algorithm was biased against women and favored male resumes over female resumes. This was due to the fact that Amazon's computer models were trained to vet patterns in resumes over a 10-year period. During this ten-year period, the majority of the resumes belong to male individuals, which is a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G}}</ref>\n\n===LGBTQIA gap===\nA number of states, including some that have introduced new laws since 2010, notably censor voices from and content related to the LGBTQI community, posing serious consequences to access to information about sexual orientation and gender identity. Digital platforms play a powerful role in limiting access to certain content, such as YouTube's 2017 decision to classify non-explicit videos with LGBTQIA themes as \u2018restricted\u2019, a classification designed to filter out \u2018potentially inappropriate content\u2019.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hunt|first=Elle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/20/lgbt-community-anger-over-youtube-restrictions-which-make-their-videos-invisible|title=LGBT community anger over YouTube restrictions which make their videos invisible|date=2017-03-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The internet provides information that can create a safe space for marginalized groups such as the LGBTQIA community to connect with others and engage in honest dialogues and conversations that are affecting their communities. It can also be viewed as an agent of change for the LGBTQIA community and provide a means of engaging in social justice. It can allow for LGBTQIA individuals who may be living in rural areas or in areas where they are isolated to gain access to information that are not within their rural system as well as gaining information from other LGBT individuals. This includes information such as healthcare, partners, and news. GayHealth provides online medical and health information and Gay and Lesbians Alliance Against Defamation contains online publications and news that focus on human rights campaigns and issues focused on LGBTQIA issues. The Internet also allows LGBTQIA individuals to maintain anonymity. Lack of access to the internet can hinder these things, due to lack of broadband access in remote rural areas. LGBT Tech has emphasized launching newer technologies with 5G technology in order to help close the digital divide that can cause members of the LGBTQIA community to lose access to reliable and fast technology that can provide information on healthcare, economic opportunities, and safe communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lgbttech.org/post/the-potential-of-5g-to-reduce-the-digital-divide|title=The potential of 5G to reduce the digital divide|last=Director &amp;amp;amp;|first=Carlos Gutierrez-Deputy|date=2020-01-27|website=lgbttech|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Age gap===\n\nOlder adults, those ages 60 and up, face various barriers that contribute to their lack of access to information and communication technologies (ICTs).

They may be unable to afford internet access or lack transportation to use computers in public spaces, the benefits of which would be enhancing their health and reducing their social isolation and depression. Homebound older adults would benefit from internet use by using it to access health information, use telehealth resources, shop and bank online, and stay connected with friends or family using email or social networks.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Namkee G|last2=DiNitto|first2=Diana M|date=2013-05-02|title=The Digital Divide Among Low-Income Homebound Older Adults: Internet Use Patterns, eHealth Literacy, and Attitudes Toward Computer/Internet Use|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=e93|doi=10.2196/jmir.2645|pmc=3650931|pmid=23639979}}</ref>\n\nThose in more privileged socio-economic positions and with a higher level of education are more likely to have internet access than those older adults living in poverty. Lack of access to the internet inhibits \"capital-enhancing activities\" such as accessing government assistance, job opportunities, or investments.

The Facebook Divide, Facebook native, Facebook immigrants, and Facebook left-behind are concepts for social and business management research. Facebook Immigrants are utilizing Facebook for their accumulation of both bonding and bridging social capital. These Facebook Native, Facebook Immigrants, and Facebook left-behind induced the situation of Facebook inequality. In February 2018, the Facebook Divide Index was introduced at the ICMAPRANE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jaipuria.ac.in/icmaprane2018/icmaprane-2018/ |title=ICMAPRANE 2018 |work=Jaipuria.ac.in |date=June 20, 2014 |accessdate=2018-10-26}}</ref> conference in Noida, India, to illustrate the Facebook Divide phenomenon.\n\n==Overcoming the divide==\n\nAn individual must be able to connect in order to achieve enhancement of social and [[cultural capital]] as well as achieve mass economic gains in productivity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}  Therefore, access is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for overcoming the digital divide. Access to ICT meets significant challenges that stem from income restrictions. The borderline between ICT as a [[necessity good]] and ICT as a [[luxury good]] is roughly around the \"magical number\" of US$10 per person per month, or US$120 per year,<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = When is Cheap, Cheap Enough to Bridge the Digital Divide?

Since more than 40% of the world population lives on less than US$2 per day, and around 20% live on less than US$1 per day (or less than US$365 per year), these income segments would have to spend one third of their income on ICT (120/365 = 33%). The global average of ICT spending is at a mere 3% of income.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/> Potential solutions include driving down the costs of ICT, which includes low-cost technologies and shared access through [[Telecentre]]s.\n\nFurthermore, even though individuals might be capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry, such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of adequate infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals can connect, but they do not have the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them. This leads to a focus on capabilities and skills, as well as awareness to move from mere access to effective usage of ICT.<ref name=\":2\">Karen Mossberger (2003). Virtual Inequality: Beyond the Digital Divide. Georgetown University Press</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] is aiming to raise awareness of the divide by way of the [[World Information Society Day]] which has taken place yearly since May 17, 2006.<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/resources/news-and-in-focus-articles/in-focus-articles/ United Nations Educational] UNDay</ref> It also set up the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Task Force in November 2001.<ref>[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/dev2353.doc.htm \"UN Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) Task Force Launched Today at Headquarters\"], Press Release, United Nations (New York), November 20, 2001</ref>  \"United Nations is trying to achieve the goal of true parity between men and women by fostering awareness, making a political commitment, accumulating resources, sharing knowledge and utilizing different talents, capabilities and terminating the digital gender gap by 2030\".<ref name=\":6\" /> Later [[UN]] initiatives in this area are the [[World Summit on the Information Society]], which was set up in 2003, and the [[Internet Governance Forum]], set up in 2006.\n\nIn the year 2000, the [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) programme launched its Online Volunteering service,<ref>[https://onlinevolunteering.org Online Volunteering]</ref> which uses ICT as a vehicle for and in support of volunteering. It constitutes an example of a volunteering initiative that effectively contributes to bridge the digital divide. ICT-enabled volunteering has a clear added value for development. If more people collaborate online with more development institutions and initiatives, this will imply an increase in person-hours dedicated to development cooperation at essentially no additional cost. This is the most visible effect of online volunteering for human development.<ref>Acevedo, Manuel. 2005.

The former describes phenomena such as the divided users' demographics that make up sites such as Facebook and Myspace or Word Press and Tumblr. Each of these sites hosts thriving communities that engage with otherwise [[marginalized]] populations. An example of this is the large online community devoted to Afrofuturism, a discourse that critiques dominant structures of power by merging themes of science fiction and blackness. Social media brings together minds that may not otherwise meet, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and empowerment of marginalized discourses.\n\n=== Libraries ===\n[[File:13394-Laptops Anytime Launch-6629 (10844113484).jpg|thumb|A laptop lending kiosk at [[Texas A&M University\u2013Commerce]]'s Gee Library]]\n\nAttempts to bridge the digital divide include a program developed in Durban, South Africa, where deficient access to technology and a lack of documented cultural heritage has motivated the creation of an \"online indigenous digital library as part of public library services.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Greyling | first1 = E. | last2 = Zulu | first2 = S. | year = 2010 | title = Content development in an indigenous digital library: A case study in community participation | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4190d9002582db2c23292cf7828d9ca3d273016| journal = IFLA Journal | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20139 | doi = 10.1177/0340035209359570 }}</ref> This project has the potential to narrow the digital divide by not only giving the people of the Durban area access to this digital resource, but also by incorporating the community members into the process of creating it.\n\nTo address the divide [[The Gates Foundation]] started the Gates Library Initiative which provides training  assistance and guidance in libraries.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Blau | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Access isn't enough: Merely connecting people and computers won't close the digital divide | url = | journal = American Libraries | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 50\u201352 }}</ref>\n\nIn nations where poverty compounds effects of the digital divide, programs are emerging to counter those trends.  In Kenya, lack of funding, language, and technology illiteracy contributed to an overall lack of computer skills and educational advancement. This slowly began to change when foreign investment began.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} In the early 2000s, the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] funded a revitalization project through the [[Kenya National Library Service]].  Those resources enabled public libraries to provide information and communication technologies to their patrons.

[[Social capital]] is acquired through repeated interactions with other individuals or groups of individuals. Connecting to the Internet creates another set of means by which to achieve repeated interactions.

[[Web 2.0]] technologies like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Blogs enable users to participate online and create content without having to understand how the technology actually works, leading to an ever-increasing digital divide between those who have the skills and understanding to interact more fully with the technology and those who are passive consumers of it.<ref name=\"Reilley\" /> Many are only nominal content creators through the use of Web 2.0, posting photos and status updates on Facebook, but not truly interacting with the technology.\n\nSome of the reasons for this production gap include material factors like the type of Internet connection one has and the frequency of access to the Internet. The more frequently a person has access to the Internet and the faster the connection, the more opportunities they have to gain the technology skills and the more time they have to be creative.<ref name=\"Schradie\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schradie | first1 = Jen | year = 2011 | title = The Digital Production Gap: The Digital Divide and Web 2.0 Collide | url = http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120227005023/http://sociology.berkeley.edu/documents/newspage_docs/J.%20Schradie%20-%20The%20Digital%20Production%20Gap%20for%20Web%20Post%20Poetics.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2012-02-27 | journal = Poetics | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145\u2013168 | doi = 10.1016/j.poetic.2011.02.003 }}</ref>\n\nOther reasons include cultural factors often associated with class and socioeconomic status.

The term \"digital divide\" does not necessarily mean that someone does not have technology; it could mean that there is simply a difference in technology.  These differences can refer to, for example, high-quality computers, fast Internet, technical assistance, or telephone services. The difference between all of these is also considered a gap.\n\nThere is a large inequality worldwide in terms of the distribution of installed telecommunication bandwidth. In 2014 only three countries (China, US, Japan) host 50% of the globally installed bandwidth potential (see pie-chart Figure on the right).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/> This concentration is not new, as historically only ten countries have hosted 70\u201375% of the global telecommunication capacity (see Figure). The U.S. lost its global leadership in terms of installed bandwidth in 2011, being replaced by China, which hosts more than twice as much national bandwidth potential in 2014 (29% versus 13% of the global total).<ref name=\"HilbertBitsDivide\"/>\n\n===Versus the digital divide===\nThe global digital divide is a special case of the digital divide; the focus is set on the fact that \"Internet has developed unevenly throughout the world\"<ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|681}} causing some countries to fall behind in technology, education, labor, democracy, and tourism.  The concept of the digital divide was originally popularized regarding the disparity in Internet access between rural and urban areas of the United States of America; the ''global'' digital divide mirrors this disparity on an international scale.\n\nThe global digital divide also contributes to the inequality of access to goods and services available through technology.  Computers and the Internet provide users with improved education, which can lead to higher wages; the people living in nations with limited access are therefore disadvantaged.<ref>Krueger 1993; Attewell and Battle 1999.</ref> This global divide is often characterized as falling along what is sometimes called the [[North\u2013South divide]] of \"northern\" wealthier nations and \"southern\" poorer ones.\n\n===Obstacles to a solution===\nSome people argue that necessities need to be considered before achieving digital inclusion, such as an ample food supply and quality health care.  Minimizing the global digital divide requires considering and addressing the following types of access:\n\n====Physical access====\nInvolves \"the distribution of ICT devices per capita\u2026and land lines per thousands\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|306}}  Individuals need to obtain access to computers, landlines, and networks in order to access the Internet. This access barrier is also addressed in Article 21 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the United Nations.\n\n====Financial access====\nThe cost of ICT devices, traffic, applications, technician and educator training, software, maintenance, and infrastructures require ongoing financial means.<ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\" />\nFinancial access and \"the levels of household income play a significant role in widening the gap\" <ref>\u201cDigital Divide.\u201d The Digital Divide, Stanford University, cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/digital-divide/start.html. Retrieved September 19, 2017.</ref>\n\n====Socio-demographic access====\nEmpirical tests have identified that several socio-demographic characteristics foster or limit ICT access and usage. Among different countries, educational levels and income are the most powerful explanatory variables, with age being a third one.<ref name=\"HilbertDigDiv2011\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin| title = The end justifies the definition: The manifold outlooks on the digital divide and their practical usefulness for policy-making | doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2011.06.012 | journal = Telecommunications Policy | volume = 35 | issue = 8 | pages = 715\u2013736| year = 2011 | url = http://martinhilbert.net/ManifoldDigitalDivide_Hilbert_AAM.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"HilbertWD38,5\"/>\n\nWhile a Global Gender Gap in access and usage of ICT's exist, empirical evidence shows that this is due to unfavorable conditions concerning employment, education and income and not to technophobia or lower ability. In the contexts understudy, women with the prerequisites for access and usage turned out to be more active users of digital tools than men.<ref name=HilbertGend2011 />  In the US, for example, the figures for 2018 show 89% of men and 88% of women use the Internet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/184415/percentage-of-us-adults-who-are-internet-users-by-gender/ |title = U.S. Internet penetration by gender 2000-2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cognitive access====\nIn order to use computer technology, a certain level of information literacy is needed.   Further challenges include information overload and the ability to find and use reliable information.\n\n====Design access====\nComputers need to be accessible to individuals with different learning and physical abilities including complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 in the United States.<ref>[http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws Section 508] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075749/http://section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=Laws |date=August 6, 2013 }} (1998). United States Government.</ref>\n\n====Institutional access====\nIn illustrating institutional access, Wilson states \"the numbers of users are greatly affected by whether access is offered only through individual homes or whether it is offered through schools, community centers, religious institutions, cybercaf\u00e9s, or post offices, especially in poor countries where computer access at work or home is highly limited\".<ref name=Wilson-2004/>{{rp|303}}\n\n====Political access====\nGuillen & Suarez argue that \"democratic political regimes enable faster growth of the Internet than authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.\" <ref name=Guillen-2005/>{{rp|687}}  The Internet is considered a form of e-democracy, and attempting to control what citizens can or cannot view is in contradiction to this.

(March 21, 2014). Retrieved April 13, 2014, from http://www.internetworldstats.com/links10.htm</ref>\n\n*Economic equality \u2013 For example, the telephone is often seen as one of the most important components, because having access to a working telephone can lead to higher safety. If there were to be an emergency, one could easily call for help if one could use a nearby phone. In another example, many work-related tasks are online, and people without access to the Internet may not be able to complete work up to company standards. The Internet is regarded by some as a basic component of civic life that developed countries ought to guarantee for their citizens. Additionally, welfare services, for example, are sometimes offered via the Internet.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Social mobility \u2013 Computer and Internet use is regarded as being very important to development and success. However, some children are not getting as much technical education as others, because lower socioeconomic areas cannot afford to provide schools with computer facilities. For this reason, some kids are being separated and not receiving the same chance as others to be successful.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Democracy \u2013 Some people believe that eliminating the digital divide would help countries become healthier democracies. They argue that communities would become much more involved in events such as elections or decision making.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|title=Inclusion of excluded groups in decision-making in the development of technologies|last=Social Impact Open Repository|date=2011|website=SIOR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905142527/http://sior.ub.edu/jspui/cris/socialimpact/socialimpact00418|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=dead|access-date=September 5, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n*Economic growth \u2013 It is believed that less-developed nations could gain quick access to economic growth if the information infrastructure were to be developed and well used. By improving the latest technologies, certain countries and industries can gain a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nWhile these four arguments are meant to lead to a solution to the digital divide, there are a couple of other components that need to be considered. The first one is rural living versus suburban living. Rural areas used to have very minimal access to the Internet, for example. However, nowadays, power lines and satellites are used to increase the availability in these areas. Another component to keep in mind is disabilities. Some people may have the highest quality technologies, but a disability they have may keep them from using these technologies to their fullest extent.<ref name=\"internetworldstats.com\"/>\n\nUsing previous studies (Gamos, 2003; Nsengiyuma & Stork, 2005; Harwit, 2004 as cited in James), James asserts that in developing countries, \"internet use has taken place overwhelmingly among the upper-income, educated, and urban segments\" largely due to the high literacy rates of this sector of the population.<ref name=James-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = James | first1 = J | year = 2008 | title = Digital Divide Complacency: Misconceptions and Dangers | journal = The Information Society | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 54\u201361 | doi = 10.1080/01972240701774790 }}</ref>{{rp|58}} As such, James suggests that part of the solution requires that developing countries first build up the literacy/language skills, [[computer literacy]], and technical competence that low-income and rural populations need in order to make use of ICT.\n\nIt has also been suggested that there is a correlation between democrat regimes and the growth of the Internet. One hypothesis by Gullen is, \"The more democratic the polity, the greater the Internet use...The government can try to control the Internet by monopolizing control\" and Norris ''et al.'' also contends, \"If there is less government control of it, the Internet flourishes, and it is associated with greater democracy and civil liberties.<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Pick | first1 = J. | last2 = Azari | first2 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Global Digital Divide: Influence of Socioeconomic, Governmental, and Accessibility Factors on Information Technology | url = | journal = Information Technology for Development | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 91\u2013115 | doi=10.1002/itdj.20095}}</ref>\n\nFrom an economic perspective, Pick and Azari state that \"in developing nations\u2026foreign direct investment (FDI), primary education, educational investment, access to education, and government prioritization of ICT as all-important\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|112}} Specific solutions proposed by the study include: \"invest in stimulating, attracting, and growing creative technical and scientific workforce; increase the access to education and digital literacy; reduce the gender divide and empower women to participate in the ICT workforce; emphasize investing in intensive Research and Development for selected metropolitan areas and regions within nations\".<ref name=PickAndAzari-2008/>{{rp|111}}\n\nThere are projects worldwide that have implemented, to various degrees, the solutions outlined above.  Many such projects have taken the form of Information Communications Technology Centers (ICT centers).  Rahnman explains that \"the main role of ICT intermediaries is defined as an organization providing effective support to local communities in the use and adaptation of technology.  Most commonly, an ICT intermediary will be a specialized organization from outside the community, such as a non-governmental organization, local government, or international donor. On the other hand, a social intermediary is defined as a local institution from within the community, such as a community-based organization.<ref>Rahman, H. (2006). ''Empowering Marginal Communities and Information Networking''. Hershey, Pennsylvania: Idea Group Publishing.</ref>{{rp|128}}\n\nOther proposed solutions that the Internet promises for developing countries are the provision of efficient communications within and among developing countries so that citizens worldwide can effectively help each other to solve their problems. Grameen Banks and Kiva loans are two microcredit systems designed to help citizens worldwide to contribute online towards entrepreneurship in developing communities. Economic opportunities range from entrepreneurs who can afford the hardware and broadband access required to maintain Internet caf\u00e9s to agribusinesses having control over the seeds they plant.\n\nAt the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], the IMARA organization (from [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word for \"power\") sponsors a variety of outreach programs which bridge the Global Digital Divide. Its aim is to find and implement long-term, sustainable solutions which will increase the availability of educational technology and resources to domestic and international communities. These projects are run under the aegis of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (CSAIL) and staffed by MIT volunteers who give training, install and donate computer setups in greater [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Kenya]], Indian reservations the American Southwest such as the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. The CommuniTech project strives to empower underserved communities through sustainable technology and education.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Fizz|first1=Robyn|last2=Mansur|first2=Karla|title=Helping MIT neighbors cross the 'digital divide'|newspaper=MIT Tech Talk|date=June 4, 2008|publisher=Cambridge: MIT|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/techtalk52-28.pdf|page=3}}</ref><ref>[http://imara.csail.mit.edu/ IMARA Project at MIT]</ref><ref>Fizz, Robyn, [http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech \"CommuniTech Works Locally to Bridge the Digital Divide\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818173543/http://ist.mit.edu/news/communitech |date=August 18, 2011 }}, ''IST News'', MIT, April 8, 2011</ref> According to Dominik Hartmann of the MIT's Media Lab, interdisciplinary approaches are needed to bridge the global digital divide.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Hartmann|first1=Dominik|title=Building bridges|newspaper=D+C, development&cooperation|date=March 25, 2016|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/innovative-interdisciplinary-approaches-needed-tackle-digital-divide-and-growing-inequality}}</ref>\n\nBuilding on the premise that any effective solution must be decentralized, allowing the local communities in developing nations to generate their content, one scholar has posited that social media\u2014like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter\u2014may be useful tools in closing the divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ali | first1 = Amir | year = 2011 | title = The Power of Social Media in Developing Nations: New Tools for Closing the Global Digital Divide and Beyond | url = http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | journal = Harvard Human Rights Journal | volume = 24 | issue =  | page = 1 | access-date = March 30, 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121114083745/http://harvardhrj.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/185-220.pdf | archive-date = November 14, 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> As Amir Hatem Ali suggests, \"the popularity and generative nature of social media empower individuals to combat some of the main obstacles to bridging the digital divide\".<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>{{rp|188}} Facebook's statistics reinforce this claim. According to Facebook, more than seventy-five percent of its users reside outside of the US.<ref name=FacebookStats-2011>[http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics \"Facebook Statistics\"], 2011. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018164409/http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics |date=October 18, 2007 }}</ref> Moreover, more than seventy languages are presented on its website.<ref name=FacebookStats-2011/> The reasons for the high number of international users are due to many the qualities of Facebook and other social media. Amongst them, are its ability to offer a means of interacting with others, user-friendly features, and the fact that most sites are available at no cost.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> The problem with social media, however, is that it can be accessible, provided that there is physical access.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/> Nevertheless, with its ability to encourage digital inclusion, social media can be used as a tool to bridge the global digital divide.<ref name=\"AliHRJ\"/>\n\nSome cities in the world have started programs to bridge the digital divide for their residents, school children, students, parents and the elderly. One such program, founded in 1996, was sponsored by the city of Boston and called the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021008225433/http://www.digitalbridgefoundation.org/ (Boston) Digital Bridge Foundation]</ref> It especially concentrates on school children and their parents, helping to make both equally and similarly knowledgeable about computers, using application programs, and navigating the Internet.<ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=1479 \"Mayor Menino, Boston Digital Bridge Foundation Host Evening on the Bridge 2.0 Celebration\"], Mayor's Office, Boston, Press Release, September 26, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/default.aspx?id=4765 \"City of Boston Receives $4.3 Million Grant That Will Give Training, Computers and Opportunity to Underserved Communities\"], City of Boston press office, September 14, 2010</ref>\n\n===Free Basics===\n{{Main|Free Basics}}\n\nFree Basics is a partnership between social networking services company Facebook and six companies (Samsung, Ericsson, MediaTek, Opera Software, Nokia and Qualcomm) that plans to bring affordable access to selected Internet services to less developed countries by increasing efficiency, and facilitating the development of new business models around the provision of Internet access. In the whitepaper<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/12057105_1001874746531417_622371037_n.pdf?oh=4a6afa24c125a3debe1784bcacefa8b4&oe=5B03C427|title=Is connectivity a human right?|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}{{Dead link|date=January 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> realised by Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, connectivity is asserted as a \"human right\", and Internet.org is created to improve Internet access for people around the world.\n\n\"Free Basics provides people with access to useful services on their mobile phones in markets where internet access may be less affordable. The websites are available for free without data charges, and include content about news, employment, health, education and local information etc. By introducing people to the benefits of the internet through these websites, we hope to bring more people online and help improve their lives.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://info.internet.org/en/|title=Internet.org:About|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Free Basics is also accused of violating [[net neutrality]] for limiting access to handpicked services. Despite a wide deployment in numerous countries, it has been met with heavy resistance notably in India where the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India eventually banned it in 2016.\n\n===Satellite constellations===\n\nSeveral projects to bring internet to the entire world with a [[satellite constellation]] have been devised in the last decade, one of these being [[Starlink (satellite constellation)|Starlink]] by [[Elon Musk]]'s company [[SpaceX]]. Unlike Free Basics, it would provide people with a full internet access and would not be limited to a few selected services. In the same week Starlink was announced, serial-entrepreneur Richard Branson announced his own project [[OneWeb satellite constellation|OneWeb]], a similar constellation with approximately 700 satellites that has already procured communication frequency licenses for their broadcast spectrum and could possibly be operational as early as in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-satellite-entrepreneurs-20150117-story.html|title=Elon Musk and Richard Branson invest in satellite-Internet ventures|last=|first=|date=January 17, 2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe biggest hurdle to these projects is the astronomical, financial, and logistical cost of launching so many satellites. After the failure of previous satellite-to-consumer space ventures, satellite industry consultant Roger Rusch said \"It's highly unlikely that you can make a successful business out of this.\" Musk has publicly acknowledged this business reality, and indicated in mid-2015 that while endeavoring to develop this technically-complicated space-based communication system he wants to avoid overextending the company and stated that they are being measured in the pace of development.\n\n===One Laptop per Child===\n\n[[One Laptop per Child]] (OLPC) is another attempt to narrow the digital divide.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\">[http://one.laptop.org/about/mission One Laptop Per Child]. (2009).</ref> This organization, founded in 2005, provides inexpensively produced \"XO\" laptops (dubbed the \"$100 laptop\", though actual production costs vary) to children residing in poor and isolated regions within developing countries. Each laptop belongs to an individual child and provides a gateway to digital learning and Internet access. The XO laptops are designed to withstand more abuse than higher-end machines, and they contain features in context to the unique conditions that remote villages present. Each laptop is constructed to use as little power as possible, have a sunlight-readable screen, and is capable of automatically networking with other XO laptops in order to access the Internet\u2014as many as 500 machines can share a single point of access.<ref name=\"wiki.laptop.org\"/>\n\n==World Summit on the Information Society==\n{{Main |World Summit on the Information Society}}\n\nSeveral of the 67 principles adopted at the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] convened by the [[United Nations]] in Geneva in 2003 directly address the digital divide:<ref name=WSIS-03>[http://www.itu.int/wsis/docs/geneva/official/dop.html \"Declaration of Principles\"], WSIS-03/GENEVA/DOC/4-E, World Summit on the Information Society, Geneva, December 12, 2003</ref>\n:10. We are also fully aware that the benefits of the information technology revolution are today unevenly distributed between the developed and developing countries and within societies. We are fully committed to turning this digital divide into a digital opportunity for all, particularly for those who risk being left behind and being further marginalized.\n:11. We are committed to realizing our common vision of the Information Society for ourselves and for future generations. We recognize that young people are the future workforce and leading creators and earliest adopters of ICTs. They must therefore be empowered as learners, developers, contributors, entrepreneurs and decision-makers. We must focus especially on young people who have not yet been able to benefit fully from the opportunities provided by ICTs. We are also committed to ensuring that the development of ICT applications and operation of services respects the rights of children as well as their protection and well-being.\n:12. We affirm that development of ICTs provides enormous opportunities for women, who should be an integral part of, and key actors, in the Information Society. We are committed to ensuring that the Information Society enables women's empowerment and their full participation on the basis on equality in all spheres of society and in all decision-making processes. To this end, we should mainstream a gender equality perspective and use ICTs as a tool to that end.\n:13. In building the Information Society, we shall pay particular attention to the special needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups of society, including migrants, internally displaced persons and refugees, unemployed and underprivileged people, minorities and nomadic people. We shall also recognize the special needs of older persons and persons with disabilities.\n:14. We are resolute to empower the poor, particularly those living in remote, rural and marginalized urban areas, to access information and to use ICTs as a tool to support their efforts to lift themselves out of poverty.\n:15. In the evolution of the Information Society, particular attention must be given to the special situation of indigenous peoples, as well as to the preservation of their heritage and their cultural legacy.\n:16. We continue to pay special attention to the particular needs of people of developing countries, countries with economies in transition, Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States, Landlocked Developing Countries, Highly Indebted Poor Countries, countries and territories under occupation, countries recovering from conflict and countries and regions with special needs as well as to conditions that pose severe threats to development, such as natural disasters.\n:21. Connectivity is a central enabling agent in building the Information Society. Universal, ubiquitous, equitable and affordable access to ICT infrastructure and services, constitutes one of the challenges of the Information Society and should be an objective of all stakeholders involved in building it. Connectivity also involves access to energy and postal services, which should be assured in conformity with the domestic legislation of each country.\n:28. We strive to promote universal access with equal opportunities for all to scientific knowledge and the creation and dissemination of scientific and technical information, including open access initiatives for scientific publishing.\n:46. In building the Information Society, States are strongly urged to take steps with a view to the avoidance of, and refrain from, any unilateral measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that impedes the full achievement of economic and social development by the population of the affected countries, and that hinders the well-being of their population.\n\n==See also==\n{{Library resources box}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Achievement gap]]\n* [[Participation (decision making)#Civic opportunity gap|Civic opportunity gap]]\n* [[Computer technology for developing areas]]\n* [[Digital divide by country]]\n* [[Digital divide in Canada]]\n* [[Digital divide in China]]\n* [[Digital divide in South Africa]]\n* [[Digital divide in Thailand]]\n* [[Digital rights]]\n* [[Digital Society Day]] (October 17 in India)\n* [[Global Internet usage]]\n* [[Information society]]\n* [[International communication]]\n* [[Internet Geography|Internet geography]]\n* [[Internet governance]]\n* [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[NetDay]]\n* [[Rural Internet]]\n\n===Groups devoted to digital divide issues===\n* [[Center for Digital Inclusion]]\n* [[Digital Textbook]] a [[South Korea]]n Project that intends to distribute tablet notebooks to elementary school students.\n* [[Inveneo]]\n* [[TechChange]]\n* [[United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = I'd blush if I could: closing gender divides in digital skills through education\n| author = UNESCO, EQUALS Skills Coalition\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = \n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000367416\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO\n}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Azam, M.

Entertainment during the [[Super Bowl]], the annual championship game of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), represents a fundamental link to [[Popular culture|pop culture]], which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest.\n\nPrior to the early 1990s, the halftime show was based around a theme, and featured university marching bands (the [[Grambling State University]] Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to the 1990s), [[drill team]]s, and other performance ensembles such as [[Up with People]]. Beginning in 1991, the halftime show began to feature [[pop music]] acts such as [[New Kids on the Block]] and [[Gloria Estefan]]. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, [[Super Bowl XXVII]] featured a [[Super Bowl XXVII halftime show|headlining performance]] by [[Michael Jackson]]. After [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], whose halftime show featured an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s breasts, the halftime show began to feature [[classic rock]] acts until the return of headlining pop musicians in [[Super Bowl XLV|2011]]. Since 2013, [[Pepsi]] is the official sponsor of the halftime show.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:SuperBowl I - Los Angeles Coliseum (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the halftime show at [[Super Bowl I]]]]\nDuring most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college [[marching band]]. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring [[drill team]]s and other performance ensembles; the group [[Up with People]] produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|counterprogram the game]],<ref>{{cite web|title=If NFL doesn't put on a halftime show, someone else will|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/05/if-nfl-doesnt-put-on-a-halftime-show-someone-else-will/|first=Mike|last=Florio|work=ProFootballTalk.com|date=February 5, 2013|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref> saw the introduction of popular music acts such as [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Clint Black]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Tony Bennett]]. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme\u2014begun with Super Bowl III\u2014ended, replaced by major music productions by [[arena rock]] bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s breasts in an alleged \"[[wardrobe malfunction]]\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being [[rock music|rock]] artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

Entertainment during the [[Super Bowl]], the annual championship game of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), represents a fundamental link to [[Popular culture|pop culture]], which helps broaden the television audience and nationwide interest.\n\nPrior to the early 1990s, the halftime show was based around a theme, and featured university marching bands (the [[Grambling State University]] Marching Band has performed at the most Super Bowl halftime shows, featuring in six shows including at least one per decade from the 1960s to the 1990s), [[drill team]]s, and other performance ensembles such as [[Up with People]]. Beginning in 1991, the halftime show began to feature [[pop music]] acts such as [[New Kids on the Block]] and [[Gloria Estefan]]. In an effort to boost the prominence of the halftime show to increase viewer interest, [[Super Bowl XXVII]] featured a [[Super Bowl XXVII halftime show|headlining performance]] by [[Michael Jackson]]. After [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], whose halftime show featured an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s breasts, the halftime show began to feature [[classic rock]] acts until the return of headlining pop musicians in [[Super Bowl XLV|2011]]. Since 2013, [[Pepsi]] is the official sponsor of the halftime show.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:SuperBowl I - Los Angeles Coliseum (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the halftime show at [[Super Bowl I]]]]\nDuring most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college [[marching band]]. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring [[drill team]]s and other performance ensembles; the group [[Up with People]] produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to [[Super Bowl counterprogramming|counterprogram the game]],<ref>{{cite web|title=If NFL doesn't put on a halftime show, someone else will|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/02/05/if-nfl-doesnt-put-on-a-halftime-show-someone-else-will/|first=Mike|last=Florio|work=ProFootballTalk.com|date=February 5, 2013|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}</ref> saw the introduction of popular music acts such as [[New Kids on the Block]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Clint Black]], [[Patti LaBelle]], and [[Tony Bennett]]. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme\u2014begun with Super Bowl III\u2014ended, replaced by major music productions by [[arena rock]] bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|incident]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] where [[Justin Timberlake]] exposed one of [[Janet Jackson]]'s breasts in an alleged \"[[wardrobe malfunction]]\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being [[rock music|rock]] artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.  These shows were considered \"family friendly\" and the time in which they took place has been described as \"the age of reactionary halftime shows\".<ref>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/boobs-beyonce-brass-bands-the-evolution-of-the-super-bowl-halftime-show.html</ref> Since [[Super Bowl XLV]], the halftime show has returned to featuring popular contemporary musicians, with the typical format featuring a single headline artist collaborating with a small number of guest acts.\n\nThe NFL does not pay the halftime show performers an appearance fee, though it covers all expenses for the performers and their entourage of band members management, technical crew, security personnel, family, and friends.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/sports/football/03halftime.html?ref=sports|title=The Who, and the Super Bowl's Evolving Halftime Show|first=Ken|last=Belson|work=The New York Times|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2010}}</ref> [[Super Bowl XXVII halftime show]] with Michael Jackson provided an exception, as the NFL and [[Frito-Lay]] agreed to make a donation and provide commercial time for Jackson's [[Heal the World Foundation]].<ref name=\"lat-healla\">{{cite web|title=Heal the Kids : Rebuilding: Michael Jackson announces a $1.25-million program to help children in riot-torn areas.

It was the largest stage ever assembled for a Super Bowl halftime show, with 28 separate pieces assembled in five minutes by a 600-member volunteer stage crew. The group performed three songs: \"[[Start Me Up]]\", \"[[Rough Justice (The Rolling Stones song)|Rough Justice]]\", and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". The show was viewed by 89.9 million people, more than the audiences for the Oscars, Grammys and Emmy Awards combined.<ref>Unknown.

It is part of the [[California Community College]] system. It is operated by the [[Antelope Valley Community College District]], with a primary service area of {{convert|1945|sqmi|km2}} covering portions of Los Angeles and Kern counties. Instruction is offered at several sites, including Palmdale and Lancaster, and through online and instructional television courses.\n\nThe college offers Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degrees in 71 fields as well as certificate programs in 59 vocational areas.\n\nThe main campus in Lancaster hosts the satellite location of [[California State University, Bakersfield-Antelope Valley]] (CSUB-AV), where students can obtain bachelor's and master's degrees in select subjects.\n\n== History ==\nThe institution began classes on September 10, 1929, as a department of [[Antelope Valley High School]] in Lancaster. It was established as Antelope Valley Junior College, providing the first two years of a college education for those living in what was then a remote, rural area. The name was later modified to Antelope Valley College to reflect it comprehensive nature. The average daily attendance at the college was 13 during the 1929-30 school year.\n\nThere was little growth in enrollment at the college during the depression years that followed. Alfalfa farmers in Antelope Valley were hard hit during the 1930s, and the smallest junior college in California suffered serious financial difficulties. Teachers took a 20 percent cut in salaries, which ranged from a state-mandated minimum of $1,350 a year to a $1,595 maximum.\n\nAverage daily attendance (ADA) at the college reached 100 by 1939, but with [[World War II]], attendance plummeted. Attendance reached a low of 13 during the war, the same ADA as the year the school was founded.\n\nThere were pressures to close the junior college, but trustees and staff held out until veterans returned from the war. Enrollment grew steadily during the postwar years, partly because of the GI Bill of Rights and partly because Antelope Valley began developing an aircraft industry.\n\nIn 1959, groundbreaking was held for a new college campus on {{convert|110|acre|ha}} at Avenue K and 30th Street West, designed by the architect [[Henry L. Gogerty]] (1894-1990).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/architect/structures/15203/|title=PCAD - the Pacific Coast Architecture Database - Home|website=digital.lib.washington.edu|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe college campus has expanded to approximately {{convert|135|acre|ha}} through land purchases.\n\n== Academics ==\nAntelope Valley College has grown to a student population of approximately 16,000. It is accredited by the [[Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges]].\n\nAmong the many programs offered through the college are an associate degree program in registered nursing approved by the Board of Registered Nursing, an airframe and powerplant technician program certified by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]], and a lower division engineering program that co-ordinates with an engineering degree program offered locally through California State University, Long Beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccpe.csulb.edu/continuinged/course_listing/programdescription.aspx?ProgramID=77&btnID=15|title=Bachelor of Science in Engineering Degree Completion Program|website=Ccpe.csulb.edu|accessdate=1 October 2017}}</ref> Other programs include aircraft fabrication and assembly (including composite materials), computer graphics, respiratory therapy, Firefighter I Academy and wildland fire technology.\n\nIn conjunction with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Lancaster campus hosts the Sheriff's Training Academy, which meets the requirements of the Peace Officer Standards and Training for training members of the sheriff's department and other law enforcement agencies.\n  \nThe community college district is governed by a locally elected Board of Trustees consisting of five members serving four-year terms, plus a student trustee elected annually by members of the student body.\n\n===Palmdale campus===\nThe college maintains a temporary leased site in the City of [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]], which serves nearly 2,000 students. Plans call for creation of a full campus on {{convert|60|acre|ha}} of land in southern Palmdale on 25th Street East, south of Avenue S. College officials are working toward a sustainable enrollment of 1,000 full-time equivalent students to qualify Palmdale for center status\u2014a key step in developing a permanent campus. Officials in April 2009 expressed their intent to submit an initial project proposal for a campus to the state in June 2010.\n\n== Athletics ==\nThe college's athletic teams are known as the Marauders. The college currently fields eight men\u2019s and eight women\u2019s varsity teams.

The biggest girl group in the early 2000s was [[S.H.E.]] and since then, there has arguably been a lack of well-known cohesive girl groups that have been as successful. The show aims to create a brand new \"it\" girl group that represents modern women and appeals to all genders for the new generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xuehua.us/2018/04/14/\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426/ |script-title=zh:\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426\u6253\u901a\u5076\u50cf\u4ea7\u4e1a\u94fe |website=xuehua.us |date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-12-12 |language=zh-hans}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the original Korean version, ''Produce 101 China'' has a number of different rules and challenges introduced beginning in episode 2. One such example is the inclusion of \u201cknock-out\u201d challengers who can take the place of a 101 member in the original \u201cauditions\u201d based on mentors discretion of the challengers\u2019 skills in comparison to the original trainees. In the first elimination, certain members who had highest votes could also choose to save a member who was up for elimination as a second chance \u201cintern.\u201d\n\n== Mentors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n!Age (then)\n!Age (now)\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Huang Zitao|Tao]]\n|25\n|26\n|Nation's Producer \n|ex-member of [[Exo (band)]]\n|-\n|[[Tiger Hu]]\n|34\n|36\n|Songwriting/Composition instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Jason Zhang]]\n|35\n|37\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Vocal instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Ella Chen]]\n|36\n|38\n|Member of [[S.H.E]]\n|-\n|[[Show Lo]]\n|38\n|40\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Dance instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Wang Yibo]]\n|20\n|22\n|Member of [[UNIQ (band)|UNIQ]]\n|}\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Episode 1 (April 21, 2018) ===\nThe audience is introduced to the Lady Bee trio who walks in to a dark studio wondering where to go. The lights suddenly turn on and 101 seats are shown. Similar to the Korean counterpart, contestants are introduced by label and choose where they want to sit from #1 to #101. Once every girl is seated, the studio darkens and [[Huang Zitao|Tao]] introduces the mentors with each of the mentors performing their own song. After the performances by the mentors have ended, contestants perform with their label mates or a pre-made group to be evaluated from grades A to F. During the episode, it is revealed that only 11 trainees are only to be sorted into the A group, once 11 girls are filled, another girl that has been given the A rank will have to take a girl's nominated seat, voluntarily if a girl in the top 11 chooses to downgrade to the B rank or through a battle. At the end of the episode, we see 11 spots filled yet Yamy is given an A rank. The mentors discuss heavily to choose whom to demote to B rank. They choose Qiang Dongyue and she  agrees to a battle with Yamy. Yamy wins the battle and Qiang Dongyue is reluctantly demoted to the B rank.\n\n=== Episode 2 (April 28, 2018) ===\nThe evaluations go on where former SNH48 member Ge Jiahui performs with her group and trainees continually get evaluated to their respective ranks. There is a twist after all 101 girls are graded when the mentors announce that girls who are not from idol companies will also be competing for a spot in the top 101. If any of them get above an F grade, they may take the spot of another girl in F grade, eliminating her from the competition. Gao Yingxi, Wu Qianying and Re Yina take Cindy, Dora and Zhao Ling's place on the show. Re Yina also receives an A grade and battles Li Ziting for her spot in A class. Re Yina wins. Sunnee questions the mentors on this decision and Tao responds saying Re Yina's style is more unique and Li Ziting went off key during the vocal part of the battle while Ye Rina did not. Tao reassures the trainees that if they felt they were placed in an incorrect grade if they work hard it will be seen.\nThe girls arrive at their dorms and all the trainees envy A class' rooms being pink and bigger than all the others and having its own couch. Yina and Sunnee are placed in the same room which causes some tension between them. \nDuring the first class, it is revealed that Abby left the competition overnight and one of the girls from the non-idol companies, Wang Ju, will be taking her place in C class. The F class girls walk into their small practice room and become emotional at seeing an easel with motivational writing on it in the middle of the room. All of them make a promise to move up. In A class, Re Yina has a hard time matching the tones of the vocal teacher and keeping up with the dance. Li Zixuan in B class gets called up to sing with Ella and begins to cry. Ella motivates her and gets her some sunglasses to cover her eyes to overcome her fear of singing in front of people. \nFor the first evaluation, it is revealed that the girls will come up five at a time and dance and sing the theme song in front of everyone. Yang Chaoyue performs poorly and cries afterwards due to embarrassment and stress. When Zhu Tiantian performs, she dances incorrectly and sings loudly and incorrectly, throwing off the other contestants dancing with her. This causes Gao Qiuzi to cry from the shock and stress. The other trainees accuse Zhu Tiantian of just wanting screen time and not caring if it affects other trainees in their individual interviews.\nWhen it comes to F class's turn to be re-graded, Show Luo surprises them by saying only one trainee has remained in F class and the rest have moved up. A class has their re-gradings read out in front of everyone. The biggest change is Re Yina going from A class to F class.\n\n=== Episode 3 (May 5, 2018) ===\nThe next mission is revealed to be a battle mission like the other 101 series. However, this time the 16 leaders and centres are already chosen and split into two types of eight each. Eight \"Skilled\" centres and eight \"Diligent\" centres. The \"Diligent\" centres are chosen from the eight girls who spent the most time practising while the eight \"Skilled\" centres are chosen by the mentors and restricted to A and B class. The rest of the girls choose whose team they want to be in by standing behind them. The battles are also not two teams performing the same songs, instead, the centres of each team pick the song they want from a list of 16 songs given to them. On the night of the performances, the mentors form two teams representing eight groups each. The mentors play black and white match to decide who will announce their first group first.\nAt the end of all of the performances, both teams are left at four points each. As such, the result of the team battle is decided by who received the most votes out of everyone who performed. The person with the most votes was Meng Meiqi, meaning that Zhang Jie and Show Luo's team won the battle.\n\n'''Color key'''\n{{plainlist|* {{Color box|#FFE6B3|border=darkgray}} Winning Team\n* {{Color box|#CCF2FF|border=darkgray}} \"Skilled\" Centre\n* {{Color box|#CCFFE6|border=darkgray}} \"Diligent\" Centre\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center;

The rankings are announced and it is revealed that their rank will determine their grade from that point on with ranks 55-41 becoming D class, ranks 40-26 becoming C class, ranks 25-12 becoming B class and ranks 11-1 becoming A class. Wu Xuanyi comes 1st and Yang Bing comes 55th. It is then revealed that the eight girls from the winning teams who gained the most votes in the public performances can each pick one member from their teams from the previous round who is not in the top 55 to avoid elimination and join the top 55 as a pending trainee. Tao explains that the pending trainees will not be able to make any choices in the next mission and the 3 pending trainees who get the most votes will stay in the competition. Meng Meiqi saves Jiang Shen (rank 59), Qiang Dongyue saves Luo Tianshu (rank 92), Duan Aojuan saves Liu Nian (rank 63), Sunnee's whole team entered the top 55 without being saved so Sunnee cannot save anyone, Zhao Yaoke saves Yang Han (rank 93), Yamy saves Wang Ju (rank 90), Kimberley saves Chen Yuyan (rank 82) and Yang Chaoyue saves Xu Shiyin (rank 75).\n\n=== Episode 5 (May 19, 2018) ===\nThe episode starts with the girls calling their families before the first elimination. The procedure for the second mission is revealed. There are six mentors that will hold three different classes; vocal (Ella and Zhang Jie), dance (Show Luo and Wang Yibo) and composition (Hu Yanbin and Lin Yoga). The girls will write down which class they want from most to least (1 being top pick, 3 being bottom pick). The mentors then look through the lists and pick which girls they want. If there are too many top picks for their class, they must choose which girls not to pick and if they do not have enough top picks they must choose some girls who did not pick that class as their top pick. There are 10 spots in composition, 19 spots in vocal and 31 spots in dance. The classes are then split into 12 groups; 2 in composition, 4 in vocal and 6 in dance. The team leaders for all 12 teams are picked from the highest ranked girls within that class. The leaders pick which girls they want to fill their team. The girls race for the song they want by relay, the boards with the song names are on a wall and they have to try and take the board they want. During the race for the dance team's songs, one of the girls falls and all the other girls keep running. This makes Tao very angry and he scolds the girls for many things including their actions during the elimination, talking during filming, not listening and not caring when the girl fell over. The dance teams are made to run again. All the teams then practice for their performance.\n\n=== Episode 6 (May 26, 2018) ===\nThe teams perform their stages with Meng Meiqi's group going first as she received the most votes on the last stage. It is noticed that there is a chair on the left-hand side of the stage, the chair is revealed to be for the overall popularity queen during the position battle stages. Meng Meiqi is the first popularity queen as her team goes first and she received the most votes within her team. It is explained that if another team's popularity queen receives more votes than her, they can dethrone her. It is also explained that the popularity queens in each team will also get to choose which group to perform next regardless of dethroning the current overall popularity queen or not. The team chosen to perform next is always chosen by the previous team's popularity queen. Meng Meiqi is dethroned by Li Ziting, and Li Ziting is dethroned by Lu Xiaoyu on the last performance, who then becomes the overall popularity queen. The seven pending trainees gather on stage for a voting round to see who will stay and who will be eliminated officially. Jiang Shen, Wang Ju and Liu Nian become normal trainees again.\n\n'''Color key'''\n{{plainlist|{{Color box|#CCF2FF|border=darkgray}} Popularity Queen\n{{Color box|#D9D9D9|border=darkgray}} Pending Trainees\n}}\n\n'''Bold''' denotes the person who picked the team members (highest ranking trainees from the previous round of eliminations)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"  style=\"text-align:center;

They get an irregular announcement from Tao where he expresses his sorrow that the next time they meet, some of the girls will be leaving. He also announces and the staff have organised an activity for the girls and each dorm is given a set amount of money. The girls may go out and spend the money on decorations for their dorm room. The dorms will be judged and the winning dorm will win a surprise. The popularity award prize is a voucher to go out and watch a movie, the prize for the best design is a cute dollhouse of the dorm. Meng Meiqi, Yamy, Qiang Dongyue and Sunnee's team wins the best design award and Wang Qing, Gao Quizi, Xu Mengjie and Ma Xingyu's dorm wins the popularity award. The ranks are announced company by company with JC Universe Entertainment being announced first as they are the only group with all of their members currently in the competition. After the rankings, the top 36 girls have a special segment called \"Us, whom you did not know\" where the girls get to show off skills previously unknown to the public. Then Tao reveals the next mission which, like the other seasons, is the album missions. There are six songs. The centres are chosen by the fans from the girls who received the most votes for each song. The centres are:\n\nI Am That Kind Of Girl: Meng Meiqi\n\nShiny: Wu Xuanyi\n\nSomeone Else's Kid: Yamy\n\nLiving Up To Our Youth: Yang Chaoyue\n\nTears Of A Ferris Wheel: Zining\n\nAwesome: Lai Meiyun\n\nTao then announces that there will be six male idol seniors joining in the performances, one in each team. Each of them has left a secret message for the girls to try and guess who they are. The episode ends after the first secret message is played.\n\n=== Episode 8 (June 9, 2018) ===\nThe 36 girls are presented with 30 gifts on a table. Each of the 30 gifts somehow represents one of the six male idols that will join the teams.  Everyone except the centres can pick a gift. The male idols are already assigned to a group so the gift the trainee picks determines which group they will join. Before the girls pick their gifts, the secret messages from each idol are played. The idols, which songs they picked and their gifts are revealed and the teams are formed. The group perform their songs and are then all invited back onstage so the fans can vote for their favourite team, the team that wins will receive a special coaching class from all of the mentors. I Am That Kind Of Girl wins the prize and Zining is crowned overall popularity queen.\n\n'''Color key'''\n\n{{Color box|#CCF2FF|border=darkgray}} Popularity Queen\n\n'''Bold''' denotes centres picked in the previous episode\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=text-align:center width=100%\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#FF3166; color:white\" |Concept Evaluation Performances\n|-\n! # \n!

Subsequently, while the show launched the careers of many talented solo vocalists, there has been a lack of ''girl groups'' in the Chinese speaking world. The biggest girl group in the early 2000s was [[S.H.E.]] and since then, there has arguably been a lack of well-known cohesive girl groups that have been as successful. The show aims to create a brand new \"it\" girl group that represents modern women and appeals to all genders for the new generation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.xuehua.us/2018/04/14/\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426/ |script-title=zh:\u5371\u673a\u4e0e\u8f6c\u673a\u5e76\u5b58\uff0c\u817e\u8baf\u89c6\u9891\u643a\u300a\u521b\u9020101\u300b\u5165\u573a\u80fd\u5426\u6253\u901a\u5076\u50cf\u4ea7\u4e1a\u94fe |website=xuehua.us |date=2018-04-14 |accessdate=2018-12-12 |language=zh-hans}}</ref>\n\nUnlike the original Korean version, ''Produce 101 China'' has a number of different rules and challenges introduced beginning in episode 2. One such example is the inclusion of \u201cknock-out\u201d challengers who can take the place of a 101 member in the original \u201cauditions\u201d based on mentors discretion of the challengers\u2019 skills in comparison to the original trainees. In the first elimination, certain members who had highest votes could also choose to save a member who was up for elimination as a second chance \u201cintern.\u201d\n\n== Mentors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\"\n!Name\n!Age (then)\n!Age (now)\n!Role\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[Huang Zitao|Tao]]\n|25\n|26\n|Nation's Producer \n|ex-member of [[Exo (band)]]\n|-\n|[[Tiger Hu]]\n|34\n|36\n|Songwriting/Composition instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Jason Zhang]]\n|35\n|37\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Vocal instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Ella Chen]]\n|36\n|38\n|Member of [[S.H.E]]\n|-\n|[[Show Lo]]\n|38\n|40\n|rowspan=\"2\" |Dance instructor\n|\n|-\n|[[Wang Yibo]]\n|20\n|22\n|Member of [[UNIQ (band)|UNIQ]]\n|}\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n=== Episode 1 (April 21, 2018) ===\nThe audience is introduced to the Lady Bee trio who walks in to a dark studio wondering where to go. The lights suddenly turn on and 101 seats are shown. Similar to the Korean counterpart, contestants are introduced by label and choose where they want to sit from #1 to #101. Once every girl is seated, the studio darkens and [[Huang Zitao|Tao]] introduces the mentors with each of the mentors performing their own song. After the performances by the mentors have ended, contestants perform with their label mates or a pre-made group to be evaluated from grades A to F. During the episode, it is revealed that only 11 trainees are only to be sorted into the A group, once 11 girls are filled, another girl that has been given the A rank will have to take a girl's nominated seat, voluntarily if a girl in the top 11 chooses to downgrade to the B rank or through a battle. At the end of the episode, we see 11 spots filled yet Yamy is given an A rank. The mentors discuss heavily to choose whom to demote to B rank. They choose Qiang Dongyue and she  agrees to a battle with Yamy. Yamy wins the battle and Qiang Dongyue is reluctantly demoted to the B rank.\n\n=== Episode 2 (April 28, 2018) ===\nThe evaluations go on where former SNH48 member Ge Jiahui performs with her group and trainees continually get evaluated to their respective ranks. There is a twist after all 101 girls are graded when the mentors announce that girls who are not from idol companies will also be competing for a spot in the top 101. If any of them get above an F grade, they may take the spot of another girl in F grade, eliminating her from the competition. Gao Yingxi, Wu Qianying and Re Yina take Cindy, Dora and Zhao Ling's place on the show. Re Yina also receives an A grade and battles Li Ziting for her spot in A class. Re Yina wins. Sunnee questions the mentors on this decision and Tao responds saying Re Yina's style is more unique and Li Ziting went off key during the vocal part of the battle while Ye Rina did not. Tao reassures the trainees that if they felt they were placed in an incorrect grade if they work hard it will be seen.\nThe girls arrive at their dorms and all the trainees envy A class' rooms being pink and bigger than all the others and having its own couch. Yina and Sunnee are placed in the same room which causes some tension between them. \nDuring the first class, it is revealed that Abby left the competition overnight and one of the girls from the non-idol companies, Wang Ju, will be taking her place in C class. The F class girls walk into their small practice room and become emotional at seeing an easel with motivational writing on it in the middle of the room. All of them make a promise to move up. In A class, Re Yina has a hard time matching the tones of the vocal teacher and keeping up with the dance. Li Zixuan in B class gets called up to sing with Ella and begins to cry. Ella motivates her and gets her some sunglasses to cover her eyes to overcome her fear of singing in front of people. \nFor the first evaluation, it is revealed that the girls will come up five at a time and dance and sing the theme song in front of everyone. Yang Chaoyue performs poorly and cries afterwards due to embarrassment and stress. When Zhu Tiantian performs, she dances incorrectly and sings loudly and incorrectly, throwing off the other contestants dancing with her. This causes Gao Qiuzi to cry from the shock and stress. The other trainees accuse Zhu Tiantian of just wanting screen time and not caring if it affects other trainees in their individual interviews.\nWhen it comes to F class's turn to be re-graded, Show Luo surprises them by saying only one trainee has remained in F class and the rest have moved up. A class has their re-gradings read out in front of everyone. The biggest change is Re Yina going from A class to F class.\n\n=== Episode 3 (May 5, 2018) ===\nThe next mission is revealed to be a battle mission like the other 101 series. However, this time the 16 leaders and centres are already chosen and split into two types of eight each. Eight \"Skilled\" centres and eight \"Diligent\" centres. The \"Diligent\" centres are chosen from the eight girls who spent the most time practising while the eight \"Skilled\" centres are chosen by the mentors and restricted to A and B class. The rest of the girls choose whose team they want to be in by standing behind them. The battles are also not two teams performing the same songs, instead, the centres of each team pick the song they want from a list of 16 songs given to them. On the night of the performances, the mentors form two teams representing eight groups each. The mentors play black and white match to decide who will announce their first group first.\nAt the end of all of the performances, both teams are left at four points each. As such, the result of the team battle is decided by who received the most votes out of everyone who performed. The person with the most votes was Meng Meiqi, meaning that Zhang Jie and Show Luo's team won the battle.\n\n'''Color key'''\n{{plainlist|* {{Color box|#FFE6B3|border=darkgray}} Winning Team\n* {{Color box|#CCF2FF|border=darkgray}} \"Skilled\" Centre\n* {{Color box|#CCFFE6|border=darkgray}} \"Diligent\" Centre\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center;

The rankings are announced and it is revealed that their rank will determine their grade from that point on with ranks 55-41 becoming D class, ranks 40-26 becoming C class, ranks 25-12 becoming B class and ranks 11-1 becoming A class. Wu Xuanyi comes 1st and Yang Bing comes 55th. It is then revealed that the eight girls from the winning teams who gained the most votes in the public performances can each pick one member from their teams from the previous round who is not in the top 55 to avoid elimination and join the top 55 as a pending trainee. Tao explains that the pending trainees will not be able to make any choices in the next mission and the 3 pending trainees who get the most votes will stay in the competition. Meng Meiqi saves Jiang Shen (rank 59), Qiang Dongyue saves Luo Tianshu (rank 92), Duan Aojuan saves Liu Nian (rank 63), Sunnee's whole team entered the top 55 without being saved so Sunnee cannot save anyone, Zhao Yaoke saves Yang Han (rank 93), Yamy saves Wang Ju (rank 90), Kimberley saves Chen Yuyan (rank 82) and Yang Chaoyue saves Xu Shiyin (rank 75).\n\n=== Episode 5 (May 19, 2018) ===\nThe episode starts with the girls calling their families before the first elimination. The procedure for the second mission is revealed. There are six mentors that will hold three different classes; vocal (Ella and Zhang Jie), dance (Show Luo and Wang Yibo) and composition (Hu Yanbin and Lin Yoga). The girls will write down which class they want from most to least (1 being top pick, 3 being bottom pick). The mentors then look through the lists and pick which girls they want. If there are too many top picks for their class, they must choose which girls not to pick and if they do not have enough top picks they must choose some girls who did not pick that class as their top pick. There are 10 spots in composition, 19 spots in vocal and 31 spots in dance. The classes are then split into 12 groups; 2 in composition, 4 in vocal and 6 in dance. The team leaders for all 12 teams are picked from the highest ranked girls within that class. The leaders pick which girls they want to fill their team. The girls race for the song they want by relay, the boards with the song names are on a wall and they have to try and take the board they want. During the race for the dance team's songs, one of the girls falls and all the other girls keep running. This makes Tao very angry and he scolds the girls for many things including their actions during the elimination, talking during filming, not listening and not caring when the girl fell over. The dance teams are made to run again. All the teams then practice for their performance.\n\n=== Episode 6 (May 26, 2018) ===\nThe teams perform their stages with Meng Meiqi's group going first as she received the most votes on the last stage. It is noticed that there is a chair on the left-hand side of the stage, the chair is revealed to be for the overall popularity queen during the position battle stages. Meng Meiqi is the first popularity queen as her team goes first and she received the most votes within her team. It is explained that if another team's popularity queen receives more votes than her, they can dethrone her. It is also explained that the popularity queens in each team will also get to choose which group to perform next regardless of dethroning the current overall popularity queen or not. The team chosen to perform next is always chosen by the previous team's popularity queen. Meng Meiqi is dethroned by Li Ziting, and Li Ziting is dethroned by Lu Xiaoyu on the last performance, who then becomes the overall popularity queen. The seven pending trainees gather on stage for a voting round to see who will stay and who will be eliminated officially. Jiang Shen, Wang Ju and Liu Nian become normal trainees again.\n\n'''Color key'''\n{{plainlist|{{Color box|#CCF2FF|border=darkgray}} Popularity Queen\n{{Color box|#D9D9D9|border=darkgray}} Pending Trainees\n}}\n\n'''Bold''' denotes the person who picked the team members (highest ranking trainees from the previous round of eliminations)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"  style=\"text-align:center;

They get an irregular announcement from Tao where he expresses his sorrow that the next time they meet, some of the girls will be leaving. He also announces and the staff have organised an activity for the girls and each dorm is given a set amount of money. The girls may go out and spend the money on decorations for their dorm room. The dorms will be judged and the winning dorm will win a surprise. The popularity award prize is a voucher to go out and watch a movie, the prize for the best design is a cute dollhouse of the dorm. Meng Meiqi, Yamy, Qiang Dongyue and Sunnee's team wins the best design award and Wang Qing, Gao Quizi, Xu Mengjie and Ma Xingyu's dorm wins the popularity award. The ranks are announced company by company with JC Universe Entertainment being announced first as they are the only group with all of their members currently in the competition. After the rankings, the top 36 girls have a special segment called \"Us, whom you did not know\" where the girls get to show off skills previously unknown to the public. Then Tao reveals the next mission which, like the other seasons, is the album missions. There are six songs. The centres are chosen by the fans from the girls who received the most votes for each song. The centres are:\n\nI Am That Kind Of Girl: Meng Meiqi\n\nShiny: Wu Xuanyi\n\nSomeone Else's Kid: Yamy\n\nLiving Up To Our Youth: Yang Chaoyue\n\nTears Of A Ferris Wheel: Zining\n\nAwesome: Lai Meiyun\n\nTao then announces that there will be six male idol seniors joining in the performances, one in each team. Each of them has left a secret message for the girls to try and guess who they are. The episode ends after the first secret message is played.\n\n=== Episode 8 (June 9, 2018) ===\nThe 36 girls are presented with 30 gifts on a table. Each of the 30 gifts somehow represents one of the six male idols that will join the teams.  Everyone except the centres can pick a gift. The male idols are already assigned to a group so the gift the trainee picks determines which group they will join. Before the girls pick their gifts, the secret messages from each idol are played. The idols, which songs they picked and their gifts are revealed and the teams are formed. The group perform their songs and are then all invited back onstage so the fans can vote for their favourite team, the team that wins will receive a special coaching class from all of the mentors. I Am That Kind Of Girl wins the prize and Zining is crowned overall popularity queen.\n\n'''Color key'''\n\n{{Color box|#CCF2FF|border=darkgray}} Popularity Queen\n\n'''Bold''' denotes centres picked in the previous episode\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=text-align:center width=100%\n! colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#FF3166; color:white\" |Concept Evaluation Performances\n|-\n! # \n!

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by '''British Lion''' and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== Critical Reception ==\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Metal Temple''' deemed the album a 9/10 saying '''\u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. '''Hawkins''' and '''Leslie's''' dual guitar attack is on point, '''Dawson's''' drums precise and well deftly executed. '''Taylor's''' vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal. '''British Lion's \u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is refreshing in it's telling of the story, and hints of even better tales in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/b_2/british-lion-the.htm|title=Metal-Temple.com :: British Lion \u2013 The Burning (CD Review)|last=bkarr272|website=www.metal-temple.com|language=EN|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] rated the album a 4/5, and believes \"'''''The Burning''''' sounds vastly more punchy and powerful than its predecessor, while also giving the distinct impression that '''British Lion''' have evolved into a fiery and characterful ensemble with a strong identity of their own\". The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]]\u2019s love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of '''Bible Black''' sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/british-lion-arrys-other-army-return-on-sizzling-form|title=British Lion: \u2018Arry\u2019s other army return on sizzling form|last=January 2020|first=Dom Lawson 17|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Cryptic Rock''' said '''British Lion''' are one of the more interesting and intriguing side projects in [[Hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal]] today.

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by '''British Lion''' and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== Critical Reception ==\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Metal Temple''' deemed the album a 9/10 saying '''\u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. '''Hawkins''' and '''Leslie's''' dual guitar attack is on point, '''Dawson's''' drums precise and well deftly executed. '''Taylor's''' vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal.

Such a procedure was quite common under the early Umayyads, but by the early Abbasid period it had disappeared in Iraq and it was now regarded as the {{'}}''amal'' (\"good practice\") of Medina. Up until the end of the 8th century, the qadis of Fustat were still using this \"Medinan\" procedure and differentiated themselves from Iraqi practices. From a doctrinal point of view, however, the legal affiliation of Egypt could be more complex. The principal Egyptian jurist in the second half of the 8th century is al-Layth b. Sa'd.<ref>R.G.

Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.<ref name=hussin>{{cite encyclopedia |ref=harv |first=Iza |last=Hussin |title=Sunni Schools of Jurisprudence |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor=Emad El-Din Shahin |year=2014 |doi=10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199739356.001.0001|isbn=9780199739356 }}</ref> In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=messick>{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first1=Brinkley|last1=Messick |first2=Joseph A.|last2=K\u00e9chichian|title=Fatw\u0101.

Most rely on ''[[taqlid]]'', or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.<ref>[http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=MNJ06&articleID=MNJ060001&articlePages=1]</ref><ref>[http://www.rissc.jo/docs/1N-WithCovers(lowres).pdf On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures]</ref>\n\nExperts and scholars of ''fiqh'' follow the ''[[usul al-fiqh|usul]]'' (principles) of their own native ''madhhab'', but they also study the ''usul'', evidences, and opinions of other ''madhahib''.\n\n===Sunni===\n{{Sunni Islam|Sunni Schools of Law}}\n\n[[Sunni]] schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them.  The four primary Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] rites. The [[Zahiri]] school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the [[Jariri]], [[Laythi]], [[Awza'i]], & [[Thawri]] have  become extinct.\n\nThe extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to [[Qiyas|analogical]] reason and pure reason.\n\n* The [[Hanafi]] school was founded by [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu\u2018man]]. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of [[Islam in Russia|Russia's Muslim community]]. There are movements within this school such as [[Barelvi]]s and [[Deobandi]], which are concentrated in South Asia.\n* The [[Maliki]] school was founded by [[Malik ibn Anas]]. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The [[Murabitun World Movement]] follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of [[Islam in Europe|Europe under Islamic rule]], particularly [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].\n* The [[Shafi'i]] school was founded by [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]]. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the [[Mappila]]s of [[Kerala]] and [[Konkani Muslims]] of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia.\n* The [[Hanbali]] school was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the [[Salafi]]st movement claims to follow this school.\n* The [[Zahiri]] school was founded by [[Dawud al-Zahiri]]. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain.\n\n===Shia===\n{{Shia Islam|collapsed=1}}\n{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}\n\n* [[Twelver]]s (see also ''[[Imami]]'')\n** [[Ja'fari]]: associated with [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].  The time and space bound [[Fatwa|rulings]] of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imams]].  The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the [['aql|intellect]] instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice.\n*** [[Usulism]]: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a [[Marja'|Marja-i Taqlid]] on the subject of [[taqlid]] and fiqh. They are concentrated in <nowiki>Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon</nowiki>.\n*** [[Akhbarism]]: similar to Usulis, however reject [[ijtihad]] in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain.\n*** [[Shaykhism]]: an Islamic religious movement founded by [[Shaykh Ahmad]] in the early 19th century [[Qajar dynasty]], Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the [[B\u00e1bism|B\u00e1b\u00ed]] and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.\n** The [[Batiniyyah]] school consists of [[Alevis]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashis]], and [[Alawites]], who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].\n*** [[Alawism]] is followed by [[Alawites]], who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their [[madh'hab]] was established by [[Ibn Nusayr]], and their [[aqidah]] is developed by [[Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b]].

In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Musta\u02bbl\u012b over Niz\u0101r as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the [[Taiyabi]], which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the [[Hafizi]] branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized [[Al-Amir]] as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that [[At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]] was the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The [[Hafizi]] themselves however considered [[Al-Hafiz]] as the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642), Ma'zoon (\u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646) and Mukasir (\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0633\u0631). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Sulaimani Bohra]], and [[Alavi Bohra]].\n** [[Nizari]]: the largest branch (95%) of [[Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b]], they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is currently invested in [[Aga Khan IV]]. Their present living Imam is [[Mawl\u0101n\u0101]] [[Shah Karim Al-Husayni]] who is the 49th Imam. [[Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b]]s believe that the successor-Im\u0101m to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] was his elder son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|al-Niz\u0101r]]. While ''[[Niz\u0101r\u012b]]'' belong to the \"[[Imami]] jurisprudence\" or [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'f\u0101riyya Madhab ''(school of Jurisprudence)'']], believed by Shias to be founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]] they adhere to sumpremacy of \"[[Kalam]]\", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh ''(traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]),'' which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] approach to [[revelation]].\n* [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] jurisprudence follows the teachings of [[Zayd ibn Ali]].

Schacht, ''The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), p. 9</ref> Regarding judicial practices, the qadis (judges) of Fustat resorted to the procedure called \"''al-yamin ma'a l-shahid''\", that is, the ability of the judge to base his verdict on one single witness and the oath of the claimant, instead of two witnesses as was usually required. Such a procedure was quite common under the early Umayyads, but by the early Abbasid period it had disappeared in Iraq and it was now regarded as the {{'}}''amal'' (\"good practice\") of Medina. Up until the end of the 8th century, the qadis of Fustat were still using this \"Medinan\" procedure and differentiated themselves from Iraqi practices. From a doctrinal point of view, however, the legal affiliation of Egypt could be more complex. The principal Egyptian jurist in the second half of the 8th century is al-Layth b. Sa'd.<ref>R.G.

Nevertheless, he distances himself from the Medinan School by opposing a series of Medinan legal views. He maintains that the common practice in other cities is also valuable, and thus implicitly defends the Egyptians\u2019 adherence to their own local tradition.

Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system. State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question). Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws. Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence. The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.<ref name=hussin>{{cite encyclopedia |ref=harv |first=Iza |last=Hussin |title=Sunni Schools of Jurisprudence |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |editor=Emad El-Din Shahin |year=2014 |doi=10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199739356.001.0001|isbn=9780199739356 }}</ref> In the 20th century many Islamic jurists began to assert their intellectual independence from traditional schools of jurisprudence.<ref name=messick>{{cite encyclopedia|ref=harv |first1=Brinkley|last1=Messick |first2=Joseph A.|last2=K\u00e9chichian|title=Fatw\u0101.

Most rely on ''[[taqlid]]'', or acceptance of religious rulings and epistemology from a higher religious authority in deferring meanings of analysis and derivation of legal practices instead of relying on subjective readings.<ref>[http://www.sahihmuslim.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=MNJ06&articleID=MNJ060001&articlePages=1]</ref><ref>[http://www.rissc.jo/docs/1N-WithCovers(lowres).pdf On Islam, Muslims and the 500 most influential figures]</ref>\n\nExperts and scholars of ''fiqh'' follow the ''[[usul al-fiqh|usul]]'' (principles) of their own native ''madhhab'', but they also study the ''usul'', evidences, and opinions of other ''madhahib''.\n\n===Sunni===\n{{Sunni Islam|Sunni Schools of Law}}\n\n[[Sunni]] schools of jurisprudence are each named after the classical jurist who taught them.  The four primary Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] rites. The [[Zahiri]] school remains in existence but outside of the mainstream, while the [[Jariri]], [[Laythi]], [[Awza'i]], [[Thawri]], & Qurtubi have  become extinct.\n\nThe extant schools share most of their rulings, but differ on the particular practices which they may accept as authentic and the varying weights they give to [[Qiyas|analogical]] reason and pure reason.\n\n* The [[Hanafi]] school was founded by [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu\u2018man]]. It is followed by Muslims in the Levant, Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, most of Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, the Balkans and by most of [[Islam in Russia|Russia's Muslim community]]. There are movements within this school such as [[Barelvi]]s and [[Deobandi]], which are concentrated in South Asia.\n* The [[Maliki]] school was founded by [[Malik ibn Anas]]. It is followed by Muslims in North Africa, West Africa, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, in parts of Saudi Arabia and in Upper Egypt. The [[Murabitun World Movement]] follows this school as well. In the past, it was also followed in parts of [[Islam in Europe|Europe under Islamic rule]], particularly [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]].\n* The [[Shafi'i]] school was founded by [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i]]. It is followed by Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Eastern Lower Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, Jordan, Palestine, the Philippines, Singapore, Somalia, Thailand, Yemen, Kurdistan, and the [[Mappila]]s of [[Kerala]] and [[Konkani Muslims]] of India. It is the official school followed by the governments of Brunei and Malaysia.\n* The [[Hanbali]] school was founded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]]. It is followed by Muslims in Qatar, most of Saudi Arabia and minority communities in Syria and Iraq. The majority of the [[Salafi]]st movement claims to follow this school.\n* The [[Zahiri]] school was founded by [[Dawud al-Zahiri]]. It is followed by minority communities in Morocco and Pakistan. In the past, it was also followed by the majority of Muslims in Mesopotamia, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, North Africa and parts of Spain.\n\n===Shia===\n{{Shia Islam|collapsed=1}}\n{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}\n\n* [[Twelver]]s (see also ''[[Imami]]'')\n** [[Ja'fari]]: associated with [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].  The time and space bound [[Fatwa|rulings]] of early jurists are taken more seriously in this school, likely due to the more hierarchical structure of Shia Islam which is ruled by the Shi'ite [[Imam (Shia Islam)|Imams]].  The Ja'fari school is also more flexible in that every jurist has considerable power to alter a decision according to his reasoning. The Jafari school uses the [['aql|intellect]] instead of analogy when establishing Islamic laws, as opposed to common Sunni practice.\n*** [[Usulism]]: forms the overwhelming majority within the Twelver Shia denomination. They follow a [[Marja'|Marja-i Taqlid]] on the subject of [[taqlid]] and fiqh. They are concentrated in <nowiki>Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, India, Iraq, and Lebanon</nowiki>.\n*** [[Akhbarism]]: similar to Usulis, however reject [[ijtihad]] in favor of hadith. Concentrated in Bahrain.\n*** [[Shaykhism]]: an Islamic religious movement founded by [[Shaykh Ahmad]] in the early 19th century [[Qajar dynasty]], Iran, now retaining a minority following in Iran and Iraq. It began from a combination of Sufi and Shia and Akhbari doctrines. In the mid 19th-century many Shaykhis converted to the [[B\u00e1bism|B\u00e1b\u00ed]] and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] religions, which regard Shaykh Ahmad highly.\n** The [[Batiniyyah]] school consists of [[Alevis]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashis]], and [[Alawites]], who developed their own fiqh system and do not pursue the [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]].\n*** [[Alawism]] is followed by [[Alawites]], who are also called Nusayris, Nusairis, Namiriya or Ansariyya. Their [[madh'hab]] was established by [[Ibn Nusayr]], and their [[aqidah]] is developed by [[Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b]]. They follow ''Cill\u012b'' [[aqidah]] of ''\"Maym\u016bn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b]] fiqh\"'' of the [[\u2018Alawi]]s.<ref name=\"Meym\u00fbn\">\"Muhammad ibn \u0100liyy\u2019\u016bl Cill\u012b [[aqidah]]\" of \"Maym\u016bn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b]] fiqh\" (S\u016blaiman Affandy, ''Al-B\u0101k\u016brat\u2019\u016bs S\u016blaiman\u2019\u012byyah - [[Family tree]] of the [[Nusayri]] [[Tariqat]],'' pp. 14-15, [[Beirut]], 1873.)</ref><ref>Both ''Muhammad ibn \u0100liyy\u2019\u016bl Cill\u012b'' and ''Maym\u016bn ibn [[Al-Tabarani|Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim\u2019at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b]]'' were the [[murid]]s of ''\"[[Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b]]\"'', the founder of the [[Nusayri]] [[tariqat]].</ref> Slightly over one million of them live in Syria and Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-alawi.htm|title=Alawi Islam|author=John Pike|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n*** [[Alevism]], sometimes categorized as part of Twelver Shia Islam and sometimes as its own religious tradition, as it has markedly different philosophy, customs, and rituals. They have many ''[[Tasawwuf]]\u012b'' characteristics and express belief in the [[Qur'an]] and [[The Twelve Imams]], but reject [[polygamy]] and accept religious traditions predating Islam, like Turkish [[shamanism]]. They are significant in East-Central Turkey. They are sometimes considered a Sufi sect, and have an untraditional form of religious leadership that is not scholarship oriented like other Sunni and Shia groups. They number around 24 million worldwide, of which 17 million are in [[Turkey]], with the rest in the [[Balkans]], [[Albania]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]] and [[Syria]].\n* [[Ismaili]] Muslims who adhere to the [[Shi'a]] [[Ismaili]] [[Fatimid]] fiqh, follow the ''[[Daim al-Islam]]'', a book on the rulings of Islam. It describes manners and etiquette, including [[Ibadat]] in the light of guidance provided by the Ismaili Imams. The book emphasizes what importance Islam has given to manners and etiquette along with the worship of God, citing the traditions of the first four Imams of the Shi'a Ismaili Fatimid school of thought.\n** T\u0101yyeb\u012b Must\u0101'l\u012byyah: the [[Mustaali]] group of Ismaili Muslims differ from the Niz\u0101riyya in that they believe that the successor-Im\u0101m to the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustansir, was his younger son al-Musta\u02bbl\u012b, who was made Caliph by the Fatimad Regent [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]]. In contrast to the Nizaris, they accept the younger brother al-Musta\u02bbl\u012b over Niz\u0101r as their Imam. The Bohras are an offshoot of the [[Taiyabi]], which itself was an offshoot of the Mustaali. The Taiyabi, supporting another offshoot of the Mustaali, the [[Hafizi]] branch, split with the Mustaali Fatimid, who recognized [[Al-Amir]] as their last Imam. The split was due to the Taiyabi believing that [[At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim]] was the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The [[Hafizi]] themselves however considered [[Al-Hafiz]] as the next rightful Imam after [[Al-Amir]]. The Bohras believe that their 21st Imam, Taiyab abi al-Qasim, went into seclusion and established the offices of the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0644\u0642), Ma'zoon (\u0645\u0623\u0630\u0648\u0646) and Mukasir (\u0645\u0643\u0627\u0633\u0631). The Bohras are the only surviving branch of the Mustaali and themselves have split into the [[Dawoodi Bohra]], [[Sulaimani Bohra]], and [[Alavi Bohra]].\n** [[Nizari]]: the largest branch (95%) of [[Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b]], they are the only Shia group to have their absolute temporal leader in the rank of Imamate, which is currently invested in [[Aga Khan IV]]. Their present living Imam is [[Mawl\u0101n\u0101]] [[Shah Karim Al-Husayni]] who is the 49th Imam. [[Niz\u0101r\u012b Ism\u0101'\u012bl\u012b]]s believe that the successor-Im\u0101m to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] was his elder son [[Nizar (Fatimid Imam)|al-Niz\u0101r]]. While ''[[Niz\u0101r\u012b]]'' belong to the \"[[Imami]] jurisprudence\" or [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Ja'f\u0101riyya Madhab ''(school of Jurisprudence)'']], believed by Shias to be founded by Imam [[Jafar Sadiq|Ja'far as-Sadiq]] they adhere to sumpremacy of \"[[Kalam]]\", in the interpretation of scripture, and believe in the temporal relativism of understanding, as opposed to fiqh ''(traditional [[nomianism|legalism]]),'' which adheres to an [[Moral absolutism|absolutism]] approach to [[revelation]].\n* [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] jurisprudence follows the teachings of [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. In terms of law, the Zaidi school is quite similar to the Hanafi school from Sunni Islam.<ref name=\"Sayyid 2005\">Article by Sayyid 'Ali ibn 'Ali Al-Zaidi, \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646 (A short History of the Yemenite Shi\u2018ites, 2005)</ref> This is likely due to the general trend of Sunni resemblance within Zaidi beliefs. After the passing of Muhammad, Imam [[Jafar al-Sadiq]], Imam [[Zayd ibn Ali]], Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]] worked together in [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi]] in Medina along with over 70 other leading jurists and scholars{{fact|date=November 2018}}. [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] did not themselves write any books{{fact|date=November 2018}}. But their views are Hadiths in the books written by Imams [[Abu Hanifa]] and Imam [[Malik ibn Anas]].
