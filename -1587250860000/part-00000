When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

When it reached the area as planned, at 15:53 [[Eastern European Summer Time|local time]] (12:53&nbsp;UTC), [[Dnipropetrovsk]] Air Control (''Dnipro Control'') asked MH17 if they could climb to FL 350 as planned, and also to avoid a potential [[Conflict (air traffic control)|separation conflict]] with another flight, [[Singapore Airlines]] Flight 351 (SQ351), also at FL 330. The crew asked to remain at FL 330 and the air traffic controller approved this request, moving the other flight to FL 350.

This request was also approved by ''Dnipro Control'' [[Air traffic control|ATC]].

At 16:19 local time (13:19 UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' noticed that the flight was {{convert|3.6|nmi|km}} north of the centreline of approved airway and instructed MH17 to return to the track. At 16:19 local time (13:19&nbsp;UTC), ''Dnipro Control'' contacted Russian ATC in [[Rostov-on-Don]] (''RND Control'') by telephone and requested clearance to transfer the flight to Russian [[airspace]]. After obtaining the permission, ''Dnipro Control'' attempted to contact MH17 for handing them off to ''RND Control'' at 16:20 local time (13:20&nbsp;UTC), but the aircraft did not respond. When MH17 did not respond to several calls, ''Dnipro Control'' contacted ''RND Control'' again to check if they could see the aircraft on their radar.

On December 27, 2014, the main line service was further extended to [[Yongsan Station]] from Gongdeok Station, and the service was renamed to the '''Gyeongui\u2013Jungang Line''' following the merging of the line with the [[Jungang Line]].\n\nThe term \"subway\" in reference to this line is somewhat of a misnomer, as the line runs underground for less than three percent of its length. The upgraded line simply follows alignment of the old line built 100 years ago.  The outer portion of the line runs largely through countryside rice paddies, forests, and vegetable fields, and outside of Seoul rarely enters urbanized areas. It is mostly at-grade, and includes several at-grade crossings with local roads, where Korail employees stand by on duty to stop traffic.\n\n===Regular rail service===\nBefore the integration with the subway system, the most common service on the line was a [[Tonggeun]] train service between Seoul and Imjingang, with one [[Saemaeul-ho]] train. Since the line was integrated with the Seoul Subway system, Tonggeun service had been restricted to a few stations in the north, from Munsan to Imjingang, with a few continuing on to Dorasan, near the North Korean border.\n\n===KTX===\nThere is a depot for [[Korea Train Express]] (KTX) trains along the Gyeongui Line at [[Haengsin Station]].<ref name=\"LaunchHSR2007\">{{cite journal |last=Lee

Northern trains would have terminated north of Kaes\u014fng.\n\nAfter the end of the [[Korean War]] in 1953, southern trains were cut back to around [[Munsan]] (north of Seoul), with northern trains terminating at Kaes\u014fng.

Since the line was integrated with the Seoul Subway system, Tonggeun service had been restricted to a few stations in the north, from Munsan to Imjingang, with a few continuing on to Dorasan, near the North Korean border.\n\n===KTX===\nThere is a depot for [[Korea Train Express]] (KTX) trains along the Gyeongui Line at [[Haengsin Station]].<ref name=\"LaunchHSR2007\">{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Kyung Chul |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr48/pdf/f30_Lee.pdf |title=Launch of Korean High-Speed Railway and Efforts to Innovate Future Korean Railway |journal=Japan Railway & Transport Review |issue=48 |pages=30\u201335 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-23 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5x9g0ZueU?url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr48/pdf/f30_Lee.pdf |archive-date=2011-03-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Some KTX services thus continue beyond Seoul respective Yongsan Station and terminate at [[Haengsin Station]].<ref name=\"booking\">{{cite web |url=http://www.korail.com/en/rv/pr21100/w_pr21110.jsp |title=Booking |publisher=[[Korail]] |accessdate=2010-10-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713164814/http://www.korail.com/en/rv/pr21100/w_pr21110.jsp |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe line may see more KTX service after the upgrade for 230&nbsp;km/h considered in the government's strategic plan for 2020.<ref name=\"plans2020\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Stations==\nThis list does not include stations served only by [[Gyeongui-Jungang Line]] metro trains.\n\nUncheon, Imjingang, and Dorasan stations are planned to become a part of the Gyeongui-Jungang Line sometime after 2020.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Station number<br><small>(Seoul Subway)</small>'''\n!'''Station'''\n!'''[[Hangul]]'''\n!'''[[Hanja]]'''\n!'''Services'''\n|-\n|P313\n|[[Seoul Station|Seoul]]\n|{{lang|ko|[[:ko:\uc11c\uc6b8\uc5ed|\uc11c\uc6b8]]}} \n|\n|[[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]: {{rint|seoul|1}} {{rint|seoul|4}} {{rint|seoul|arx}}<br>[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Gyeongbu High Speed Railway|Gyeongbu HSR]]<br>{{nowrap|[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Gyeongbu Line#KTX|Gyeongbu]]}}<br>{{nowrap|[[File:Korail logo.svg|100x12px|link=Korail]] {{small|[[ITX-Saemaeul]] services}}}}<br>{{nowrap|[[File:Korail logo.svg|100x12px|link=Korail]] {{small|[[Mugunghwa-ho]] services}}}}<br>DMZ Train\n|-\n|K320\n|[[Haengsin Station|Haengsin]]\n|{{lang|ko|[[:ko:\ud589\uc2e0\uc5ed|\ud589\uc2e0]]}} \n|{{linktext|\u5e78|\u4fe1}}\n|[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Gyeongbu High Speed Railway|Gyeongbu HSR]]<br>[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Honam High Speed Railway|Honam HSR]]<br>{{nowrap|[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Gyeongbu Line#KTX|Gyeongbu]]}} {{nowrap|[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Honam Line#Honam KTX|Honam]]}}<br>{{nowrap|[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Gyeongjeon Line#Gyeongjeon KTX|Gyeongjeon]]}} {{nowrap|[[File:KTX logo.svg|100x12px|link=KTX]] [[Jeolla Line#Jeolla KTX|Jeolla]]}}\n|-\n|K335 (terminus)\n|[[Munsan Station|Munsan]]\n|{{lang|ko|[[:ko:\ubb38\uc0b0\uc5ed|\ubb38\uc0b0]]}} \n|{{linktext|\u6c76|\u5c71}}\n|rowspan =4| [[DMZ Train]]\n|-\n|K336 (TBD)\n|[[Uncheon Station (Paju)|Uncheon]]\n|{{lang|ko|[[:ko:\uc6b4\ucc9c\uc5ed (\ud30c\uc8fc)|\uc6b4\ucc9c]]}} \n|{{linktext|\u96f2|\u6cc9}}\n|-\n|K336\n|[[Imjingang Station|Imjingang]]\n|{{lang|ko|[[:ko:\uc784\uc9c4\uac15\uc5ed|\uc784\uc9c4\uac15]]}} \n|{{linktext|\u81e8|\u6d25|\u6c5f}}\n|-\n|K338 (TBD)\n|[[Dorasan Station|Dorasan]]\n|{{lang|ko|[[:ko:\ub3c4\ub77c\uc0b0\uc5ed|\ub3c4\ub77c\uc0b0]]}} \n|{{linktext|\u90fd|\u7f85|\u5c71}}\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Korail]]\n* [[Gyeongui\u2013Jungang Line]]\n* [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]\n* [[Pyongui Line]]\n* [[Pyongbu Line]]\n* [[Transportation in North Korea]]\n* [[Transportation in South Korea]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat-inline}}\n\n{{Public transport in the Seoul Metropolitan Area}}\n{{Gyeongui Line}}\n{{Korail Lines}}\n{{KTX lines and services}}\n\n[[Category:Gyeongui Line| ]]\n[[Category:Railway lines in South Korea]]\n[[Category:International railway lines]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge railways in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Korea]]\n[[Category:Seoul Metropolitan Subway lines]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1905]]\n[[Category:1905 establishments in Korea]]\n", "name_user": "Mtattrain", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeongui_Line"}

This is polite judicial language.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

This is polite judicial language.

This is how many saw his trial and, in this sense, it was a political trial.\" Human rights lawyer Frank Brennan said: \"I was a law and politics student in Queensland in the 1970s when [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] was premier. This Pell saga has all the marks of the same broken-down criminal justice system.

They did not interview the men who ordinarily accompanied Pell around the Cathedral on the day of the first alleged offence in the open sacristy, and they did not interview any of the 50 witnesses present for the alleged second assault in a public corridor. Paul Kelly wrote \"The Ferguson-Maxwell majority said they found 'improbable' the idea that the complainant 'would have thought to invent a second incident if his true purpose was to advance false allegations' against Pell because this second allegation only risked the likelihood his entire position 'would unravel' when tested. In short, the sheer dubious nature of A\u2019s second complaint must be a sign of his credibility! What hope did Pell have against this logic?

Boundaries were drafted taking account of the discontinuities in Rome's urban pattern\nThe urban zones are identified by an alphanumeric code that consists of a letter and of the number of the ''municipio'' where the zone was located: indeed, the ''municipi'' were reduced from 20 to 15 in 2013, but the alphanumeric codes were not revised.\n\n* '''[[Municipio I]]''': 1A Historic centre, 1B

which are organized into four groups:\n* 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' located in the historic centre of the city, mostly within the [[Aurelian Walls]], except for [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]];\n* 35 ''[[Quarters of Rome|quartieri]]'' surrounding the historic centre of Rome outside the Aurelian Walls;\n* 6 ''[[Suburbs of Rome|suburbi]]'' located in the suburban area of the city;\n* 53 ''[[Zones of Rome|zone]]'' in the countryside of the ''comune''.\n\n===List of historic Rioni in Rome's centre===\n{{See also|Rioni of Rome}}\nThe ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regiones of ancient Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870 when Rome became the capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls]]. In 1874 a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Rome rioni with numbers.PNG|thumb|500px|right|A map of Rome's historic center with its [[Rioni of Rome|Rioni]].]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rione!!Name!!Population<br><small>(2016)</small>\n|-\n|R.

On 11 February 1972 those areas were increased to 20.\n\nOn 6 March 1992, after the [[referendum]] that ratified the separation of the then ''Circoscrizione XIV'' from Rome and the birth of the new independent ''comune'' of [[Fiumicino]], the number of administrative areas of Rome decreased to 19.\n\nOn 19 January 2001, ''circoscrizioni'' which were renamed ''municipi'' and the direct election of a President to head each ''municipio'' wa established.<ref>{{cite web|title=Strutture territoriali|publisher=Comune di Roma|accessdate=20 December 2013|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?jppagecode=municipi.wp|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 March 2013, [[City Council of Rome|Rome City Council]] decided to merge some of the ''municipi'', reducing their number to 15 and giving them a new numeration.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roma, s\u00ec all'accorpamento dei municipi: il Consiglio li riduce da 19 a 15|url=http://www.ilmessaggero.it/roma/campidoglio/roma_municipi_accorpamento_consiglio_s_riduzione/notizie/257651.shtml#|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Il Messaggero|date=11 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==''Municipi''==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|-\n!

which are organized into four groups:\n* 22 ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' located in the historic centre of the city, mostly within the [[Aurelian Walls]], except for [[Prati]] and [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]];\n* 35 ''[[Quarters of Rome|quartieri]]'' surrounding the historic centre of Rome outside the Aurelian Walls;\n* 6 ''[[Suburbs of Rome|suburbi]]'' located in the suburban area of the city;\n* 53 ''[[Zones of Rome|zone]]'' in the countryside of the ''comune''.\n\n===List of historic Rioni in Rome's centre===\n{{See also|Rioni of Rome}}\nThe ''[[Rioni of Rome|rioni]]'' originate from the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|Regiones of ancient Rome]], which evolved in the Middle Ages into the [[14 regions of Medieval Rome|medieval rioni]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Rioni.html |title=The \"Rioni\" of Rome |publisher=Romeartlover.it |accessdate=3 February 2010}}</ref> In the [[Renaissance]], under Pope [[Sixtus V]], they reached again the number of fourteen, and their boundaries were finally defined under [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1743.\n\nA new subdivision of the city under [[Napoleon]] was ephemeral, and there were no sensible changes in the organisation of the city until 1870 when Rome became the capital of Italy. The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls]]. In 1874 a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city the name \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[Image:Rome rioni with numbers.PNG|thumb|500px|right|A map of Rome's historic center with its [[Rioni of Rome|Rioni]].]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rione!!Name!!Population<br><small>(2016)</small>\n|-\n|R.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J.

He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run.

Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltsby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n==== Character ====\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

There are more than 50 discovered [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the [[Thracians]]. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The [[Panagyurishte Treasure]] unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164&nbsp;kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the fall of Rome.\n\nMost of the region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are [[Tsepina]] near the village of [[Dorkovo]] and [[Krasen (fortress)|Krasen]] in the vicinities of [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]].\n\nThe [[April Uprising]] of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of [[Panagyurishte]] became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the [[Batak massacre]]. According to the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region [[Eastern Rumelia]] which [[Unification of Bulgaria|united]] with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] on 6 September 1885.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oborishte127.JPG|left|thumb|The village of [[Oborishte]].]]\n\nThe Pazardzhik Province is situated in central part of southern Bulgaria and borders the provinces of [[Plovdiv Province|Plovdiv]], [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]] and [[Sofia Province|Sofia]]. The total area of the region is 4,458&nbsp;km\u00b2 which is 4% of the national territory. Forests account for more than half of the area (57.1%); the arable land is 35.6%, urban territory is 3.3%, rivers and lakes occupy 2.6%, road infrastructure - 0.6% and quarries and mines - 0,4%.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\n[[File:Panagyurishte-library.jpg|thumb|The [[chitalishte]] \"Videlina\" in [[Panagyurishte]].]]\nThe northern parts of the region include the middle ridges of the [[Sredna Gora]] mountain, to the south the relief flattens and forms the western-most parts of the [[Upper Thracian Plain]] and to the south are located the [[Rhodope Mountains]] where most of the forests are situated. The highest point of the region is Savov Vrah at an altitude of 2,306 m while the lowest altitude is around 200 m in the plains of the central area.<ref name=\"of\">[http://www.pz.government.bg/pz/fr_engl.html Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]</ref> The climate is transcontinental with milder winter than northern Bulgaria in the lowlands but with very low temperatures and high snowfall in the mountain areas. The average annual temperature is 11.3&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"of\"/>\n\nThe province is abundant in [[water resources]], its main [[waterway]] is the river [[Maritsa]] and its [[catchment basin]] includes the [[Topolnitsa River]] and [[Luda Yana River]] from the north and Stara Reka from the south. There are three main reservoirs all situated in the Rhodope Mountains within the municipal limits of [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]] - [[Batak Reservoir]], [[Golyam Beglik]] and [[Shiroka Polyana]]. A fourth large dam lake, the [[Dospat Reservoir]] is only partially in the region. In Sredna Gora to the north is [[Topolnitsa Reservoir]] shared with the Sofia Province and a dam near Panagyurishte which is in initial stages of construction.\n\n==Municipalities==\n[[Image:Pazardzik Oblast map.png|right|thumb|250px|Map of Pazardzik Province]]\nThe Pazardzik province (\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442, ''oblast'') contains 12 municipalities ({{lang-bg|\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430|translit=obshtina}} - plural: {{lang|bg|\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0438}}, {{transl|bg|obshtini}}).

The \"Batashki Vodnosilov Pat\" is an important hydrocomplex consisting of three hydro power plants- \"Batak\", \"Peshtera\" and \"Aleko\" with combined capacity of around 250 MW. Copper extracting industry is of national and European importance with major mines located around Panagyurishte (Asarel and Medet), [[Elshitsa]], [[Tsar Asen]] and [[Mina Radka]]. Machine building industry is developed in [[Pazardzhik]] (lead acid batteries), [[Panagyurishte]] (optical), [[Velingrad]]. There is flourishing pharmaceutical industry in [[Peshtera]] with more than 1 000 employees in the plant. Paper industry is developed in [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Timber industry is very important in the southern part of the region (the Rhodopes)- [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Peshtera]], [[Rakitovo]] and [[Velingrad]]. The manufacturing of textiles is well developed in [[Pazardzhik]], [[Panagyurishte]] and [[Velingrad]]. There is a huge footwear plant in [[Peshtera]]. Food processing industry is developed in most of the towns.\nAgriculture is also important, especially in the fertile central parts of the region. The most important crops are orchards (apples, plums and strawberries), grapes, wheat, barley, rye and rice.  Livestock breeding is relatively well developed in the mountainous areas.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:BatakChurch.JPG|thumb|left|A church in [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]].]]\nThe province has considerable opportunities to develop mountain and rural tourism, especially in the southern parts where the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains are located. The slopes are covered with dense deciduous and higher up, coniferous forests, dotted with numerous artificial lakes. The largest one is the [[Batak Dam]], on whose shores are built two resorts: ''Tsigov Chark'' and ''Saint Konstantin'' as well as many villas and shrines.  Fish is abundant in the dams, including [[carp]], [[rudd]], [[Rutilus|roach]] [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], [[perch]], [[zander]] and many others; the mountain streams are rich in [[trout]].  There are spa resorts in [[Velingrad]], [[Strelcha]], [[Banya, Pazardzhik Province|Banya]], [[Varvara, Pazardzhik Province|Varvara]].  The most famous landmarks are located in [[Panagyurishte]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Velingrad]].\n\nImpressive ruins of an ancient basilica (the [[Belovo Basilica]]) rise in the hilly country, close to the town of [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Numerous ruined fortresses are scattered around the province, the most famous of these are [[Tsepina]], and the ramparts near [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]] and [[Strelcha]]. The medieval [[Church of St Demetrius, Patalenitsa|Church of St Demetrius]] in the village of [[Patalenitsa]] has frescoes dating to the 12th\u201313th century.\n\n==Transportation and communications==\nThe road network is not dense.  The [[Trakiya motorway]] runs through the middle of the region. The main railway between [[Sofia]] and [[Plovdiv]] also runs through it.  There are two other railways: to [[Panagyurishte]] and to [[Peshtera]].  There are several military airports. \nAs everywhere in [[Bulgaria]], every town and village in the region is provided with electricity, drinking water and telephone network.  Each town and some villages are provided with Internet connection, and the cellular phone coverage is almost 100%, as most people own GSMs.\nSome of the interconnecting roads, especially higher up the mountain, are currently in a very bad state following heavy downpours in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n*[[List of villages in Pazardzhik Province]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pz.government.bg/news.php Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Pazardzhik Province\n|North     = [[Sofia Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Plovdiv Province]]\n|Southeast = [[Smolyan Province]]\n|South     = \n|Southwest = [[Blagoevgrad Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[Sofia Province]]\n}}\n\n<br/>{{Provinces of Bulgaria}}\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Pazardzhik Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|42|5|N|24|15|E|region:BG|display=title}}\n{{Short description|Province of Bulgaria}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Pazardzhik Province\n| native_name             = \u041e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442 \u041f\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043a\n| native_name_lang        = bul<!-- ISO 639-2 code e.g. \"bul\" for Bulgarian.

There are more than 50 discovered [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] settlements. The earliest civilization to inhabit the region were the [[Thracians]]. The remains of the Thracian town Besapara are located in the hills near the provincial capital Pazardzhik. The [[Panagyurishte Treasure]] unearthed near the northern town of the same name is known as one of the finest examples of Thracian art. The 6.164&nbsp;kg of 23-karat gold treasure which consists of nine vessels has been dated back to the 4th and 3rd century BC. In the 1st century BC the region became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province and remained in the [[Byzantine Empire]] after the fall of Rome.\n\nMost of the region became part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the beginning of the 9th century and remained in Bulgarian hands until the fall of the First Empire. With the rise of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] the region once again became part of the country until it was overran by the [[Ottomans]] in the late 14th century. Some of medieval fortresses are [[Tsepina]] near the village of [[Dorkovo]] and [[Krasen (fortress)|Krasen]] in the vicinities of [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]].\n\nThe [[April Uprising]] of 1876 against the Ottoman rule was widely supported within the region and the town of [[Panagyurishte]] became the center of the uprising. The Bulgarian population also rebelled to the south where the Ottoman atrocities culminated in the [[Batak massacre]]. According to the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] after the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] in 1878 the region was included in the autonomous region [[Eastern Rumelia]] which [[Unification of Bulgaria|united]] with the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] on 6 September 1885.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oborishte127.JPG|left|thumb|The village of [[Oborishte]].]]\n\nThe Pazardzhik Province is situated in central part of southern Bulgaria and borders the provinces of [[Plovdiv Province|Plovdiv]], [[Smolyan Province|Smolyan]], [[Blagoevgrad Province|Blagoevgrad]] and [[Sofia Province|Sofia]]. The total area of the region is 4,458&nbsp;km\u00b2 which is 4% of the national territory.

The \"Batashki Vodnosilov Pat\" is an important hydrocomplex consisting of three hydro power plants- \"Batak\", \"Peshtera\" and \"Aleko\" with combined capacity of around 250 MW. Copper extracting industry is of national and European importance with major mines located around Panagyurishte (Asarel and Medet), [[Elshitsa]], [[Tsar Asen]] and [[Mina Radka]]. Machine building industry is developed in [[Pazardzhik]] (lead acid batteries), [[Panagyurishte]] (optical), [[Velingrad]]. There is flourishing pharmaceutical industry in [[Peshtera]] with more than 1 000 employees in the plant. Paper industry is developed in [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Timber industry is very important in the southern part of the region (the Rhodopes)- [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Peshtera]], [[Rakitovo]] and [[Velingrad]]. The manufacturing of textiles is well developed in [[Pazardzhik]], [[Panagyurishte]] and [[Velingrad]]. There is a huge footwear plant in [[Peshtera]]. Food processing industry is developed in most of the towns.\nAgriculture is also important, especially in the fertile central parts of the region. The most important crops are orchards (apples, plums and strawberries), grapes, wheat, barley, rye and rice.  Livestock breeding is relatively well developed in the mountainous areas.\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:BatakChurch.JPG|thumb|left|A church in [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]].]]\nThe province has considerable opportunities to develop mountain and rural tourism, especially in the southern parts where the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope]] mountains are located. The slopes are covered with dense deciduous and higher up, coniferous forests, dotted with numerous artificial lakes. The largest one is the [[Batak Dam]], on whose shores are built two resorts: ''Tsigov Chark'' and ''Saint Konstantin'' as well as many villas and shrines.  Fish is abundant in the dams, including [[carp]], [[rudd]], [[Rutilus|roach]] [[Barbel (fish)|barbel]], [[perch]], [[zander]] and many others; the mountain streams are rich in [[trout]].  There are spa resorts in [[Velingrad]], [[Strelcha]], [[Banya, Pazardzhik Province|Banya]], [[Varvara, Pazardzhik Province|Varvara]].  The most famous landmarks are located in [[Panagyurishte]], [[Pazardzhik]], [[Batak, Bulgaria|Batak]], [[Velingrad]].\n\nImpressive ruins of an ancient basilica (the [[Belovo Basilica]]) rise in the hilly country, close to the town of [[Belovo, Bulgaria|Belovo]]. Numerous ruined fortresses are scattered around the province, the most famous of these are [[Tsepina]], and the ramparts near [[Bata, Pazardzhik Province|Bata]] and [[Strelcha]]. The medieval [[Church of St Demetrius, Patalenitsa|Church of St Demetrius]] in the village of [[Patalenitsa]] has frescoes dating to the 12th\u201313th century.\n\n==Transportation and communications==\nThe road network is not dense.  The [[Trakiya motorway]] runs through the middle of the region. The main railway between [[Sofia]] and [[Plovdiv]] also runs through it.  There are two other railways: to [[Panagyurishte]] and to [[Peshtera]].  There are several military airports. \nAs everywhere in [[Bulgaria]], every town and village in the region is provided with electricity, drinking water and telephone network.  Each town and some villages are provided with Internet connection, and the cellular phone coverage is almost 100%, as most people own GSMs.\nSome of the interconnecting roads, especially higher up the mountain, are currently in a very bad state following heavy downpours in 2005 and 2006.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n*[[List of villages in Pazardzhik Province]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pz.government.bg/news.php Official site of the Pazardzhik Province]\n\n{{Geographic Location\n|Centre    = Pazardzhik Province\n|North     = [[Sofia Province]]\n|Northeast = \n|East      = [[Plovdiv Province]]\n|Southeast = [[Smolyan Province]]\n|South     = \n|Southwest = [[Blagoevgrad Province]]\n|West      = \n|Northwest = [[Sofia Province]]\n}}\n\n<br/>{{Provinces of Bulgaria}}\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Pazardzhik Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Bulgaria]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePopulation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazardzhik_Province"}
