The cars were built in [[La Pocati\u00e8re]], [[Quebec]], with final assembly done in [[Auburn, New York]] and [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, Vermont]] under a license from [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], manufacturer of the previous [[R62 (New York City Subway car)|R62]] order. A total of 825 cars were built, arranged as sets of three, four, or five cars per set. The cars replaced the remaining [[R17 (New York City Subway car)|R17s]], [[R21 (New York City Subway car)|R21s]], and [[R22 (New York City Subway car)|R22s]], which were all retired by early 1988.<ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1988\"/><ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1998\"/><ref name=\"Feinman 2004\"/>\n\nThe R62As were a follow-up order to the R62 order from 1981, and the second order of stainless steel cars for the \"A\" Division. The contract had been given to Bombardier due to Kawasaki's refusal to build the additional cars under a separate order. The first R62As entered service on May 29, 1985, and all were delivered by 1988. The R62As are scheduled to remain in service until 2026\u20132028, when they will be replaced with the [[R262 (New York City Subway car)|R262s]].\n\n==Description==\nThe R62As are numbered 1651-2475. The cars were originally single cars with functioning half-width cabs at both ends, but all cars running on the '''{{NYCS|1}}''' (based at [[240th Street Yard]] in [[the Bronx]]) and the '''{{NYCS|6}}''' (based at the [[Westchester Yard]] in the Bronx) are now linked as 5-car sets. These sets have full-width cabs at each end, but retain intermediate half-width cabs in the remaining cab positions. 21 cars in the 1900 series are stored at the [[Livonia Yard]] in Brooklyn and usually run on the [[42nd Street Shuttle]], which uses single cars linked as three and four-car sets.<ref>[http://s1053.photobucket.com/user/TomraTx2/media/R62Ayardroster_zpsca97c2c3.png.html]</ref>\n\nMost cars on the '''6''' feature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights on the sides of the cars around the [[rollsign]] where the service logo is indicated to help riders distinguish between an express train (red diamond) and a local train (green circle). These indicators were first introduced on the '''{{NYCS|7}}''' when the passengers claimed they could not hear clearly the announcements regarding whether the '''7''' was express or local, even though the '''7 Express''' sign was used on the front and sides prior to its implementation in 2008.<ref>http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?62174</ref> Cars 1736-1740 and 2151 were used as test cars as early as April 12, 2007, and had red LED lettering displaying \"LCL\" and \"EXP\" on the front and the side; similar labeling was last seen on the Redbird fleet.<ref>http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?76703</ref><ref>http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?74975</ref> When the [[R188 (New York City Subway car)|R188s]] displaced the R62As from the '''7''' to the '''6''' during the 2010s, the LED lights remained in use since both the '''6''' and the '''7''' local services have express variants that run in the peak direction during rush hours.\n\nLike the [[R62 (New York City Subway car)|R62]] order from [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], the R62A was made of [[stainless steel]] and had [[air conditioning]]. A [[graffiti]]-resistant glaze was applied to all of the cars because of the extensive [[History of the New York City Subway#Graffiti|graffiti tagging]] of nearly all of the subway cars in the system since 1971. They continued a controversial interior design by employing [[bucket seat]]ing, which was very narrow with each seat being about {{convert|17|in}} wide. This reduced the number of seats per car when compared to standard bench seating, but allowed for higher standing capacity.\n\n==History==\nFollowing the successful delivery of the 325-car R62 order, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA) put out a bid for an additional 825 cars. Kawasaki did not want to build the additional cars under a separate contract, so the R62A contract was awarded to [[Bombardier Transportation]] of Quebec, who won the bid over [[Budd Company]] of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1988\">{{cite web | title=www.nycsubway.org: R-62 (Kawasaki) -- R-62A (Bombardier) | website=www.nycsubway.org | date=1988 | url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/R-62_(Kawasaki)_--_R-62A_(Bombardier) | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1998\">{{cite web | title=www.nycsubway.org: Chapter 11, Another Renewal for the IRT | website=www.nycsubway.org | date=April 10, 1998 | url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Another_Renewal_for_the_IRT | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Feinman 2004\">{{cite web | last=Feinman | first=Mark S. | title=www.nycsubway.org: The New York Transit Authority in the 1980s | website=www.nycsubway.org | date=December 8, 2004 | url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_New_York_Transit_Authority_in_the_1980s#New_Subway_Cars_for_New_York | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref> While Bombardier offered a higher price per car than Budd had, the NYCTA awarded the contract to Bombardier because of the [[Canadian government]]'s financial plan for the cars.

They were placed in service on the '''{{NYCS|1}}''' train on May 29, 1985, after arrangements were made to expand the Car Appearance Program to the route (following successful implementation of the same on the '''4''' train with the R62s).\n\n===Post-delivery===\nCar 1687 was badly damaged at the Bombardier plant in the summer of 1985, prior to its delivery.

The cars were built in [[La Pocati\u00e8re]], [[Quebec]], with final assembly done in [[Auburn, New York]] and [[Barre, Vermont (city)|Barre, Vermont]] under a license from [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], manufacturer of the previous [[R62 (New York City Subway car)|R62]] order. A total of 825 cars were built, arranged as sets of three, four, or five cars per set. The cars replaced the remaining [[R17 (New York City Subway car)|R17s]], [[R21 (New York City Subway car)|R21s]], and [[R22 (New York City Subway car)|R22s]], which were all retired by early 1988.<ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1988\"/><ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1998\"/><ref name=\"Feinman 2004\"/>\n\nThe R62As were a follow-up order to the R62 order from 1981, and the second order of stainless steel cars for the \"A\" Division. The contract had been given to Bombardier due to Kawasaki's refusal to build the additional cars under a separate order. The first R62As entered service on May 29, 1985, and all were delivered by 1988. The R62As are scheduled to remain in service until 2026-2028, when they will be replaced with the [[R262 (New York City Subway car)|R262s]].\n\n==Description==\nThe R62As are numbered 1651-2475. The cars were originally single cars with functioning half-width cabs at both ends, but all cars running on the '''{{NYCS|1}}''' (based at [[240th Street Yard]] in [[the Bronx]]) and the '''{{NYCS|6}}''' (based at the [[Westchester Yard]] in the Bronx) are now linked as 5-car sets. These sets have full-width cabs at each end, but retain intermediate half-width cabs in the remaining cab positions. 21 cars in the 1900 series are stored at the [[Livonia Yard]] in Brooklyn and usually run on the [[42nd Street Shuttle]], which uses single cars linked as three and four-car sets.<ref>[http://s1053.photobucket.com/user/TomraTx2/media/R62Ayardroster_zpsca97c2c3.png.html]</ref>\n\nMost cars on the '''6''' feature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights on the sides of the cars around the [[rollsign]] where the service logo is indicated to help riders distinguish between an express train (red diamond) and a local train (green circle). These indicators were first introduced on the '''{{NYCS|7}}''' when the passengers claimed they could not hear clearly the announcements regarding whether the '''7''' was express or local, even though the '''7 Express''' sign was used on the front and sides prior to its implementation in 2008.<ref>http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?62174</ref> Cars 1736-1740 and 2151 were used as test cars as early as April 12, 2007, and had red LED lettering displaying \"LCL\" and \"EXP\" on the front and the side; similar labeling was last seen on the Redbird fleet.<ref>http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?76703</ref><ref>http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/show?74975</ref> When the [[R188 (New York City Subway car)|R188s]] displaced the R62As from the '''7''' to the '''6''' during the 2010s, the LED lights remained in use since both the '''6''' and the '''7''' local services have express variants that run in the peak direction during rush hours.\n\nLike the [[R62 (New York City Subway car)|R62]] order from [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]], the R62A was made of [[stainless steel]] and had [[air conditioning]]. A [[graffiti]]-resistant glaze was applied to all of the cars because of the extensive [[History of the New York City Subway#Graffiti|graffiti tagging]] of nearly all of the subway cars in the system since 1971. They continued a controversial interior design by employing [[bucket seat]]ing, which was very narrow with each seat being about {{convert|17|in}} wide. This reduced the number of seats per car when compared to standard bench seating, but allowed for higher standing capacity.\n\n==History==\nFollowing the successful delivery of the 325-car R62 order, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (NYCTA) put out a bid for an additional 825 cars. Kawasaki did not want to build the additional cars under a separate contract, so the R62A contract was awarded to [[Bombardier Transportation]] of Quebec, who won the bid over [[Budd Company]] of Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1988\">{{cite web | title=www.nycsubway.org: R-62 (Kawasaki) -- R-62A (Bombardier) | website=www.nycsubway.org | date=1988 | url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/R-62_(Kawasaki)_--_R-62A_(Bombardier) | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1998\">{{cite web | title=www.nycsubway.org: Chapter 11, Another Renewal for the IRT | website=www.nycsubway.org | date=April 10, 1998 | url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Another_Renewal_for_the_IRT | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Feinman 2004\">{{cite web | last=Feinman | first=Mark S. | title=www.nycsubway.org: The New York Transit Authority in the 1980s | website=www.nycsubway.org | date=December 8, 2004 | url=http://www.nycsubway.org/wiki/The_New_York_Transit_Authority_in_the_1980s#New_Subway_Cars_for_New_York | accessdate=November 14, 2015}}</ref> While Bombardier offered a higher price per car than Budd had, the NYCTA awarded the contract to Bombardier because of the [[Canadian government]]'s financial plan for the cars. In addition, Budd proposed using unapproved and untested motors, and similarly untested technology that frequently broke down on the [[R44 (New York City Subway car)|R44]] and [[R46 (New York City Subway car)|R46]] contracts.<ref name=\"www.nycsubway.org 1988\"/>\n\nThe 825 cars were built between 1984 and 1987 and entered service between 1985 and 1988, though in August 1985, several cars were frequently taken out of service due to coupler and electrical problems, which almost forced the cancellation of the entire order itself.<ref name=\"Feinman 2004\"/> The first ten R62As, numbered 1651-1660, had their body shells built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and were shipped to Bombardier for their use as samples during their production. They were placed in service on the '''{{NYCS|1}}''' train on May 29, 1985, after arrangements were made to expand the Car Appearance Program to the route (following successful implementation of the same on the '''4''' train with the R62s).\n\n===Post-delivery===\nCar 1687 was badly damaged at the Bombardier plant in the summer of 1985, prior to its delivery.

In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco's first superintendent of schools, had broached the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to convince the Board of Education that a high school was necessary, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856 to establish the San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools; opponents in the City saw no need for an education beyond the eighth grade funded on public budgets. A simple name change from the proposed San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary to the Union Grammar School appeased those who had opposed the creation of the school. Thus was San Francisco's first public school that provided a secondary education established.\n\nThe Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856 in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. By 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-storied school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastic exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as the San Francisco High School because by that time, it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.\n\nIn May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys' High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton Streets (Girls' High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1894, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet [[James Russell Lowell]], chiefly by Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board and ardent admirer of James Russell Lowell. The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years and established its position as the city's [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory high school]]. In 1952, the school sought a new location near [[Lake Merced]] and moved there (its present address) in 1962.<ref name=\"alumni\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, Lowell has had unique and close relationships with the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. When the University of California first opened its first campus in Oakland in September 1896, Lowell (Boys' High School) began to evolve its curriculum to prepare students for the college. From its inception, the University was to have a special relationship with its unique secondary school feeder in San Francisco. Boys' High School quickly became seen as a stepping-stone to college. Of the University of California's first six graduating classes (1873-1878), over a third had attended Boys' High School. William T. Reid, the high school's fourth principal, later became the president of the University of California. Part of Lowell folklore is that Stanford took its colors and the Cardinal name from Lowell.\n\n=== ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1980s) ===\nIn 1983, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD) attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.\n\nBecause of the Consent Decree, SFUSD strived to create a more equal distribution of race at Lowell, which was predominantly [[Chinese American]], particularly trying to introduce more African American and Hispanic students into the school's population. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points, whereas Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 July 1995 |title=COLUMN ONE : Caught on the Wrong Side of the Line? : Chinese Americans must outscore all other groups to enter elite Lowell High in San Francisco, sparking an ugly battle over diversity and the image of a 'model minority.' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/mn-23543_1_chinese-americans/2 |work=Los Angeles times |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1990s) ===\n{{Main|Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District}}\n\nIn 1994, a group of Chinese-American community activists organized a lawsuit to challenge the 1983 Consent Decree race-based admissions policies used by SFUSD for its public schools. The lawsuit was led by Lowell alum, Lee Cheng.<ref>{{cite news |last=Har |first=Janie |agency=Associated Press |date=27 August 2018 |title=Race-based school criteria roils Asian-Americans - again |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/higher-education/race-based-school-criteria-roils-asian-americans---again/2018/08/27/39265076-a9af-11e8-9a7d-cd30504ff902_story.html?noredirect=on |work=Washington Post |location= |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, both parties agreed to a settlement which modified the 1983 Consent Decree to create a new \"diversity index\" system which substituted race as a factor for admissions with a variety of factors such as socioeconomic background, mother's educational level, academic achievement, language spoken at home, and English Learner Status.\n\n=== Expiration of the Consent Decree ===\nCritics of the diversity index created by ''Ho v. San Francisco Unified School District'' point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005 after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed \"since the settlement of the ''Ho'' litigation [resulting in the institution of the \"diversity index\"], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools\" by making schools more racially segregated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf |title=110805order.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |author=The United States District Court of the Northern District of California |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712183508/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg|thumbnail|Lowell High School's Main Entrance.]]\nLowell is located north of [[Lake Merced]], south of [[San Francisco]]'s Parkside District.

Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce \"incomplete\" schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).<ref name=\"SFChroniclearenascheduling\">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/04/BAGVIHIKD71.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea Class scheduling methods put Lowell High in a tizzy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref><ref name=\"keeparenascheduling\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ Self-scheduling is fundamental to Lowell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020935/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nProponents of arena argued that the system distinguishes Lowell and gives students additional responsibility and flexibility with shaping their high school careers. Doing so, students can prepare for a similar selecting of courses in college. Students would be able to choose teachers whom they found to be compatible with their learning style. The rotating priority system of picking teachers and times would assure the fairest results for the greatest number of people.\n\nAfter a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with modifications to address concerns about inequities and class imbalance, including the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and \"mini arena,\" which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.\n\nUnder pressure from faculty and students, in 2013 the Lowell administration decided on an \"online arena\"\u2014very different from the previous arena.<ref name=\"onlinearena\">[http://thelowell.org/2013/05/29/shift-to-online-self-scheduling-a-success Shift to online self-scheduling a success.] From ''The Lowell''.</ref> In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes. The preliminary trials were a success as students were able to submit their schedules into a database by means of a computerized system, saving the faculty from having to input the information themselves.

In 2004, the team won its first AAA Championship since 1952. Following a runner-up finish in 2005, the 2006 squad went undefeated in league play and finished with a 30\u20133 record and a city championship.  The 2007 squad also won the championships, while the 2008 squad finished high in the playoffs. The 2009 team once again won the 2009 AAA championships over Lincoln. The basketball team engages in an annual rivalry with [[George Washington High School (San Francisco)|Washington High School]] in a game commonly known to those in the city as the \"Battle of the Birds\" game.  This is based on the fact that Lowell's mascot is the cardinal and Washington High School's mascot is the eagle.\n\nLowell's Varsity Baseball team, led by coach John Donohue, won eight of ten championships from 1994 to 2004<ref name=\"baseballchampions\">[http://www.cifsf.org/Sports/baseballchampions.pdf AAA Baseball Annual Champions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510151753/http://cifsf.org/Sports/baseballchampions.pdf |date=2006-05-10 }}</ref> while posting a regular season record of 185 wins and only 11 losses<ref name=\"baseballrecord\">[http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/26/SPGMIIFBBF1.DTL 3 teams have caught Lowell in race for baseball supremacy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref> during that span.

The close rivalry between the Cardinals' and the Washington Eagles ended with Lowell coming out on top of all the other SFUSD high schools participating, which included [[Balboa High School (San Francisco)|Balboa High]], [[Abraham Lincoln High School (San Francisco)|Lincoln High]], and Wallenberg High School.\nIn April 2008, Lowell's varsity swim team won their 12th consecutive AAA Championship title, with an undefeated season yet again.

In 2012, they ended their season without being scored on in league games, a record of 101\u20130.  Their most recent defeat was two seasons ago, a forfeit to Balboa on April 6, 2010. Aside from forfeits, the girls have remained undefeated for the past 10 years in league play. There is no JV team.\n\nLowell's JV Girls' Gymnastics team placed first in the NCVAL JV Gymnastics Finals from 2007 to 2010.  At the CCS Varsity Finals, Lowell's Varsity Girls' Gymnastics team placed third in 2009 and second in 2010.  Lowell does not have a boys' gymnastics team.\n\nThe Lowell Varsity Cheer Squad placed 1st in stunts and received a runner up medal in dance in the 2009 AAA competition. They also went to USA Nationals (2010) and placed in the top half of their division (4 points away from 1st place). In 2015 Lowell Cheer attended USA Nationals and won 4th place in the Super Novice Show Cheer Division.

In 1853, Colonel Thomas J. Nevins, San Francisco's first superintendent of schools, had broached the idea of a free high school for boys and a seminary for girls. It took three years for Nevins to convince the Board of Education that a high school was necessary, and a resolution was passed on July 10, 1856 to establish the San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary. Six days later, however, the resolution was rescinded on the grounds that a high school could not legally be part of the San Francisco Common Schools; opponents in the City saw no need for an education beyond the eighth grade funded on public budgets. A simple name change from the proposed San Francisco High School and Ladies' Seminary to the Union Grammar School appeased those who had opposed the creation of the school. Thus was San Francisco's first public school that provided a secondary education established.\n\nThe Union Grammar School first opened on August 25, 1856 in rented quarters at the Wesleyan Methodist Church on Powell Street, between Clay and Sacramento. By 1860, the church was purchased and reconstructed as a school at the same location. The new two-storied school building had four classrooms, an assembly room, and two rooms for gymnastic exercises and calisthenics. Dedication ceremonies for the new structure took place on September 19, 1860. The school in the new building was already referred to as the San Francisco High School because by that time, it was generally recognized that the course of study was on the secondary level.\n\nIn May 1864, the Board of Education decided to form separate schools for boys and girls. Boys remained at the same campus at the Boys' High School, while girls were moved to their own school at Bush and Stockton Streets (Girls' High School), where they would remain until the return of coeducation (in practice) in the 1880s.\n\nIn 1894, the school was renamed to honor the distinguished poet [[James Russell Lowell]], chiefly by Pelham W. Ames, a member of the school board and ardent admirer of James Russell Lowell. The school relocated in January 1913 to an entire block on Hayes Street between Ashbury and Masonic. Lowell remained there for 50 years and established its position as the city's [[University-preparatory school|college preparatory high school]]. In 1952, the school sought a new location near [[Lake Merced]] and moved there (its present address) in 1962.<ref name=\"alumni\"/>\n\nThroughout its history, Lowell has had unique and close relationships with the [[University of California]] and [[Stanford University]]. When the University of California first opened its first campus in Oakland in September 1896, Lowell (Boys' High School) began to evolve its curriculum to prepare students for the college. From its inception, the University was to have a special relationship with its unique secondary school feeder in San Francisco. Boys' High School quickly became seen as a stepping-stone to college. Of the University of California's first six graduating classes (1873-1878), over a third had attended Boys' High School. William T. Reid, the high school's fourth principal, later became the president of the University of California. Part of Lowell folklore is that Stanford took its colors and the Cardinal name from Lowell.\n\n=== ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' (1980s) ===\nIn 1983, the [[San Francisco Unified School District]] (SFUSD) attempted to ensure racial desegregation at Lowell and other schools by implementing a race-based admissions policy as a result of ''San Francisco NAACP v. San Francisco Unified School District'' and the 1983 Consent Decree settlement.\n\nBecause of the Consent Decree, SFUSD strived to create a more equal distribution of race at Lowell, which was predominantly [[Chinese American]], particularly trying to introduce more African American and Hispanic students into the school's population. As a result of this policy, effective in 1985, Chinese-American freshman applicants needed to score 62 out of a possible total of 69 eligibility points, whereas Caucasian and other East Asian candidates needed only 58 points.<ref>{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 July 1995 |title=COLUMN ONE : Caught on the Wrong Side of the Line? : Chinese Americans must outscore all other groups to enter elite Lowell High in San Francisco, sparking an ugly battle over diversity and the image of a 'model minority.' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-13/news/mn-23543_1_chinese-americans/2 |work=Los Angeles times |access-date=8 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== ''Ho v.

San Francisco Unified School District'' point out that many schools, including Lowell, have become even less racially diverse since it was enacted.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied a request to extend the Consent Decree, which was set to expire on December 31, 2005 after it had been extended once before to December 31, 2002. The ruling claimed \"since the settlement of the ''Ho'' litigation [resulting in the institution of the \"diversity index\"], the consent decree has proven to be ineffective, if not counterproductive, in achieving diversity in San Francisco public schools\" by making schools more racially segregated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf |title=110805order.pdf |accessdate=December 30, 2007 |author=The United States District Court of the Northern District of California |format=PDF |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712183508/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/courses/edlaw/110805order.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = July 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:LowellHighSchoolMainEntranceFromEuclyptausStreet.jpg|thumbnail|Lowell High School's Main Entrance.]]\nLowell is located north of [[Lake Merced]], south of [[San Francisco]]'s Parkside District.

Five of six department chairs and dozens of teachers at Lowell filed a union grievance demanding an end to class imbalances. Citing these imbalances, they called to eliminate arena scheduling and to replace it with computerized scheduling used in all other SFUSD schools. Critics characterized arena scheduling as an antiquated and inefficient system, one which promotes inequities and abuses, and creates weeks of unnecessary work for teachers and counselors (the system tends to produce \"incomplete\" schedules which must be dealt with after the scheduling period).<ref name=\"SFChroniclearenascheduling\">[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/03/04/BAGVIHIKD71.DTL&feed=rss.bayarea Class scheduling methods put Lowell High in a tizzy.] From the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.</ref><ref name=\"keeparenascheduling\">[http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ Self-scheduling is fundamental to Lowell.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020935/http://www.thelowell.org/content/view/1562/29/ |date=2007-09-27 }} From ''The Lowell''.</ref>\n\nProponents of arena argued that the system distinguishes Lowell and gives students additional responsibility and flexibility with shaping their high school careers. Doing so, students can prepare for a similar selecting of courses in college. Students would be able to choose teachers whom they found to be compatible with their learning style. The rotating priority system of picking teachers and times would assure the fairest results for the greatest number of people.\n\nAfter a student forum, committee meetings, several student petitions, and final deliberation by then-principal Paul Cheng and the administration, it was decided that arena would remain in place, with modifications to address concerns about inequities and class imbalance, including the abolishment of early scheduling for Shield and Scroll and \"mini arena,\" which allowed people with incomplete schedules another chance to complete them by opening up all the classes again with a few slots.\n\nUnder pressure from faculty and students, in 2013 the Lowell administration decided on an \"online arena\"\u2014very different from the previous arena.<ref name=\"onlinearena\">[http://thelowell.org/2013/05/29/shift-to-online-self-scheduling-a-success Shift to online self-scheduling a success.] From ''The Lowell''.</ref> In 2012, the Lowell administration began preliminary testing by requiring students to submit their proposed classes for the next school year through an online form, designed and maintained by a few students from the computer programming classes. The preliminary trials were a success as students were able to submit their schedules into a database by means of a computerized system, saving the faculty from having to input the information themselves.

Ralph, whose own late son was coached by Terry, is enraged, and has him publicly arrested at a little league game. Terry insists on his innocence, and his wife, Glory, promptly calls their family lawyer, Howard Salomon.  Alec Pelley, a [[private investigator]] hired by Salomon, tracks down evidence that Terry was at an out-of-town conference at the time of the murder, including [[television news|news footage]] of Terry speaking at the conference.  Both sides are left with extremely decisive but contradictory evidence. Salomon is certain Terry will be vindicated, but Terry is left in jail waiting for his arraignment.  Meanwhile, the Peterson family disintegrates, with Frank's mother suffering an [[emotional breakdown]] that escalates into a [[heart attack]].

Fred Peterson, the sole surviving member of the family, attempts suicide by hanging, but he is only left [[coma]]tose. Ralph is put on leave, and hot-headed detective Jack Hoskins is called to substitute.  The case continues to gnaw at Ralph, who investigates the van used by the killer and identifies that it was in the same location as the Maitlands during a family trip to [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], earlier that year.  While questioning a reluctant Glory about that trip, Ralph learns from her older daughter that Terry received a small cut on his wrist, supposedly from a male nurse at his father's nursing home.

The doppelganger who committed the murder scratches a stranger before assuming their form and repeating the pattern in this new target's city.  Terry is the latest target, with the nurse in Dayton Heath Hofstadter and a woman named Maria Caneles in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]] preceding him.  A woman in Harlem explains her belief to Holly that the perpetrator is a [[boogeyman]] who feeds on the suffering of its victims and their families.  An increasingly erratic Jack leaves furniture and a dead animal in the woods for the entity who control and communicates with him.

In Dayton, Holly theorizes about the shape-shifting creature killing children. She visits the cemeteries of both Heath Hofstadter and his alleged victims, finding dilapidated buildings nearby and photographing them. She believes that the creature would live in these buildings to feed on the suffering of those visiting the graves.  She also meets a man associated with Heath, who later commits [[suicide-by-cop]] and is shown to have the same sores on his neck as Jack.  Holly suggests Ralph take photographs around Terry's grave, and Ralph's partner Yunis Sablo notices that the barn where the clothes were found is right by the cemetery.  Holly opts to drive back to Cherokee City to debrief Ralph, Howie and Alec.  The night before, she invites Andy Katcavage, a Dayton security officer (and former police detective) with whom she's had a courtship, up to her hotel room.  Holly leaves the next morning, but her car breaks down on the way out of Dayton.  Andy finds her notes on the investigation and researches them.

Jeannie invites Holly to stay with her and Ralph at their house, where Jeannie increasingly believes in the entity due to the matching descriptions and Holly's theories. Ralph is still skeptical until Holly uses a blue light against the chair where the entity was sitting in Jeannie's dream and finds the same residue found in the barn, as well as fingerprints. Holly now believes the entity is \"shedding\" as it transforms into its next human form. She theorizes it must use a host while it is vulnerable to do its bidding. Jack invites Holly to visit the barn where Terry's clothes were found, but while driving, she notices the rash on the back of his neck. Realizing her imminent danger, she tries to return to town, but Jack tells her to continue driving.\n |LineColor = 575755\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = In the Pines, In the Pines\n |DirectedBy = [[Daina Reid]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Dennis Lehane]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|16}}\n |Viewers = 1.077<ref name=\"1.07\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-16-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.16.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 19, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=February 19, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Ralph and Alec become suspicious about the simultaneous disappearances of Holly and Jack. They search Jack's apartment and find his blood everywhere, eventually tracking Holly and Jack's phones to the same location. Holly, meanwhile, manages to trick and abandon Jack at a gas station and drive away. Jack considers suicide, but he cannot go through with it. Glory, after experiencing more difficulties in her first day back at work, finally decides to file a civil lawsuit against everyone that her attorney Howard suggests. Claude, feeling discomfort in a way he cannot explain, quits his job. When Holly reunites with the others (including Andy, who arrives in Georgia), Yunis shares Claude's situation with her, and Holly angrily confronts Ralph about not revealing it to her earlier.

Ralph, Yunis, and Andy agree to join her. To evade the police, Jack murders a local fisherman (who the entity, currently transforming into Claude, then consumes) and steals his car. Soon after Claude arrives in Tennessee, he is taken into custody by local police who have coordinated with the investigators to protect him. Claude, Seale, and the investigators converge on the Bolton house so they can keep track of Claude. Concurrently, the mid-transformation entity travels to a local cave festival and attempts to lure a young boy so it can eat him. Other festivalgoers manage to stop the entity, however, with the boy's grandfather getting in a scuffle with it before it flees. Meanwhile, Alec and Howard arrive to assist with the investigation. The next morning, local police arrive at the house looking for Claude. They meet with Ralph and Holly, showing them recorded footage of the festival scuffle, which reveals the entity to have a deformed version of Claude's face.

The investigators manage to arrange interviews with the boy who had been lured by the entity and with the boy's grandfather. The boy explains the entity's description of a potential bear cave, while the grandfather describes being unsettled by the entity's face seeming mask-like. A parallel story during the episode, about a father searching for his two boys, is revealed to occur over 70 years earlier, in 1947, when the bear cave collapsed. The [[wikt:search party|search party]], which included some of the Claude and Seale Bolton's ancestors, starved to death after being trapped inside the cave.

Hayes learns of another young boy who has been killed in a manner similar to Frankie. Ralph, Holly, Yunis, Alec, and Andy travel to the cave. Seale recklessly reveals the plan to Claude, immediately alerting the entity to the situation; the entity forces Jack into action.

Howard tries to rescue Andy, but Jack ignites the gasoline, killing both Andy and Howard. When the entity commands Jack to kill Holly, Jack refuses. He approaches the others, begs them to kill the entity, then commits suicide. Ralph and Holly enter the cave and find the entity, who expresses disbelief that Holly discovered the truth about it. It offers few details when Holly inquires about its history and nature. Claude enters and shoots the entity, causing the cave to collapse; the entity is impaled by falling debris.

Local detective Ralph Anderson quickly identifies strong evidence pointing to [[little league]] coach Terry Maitland, including testimony from multiple witnesses and [[security camera]] footage. Ralph, whose own late son was coached by Terry, is enraged, and has him publicly arrested at a little league game. Terry insists on his innocence, and his wife, Glory, promptly calls their family lawyer, Howard Salomon.  Alec Pelley, a [[private investigator]] hired by Salomon, tracks down evidence that Terry was at an out-of-town conference at the time of the murder, including [[television news|news footage]] of Terry speaking at the conference.  Both sides are left with extremely decisive but contradictory evidence. Salomon is certain Terry will be vindicated, but Terry is left in jail waiting for his arraignment.  Meanwhile, the Peterson family disintegrates, with Frank's mother suffering an [[emotional breakdown]] that escalates into a [[heart attack]].

The case continues to gnaw at Ralph, who investigates the van used by the killer and identifies that it was in the same location as the Maitlands during a family trip to [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]], earlier that year.  While questioning a reluctant Glory about that trip, Ralph learns from her older daughter that Terry received a small cut on his wrist, supposedly from a male nurse at his father's nursing home.

Terry is the latest target, with the nurse in Dayton Heath Hofstadter and a woman named Maria Caneles in [[Harlem]], [[New York City]] preceding him.  A woman in Harlem explains her belief to Holly that the perpetrator is a [[boogeyman]] who feeds on the suffering of its victims and their families.

She visits the cemeteries of both Heath Hofstadter and his alleged victims, finding dilapidated buildings nearby and photographing them.

Jeannie invites Holly to stay with her and Ralph at their house, where Jeannie increasingly believes in the entity due to the matching descriptions and Holly's theories. Ralph is still skeptical until Holly uses a blue light against the chair where the entity was sitting in Jeannie's dream and finds the same residue found in the barn, as well as fingerprints. Holly now believes the entity is \"shedding\" as it transforms into its next human form. She theorizes it must use a host while it is vulnerable to do its bidding.

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]] and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli].
