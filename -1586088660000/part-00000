Brown advocated the use of armed insurrection to overthrow the institution of [[slavery in the United States]]. He first gained national attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis of 1856. He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement: \"These men are all talk. What we need is action\u2014action!\" In May 1856, Brown and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the [[Pottawatomie massacre]], which responded to the [[sacking of Lawrence]] by pro-slavery forces. Brown then commanded anti-slavery forces at the [[Battle of Black Jack]] (June 2) and the [[Battle of Osawatomie]] (August 30, 1856).\n\nIn October 1859, Brown [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|led a raid]] on the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|federal armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]] (today West Virginia), intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina; there was a [[Provisional Constitution (John Brown)|Provisional Constitution]] for the state he hoped to establish. He seized the armory, but seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. He intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory, but only a small number of local slaves joined his revolt. Within 36 hours, those of Brown's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and [[U.S. Marines]], the latter led by [[Robert E. Lee]]. He was hastily tried for [[treason]] against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men (including three blacks), and inciting a slave insurrection; he was found guilty on all counts and was hanged. He was the first person convicted of treason in the history of the country.<ref name=Lies/>{{rp|179}}\n\nHistorians agree that the Harpers Ferry raid and Brown's trial, both covered extensively by the national press, escalated tensions that led to [[Secession in the United States#Confederate States of America|the South's secession]] a year later and the [[American Civil War]]. Brown's raid captured the nation's attention; Southerners feared that it was just the first of many Northern plots to cause a slave rebellion that might endanger their lives, while [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] dismissed the notion and claimed that they would not interfere with slavery in the South. \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" was a popular [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] marching song that portrayed him as a heroic martyr.\n\nBrown's actions as an abolitionist and the tactics he used still make him a controversial figure today. He is both memorialized as a heroic martyr and visionary, and vilified as a madman and a terrorist.<ref name=CHOWDER>Ken Chowder. \"[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/father-american-terrorism?page=show The Father of American Terrorism]\".

John Brown (1728\u20131776).<ref name=\"grandfather\">There has been speculation that the grandfather was the same John Brown who was a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]] and spent time in jail with the notorious [[Claudius Smith]], allegedly for stealing cattle, which he and Smith used to feed starving British troops. But this runs against the grain of the Brown family history as well as the record of the Humphrey family, to which the Browns were directly related (abolitionist John Brown's maternal grandmother was a Humphrey). Brown himself wrote in his 1857 autobiographical letter that both his and his first wife's grandfathers were soldiers in the [[Continental Army]] [which he established in his ''The Humphreys Family in America'' (1883)], which notes that abolitionist John Brown's grandfather, Capt. John Brown (born November 4, 1728), was a militia captain who died early in the American Revolution. His son Owen Brown, the father of abolitionist John Brown, was a tanner and strict evangelical who hated slavery and taught his trade to his son.</ref> Brown could trace his ancestry back to 17th-century English [[Puritans]].<ref>{{cite article\n|first=Franklin\n|last=Sanborn\n|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/1872apr/sanborn.htm\n|title=John Brown in Massachusetts\n|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]\n|date=April 1872}}</ref>\n\nIn 1805, the family moved to [[Hudson, Ohio]], where Owen Brown opened a tannery; there is a historical marker at the site of their house. Hudson was a center of anti-slavery activity and debate, and Owen participated fully, offering a [[safe house]] to [[Underground Railroad]] [[fugitive slaves|fugitives]]. There not being a high school in Hudson at that time, John studied at the school of the abolitionist Elizur Wright, father of the famous [[Elizur Wright]], in nearby [[Tallmadge, Ohio|Tallmadge]].\n\nOwen was one of the founders of Hudson's school, the [[Western Reserve College and Preparatory School]], which would soon (1832\u201333) become consumed with and torn apart by the issue of slavery (see [[Beriah Green]] and [[Lane Rebels]]). Owen also became a supporter of the [[Oberlin College|Oberlin Institute]] in its early stage, but was ultimately critical of the school's \"[[Christian perfection|Perfectionist]]\" leanings, especially renowned in the preaching and teaching of [[Charles Finney]] and [[Asa Mahan]]. Brown withdrew his membership from the Congregational church in the 1840s and never officially joined another church, but both he and his father were fairly conventional evangelicals for the period with its focus on the pursuit of personal righteousness. Brown's personal religion is fairly well documented in the papers of the Reverend Clarence Gee, a Brown family expert, now held in the Hudson [Ohio] Library and Historical Society.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nBrown's father had as an apprentice Jesse R.

Their first child, [[John Brown Junior|John Jr]], was born 13 months later. In 1825, seeking a safer location (for fugitive slaves), Brown and his family moved to [[Richmond Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania|New Richmond, Pennsylvania]], where he bought {{convert|200|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of land.

During this period, Brown operated an interstate business involving cattle and leather production along with a kinsman, Seth Thompson, from eastern Ohio.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1829, some white families asked Brown to help them drive off Native Americans who hunted annually in the area.

Brown fell ill, and his businesses began to suffer, leaving him in terrible debt. In the summer of 1832, shortly after the death of a newborn son, his wife Dianthe died, leaving him with the children John Jr., Jason, [[Owen Brown (abolitionist, born 1824)|Owen]], and Ruth. (Another three of their children did not survive to adulthood.)

Following the heavy borrowing trends of Ohio, many businessmen like Brown trusted too heavily in credit and state bonds and paid dearly for it. In one episode of property loss, Brown was jailed when he attempted to retain ownership of a farm by occupying it against the claims of the new owner. Like other determined men of his time and background, he tried many different business efforts in an attempt to get out of debt. Along with tanning hides and cattle trading, he also undertook horse and sheep breeding, the last of which was to become a notable aspect of his pre-public vocation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1837, in response to the murder of [[Elijah P.

In 1843, four of his children died of [[dysentery]]. As Louis DeCaro Jr shows in his biographical sketch (2007), from the mid-1840s Brown had built a reputation as an expert in fine sheep and wool, and entered into a partnership with Col. Simon Perkins of [[Akron, Ohio]], whose flocks and farms were managed by Brown and sons. Brown eventually moved into a home with his family across the street from the [[Perkins Stone Mansion]] on Perkins Hill.

From 1846 until he left Springfield in 1850, Brown was a parishioner at the Free Church, where he witnessed abolitionist lectures by the likes of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Sojourner Truth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourpluralhistory.stcc.edu/resistingslavery/stjohns.html|title=Resisting Slavery: St. John's Congregational Church|publisher=Springfield, MA \u2013 Our Plural History|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> In 1847, after speaking at the Free Church, Douglass spent a night speaking with Brown, after which he wrote, \"From this night spent with John Brown in Springfield, Mass. 1847 while I continued to write and speak against slavery, I became all the same less hopeful for its peaceful abolition.

The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool ''en masse'' at low prices. Initially, Brown naively trusted them, but he soon realized they were determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the [[Connecticut River Valley]]'s sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the ''Ohio Cultivator'', Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools ''en masse'' at the cheap prices they had been getting. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Slave kidnap post 1851 boston.jpg|thumb|left|An 1851 poster warning the \"colored people of Boston\" about policemen acting as slave catchers]]\n\nBefore Brown left Springfield in 1850, the United States passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], a law mandating that authorities in free states aid in the return of escaped slaves and imposing penalties on those who aided in their escape. In response Brown founded a militant group to prevent slaves' capture, the League of Gileadites. In the Bible, [[Gilead|Mount Gilead]] was the place where only the bravest of [[Israelites]] gathered to face an invading enemy. Brown founded the League with the words, \"Nothing so charmes the American people as personal bravery.

In actuality, Perkins absorbed much of the financial loss, and their partnership continued for several more years, with Brown nearly breaking even by 1854.

Determined to protect his family and oppose the advances of slavery supporters, Brown left for Kansas, enlisting a son-in-law and making several stops just to collect funds and weapons. As reported by the New York ''Tribune'', Brown stopped en route to participate in an anti-slavery convention that took place in June 1855 in [[Albany, New York]]. Despite the controversy that ensued on the convention floor regarding the support of violent efforts on behalf of the free state cause, several people gave Brown financial support. As he went westward, Brown found more militant support in his home state of Ohio, particularly in the strongly anti-slavery [[Western Reserve]] section where he had been reared.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Pottawatomie===\n{{Main|Pottawatomie massacre|Bleeding Kansas}}\n[[File:John Brown by Southworth & Hawes, 1856.png|thumb|upright|<center>John Brown, 1856</center>]]\n\nBrown and the free settlers were optimistic that they could bring Kansas into the union as a slavery-free state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rhodes|first=James Fork|title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofuniteds06rhodrich|year=1892|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=Original from Harvard University|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofuniteds06rhodrich/page/385 385]}}</ref> After the winter snows thawed in 1856, the pro-slavery activists began a campaign to seize Kansas on their own terms. Brown was particularly affected by the [[sacking of Lawrence]] in May 1856, in which a [[sheriff]]-led posse destroyed newspaper offices and  [[The Eldridge Hotel|a hotel]]. Only one man, a Border Ruffian, was killed. [[Preston Brooks]]'s [[Caning of Charles Sumner|caning]] of anti-slavery Senator [[Charles Sumner]] in the [[United States Senate]] also fueled Brown's anger. A pro-slavery writer, [[Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow (1816\u20131891)|Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow]], of the ''Squatter Sovereign'', wrote that \"[pro-slavery forces] are determined to repel this Northern invasion, and make Kansas a Slave State; though our rivers should be covered with the blood of their victims, and the carcasses of the Abolitionists should be so numerous in the territory as to breed disease and sickness, we will not be deterred from our purpose\".<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 162</ref> Brown was outraged by both the violence of the pro-slavery forces and what he saw as a weak and cowardly response by the antislavery partisans and the Free State settlers, whom he described as \"cowards, or worse\".<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 163\u201364</ref>\n\nThe [[Pottawatomie massacre]] occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856. Using swords, Brown and a band of abolitionist settlers took from their residences and killed five \"professional slave hunters and militant pro-slavery\"<ref>{{cite web\n|title=A Libertarian Defense of John Brown\n|date=February 18, 2014\n|last=Huyett\n|first=Ian\n|magazine=The Libertarian Republic\n|url=https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/defense-john-brown/\n|accessdate=February 10, 2019}}</ref> settlers north of [[Pottawatomie Creek]] in [[Franklin County, Kansas]].\n\nSpeaking of the threats that were supposedly the justification for the massacre, Free State leader [[Charles L. Robinson]] stated:\n\n<blockquote>When it is known that such threats were as plenty as blue-berries in June, on both sides, all over the Territory, and were regarded as of no more importance than the idle wind, this indictment will hardly justify midnight assassination of all pro-slavery men, whether making threats or not ... Had all men been killed in Kansas who indulged in such threats, there would have been none left to bury the dead.<ref>Robinson, Charles. ''The Kansas Conflict''. 1892. Reprint. Lawrence, Kans.: Journal Publishing Co., 1898.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the two years prior to the Pottawatomie Creek massacre, there had been eight killings in Kansas Territory attributable to slavery politics, but none in the vicinity of the massacre. The massacre was the match in the powderkeg that precipitated the bloodiest period in \"Bleeding Kansas\" history, a three-month period of retaliatory raids and battles in which 29 people died.<ref>Watts, Dale E.

On June 2, John Brown, nine of his followers, and 20 local men successfully defended a Free State settlement at [[Palmyra Township, Douglas County, Kansas|Palmyra, Kansas]], against an attack by Pate (see [[Battle of Black Jack]]). Pate and 22 of his men were taken prisoner.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 180\u201381, 186</ref> After capture, they were taken to Brown's camp, and received all the food Brown could find. Brown forced Pate to sign a treaty, exchanging the freedom of Pate and his men for the promised release of Brown's two captured sons. Brown released Pate to Colonel [[Edwin Sumner]], but was furious to discover that the release of his sons was delayed until September.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn August, a company of over 300 Missourians under the command of General [[John W. Reid]] crossed into Kansas and headed towards [[Osawatomie, Kansas|Osawatomie]], intending to destroy the Free State settlements there, and then march on [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] and [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]].<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 199</ref>\n\nOn the morning of August 30, 1856, they shot and killed Brown's son Frederick and his neighbor David Garrison on the outskirts of Osawatomie. Brown, outnumbered more than seven to one, arranged his 38 men behind natural defenses along the road. Firing from cover, they managed to kill at least 20 of Reid's men and wounded 40 more.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 200\u201301</ref> Reid regrouped, ordering his men to dismount and charge into the woods. Brown's small group scattered and fled across the [[Marais des Cygnes River]]. One of Brown's men was killed during the retreat and four were captured. While Brown and his surviving men hid in the woods nearby, the Missourians plundered and burned Osawatomie. Despite his defeat, Brown's bravery and military shrewdness in the face of overwhelming odds brought him national attention and made him a hero to many Northern abolitionists.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 201\u201302</ref>\n\nOn September 7, Brown entered Lawrence to meet with Free State leaders and help fortify against a feared assault. At least 2,700 pro-slavery Missourians were once again invading Kansas. On September 14, they skirmished near Lawrence. Brown prepared for battle, but serious violence was averted when the new governor of Kansas, [[John W. Geary]], ordered the warring parties to disarm and disband, and offered clemency to former fighters on both sides.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 203\u201304</ref> Brown, taking advantage of the fragile peace, left Kansas with three of his sons to raise money from supporters in the North.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:John Brown portrait, 1859.jpg|thumb|right|upright|<center>John Brown in 1859</center>]]\n\n===Gathering forces===\nBrown returned to the East by November 1856, and spent the next two years in New England raising funds.

In March, Brown contracted Charles Blair of [[Collinsville, Connecticut]] for 1,000 [[Pike (weapon)|pikes]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn the following months, Brown continued to raise funds, visiting [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and Boston. In Boston, he met [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He received many pledges but little cash. In March, while in New York City, he was introduced to Hugh Forbes, an English mercenary, who had experience as a military tactician fighting with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in Italy in 1848. Brown hired him as his men's drillmaster and to write their tactical handbook. They agreed to meet in Tabor that summer. Using the alias Nelson Hawkins, Brown traveled through the Northeast and then visited his family in [[Hudson, Ohio]]. On August 7, he arrived in Tabor. Forbes arrived two days later. Over several weeks, the two men put together a \"Well-Matured Plan\" for fighting slavery in the South. The men quarreled over many of the details. In November, their troops left for Kansas. Forbes had not received his salary and was still feuding with Brown, so he returned to the East instead of venturing into Kansas. He soon threatened to expose the plot to the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Maxon house springdale iowa.jpg|thumb|left|William Maxon's house, near [[Springdale, Iowa]], where John Brown's associates lived and trained, 1857\u20131859.

Brown himself was taken into the home of John H. Painter, about a half-mile away; and all were welcomed with that unfeigned hospitality for which the Friends have always been known.\"</ref> In January 1858, Brown left his men in [[Springdale, Iowa]], and set off to visit [[Frederick Douglass]] in [[Rochester, New York]].

In letters to them, he indicated that, along with recruits, he would go into the South equipped with weapons to do \"Kansas work\".{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nBrown and 12 of his followers, including his son [[Owen Brown (abolitionist, born 1824)|Owen]], traveled to [[Chatham-Kent, Ontario|Chatham]], Ontario, where he convened on May 10 a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]].<ref>{{cite web|title=John Brown's Convention 1858|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=71386|website=Historical Marker Database|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref> The convention, with several dozen delegates including his friend [[James Madison Bell]], was put together with the help of Dr. [[Martin Delany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/jbexhibit/chathamdelegates.html|title=Chatham Convention Delegates|website=www.wvculture.org|access-date=2016-04-17}}</ref> One-third of Chatham's 6,000 residents were fugitive slaves, and it was here that Brown was introduced to [[Harriet Tubman]]. The convention assembled 34 blacks and 12 whites to adopt Brown's [[Provisional Constitution (John Brown)|Provisional Constitution]]. According to Delany, during the convention, Brown illuminated his plans to make Kansas rather than Canada the end of the [[Underground Railroad]]. This would be the Subterranean Pass Way.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Delany's reflections are not entirely trustworthy. Brown was no longer looking toward Kansas and was entirely focused on Virginia. Other testimony from the Chatham meeting suggests Brown did speak of going south. Brown had long used the terminology of the Subterranean Pass Way from the late 1840s, so it is possible that Delany conflated Brown's statements over the years. Regardless, Brown was elected commander-in-chief and named [[John Henrie Kagi]] his \"Secretary of War\". [[Richard Realf]] was named \"Secretary of State\". Elder Monroe, a black minister, was to act as president until another was chosen. A. M. Chapman was the acting vice president; Delany, the corresponding secretary. In 1859, \"A Declaration of Liberty by the Representatives of the Slave Population of the United States of America\" was written.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAlthough nearly all of the delegates signed the constitution, very few volunteered to join Brown's forces, although it will never be clear how many Canadian expatriates actually intended to join Brown because of a subsequent \"security leak\" that threw off plans for the raid, creating a hiatus in which Brown lost contact with many of the Canadian leaders. This crisis occurred when Hugh Forbes, Brown's mercenary, tried to expose the plans to Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Wilson]] and others. The Secret Six feared their names would be made public. Howe and Higginson wanted no delays in Brown's progress, while Parker, Stearns, Smith and Sanborn insisted on postponement. Stearns and Smith were the major sources of funds, and their words carried more weight. To throw Forbes off the trail and invalidate his assertions, Brown returned to Kansas in June, and remained in that vicinity for six months. There he joined forces with [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]], who was leading raids into Missouri.\n\n[[File:Ole Peter Hansen Balling - John Brown - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Brown by [[Ole Peter Hansen Balling]], 1872]]\n\nOn December 20, Brown led his own raid, in which he liberated 11 slaves, took captive two white men, and looted horses and wagons. (See [[Battle of the Spurs (Kansas)|Battle of the Spurs]].) On January 20, 1859, he embarked on a lengthy journey to take the liberated slaves to Detroit and then on a ferry to Canada. While passing through Chicago, Brown met with abolitionists [[Allan Pinkerton]], John Jones, and [[Henry O. Wagoner]] who arranged and raised the fare for the passage to Detroit<ref>''The History of Johnson County, Iowa'', 1883, pp. 475\u201377</ref> and purchase clothes and supplies for Brown.

On May 9, he delivered a lecture in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], that [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], Emerson, and Thoreau attended. Brown reconnoitered with the Secret Six. In June he paid his last visit to his family in North Elba before departing for Harpers Ferry. He stayed one night en route in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], at the Washington House, on West Washington Street. On June 30, 1859, the hotel had at least 25 guests, including I. Smith and Sons, Oliver Smith and Owen Smith, and Jeremiah Anderson, all from New York. From papers found in the Kennedy Farmhouse after the raid, it is known that Brown wrote to Kagi that he would sign into a hotel as I. Smith and Sons.<ref>[http://www.whilbr.org/JohnBrownWashingtonCounty/index.aspx John Brown in Washington County], whilbr.org; accessed August 29, 2015.</ref>\n\n===Raid===\n{{Main|John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry}}\n[[File:HWFireHouseBrown.jpg|thumb|left|246px|''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' illustration of U.S. Marines attacking John Brown's \"Fort\"]]\nAs he began recruiting supporters for an attack on slaveholders, Brown was joined by [[Harriet Tubman]], \"General Tubman,\" as he called her.<ref name=\"Cli129\">Clinton, p. 129.</ref> Her knowledge of support networks and resources in the border states of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware was invaluable to Brown and his planners. Some abolitionists, including [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]], opposed his tactics, but Brown dreamed of fighting to create a new state for freed slaves and made preparations for military action. After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the South.<ref>Clinton, pp. 126\u201328.</ref>\n\nBrown asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.<ref>Larson, p. 159.</ref> He arrived in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] on July 3, 1859. A few days later, under the name Isaac Smith, he rented a [[Kennedy Farm|farmhouse]] in nearby [[Maryland]]. He awaited the arrival of his recruits. They never materialized in the numbers he expected. In late August he met with Douglass in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], where he revealed the Harpers Ferry plan. Douglass expressed severe reservations, rebuffing Brown's pleas to join the mission. Douglass had known of Brown's plans since early 1859 and had made a number of efforts to discourage blacks from enlisting.\n\nIn late September, the 950 pikes arrived from Charles Blair. Kagi's draft plan called for a brigade of 4,500 men, but Brown had only 21 men (16 white and 5 black: three free blacks, one freed slave, and a fugitive slave). They ranged in age from 21 to 49. Twelve had been with Brown in Kansas raids. On October 16, 1859, Brown (leaving three men behind as a rear guard) led 18 men in an attack on the [[Harpers Ferry Armory]]. He had received 200 [[Beecher's Bibles]]\u2014breechloading .52 (13.2&nbsp;mm) caliber Sharps rifles\u2014and pikes from northern abolitionist societies in preparation for the raid. The armory was a large complex of buildings that contained 100,000 muskets and rifles, which Brown planned to seize and use to arm local slaves. They would then head south, drawing off more and more slaves from plantations, and fighting only in self-defense. As Douglass and Brown's family testified, his strategy was essentially to deplete Virginia of its slaves, causing the institution to collapse in one county after another, until the movement spread into the South, wreaking havoc on the economic viability of the pro-slavery states.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nInitially, the raid went well, and they met no resistance entering the town. They cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended by a single watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including [[Colonel Lewis Washington]], great-grandnephew of [[George Washington]]. They also spread the news to the local slaves that their liberation was at hand.  Two of the hostages' slaves also died in the raid.<ref>[http://www.wvculture.org/History/jnobrown.html John Brown and the Harpers Ferry Raid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111050237/http://www.wvculture.org/History/jnobrown.html |date=January 11, 2008 }}, wvculture.org; accessed August 29, 2015.</ref> \n\nThings started to go wrong when an eastbound [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad|Baltimore & Ohio]] train approached the town. After holding the train, Brown inexplicably allowed it to continue on its way. At the next station, where the telegraph still worked, the passenger train conductor, sent a telegram to Baltimore:\n\n{{quote|''Monocacy, 7.05 A.

In the meantime, local farmers, shopkeepers, and militia pinned down the raiders in the armory by firing from the heights behind the town. Some of the local men were shot by Brown's men. At noon, a company of militia seized the bridge, blocking the only escape route. Brown then moved his prisoners and remaining raiders into the engine house, a small brick building at the armory's entrance. He had the doors and windows barred and loopholes cut through the brick walls. The surrounding forces barraged the engine house, and the men inside fired back with occasional fury. Brown sent his son Watson and another supporter out under a white flag, but the angry crowd shot them. Intermittent shooting then broke out, and Brown's son Oliver was wounded. His son begged his father to kill him and end his suffering, but Brown said \"If you must die, die like a man.\" A few minutes later, Oliver was dead. The exchanges lasted throughout the day.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:John brown interior engine house.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of the interior of the Fort immediately before the door is broken down]]\nBy the morning of October 18 the engine house, later known as [[John Brown's Fort]], was surrounded by a company of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] under the command of First Lieutenant [[Israel Greene]], USMC, with Colonel [[Robert E.

In three minutes Brown and the survivors were captives.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAltogether Brown's men killed four people, and wounded nine. Ten of Brown's men were killed (including his sons Watson and Oliver). Five escaped (including his son Owen), and seven were captured along with Brown.

Mason led the three-hour questioning session of Brown.\n[[File:John Brown - Treason broadside, 1859.png|thumb|right]]\n[[File:The old Court House at Charlestown, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was tried; it stands diagonal across the street from the jail (1906).jpg|thumb|The old Court House at Charles Town, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was tried; it stands diagonally across the street from the jail (ca. 1906)]]\n[[File:Old Jail at Charlestown, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was imprisoned.jpg|thumb|right|The Jefferson County Jail at Charles Town, Virginia, where John Brown was imprisoned during and after his trial, since torn down and now the site of the Charles Town post office]]\nAlthough the attack had taken place on federal property, Wise ordered that Brown and his men be tried in Virginia in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], the nearby seat of Jefferson County just seven miles west of Harpers Ferry (perhaps to avert Northern political pressure on the Federal government, or in the unlikely event of a presidential [[pardon]]). The trial began October 27, after a doctor pronounced the still-wounded Brown fit for trial. Brown was charged with murdering four whites and a black, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] with slaves to rebel, and [[treason]] against Virginia. A series of lawyers were assigned to him, including Lawson Botts, Thomas C. Green, [[Samuel Chilton]], a lawyer from Washington D.C., and [[George Henry Hoyt|George Hoyt]], but it was Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, who concluded the defense on October 31. In his closing statement, Griswold argued that Brown could not be found guilty of treason against a state to which he owed no loyalty and of which he was not a resident, that Brown had not killed anyone himself, and that the raid's failure indicated that Brown had not conspired with slaves. [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]], the local district attorney, presented the closing arguments for the prosecution.\n\nOn November 2, after a week-long trial and 45 minutes of deliberation, the Charles Town jury found Brown guilty on all three counts. He was sentenced to be hanged in public on December 2. In response to the sentence, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] remarked that \"[John Brown] will make the gallows glorious like the Cross.\" Cadets from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] under the leadership of General [[Francis H. Smith]] and Major [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] (who earned the nickname \"Stonewall\" less than two years later) were called into service as a security detail in the event Brown's supporters attempted a rescue.\n\nDuring the month before his execution, Brown was allowed to send and receive correspondence, and he wrote many letters. One of the letters was from Mahala Doyle, wife and mother of three of Brown's Kansas victims. She wrote \"Altho' vengeance is not mine, I confess that I do feel gratified to hear that you were stopped in your fiendish career at Harper's Ferry ...\"  In a postscript she added \"My son John Doyle whose life I beg[g]ed of you is now grown up and is very desirous to be in Charlestown on the day of your execution.\"<ref>Oates (1984) pp. 344\u201345</ref>\n\nBrown refused to be rescued by [[Silas Soule]], a friend from Kansas who somehow infiltrated the Jefferson County Jail one day and offered to break him out during the night and flee northward to New York state and possibly Canada. Brown supposedly told Silas that, aged 59, he was too old to live a life on the run from the federal authorities as a fugitive and that he was ready to die as a [[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]. Silas left him behind to be executed.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Many of Brown's letters exuded spirituality and conviction and, when picked up by the Northern press, won him more supporters in the North while infuriating many white people in the South. On December 1, Brown's wife arrived by train in Charles Town, where she joined him at the county jail for his last meal. She was denied permission to stay the night, prompting Brown to lose his composure and temper for the only time during the ordeal.\n\nThe Governor of Virginia was so concerned about an attempt to rescue Brown that he halted almost all transportation on the [[Winchester and Potomac Railroad]] (from Maryland south through Harpers Ferry to Charles Town) from the day before through the day after the execution (see [[Winchester and Potomac Railroad#John Brown's raid]]).\n\n===Victor Hugo's reaction===\n[[Victor Hugo]], from exile on [[Guernsey]], tried to obtain [[Clemency|pardon]] for John Brown: he sent an [[open letter]] that was published by the press on both sides of the Atlantic. This text, written at Hauteville-House on December 2, 1859, warned of a possible civil war:\n\n{{Wikisource|Victor Hugo's letter to the London News regarding John Brown|Victor Hugo's letter to the London News}}\n\n{{quote|Politically speaking, the murder of John Brown would be an uncorrectable sin. It would create in the Union a latent fissure that would in the long run dislocate it. Brown's agony might perhaps consolidate slavery in Virginia, but it would certainly shake the whole American democracy. You save your shame, but you kill your glory. Morally speaking, it seems a part of the human light would put itself out, that the very notion of justice and injustice would hide itself in darkness, on that day where one would see the assassination of Emancipation by Liberty itself. ...\n\nLet America know and ponder on this: there is something more frightening than Cain killing Abel, and that is Washington killing [[Spartacus]].}}\n\nThe letter was initially published in the ''London News'' and was widely reprinted. After Brown's execution, Hugo wrote a number of additional letters about Brown and the abolitionist cause.<ref>Reynolds, David S.

Vintage, 2009. pp. 408\u201310</ref>\n\nAbolitionists in the United States saw Hugo's writings as evidence of international support for the anti-slavery cause. The most widely publicized commentary on Brown to reach America from Europe was an 1861 pamphlet, ''John Brown par Victor Hugo'', that included a brief biography and reprinted two letters by Hugo, including that of December 9, 1859. The pamphlet's frontispiece was an engraving of a hanged man by Hugo that became widely associated with the execution.<ref>Drescher, Seymour, \"Servile Insurrection and John Brown's Body in Europe\". in Finkelman, Paul, ed.

Since the region was in the grips of virtual hysteria, most Northerners, including journalists, were run out of town, and it is unlikely any anti-slavery clergyman would have been safe, even if one were to have sought to visit Brown. He elected to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold.

The Democrats attempted to implicate the Republicans in the raid; the Republicans tried to disassociate themselves from Brown and his acts.\n\nThe Senate committee heard testimony from 32 witnesses, including Liam Dodson, one of the surviving abolitionists. The report, authored by chairman [[James Murray Mason]], a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, was published in June 1860. It found no direct evidence of a conspiracy, but implied that the raid was a result of Republican doctrines.<ref>{{cite web |title=Senate Select Committee Report on the Harper's Ferry Invasion |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/jbexhibit/masonreport.html |date=June 15, 1860 |website=West Virginia Division of Culture and History |access-date=July 25, 2016}}</ref> The two committee Republicans published a [[Dissenting opinion|minority report]], but were apparently more concerned about denying Northern culpability than clarifying the nature of Brown's efforts. Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] rejected any connection with the raid, calling Brown \"insane\".<ref>David Donald, ''Lincoln'' (1995) p. 239</ref>\n\nThe investigation was performed in a tense environment in both houses of Congress. One senator wrote to his wife that \"The members on both sides are mostly armed with deadly weapons and it is said that the friends of each are armed in the galleries.\" After a heated exchange of insults, a Mississippian attacked [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of Pennsylvania with a [[Bowie knife]] in the House of Representatives. Stevens' friends prevented a fight.<ref>Oates (1984), p. 359</ref>\n\nThe Senate committee was very cautious in its questions of two of Brown's backers, Samuel Howe and George Stearns, out of fear of stoking violence.

In light of the upcoming elections in November 1860, the Republicans tried to distance themselves as much as possible from Brown, condemning the raid and dismissing its leader as an insane fanatic. As one historian explains, Brown was successful in polarizing politics: \"Brown's raid succeeded brilliantly. It drove a wedge through the already tentative and fragile Opposition-Republican coalition and helped to intensify the sectional polarization that soon tore the Democratic party and the Union apart.\"<ref name=\"Crofts\"/>\n\nMany abolitionists in the North viewed Brown as a martyr, sacrificed for the sins of the nation. Immediately after the raid, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] published a column in ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', judging Brown's raid \"well-intended but sadly misguided\" and \"wild and futile\".<ref>[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1859/10/28/the-tragedy-at-harpers-ferry \"The Tragedy at Harper's Ferry\"], fair-use.org; accessed November 12, 2015.</ref> But he defended Brown's character from detractors in the Northern and Southern press and argued that those who supported the principles of the [[American Revolution]] could not consistently oppose Brown's raid.

In the 1880s, Brown's detractors \u2014 some of them{{who|date=October 2019}} contemporaries now embarrassed by their former fervent abolitionism \u2014 began to produce virulent expos\u00e9s, particularly emphasizing the Pottawatomie killings of 1856.

The same cannot be said for the sadistic butchery that was Pottawatomie. It served no useful purpose other than to vent an old man's rage, and Brown is the smaller for it.\"<ref>Brian Harris.

It was never produced.\n\nThe two most noted screen portrayals of Brown were both given by actor [[Raymond Massey]]. The 1940 film ''[[Santa Fe Trail (film)|Santa Fe Trail]]'', starring [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]], depicted Brown completely unsympathetically as an out-and-out villainous madman; Massey added to that impression by playing him with a constant, wild-eyed stare. The film gave the impression that it did not oppose slavery, even to the point of having a Black \"[[Mammy archetype|mammy]]\" character say, after an especially fierce battle, \"Mr. Brown done promised us freedom, but ... if this is freedom, I don't want no part of it\". Massey portrayed Brown again in the little-known, low-budget ''[[Seven Angry Men]]'', in which he was not only the main character, but depicted in a much more restrained, sympathetic way.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Andrew Taylor|author2=Eldrid Herrington|title=The Afterlife of John Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HebFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA22|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=22\u201323|isbn=9781403978462}}</ref> Massey along with [[Tyrone Power]] and [[Judith Anderson]] starred in the acclaimed 1953 dramatic reading of [[Stephen Vincent Benet]]'s epic [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize]]-winning poem ''[[John Brown's Body (poem)|John Brown's Body]]'' (1928).

Brown was born during the period of the [[Haitian Revolution]], which saw Haitian slaves revolting against the French. The role the revolution played in helping to formulate Brown's abolitionist views directly is not clear; however, the revolution had an obvious effect on the general view towards slavery in the northern United States. As W. E. B. Du Bois notes, the involvement of slaves in the American Revolutions, as well as the \"upheaval in Hayti, and the new enthusiasm for human rights, led to a wave of emancipation which started in Vermont ... swept through New England and Pennsylvania, ending finally in New York and New Jersey\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=John Brown|year=1962|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York|pages=80\u201381}}</ref> This changed sentiment, which occurred during the late 18th and early 19th century, undoubtedly had a role in creating Brown's abolitionist opinion, during his upbringing.\n\nThe 1839 slave insurrection aboard the Spanish ship ''[[La Amistad]]'', off the coast of Cuba, provides a poignant example of John Brown's support and appeal towards Caribbean slave revolts. On ''La Amistad'', [[Joseph Cinqu\u00e9]] and approximately 50 other slaves captured the ship, slated to transport them from [[Havana]] to [[Camag\u00fcey|Puerto Pr\u00edncipe]], Cuba in July 1839, and attempted to return to Africa. However, through trickery, the ship ended up in the United States, where Cinque and his men stood trial. Ultimately, the courts acquitted the men because at the time the international slave trade was illegal in the United States.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 54</ref> According to Brown's daughter, \"[[Nat Turner|Turner]] and Cinque stood first in esteem\" among Brown's black heroes. Furthermore, she noted Brown's \"admiration of Cinques' character and management in carrying his points with so little bloodshed!\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Redpath|first=James|title=The Public Life of Captain John Brown|url=https://archive.org/details/publiclifeofcapt00redprich|year=1860|publisher=Thayer and Eldridge|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/publiclifeofcapt00redprich/page/46 46]}}</ref> In 1850, Brown would refer affectionately to the revolt, in saying \"Nothing so charms the American people as personal bravery. Witness the case of Cinques, of everlasting memory, on board the ''Amistad''.\"<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 54\u201355</ref> The slave revolts of the Caribbean had a clear and important impact on Brown's views toward slavery and his staunch support of the most severe forms of abolitionism. However, this is not the most important part of the many revolts' legacy of influencing Brown.\n\nThe specific knowledge John Brown gained from the tactics employed in the Haitian Revolution, and other Caribbean revolts, was of paramount importance when Brown turned his sights to the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. As Brown's cohort [[Richard Realf]] explained to a committee of the 36th Congress, \"he had posted himself in relation to the wars of Toussaint L'Ouverture ... he had become thoroughly acquainted with the wars in Hayti and the islands round about.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|title=John Brown|page=216}}</ref> By studying the slave revolts of the Caribbean region, Brown learned a great deal about how to properly conduct guerilla warfare. A key element to the prolonged success of this warfare was the establishment of [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] communities, which are essentially colonies of runaway slaves. As a contemporary article notes, Brown would use these establishments to \"retreat from and evade attacks he could not overcome. He would maintain and prolong a guerilla war, of which ... Haiti afforded\" an example.<ref name=\"Reynolds 106\">Reynolds, 2005, p. 106</ref>\n\nThe idea of creating maroon communities was the impetus for the creation of John Brown's \"Provisional Constitution and Ordinances for the People of the United States\", which helped to detail how such communities would be governed. However, the idea of maroon colonies of slaves is not an idea exclusive to the Caribbean region. In fact, maroon communities riddled the southern United States between the mid-1600s and 1864, especially the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] region of Virginia and North Carolina. Similar to the Haitian Revolution, the [[Seminole Wars]], fought in modern-day Florida, saw the involvement of maroon communities, which although outnumbered by native allies were more effective fighters.<ref name=\"Reynolds 106\" />\n\nAlthough the maroon colonies of North America undoubtedly had an effect on John Brown's plan, their impact paled in comparison to that of the maroon communities in places like Haiti, Jamaica, and Surinam. Accounts by Brown's friends and cohorts prove this idea. Richard Realf, a cohort of Brown in Kansas, noted that Brown not only studied the slave revolts in the Caribbean, but focused more specifically on the maroons of Jamaica and those involved in Haiti's liberation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Realf|first=Richard|title=Report of the Select Committee of the Senate Appointed to Inquire in the Late Invasion and Seizure of the Public Property at Harper's Ferry|year=1860|location=Washington D.C.|page=96}}</ref> Brown's friend Richard Hinton similarly noted that Brown knew \"by heart\" the occurrences in Jamaica and Haiti.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 107</ref> [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], a cohort of Brown's and a member of the [[Secret Six]], stated that Brown's plan involved getting \"together bands and families of fugitive slaves\" and \"establish them permanently in those [mountain] fastnesses, like the Maroons of Jamaica and Surinam\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Howard N.|title=The Magnificent Activist: The Writings of Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823\u20131911)|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|page=119}}</ref> Brown had planned for the maroon colonies established to be \"durable\", and thus able to endure over a prolonged period of war.\n\nThe similarities between John Brown's attempted insurrection and the Haitian Revolution, in both methods, motivations, and resolve, is still seen today as the main avenue in Haiti's capital [[Port-au-Prince]] is still named for Brown as a sign of solidarity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flounders|first=Sara|title=Cuba, Haiti and John Brown \u2013 To Rebel Is Justified|url=http://www.iacenter.org/haiti/john-brown.htm|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of the American Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Secondary sources===\n* Barney, William L. \"Brown, John\".

Brown advocated the use of armed insurrection to overthrow the institution of [[slavery in the United States]]. He first gained national attention when he led small groups of volunteers during the [[Bleeding Kansas]] crisis of 1856. He was dissatisfied with the pacifism of the organized abolitionist movement: \"These men are all talk. What we need is action\u2014action!\" In May 1856, Brown and his supporters killed five supporters of slavery in the [[Pottawatomie massacre]], which responded to the [[sacking of Lawrence]] by pro-slavery forces. Brown then commanded anti-slavery forces at the [[Battle of Black Jack]] (June 2) and the [[Battle of Osawatomie]] (August 30, 1856).\n\nIn October 1859, Brown [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|led a raid]] on the [[Harpers Ferry Armory|federal armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry, Virginia]] (today West Virginia), intending to start a slave liberation movement that would spread south through the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina; there was a [[Provisional Constitution (John Brown)|Provisional Constitution]] for the state he hoped to establish. He seized the armory, but seven people were killed, and ten or more were injured. He intended to arm slaves with weapons from the armory, but only a small number of local slaves joined his revolt. Within 36 hours, those of Brown's men who had not fled were killed or captured by local farmers, militiamen, and [[U.S. Marines]], the latter led by [[Robert E. Lee]]. He was hastily tried for [[treason]] against the Commonwealth of Virginia, the murder of five men (including three blacks), and inciting a slave insurrection; he was found guilty on all counts and was hanged. He was the first person convicted of treason in the history of the country.<ref name=Lies/>{{rp|179}}\n\nHistorians agree that the Harpers Ferry raid and Brown's trial, both covered extensively by the national press, escalated tensions that led to [[Secession in the United States#Confederate States of America|the South's secession]] a year later and the [[American Civil War]]. Brown's raid captured the nation's attention; Southerners feared that it was just the first of many Northern plots to cause a slave rebellion that might endanger their lives, while [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] dismissed the notion and claimed that they would not interfere with slavery in the South. \"[[John Brown's Body]]\" was a popular [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] marching song that portrayed him as a heroic martyr.\n\nBrown's actions as an abolitionist and the tactics he used still make him a controversial figure today. He is both memorialized as a heroic martyr and visionary, and vilified as a madman and a terrorist.<ref name=CHOWDER>Ken Chowder. \"[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/father-american-terrorism?page=show The Father of American Terrorism]\".

John Brown (1728\u20131776).<ref name=\"grandfather\">There has been speculation that the grandfather was the same John Brown who was a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] during the [[American Revolution]] and spent time in jail with the notorious [[Claudius Smith]], allegedly for stealing cattle, which he and Smith used to feed starving British troops. But this runs against the grain of the Brown family history as well as the record of the Humphrey family, to which the Browns were directly related (abolitionist John Brown's maternal grandmother was a Humphrey). Brown himself wrote in his 1857 autobiographical letter that both his and his first wife's grandfathers were soldiers in the [[Continental Army]] [which he established in his ''The Humphreys Family in America'' (1883)], which notes that abolitionist John Brown's grandfather, Capt. John Brown (born November 4, 1728), was a militia captain who died early in the American Revolution. His son Owen Brown, the father of abolitionist John Brown, was a tanner and strict evangelical who hated slavery and taught his trade to his son.</ref> Brown could trace his ancestry back to 17th-century English [[Puritans]].<ref>{{cite article\n|first=Franklin\n|last=Sanborn\n|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/1872apr/sanborn.htm\n|title=John Brown in Massachusetts\n|magazine=[[The Atlantic]]\n|date=April 1872}}</ref>\n\nIn 1805, the family moved to [[Hudson, Ohio]], where Owen Brown opened a tannery; there is a historical marker at the site of their house. Hudson was a center of anti-slavery activity and debate, and Owen participated fully, offering a [[safe house]] to [[Underground Railroad]] [[fugitive slaves|fugitives]]. There not being a high school in Hudson at that time, John studied at the school of the abolitionist Elizur Wright, father of the famous [[Elizur Wright]], in nearby [[Tallmadge, Ohio|Tallmadge]].\n\nOwen was one of the founders of Hudson's school, the [[Western Reserve College and Preparatory School]], which would soon (1832\u201333) become consumed with and torn apart by the issue of slavery (see [[Beriah Green]] and [[Lane Rebels]]). Owen also became a supporter of the [[Oberlin College|Oberlin Institute]] in its early stage, but was ultimately critical of the school's \"[[Christian perfection|Perfectionist]]\" leanings, especially renowned in the preaching and teaching of [[Charles Finney]] and [[Asa Mahan]]. Brown withdrew his membership from the Congregational church in the 1840s and never officially joined another church, but both he and his father were fairly conventional evangelicals for the period with its focus on the pursuit of personal righteousness. Brown's personal religion is fairly well documented in the papers of the Reverend Clarence Gee, a Brown family expert, now held in the Hudson [Ohio] Library and Historical Society.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nBrown's father had as an apprentice Jesse R.

Their first child, [[John Brown Junior|John Jr]], was born 13 months later. In 1825, seeking a safer location (for fugitive slaves), Brown and his family moved to [[Richmond Township, Crawford County, Pennsylvania|New Richmond, Pennsylvania]], where he bought {{convert|200|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of land.

During this period, Brown operated an interstate business involving cattle and leather production along with a kinsman, Seth Thompson, from eastern Ohio.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1829, some white families asked Brown to help them drive off Native Americans who hunted annually in the area.

Brown fell ill, and his businesses began to suffer, leaving him in terrible debt. In the summer of 1832, shortly after the death of a newborn son, his wife Dianthe died, leaving him with the children John Jr., Jason, [[Owen Brown (abolitionist, born 1824)|Owen]], and Ruth. (Another three of their children did not survive to adulthood.)

Following the heavy borrowing trends of Ohio, many businessmen like Brown trusted too heavily in credit and state bonds and paid dearly for it. In one episode of property loss, Brown was jailed when he attempted to retain ownership of a farm by occupying it against the claims of the new owner. Like other determined men of his time and background, he tried many different business efforts in an attempt to get out of debt. Along with tanning hides and cattle trading, he also undertook horse and sheep breeding, the last of which was to become a notable aspect of his pre-public vocation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIn 1837, in response to the murder of [[Elijah P.

In 1843, four of his children died of [[dysentery]]. As Louis DeCaro Jr shows in his biographical sketch (2007), from the mid-1840s Brown had built a reputation as an expert in fine sheep and wool, and entered into a partnership with Col. Simon Perkins of [[Akron, Ohio]], whose flocks and farms were managed by Brown and sons. Brown eventually moved into a home with his family across the street from the [[Perkins Stone Mansion]] on Perkins Hill.

From 1846 until he left Springfield in 1850, Brown was a parishioner at the Free Church, where he witnessed abolitionist lectures by the likes of [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Sojourner Truth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ourpluralhistory.stcc.edu/resistingslavery/stjohns.html|title=Resisting Slavery: St. John's Congregational Church|publisher=Springfield, MA \u2013 Our Plural History|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> In 1847, after speaking at the Free Church, Douglass spent a night speaking with Brown, after which he wrote, \"From this night spent with John Brown in Springfield, Mass. 1847 while I continued to write and speak against slavery, I became all the same less hopeful for its peaceful abolition. My utterances became more and more tinged by the color of this man's strong impressions.\"<ref name=\"masslive.com\"/> During Brown's time in Springfield, he became deeply involved in transforming the city into a major center of abolitionism, and one of the safest and most significant stops on the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjkb.org/discover_stjohns/history.html|title=History &#124; St. John's Congregational Church &#124; Springfield, MA|publisher=Sjkb.org|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref>\n\nBrown also learned much about Massachusetts' mercantile elite; while he initially considered this knowledge a curse, it proved to be a boon to his later activities in Kansas and at Harpers Ferry. The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool ''en masse'' at low prices. Initially, Brown naively trusted them, but he soon realized they were determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the [[Connecticut River Valley]]'s sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the ''Ohio Cultivator'', Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools ''en masse'' at the cheap prices they had been getting. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Slave kidnap post 1851 boston.jpg|thumb|left|An 1851 poster warning the \"colored people of Boston\" about policemen acting as slave catchers]]\n\nBefore Brown left Springfield in 1850, the United States passed the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], a law mandating that authorities in free states aid in the return of escaped slaves and imposing penalties on those who aided in their escape. In response Brown founded a militant group to prevent slaves' capture, the League of Gileadites. In the Bible, [[Gilead|Mount Gilead]] was the place where only the bravest of [[Israelites]] gathered to face an invading enemy. Brown founded the League with the words, \"Nothing so charmes the American people as personal bravery. [Blacks] would have ten times the number [of white friends than] they now have were they but half as much in earnest to secure their dearest rights as they are to ape the follies and extravagances of their white neighbors, and to indulge in idle show, in ease, and in luxury.\"<ref name=\"zikibay.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zikibay.com/brown/prelude.html|title=John Brown: In His Own Words \u2013 Prelude|publisher=Zikibay.com|accessdate=October 16, 2012}}</ref> Upon leaving Springfield in 1850, he instructed the League to act \"quickly, quietly, and efficiently\" to protect slaves that escaped to Springfield\u2014words that would foreshadow Brown's later actions preceding Harpers Ferry.<ref name=\"zikibay.com\"/> From Brown's founding of the ''League of Gileadites'' onward, not one person was ever taken back into slavery from Springfield.

In actuality, Perkins absorbed much of the financial loss, and their partnership continued for several more years, with Brown nearly breaking even by 1854. Brown's time in Springfield sowed the seeds for the future financial support he received from New England's great merchants, introduced him to nationally famous abolitionists like Douglass and Truth, and included the foundation of the League of Gileadites.<ref name=\"masslive.com\" /><ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> During this time, Brown also helped publicize [[David Walker (abolitionist)|David Walker]]'s speech ''Appeal''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kimeatghs.com/ushistory/abolitionism.html |title=Abolitionism |publisher=GHS IB History of the Americas |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713150821/http://kimeatghs.com/ushistory/abolitionism.html |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}</ref> Brown's personal attitudes evolved in Springfield, as he observed the success of the city's Underground Railroad and made his first venture into militant, anti-slavery community organizing.

Determined to protect his family and oppose the advances of slavery supporters, Brown left for Kansas, enlisting a son-in-law and making several stops just to collect funds and weapons. As reported by the New York ''Tribune'', Brown stopped en route to participate in an anti-slavery convention that took place in June 1855 in [[Albany, New York]]. Despite the controversy that ensued on the convention floor regarding the support of violent efforts on behalf of the free state cause, several people gave Brown financial support. As he went westward, Brown found more militant support in his home state of Ohio, particularly in the strongly anti-slavery [[Western Reserve]] section where he had been reared.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Pottawatomie===\n{{Main|Pottawatomie massacre|Bleeding Kansas}}\n[[File:John Brown by Southworth & Hawes, 1856.png|thumb|upright|<center>John Brown, 1856</center>]]\n\nBrown and the free settlers were optimistic that they could bring Kansas into the union as a slavery-free state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rhodes|first=James Fork|title=History of the United States from the Compromise of 1850|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofuniteds06rhodrich|year=1892|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=Original from Harvard University|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofuniteds06rhodrich/page/385 385]}}</ref> After the winter snows thawed in 1856, the pro-slavery activists began a campaign to seize Kansas on their own terms. Brown was particularly affected by the [[sacking of Lawrence]] in May 1856, in which a [[sheriff]]-led posse destroyed newspaper offices and  [[The Eldridge Hotel|a hotel]]. Only one man, a Border Ruffian, was killed. [[Preston Brooks]]'s [[Caning of Charles Sumner|caning]] of anti-slavery Senator [[Charles Sumner]] in the [[United States Senate]] also fueled Brown's anger. A pro-slavery writer, [[Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow (1816\u20131891)|Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow]], of the ''Squatter Sovereign'', wrote that \"[pro-slavery forces] are determined to repel this Northern invasion, and make Kansas a Slave State; though our rivers should be covered with the blood of their victims, and the carcasses of the Abolitionists should be so numerous in the territory as to breed disease and sickness, we will not be deterred from our purpose\".<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 162</ref> Brown was outraged by both the violence of the pro-slavery forces and what he saw as a weak and cowardly response by the antislavery partisans and the Free State settlers, whom he described as \"cowards, or worse\".<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 163\u201364</ref>\n\nThe [[Pottawatomie massacre]] occurred during the night of May 24 and the morning of May 25, 1856.

Robinson]] stated:\n\n<blockquote>When it is known that such threats were as plenty as blue-berries in June, on both sides, all over the Territory, and were regarded as of no more importance than the idle wind, this indictment will hardly justify midnight assassination of all pro-slavery men, whether making threats or not ... Had all men been killed in Kansas who indulged in such threats, there would have been none left to bury the dead.<ref>Robinson, Charles. ''The Kansas Conflict''. 1892. Reprint. Lawrence, Kans.: Journal Publishing Co., 1898.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the two years prior to the Pottawatomie Creek massacre, there had been eight killings in Kansas Territory attributable to slavery politics, but none in the vicinity of the massacre. The massacre was the match in the powderkeg that precipitated the bloodiest period in \"Bleeding Kansas\" history, a three-month period of retaliatory raids and battles in which 29 people died.<ref>Watts, Dale E.

On June 2, John Brown, nine of his followers, and 20 local men successfully defended a Free State settlement at [[Palmyra Township, Douglas County, Kansas|Palmyra, Kansas]], against an attack by Pate (see [[Battle of Black Jack]]). Pate and 22 of his men were taken prisoner.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 180\u201381, 186</ref> After capture, they were taken to Brown's camp, and received all the food Brown could find. Brown forced Pate to sign a treaty, exchanging the freedom of Pate and his men for the promised release of Brown's two captured sons. Brown released Pate to Colonel [[Edwin Sumner]], but was furious to discover that the release of his sons was delayed until September.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn August, a company of over 300 Missourians under the command of General [[John W. Reid]] crossed into Kansas and headed towards [[Osawatomie, Kansas|Osawatomie]], intending to destroy the Free State settlements there, and then march on [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]] and [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]].<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 199</ref>\n\nOn the morning of August 30, 1856, they shot and killed Brown's son Frederick and his neighbor David Garrison on the outskirts of Osawatomie. Brown, outnumbered more than seven to one, arranged his 38 men behind natural defenses along the road. Firing from cover, they managed to kill at least 20 of Reid's men and wounded 40 more.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 200\u201301</ref> Reid regrouped, ordering his men to dismount and charge into the woods. Brown's small group scattered and fled across the [[Marais des Cygnes River]]. One of Brown's men was killed during the retreat and four were captured. While Brown and his surviving men hid in the woods nearby, the Missourians plundered and burned Osawatomie. Despite his defeat, Brown's bravery and military shrewdness in the face of overwhelming odds brought him national attention and made him a hero to many Northern abolitionists.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 201\u201302</ref>\n\nOn September 7, Brown entered Lawrence to meet with Free State leaders and help fortify against a feared assault. At least 2,700 pro-slavery Missourians were once again invading Kansas. On September 14, they skirmished near Lawrence. Brown prepared for battle, but serious violence was averted when the new governor of Kansas, [[John W. Geary]], ordered the warring parties to disarm and disband, and offered clemency to former fighters on both sides.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 203\u201304</ref> Brown, taking advantage of the fragile peace, left Kansas with three of his sons to raise money from supporters in the North.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:John Brown portrait, 1859.jpg|thumb|right|upright|<center>John Brown in 1859</center>]]\n\n===Gathering forces===\nBrown returned to the East by November 1856, and spent the next two years in New England raising funds.

In Boston, he met [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He received many pledges but little cash. In March, while in New York City, he was introduced to Hugh Forbes, an English mercenary, who had experience as a military tactician fighting with [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] in Italy in 1848. Brown hired him as his men's drillmaster and to write their tactical handbook. They agreed to meet in Tabor that summer. Using the alias Nelson Hawkins, Brown traveled through the Northeast and then visited his family in [[Hudson, Ohio]]. On August 7, he arrived in Tabor. Forbes arrived two days later. Over several weeks, the two men put together a \"Well-Matured Plan\" for fighting slavery in the South. The men quarreled over many of the details. In November, their troops left for Kansas. Forbes had not received his salary and was still feuding with Brown, so he returned to the East instead of venturing into Kansas. He soon threatened to expose the plot to the government.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Maxon house springdale iowa.jpg|thumb|left|William Maxon's house, near [[Springdale, Iowa]], where John Brown's associates lived and trained, 1857\u20131859.

The convention assembled 34 blacks and 12 whites to adopt Brown's [[Provisional Constitution (John Brown)|Provisional Constitution]]. According to Delany, during the convention, Brown illuminated his plans to make Kansas rather than Canada the end of the [[Underground Railroad]]. This would be the Subterranean Pass Way.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Delany's reflections are not entirely trustworthy. Brown was no longer looking toward Kansas and was entirely focused on Virginia. Other testimony from the Chatham meeting suggests Brown did speak of going south. Brown had long used the terminology of the Subterranean Pass Way from the late 1840s, so it is possible that Delany conflated Brown's statements over the years. Regardless, Brown was elected commander-in-chief and named [[John Henrie Kagi]] his \"Secretary of War\". [[Richard Realf]] was named \"Secretary of State\". Elder Monroe, a black minister, was to act as president until another was chosen. A. M. Chapman was the acting vice president; Delany, the corresponding secretary. In 1859, \"A Declaration of Liberty by the Representatives of the Slave Population of the United States of America\" was written.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nAlthough nearly all of the delegates signed the constitution, very few volunteered to join Brown's forces, although it will never be clear how many Canadian expatriates actually intended to join Brown because of a subsequent \"security leak\" that threw off plans for the raid, creating a hiatus in which Brown lost contact with many of the Canadian leaders. This crisis occurred when Hugh Forbes, Brown's mercenary, tried to expose the plans to Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Wilson]] and others. The Secret Six feared their names would be made public. Howe and Higginson wanted no delays in Brown's progress, while Parker, Stearns, Smith and Sanborn insisted on postponement. Stearns and Smith were the major sources of funds, and their words carried more weight. To throw Forbes off the trail and invalidate his assertions, Brown returned to Kansas in June, and remained in that vicinity for six months. There he joined forces with [[James Montgomery (colonel)|James Montgomery]], who was leading raids into Missouri.\n\n[[File:Ole Peter Hansen Balling - John Brown - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of John Brown by [[Ole Peter Hansen Balling]], 1872]]\n\nOn December 20, Brown led his own raid, in which he liberated 11 slaves, took captive two white men, and looted horses and wagons. (See [[Battle of the Spurs (Kansas)|Battle of the Spurs]].) On January 20, 1859, he embarked on a lengthy journey to take the liberated slaves to Detroit and then on a ferry to Canada. While passing through Chicago, Brown met with abolitionists [[Allan Pinkerton]], John Jones, and [[Henry O. Wagoner]] who arranged and raised the fare for the passage to Detroit<ref>''The History of Johnson County, Iowa'', 1883, pp. 475\u201377</ref> and purchase clothes and supplies for Brown.

On May 9, he delivered a lecture in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], that [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], Emerson, and Thoreau attended. Brown reconnoitered with the Secret Six. In June he paid his last visit to his family in North Elba before departing for Harpers Ferry. He stayed one night en route in [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], at the Washington House, on West Washington Street. On June 30, 1859, the hotel had at least 25 guests, including I. Smith and Sons, Oliver Smith and Owen Smith, and Jeremiah Anderson, all from New York. From papers found in the Kennedy Farmhouse after the raid, it is known that Brown wrote to Kagi that he would sign into a hotel as I.

After he began the first battle, he believed, slaves would rise up and carry out a rebellion across the South.<ref>Clinton, pp. 126\u201328.</ref>\n\nBrown asked Tubman to gather former slaves then living in present-day Southern Ontario who might be willing to join his fighting force, which she did.<ref>Larson, p. 159.</ref> He arrived in [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]] on July 3, 1859. A few days later, under the name Isaac Smith, he rented a [[Kennedy Farm|farmhouse]] in nearby [[Maryland]]. He awaited the arrival of his recruits. They never materialized in the numbers he expected. In late August he met with Douglass in [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania]], where he revealed the Harpers Ferry plan. Douglass expressed severe reservations, rebuffing Brown's pleas to join the mission. Douglass had known of Brown's plans since early 1859 and had made a number of efforts to discourage blacks from enlisting.\n\nIn late September, the 950 pikes arrived from Charles Blair. Kagi's draft plan called for a brigade of 4,500 men, but Brown had only 21 men (16 white and 5 black: three free blacks, one freed slave, and a fugitive slave). They ranged in age from 21 to 49. Twelve had been with Brown in Kansas raids. On October 16, 1859, Brown (leaving three men behind as a rear guard) led 18 men in an attack on the [[Harpers Ferry Armory]]. He had received 200 [[Beecher's Bibles]]\u2014breechloading .52 (13.2&nbsp;mm) caliber Sharps rifles\u2014and pikes from northern abolitionist societies in preparation for the raid. The armory was a large complex of buildings that contained 100,000 muskets and rifles, which Brown planned to seize and use to arm local slaves. They would then head south, drawing off more and more slaves from plantations, and fighting only in self-defense. As Douglass and Brown's family testified, his strategy was essentially to deplete Virginia of its slaves, causing the institution to collapse in one county after another, until the movement spread into the South, wreaking havoc on the economic viability of the pro-slavery states.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nInitially, the raid went well, and they met no resistance entering the town. They cut the telegraph wires and easily captured the armory, which was being defended by a single watchman. They next rounded up hostages from nearby farms, including [[Colonel Lewis Washington]], great-grandnephew of [[George Washington]].

After holding the train, Brown inexplicably allowed it to continue on its way. At the next station, where the telegraph still worked, the passenger train conductor, sent a telegram to Baltimore:\n\n{{quote|''Monocacy, 7.05 A.

In the meantime, local farmers, shopkeepers, and militia pinned down the raiders in the armory by firing from the heights behind the town. Some of the local men were shot by Brown's men. At noon, a company of militia seized the bridge, blocking the only escape route. Brown then moved his prisoners and remaining raiders into the engine house, a small brick building at the armory's entrance. He had the doors and windows barred and loopholes cut through the brick walls. The surrounding forces barraged the engine house, and the men inside fired back with occasional fury. Brown sent his son Watson and another supporter out under a white flag, but the angry crowd shot them. Intermittent shooting then broke out, and Brown's son Oliver was wounded. His son begged his father to kill him and end his suffering, but Brown said \"If you must die, die like a man.\" A few minutes later, Oliver was dead. The exchanges lasted throughout the day.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:John brown interior engine house.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of the interior of the Fort immediately before the door is broken down]]\nBy the morning of October 18 the engine house, later known as [[John Brown's Fort]], was surrounded by a company of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] under the command of First Lieutenant [[Israel Greene]], USMC, with Colonel [[Robert E.

John Brown}}\nBrown and the others captured were held in the office of the armory. On October 18, 1859, Virginia Governor [[Henry A. Wise]], Virginia Senator [[James M. Mason]], and Representative [[Clement Vallandigham]] of Ohio arrived in Harpers Ferry. Mason led the three-hour questioning session of Brown.\n[[File:John Brown - Treason broadside, 1859.png|thumb|right]]\n[[File:The old Court House at Charlestown, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was tried; it stands diagonal across the street from the jail (1906).jpg|thumb|The old Court House at Charles Town, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was tried; it stands diagonally across the street from the jail (ca. 1906)]]\n[[File:Old Jail at Charlestown, Jefferson County, Virginia, where John Brown was imprisoned.jpg|thumb|right|The Jefferson County Jail at Charles Town, Virginia, where John Brown was imprisoned during and after his trial, since torn down and now the site of the Charles Town post office]]\nAlthough the attack had taken place on federal property, Wise ordered that Brown and his men be tried in Virginia in [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]], the nearby seat of Jefferson County just seven miles west of Harpers Ferry (perhaps to avert Northern political pressure on the Federal government, or in the unlikely event of a presidential [[pardon]]). The trial began October 27, after a doctor pronounced the still-wounded Brown fit for trial. Brown was charged with murdering four whites and a black, [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiring]] with slaves to rebel, and [[treason]] against Virginia. A series of lawyers were assigned to him, including Lawson Botts, Thomas C. Green, [[Samuel Chilton]], a lawyer from Washington D.C., and [[George Henry Hoyt|George Hoyt]], but it was Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, who concluded the defense on October 31. In his closing statement, Griswold argued that Brown could not be found guilty of treason against a state to which he owed no loyalty and of which he was not a resident, that Brown had not killed anyone himself, and that the raid's failure indicated that Brown had not conspired with slaves. [[Andrew Hunter (lawyer)|Andrew Hunter]], the local district attorney, presented the closing arguments for the prosecution.\n\nOn November 2, after a week-long trial and 45 minutes of deliberation, the Charles Town jury found Brown guilty on all three counts. He was sentenced to be hanged in public on December 2. In response to the sentence, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] remarked that \"[John Brown] will make the gallows glorious like the Cross.\" Cadets from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] under the leadership of General [[Francis H. Smith]] and Major [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] (who earned the nickname \"Stonewall\" less than two years later) were called into service as a security detail in the event Brown's supporters attempted a rescue.\n\nDuring the month before his execution, Brown was allowed to send and receive correspondence, and he wrote many letters. One of the letters was from Mahala Doyle, wife and mother of three of Brown's Kansas victims. She wrote \"Altho' vengeance is not mine, I confess that I do feel gratified to hear that you were stopped in your fiendish career at Harper's Ferry ...\"  In a postscript she added \"My son John Doyle whose life I beg[g]ed of you is now grown up and is very desirous to be in Charlestown on the day of your execution.\"<ref>Oates (1984) pp. 344\u201345</ref>\n\nBrown refused to be rescued by [[Silas Soule]], a friend from Kansas who somehow infiltrated the Jefferson County Jail one day and offered to break him out during the night and flee northward to New York state and possibly Canada. Brown supposedly told Silas that, aged 59, he was too old to live a life on the run from the federal authorities as a fugitive and that he was ready to die as a [[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]. Silas left him behind to be executed.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Many of Brown's letters exuded spirituality and conviction and, when picked up by the Northern press, won him more supporters in the North while infuriating many white people in the South. On December 1, Brown's wife arrived by train in Charles Town, where she joined him at the county jail for his last meal. She was denied permission to stay the night, prompting Brown to lose his composure and temper for the only time during the ordeal.\n\nThe Governor of Virginia was so concerned about an attempt to rescue Brown that he halted almost all transportation on the [[Winchester and Potomac Railroad]] (from Maryland south through Harpers Ferry to Charles Town) from the day before through the day after the execution (see [[Winchester and Potomac Railroad#John Brown's raid]]).\n\n===Victor Hugo's reaction===\n[[Victor Hugo]], from exile on [[Guernsey]], tried to obtain [[Clemency|pardon]] for John Brown: he sent an [[open letter]] that was published by the press on both sides of the Atlantic. This text, written at Hauteville-House on December 2, 1859, warned of a possible civil war:\n\n{{Wikisource|Victor Hugo's letter to the London News regarding John Brown|Victor Hugo's letter to the London News}}\n\n{{quote|Politically speaking, the murder of John Brown would be an uncorrectable sin. It would create in the Union a latent fissure that would in the long run dislocate it. Brown's agony might perhaps consolidate slavery in Virginia, but it would certainly shake the whole American democracy. You save your shame, but you kill your glory. Morally speaking, it seems a part of the human light would put itself out, that the very notion of justice and injustice would hide itself in darkness, on that day where one would see the assassination of Emancipation by Liberty itself. ...\n\nLet America know and ponder on this: there is something more frightening than Cain killing Abel, and that is Washington killing [[Spartacus]].}}\n\nThe letter was initially published in the ''London News'' and was widely reprinted. After Brown's execution, Hugo wrote a number of additional letters about Brown and the abolitionist cause.<ref>Reynolds, David S.

Vintage, 2009. pp. 408\u201310</ref>\n\nAbolitionists in the United States saw Hugo's writings as evidence of international support for the anti-slavery cause. The most widely publicized commentary on Brown to reach America from Europe was an 1861 pamphlet, ''John Brown par Victor Hugo'', that included a brief biography and reprinted two letters by Hugo, including that of December 9, 1859. The pamphlet's frontispiece was an engraving of a hanged man by Hugo that became widely associated with the execution.<ref>Drescher, Seymour, \"Servile Insurrection and John Brown's Body in Europe\". in Finkelman, Paul, ed.

At 11:00&nbsp;a.m. he was escorted from the county jail through a crowd of 2,000 soldiers a few blocks away to a small field where the gallows were. Among the soldiers in the crowd were future Confederate general [[Stonewall Jackson]] and [[John Wilkes Booth]] (the latter borrowing a militia uniform to gain admission to the execution).<ref>Evan Carton, ''Patriotic Treason: John Brown and the Soul of America'' (2006), pp. 332\u201333.</ref> The poet [[Walt Whitman]], in ''Year of Meteors'', described viewing the execution.<ref>Walt Whitman Archive: [http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1881/poems/103 \"Year of Meteors\"]; retrieved March 13, 2011</ref>\n\nBrown was accompanied by the sheriff and his assistants, but no minister since he had consistently rejected the ministrations of pro-slavery clergy. Since the region was in the grips of virtual hysteria, most Northerners, including journalists, were run out of town, and it is unlikely any anti-slavery clergyman would have been safe, even if one were to have sought to visit Brown. He elected to receive no religious services in the jail or at the scaffold. He was hanged at 11:15&nbsp;a.m. and pronounced dead at 11:50&nbsp;a.m.\n\n===Transportation of his body===\n[[File:John Brown's Tombstone.jpg|thumb|upright|John Brown's tombstone, [[North Elba, New York]]]]\n[[File:FMIB 43086 John Brown's Grave.jpeg|thumb|FMIB 43086 John Brown's Grave (the tombstone is now enclosed in glass)]]\nBrown's body was placed in a wooden coffin with the noose still around his neck. His coffin was then put on a train to take it away from Virginia to his family homestead in New York for burial.

However, because of demonstrations expected from both sides\u2014there were many Southern pro-slavery medical students in Philadelphia\u2014Mayor [[Alexander Henry (Philadelphia)|Alexander Henry]] \"made a fake casket, covered with flowers and flags which was carefully lifted from the coach and the train and sped onward in its destination ...

The Democrats attempted to implicate the Republicans in the raid; the Republicans tried to disassociate themselves from Brown and his acts.\n\nThe Senate committee heard testimony from 32 witnesses, including Liam Dodson, one of the surviving abolitionists. The report, authored by chairman [[James Murray Mason]], a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, was published in June 1860. It found no direct evidence of a conspiracy, but implied that the raid was a result of Republican doctrines.<ref>{{cite web |title=Senate Select Committee Report on the Harper's Ferry Invasion |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/jbexhibit/masonreport.html |date=June 15, 1860 |website=West Virginia Division of Culture and History |access-date=July 25, 2016}}</ref> The two committee Republicans published a [[Dissenting opinion|minority report]], but were apparently more concerned about denying Northern culpability than clarifying the nature of Brown's efforts. Republicans such as [[Abraham Lincoln]] rejected any connection with the raid, calling Brown \"insane\".<ref>David Donald, ''Lincoln'' (1995) p. 239</ref>\n\nThe investigation was performed in a tense environment in both houses of Congress. One senator wrote to his wife that \"The members on both sides are mostly armed with deadly weapons and it is said that the friends of each are armed in the galleries.\" After a heated exchange of insults, a Mississippian attacked [[Thaddeus Stevens]] of Pennsylvania with a [[Bowie knife]] in the House of Representatives. Stevens' friends prevented a fight.<ref>Oates (1984), p. 359</ref>\n\nThe Senate committee was very cautious in its questions of two of Brown's backers, Samuel Howe and George Stearns, out of fear of stoking violence.

In light of the upcoming elections in November 1860, the Republicans tried to distance themselves as much as possible from Brown, condemning the raid and dismissing its leader as an insane fanatic. As one historian explains, Brown was successful in polarizing politics: \"Brown's raid succeeded brilliantly. It drove a wedge through the already tentative and fragile Opposition-Republican coalition and helped to intensify the sectional polarization that soon tore the Democratic party and the Union apart.\"<ref name=\"Crofts\"/>\n\nMany abolitionists in the North viewed Brown as a martyr, sacrificed for the sins of the nation. Immediately after the raid, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] published a column in ''[[The Liberator (newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', judging Brown's raid \"well-intended but sadly misguided\" and \"wild and futile\".<ref>[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1859/10/28/the-tragedy-at-harpers-ferry \"The Tragedy at Harper's Ferry\"], fair-use.org; accessed November 12, 2015.</ref> But he defended Brown's character from detractors in the Northern and Southern press and argued that those who supported the principles of the [[American Revolution]] could not consistently oppose Brown's raid.

Brown was born during the period of the [[Haitian Revolution]], which saw Haitian slaves revolting against the French. The role the revolution played in helping to formulate Brown's abolitionist views directly is not clear; however, the revolution had an obvious effect on the general view towards slavery in the northern United States. As W. E. B. Du Bois notes, the involvement of slaves in the American Revolutions, as well as the \"upheaval in Hayti, and the new enthusiasm for human rights, led to a wave of emancipation which started in Vermont ... swept through New England and Pennsylvania, ending finally in New York and New Jersey\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|first=W. E. B.|title=John Brown|year=1962|publisher=International Publishers|location=New York|pages=80\u201381}}</ref> This changed sentiment, which occurred during the late 18th and early 19th century, undoubtedly had a role in creating Brown's abolitionist opinion, during his upbringing.\n\nThe 1839 slave insurrection aboard the Spanish ship ''[[La Amistad]]'', off the coast of Cuba, provides a poignant example of John Brown's support and appeal towards Caribbean slave revolts. On ''La Amistad'', [[Joseph Cinqu\u00e9]] and approximately 50 other slaves captured the ship, slated to transport them from [[Havana]] to [[Camag\u00fcey|Puerto Pr\u00edncipe]], Cuba in July 1839, and attempted to return to Africa. However, through trickery, the ship ended up in the United States, where Cinque and his men stood trial. Ultimately, the courts acquitted the men because at the time the international slave trade was illegal in the United States.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 54</ref> According to Brown's daughter, \"[[Nat Turner|Turner]] and Cinque stood first in esteem\" among Brown's black heroes. Furthermore, she noted Brown's \"admiration of Cinques' character and management in carrying his points with so little bloodshed!\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Redpath|first=James|title=The Public Life of Captain John Brown|url=https://archive.org/details/publiclifeofcapt00redprich|year=1860|publisher=Thayer and Eldridge|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/publiclifeofcapt00redprich/page/46 46]}}</ref> In 1850, Brown would refer affectionately to the revolt, in saying \"Nothing so charms the American people as personal bravery. Witness the case of Cinques, of everlasting memory, on board the ''Amistad''.\"<ref>Reynolds, 2005, pp. 54\u201355</ref> The slave revolts of the Caribbean had a clear and important impact on Brown's views toward slavery and his staunch support of the most severe forms of abolitionism. However, this is not the most important part of the many revolts' legacy of influencing Brown.\n\nThe specific knowledge John Brown gained from the tactics employed in the Haitian Revolution, and other Caribbean revolts, was of paramount importance when Brown turned his sights to the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. As Brown's cohort [[Richard Realf]] explained to a committee of the 36th Congress, \"he had posted himself in relation to the wars of Toussaint L'Ouverture ... he had become thoroughly acquainted with the wars in Hayti and the islands round about.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Du Bois|title=John Brown|page=216}}</ref> By studying the slave revolts of the Caribbean region, Brown learned a great deal about how to properly conduct guerilla warfare. A key element to the prolonged success of this warfare was the establishment of [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] communities, which are essentially colonies of runaway slaves. As a contemporary article notes, Brown would use these establishments to \"retreat from and evade attacks he could not overcome. He would maintain and prolong a guerilla war, of which ... Haiti afforded\" an example.<ref name=\"Reynolds 106\">Reynolds, 2005, p. 106</ref>\n\nThe idea of creating maroon communities was the impetus for the creation of John Brown's \"Provisional Constitution and Ordinances for the People of the United States\", which helped to detail how such communities would be governed. However, the idea of maroon colonies of slaves is not an idea exclusive to the Caribbean region. In fact, maroon communities riddled the southern United States between the mid-1600s and 1864, especially the [[Great Dismal Swamp]] region of Virginia and North Carolina. Similar to the Haitian Revolution, the [[Seminole Wars]], fought in modern-day Florida, saw the involvement of maroon communities, which although outnumbered by native allies were more effective fighters.<ref name=\"Reynolds 106\" />\n\nAlthough the maroon colonies of North America undoubtedly had an effect on John Brown's plan, their impact paled in comparison to that of the maroon communities in places like Haiti, Jamaica, and Surinam. Accounts by Brown's friends and cohorts prove this idea. Richard Realf, a cohort of Brown in Kansas, noted that Brown not only studied the slave revolts in the Caribbean, but focused more specifically on the maroons of Jamaica and those involved in Haiti's liberation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Realf|first=Richard|title=Report of the Select Committee of the Senate Appointed to Inquire in the Late Invasion and Seizure of the Public Property at Harper's Ferry|year=1860|location=Washington D.C.|page=96}}</ref> Brown's friend Richard Hinton similarly noted that Brown knew \"by heart\" the occurrences in Jamaica and Haiti.<ref>Reynolds, 2005, p. 107</ref> [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], a cohort of Brown's and a member of the [[Secret Six]], stated that Brown's plan involved getting \"together bands and families of fugitive slaves\" and \"establish them permanently in those [mountain] fastnesses, like the Maroons of Jamaica and Surinam\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Howard N.|title=The Magnificent Activist: The Writings of Thomas Wentworth Higginson (1823\u20131911)|year=2000|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|page=119}}</ref> Brown had planned for the maroon colonies established to be \"durable\", and thus able to endure over a prolonged period of war.\n\nThe similarities between John Brown's attempted insurrection and the Haitian Revolution, in both methods, motivations, and resolve, is still seen today as the main avenue in Haiti's capital [[Port-au-Prince]] is still named for Brown as a sign of solidarity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flounders|first=Sara|title=Cuba, Haiti and John Brown \u2013 To Rebel Is Justified|url=http://www.iacenter.org/haiti/john-brown.htm|accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of the American Civil War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Secondary sources===\n* Barney, William L. \"Brown, John\".

The two decades of Poland's sovereignty between the world wars are known as the [[Interbellum]].\n\nPoland re-emerged in November 1918 after more than a century of [[Partitions of Poland|partitions]] by [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Prussia|German]], and the [[Russian Empire]]s.<ref>Mieczys\u0142aw Biskupski.

Routledge. 1997. p. 101.</ref>\nThe Polish political scene was democratic, but was chaotic until [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (1867\u20131935) [[May Coup (Poland)|seized power]] in May 1926 and democracy ended. The policy of [[agrarianism]] led to the redistribution of lands to peasants and the country achieved significant economic growth between 1921 and 1939.  A third of the population consisted of minorities\u2014[[Ukrainians in Poland|Ukrainians]], Jews, Belarusians, Lithuanians and [[German minority in Poland|Germans]].<ref>Aviel Roshwald, ''Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914-23'' (2000), p. 164.</ref>\n\n==Formative years (1918-1921)==\nThe independence of Poland had been successfully promoted to the Allies in Paris by [[Roman Dmowski]] and [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]]. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson made the independence of Poland a war goal in his [[Fourteen Points]], and this goal was endorsed by the Allies in spring 1918.  As part of the Armistice terms imposed on Germany, all German forces had to stand down in Poland and other occupied areas.  So as the war ended, the Germans sent Pi\u0142sudski, then under arrest, back to Warsaw. On November 11, 1918, he took control from the puppet government the Germans had set up.  [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]] headed a short-lived Polish government in [[Lublin]] from November 6 but Pi\u0142sudski had overwhelming prestige at this point. Daszy\u0144ski and the other Polish leaders acknowledged him as head of the army and in effect head of what became the [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]]. Germany, now defeated, followed the terms of the Armistice and withdrew its forces.  J\u0119drzej Moraczewski became the first prime minister (in November 1918) and Dmowski headed the largest party.<ref name=\"Lukowski 6\">''A Concise History of Poland'', by Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, p. 217-222.</ref>\n\nFrom its inception the Republic fought a series of wars to secure its boundaries.  The nation was rural and poor; the richest areas were in the former German areas in the west. Industrialization came very slowly, and was promoted in the mid-1930s with the development of the [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial District]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Josef Marcus|title=Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82ncGA4GuN4C&pg=PA41|year=1983|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=41|isbn=9789027932396}}</ref>\n\n===Boundaries===\nMost Polish leaders of that period wanted to create a larger Polish state; one optimal plan, dating back to the Paris Peace Conference, included the incorporation of East Prussia and the German city of K\u00f6nigsberg being placed in a customs union with Poland. At the same time, the exact boundaries of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not desired, though mentioned as an opening gambit by [[Roman Dmowski]]. Much of this land had been controlled by the Russian Empire since the Partitions of Poland and its inhabitants were struggling to create their own states (such as [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and the Baltics: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia). The Polish leadership did not aim to restore the nation to its 17th-century boundaries.<ref name=\"Sandra Halperin 1996 pp. 40, 41\">Sandra Halperin, ''In the Mirror of the Third World: Capitalist Development in Modern Europe'', (1996) pp. 40, 41.</ref> Opinions varied among Polish politicians as to how much of the territory a new, Polish-led state should contain and what form it should take. [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] advocated a democratic, Polish-led [[federation]] of independent states \u2014 while [[Roman Dmowski]] leader of the ''[[Endecja]]'' movement represented by the National Democratic Party, set his mind on a more compact Poland composed of ethnic Polish or '[[polonization|polonizable']] territories.<ref>Piotr S. Wandycz, \"The Polish Question\" in The Treaty of Versailles: a reassessment after 75 years / edited by Manfred F. Boemeke, Gerald D. Feldman and Elisabeth Glaser, Cambridge, U.K.; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 313-336.</ref>\n\n[[File:Poland & The New Baltic States.jpg|thumb|250px|left|1920 map from ''The Peoples Atlas'' showing the situation of Poland and the Baltic states with their still-undefined borders after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and before the [[Peace of Riga]]]]\n\nTo the southwest, Poland and Czechoslovakia contested [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|boundary disputes]] (see: [[Zaolzie]]). More ominously, an embittered Germany begrudged any territorial loss to its new eastern neighbour. The December 27, 1918 [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|Great Poland Uprising]] liberated [[Greater Poland]]. The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] settled the German-Polish borders in the [[Baltic region]]. The port city of [[Danzig]] ({{lang-pl|Gda\u0144sk}}), with a majority German population and Polish minority was declared a [[Free City of Danzig|free city independent of Germany]], and became a bone of contention for decades. Allied arbitration divided the ethnically mixed and highly coveted industrial and mining district of [[Silesia]] between Germany and Poland, with Poland receiving the smaller in size, but more industrialized eastern section in 1922, after series of three [[Silesian Uprisings]].\n\n===War with Soviet Union===\n[[Polish-Soviet war|Military conflict]] proved the determinant of Poland's frontiers in the east, a theater rendered chaotic by the repercussions of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolutions]] and [[Russian Civil War|civil war]]. Pi\u0142sudski envisioned creating a federation with the rest of Ukraine (led by the Polish-friendly government in [[Kiev]] he was to help to install) and [[Lithuania]], thus forming a Central and East European federation called \"[[Mi\u0119dzymorze]]\" (literally \"between seas\"). [[Lenin]], leader of the new communist government of Russia, saw Poland as the bridge over which communism would pass into the labor class of a disorganized postwar Germany. And the issue was further complicated as some of the disputed regions had assumed various economic and political identities since the partition in the late 18th century while some did not have an ethnically Polish majority in the first place they were still viewed by Poles as their historic regions, since they envisioned Poland as a multiethnic state. In the end, the negotiations broke down, sinking Pi\u0142sudski's idea of [[Mi\u0119dzymorze]] federation; instead, wars like the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] or the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] decided the borders of the region for the next two decades.\n\nThe [[Polish-Soviet war]], began in 1919, was the most important of the regional wars.  Pi\u0142sudski first carried out a [[Kiev Offensive|major military thrust]] into [[Ukraine]] in 1920 and in May Polish-Ukrainian forces reached Kiev. Just a few weeks later, however, the Polish offensive was met with a Soviet counter-offensive, and Polish forces were forced into a retreat by the [[Red Army]]. Poland was driven out of Ukraine and back into the Polish heartland.  Most observers at the time marked Poland for extinction and Bolshevization,<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''Paris: 1919'' (2001) p. 227.</ref> However at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] Pi\u0142sudski organized a stunning counterattack that won a famous victory.<ref>Norman Davies, ''White Eagle, Red Star: The Polish-Soviet War 1919-1920 and The Miracle on the Vistula'' (2003) pp. 188-225.</ref> This \"Miracle on the Vistula\" became an iconic victory in Polish memory. Pi\u0142sudski resumed the offensive, pushing the Red forces east. Eventually both sides, exhausted, signed [[Treaty of Riga|a compromise peace treaty at Riga]] in early 1921 that divided the disputed territories of [[Belarus]] and Ukraine between the two combatants.<ref name=\"Sandra Halperin 1996 pp. 40, 41\"/>  These acquisitions were recognized by the international agreement with the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. The treaty gave Poland an eastern border well beyond what the peacemakers in Paris had envisioned, and added 4,000,000 Ukrainians, 2,000,000 Jews, and 1,000,000 Belarusians to Poland's minority population.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, \u2018\u2019Paris: 1919\u2019\u2019 (2001) p. 228.</ref>\n\nIn [[Soviet historiography]], the Polish-Soviet War was also referred to as \"the war against [[White (political adjective)|White]] Poles\", with epithet \"White Poles\" (''belopoliaki''<ref>{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=NAZm2EdxKqkC&pg=PA101 |page = 101|title = Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914-1921|author = Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev|isbn = 0253333334|year = 1997}}</ref>) alleging the \"counter-revolutionary\" character of Poland at the time, in an analogy with Russian [[White Movement]].\n\nIn 1922, in the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War and [[Polish-Lithuanian War]], Poland also officially annexed [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Central Lithuania]] following a [[plebiscite]], which was never recognised by Lithuania.\n\nThe Riga arrangement influenced the fate of the entire region for the years to come. Ukrainians and Belarusians found themselves without a country or province of their own, and [[Polish minority in the Soviet Union|some Polish speakers]] also found themselves within the borders of the [[Soviet Union]]. The latter experienced [[Collectivization in the USSR|forced collectivistion]], state terror, suppression of religion, [[Polish operation of the NKVD|purges]], labor camps and famine. The newly formed [[Second Polish Republic]], one third of whose citizens were non-ethnic Poles, engaged in promoting Polish identity, culture and language at the expense of the country's ethnic minorities who felt alienated by the process.\n\n==From democracy to authoritarian government==\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita 1938.svg|thumb|Poland during the interwar years.]]\nReborn Poland faced a host of daunting challenges: extensive war damage, a ravaged economy, a population one-third composed of wary [[national minorities]], an economy largely under control of German industrial interests, and a need to reintegrate the three zones that had been forcibly kept apart during the era of partition. Poland's formal political life began in 1921 with adoption of a [[March Constitution of Poland|constitution]] that designed Poland as a republic modeled after the [[French Third Republic]], vesting most authority in the legislature, the Sejm. This was mainly to prevent Pi\u0142sudski from establishing himself as a dictator. A multitude of political parties emerged, of which there were four major and dozens of minor ones. All had very different ideologies and voter bases, and could scarcely agree on any major issue. There had been no serious consideration of re-establishing a monarchy, and although the great Polish noble families continued to have their names mentioned in newspapers, it was mostly in the society pages.  The chief parties were the left-wing [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"|Polish Peasant Party]] (PSL) and on the right [[National Democracy]] party (ND) led by Dmowski.\n\n[[File:Poland1937linguistic.jpg|thumb|Poland, ethnic minorities (by language) 1937]]\nThe new, inexperienced government faced serious problems; already there was rampant corruption among government officials; a dizzying turnover of cabinets caused confusion and distrust.<ref>Watt, pp. 183-5.</ref>  At a deeper level there was profound disagreement about inclusiveness in the new state.  [[Roman Dmowski]] envisioned an ethnically-homogeneous Polish nation, and a pro-Western, anti-German path to modernization; he also espoused strong anti-Semitic attitudes, and emphasized that Poland should be a Catholic and hierarchical state.<ref>Piotr S. Wandycz, \"Poland's Place in Europe in the Concepts of Pi\u0142sudski and Dmowski,\" ''East European Politics & Societies'' (1990) 4#3 pp. 451-468.</ref><ref>Andreas Kossert, \"Founding Father of Modern Poland and Nationalistic Antisemite: Roman Dmowski,\" in ''In the Shadow of Hitler: Personalities of the Right in Central and Eastern Europe'' edited by Rebecca Haynes and Martyn Rady, (2011) pp. 89-105.</ref> Pi\u0142sudski, however, rooted his ideal in notions about the multi-ethnic [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].  In practice that meant ignoring the minority vote at home and seeking agreements with nearby countries. Universal suffrage gave the minorities a voice, especially when they formed a coalition, the [[Bloc of National Minorities]] (BMN) led by the Jews and including the others who together comprised a third of the population and 20% of the vote. However the districts were [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] to minimize minority representation. The BMN helped elect [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] as president on the PSL ticket in 1922, but he came under nasty attacks from the right and was assassinated after five days in office. The BMN coalition declined in significance and shut down in 1930 as the different groups cut their own deals with the government on isolated issues.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aviel Roshwald|title=Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914-23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ba97xyhIZDcC&pg=PA168|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=168|isbn=9780203187722}}</ref><ref>Davies, ''God's Playground'' 2:426.</ref>\n\n===Coup of 1926===\nAfter the constitution was adopted, Pi\u0142sudski resigned from office, unhappy with the limited role of the executive branch. But he continued to keep a close eye on political developments. The ineffectiveness of the Sejm led some of his inner circle to suggest that he launch a military coup and regain power; he said no. By 1926 he was persuaded and launched the coup of May 1926, which succeeded with little violence. For the next decade, Pi\u0142sudski dominated Polish affairs as [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] of a generally popular [[centrist]] regime, although he never held a formal title except for minister of defense. He retained the 1921 constitution, and the noisy, ineffective Sejm continued to operate, but it nearly always gave him what he wanted. Critics of the regime were occasionally arrested, but most were sued for libel. The marshal portrayed himself as a national saviour who was above partisan politics, and gained more popular support by distancing himself from the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. In 1935 a new [[Polish Constitution of 1935|Polish Constitution]] was adopted, but Pi\u0142sudski soon died and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 successors drifted toward open [[authoritarianism]]. Opposition voices were increasingly harassed or jailed, a situation that was not surprising in view of the regime's growing fears over national security.\n\nIn many respects, the Second Republic fell short of the high expectations of 1918. As happened elsewhere in [[Central Europe]], with the exception of [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], the attempt to implant democracy did not succeed. Governments polarized between right- and left-wing factions, neither of which was prepared to honor the actions taken by the other.<ref>Polonsky, Antony. (1972).

Overall, Poland had a higher degree of state involvement in the economy and less foreign investment than any other nation in eastern Europe. This emphasis on economic centralisation hampered Poland's development. The economy was largely rural, and the worldwide [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929 saw hardship in every sector. Worst hit were the peasants whose incomes plunged 50% or more. The government had few solutions except to reduce its own spending as tax revenues fell.<ref>Watt, ''Bitter Glory,'' pp. 293-96.</ref><ref>M. C. Kaser and E. A. Radice, eds., ''The Economic History of Eastern Europe 1919-1975: Volume II: Interwar Policy, The War, and Reconstruction'' (1987) ch. 8.</ref>\n\n====Minorities====\nAbout a third of the total population were members of minorities, including five or six million [[Ukrainians]], over three million [[Jews]], one and a half million [[Belarusians]], and some 800,000 [[Germans]].<ref>Peter D. Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945: An Interpretive and Documentary History of the Second Republic'' (Routledge 2004), p. 79.</ref> These minorities were increasingly alienated, complaining that they were marginalized in politics and denied rights Poland had agreed to in treaties. Historian [[Peter Stachura|Peter D. Stachura]] has examined the ethnic issue in interwar Poland and summarizes the consensus of historians, he writes:\n:\"It is undeniable that the Second Republic did not face any greater challenge than that of devising a policy towards the minorities that would bring harmony and peaceful coexistence rather than bitterness, confrontation and strife. The historiographical verdict is that Poland signally failed to address this question in a satisfactory manner. Indeed, the vast majority of historians have adopted a highly censorious attitude towards the multitude of policies and attitudes which were pursued towards the minorities by the state. Often influenced by Communist, Marxist, Soviet or liberal political and ideological perspectives, they refer unequivocally to 'oppression', 'persecution', 'terror', 'discrimination', even 'murder', as the salient characteristics of an intrinsically chauvinistic Polish approach that was designed to relegate the minorities to the status of second-class citizens. Such a situation, it is argued, meant that Poland failed repeatedly to respect the formal statutory guarantees which were introduced after 1918, notably through the Minorities' Treaty of 1919, the Treaty of Riga (Article VII) in 1921, and the Polish constitutions of 1921 and 1935.\"<ref>Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945'' (2004) p. 80.</ref>\n\nStachura himself thinks that historians have been too harsh in their negative judgment. He notes that Poland had to contend with \"an obstreperous and fundamentally disloyal German minority\" that was incited by \"fanatical\" German nationalists next door.  Poles talked of forced assimilation and seizure of industrial assets, but the governments before 1926 were too weak to carry them out. After 1926 Pi\u0142sudski had no interest in so doing.  The Germans in Poland had above-average incomes, had a full panoply of civic organizations and German-language schools, and were represented in the Sejm. A stalemate resulted. Their status became a major threat after Hitler came to power in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] in 1933, because \"the overwhelming majority of these Germans became ardent Nazis in the 1930s and a 'fifth column' when Poland was attacked in September 1939.\"<ref>Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945'' (2004), p. 82.</ref>\n\nRelations with the much larger Ukrainian minority, who formed 15% or so of the national population and were in the majority in several eastern provinces, were even more strained. The Ukrainians were poor peasants who resented their Polish landlords and the government's policy of [[Polonization|polonizing]] them. The schools after 1924 were bilingual (students had to learn Polish), and government offices were not allowed to use Ukrainian. Some Ukrainians tried sabotage, and the government cracked down with mass arrests; it tolerated Polish arson of Ukrainian community centers.  Orthodox churches were closed, especially in [[Volhynia]] province.  Some men went underground and tried to assassinate Ukrainians who collaborated with the government, as well as top Polish officials.  A compromise was reached in 1935 that somewhat quieted the situation, but the Polish Army saw a war with the USSR looming and refused to support the policy.<ref>Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945'' (2004), pp. 82-83.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Orest Subtelny|title=Ukraine: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktyM07I9HXwC&pg=PT389|year=2009|edition=4th|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=389\u201394|isbn=9781442697287}}</ref><ref>Davies, ''God's Playground,'' pp. 405-7.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] worsened in the 1930s,  [[antisemitism]] began to rise even though Poland was home to over three million Jews (10 per cent of Poland's population), the largest Jewish population in Europe at the time.

A Time of Crisis: 1929-1932.</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s the Polish government excluded Jews from receiving government bank credits, public sector employment, and obtaining business licenses. From the 1930s limits were placed on Jewish enrollment in university education, Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, [[Shechita]], Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations, etc. While in 1921-22 25% of students were Jews, by 1938-9 the proportion went down to 8%. The far-right [[National Democracy]] (Endeks) organized anti-Jewish boycotts. Following the death of Poland's ruler [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] in 1935, the Endeks intensified their efforts. In 1937 the Endeks passed resolutions that  \"its main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland\". The government in response organized the [[Camp of National Unity]] (OZON); OZON advocated mass emigration of Jews from Poland, boycott of Jews, [[Numerus clausus#Poland|numerus clausus]] (see also [[Ghetto benches]]), and other limitation on Jewish rights. At the same time the Polish government supported the [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Irgun]], training its members in [[Tatra Mountains]] and in 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the Jewish underground in Palestine, capable of arming up to 10,000 men.

Polish agriculture suffered from the usual handicaps of Eastern European nations: technological backwardness, low productivity, and lack of capital and access to markets. The former German areas in the west had better rainfall and soil quality and were the most productive, while the former Russian and Austrian areas were below-average. The Polish peasantry believed that it would be so much better if they owned their land and did not pay rents to a landowner. They endorsed [[agrarianism]] and called for land redistribution away from large estates to peasants. This was done and also many very small farms were consolidated into viable units.  Land reforms were undertaken along ethnic lines. In the west, Germans who had been made foreigners in 1919 quickly lost their land. In the east by contrast, Ukrainian and Belarusian peasants tilled for Polish landowners and no serious moves toward land redistribution were taken.  No alternative industrial jobs were developed and underemployment was high in rural areas.<ref>Richard Watt, ''Bitter Glory'' pp. 196-209.</ref><ref>Witold Staniewicz, \"The Agrarian Problem in Poland between the Two World Wars,\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' (1999) 43#100 pp. 23-33.

His practical experience as a farm manager combined with socialist, \"single-tax,\" and Slavic communal ideas shaped his worldview. He proposed a form of agrarian socialism with large state farms to counteract the inefficiency of very small holdings. In independent Poland, he advocated expropriation of gentry estates. His observation of peasant individualism convinced him that Poland should combine voluntary collectivism and individual possession of the leased land. His pragmatism left room even for private peasant ownership, despite his Marxism.<ref>K.J.

Poland with 35 million people had a large population but a thin industrial base; its war plans focused on the Soviet Union instead of Germany. Poland had long borders with two more powerful dictatorships, Hitler's Germany and Stalin's USSR. Poland was increasingly isolated. Overy says that of all the new states in Europe:\n:\"Poland was almost certainly the most disliked and her Foreign Minister the most distrusted.  Poland's pursuit of an independent line left her bereft of any close friends by the end of 1938\u2026.  The Western powers saw Poland as a greedy revisionist power, illiberal, anti-Semitic, pro-German; Beck was a 'menace,' 'arrogant and treacherous.'\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Overy |first1=Richard |title=The Road To War: The Origins of World War II |date=1989 |page=9}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1921, Poland signed a secret [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|military agreement with France]], which obliged each party to mutual aid in the event of German aggression. In March 1921, the Poles signed a treaty of [[Polish\u2013Romanian Alliance|mutual assistance with Romania]], directed against the threat from the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=Richard M. |title=Bitter Glory: Poland and its Fate, 1918-1939 |date=1982 |pages=178-179}}</ref>\n\nPoland sought to be the leader of an [[intermarium|independent bloc of nations]] between the Soviet Union and Germany that would unite to fend off those powers.  However, Poland ran into so many disputes with its smaller neighbors that it was never able to build a bloc. At first, France favored Poland, because France wanted an ally against Germany; if Germany faced a two-front war, it would be less likely to attack France. France was especially helpful at the 1919 Paris conference and in the 1920s when it resisted British efforts to weaken Poland. After 1935, however, France distrusted Beck and lost interest in Eastern Europe and Poland stood increasingly alone.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\n[[Locarno Treaties|In 1925]], Berlin formally recognized its post-1918 boundaries in the west with France, but not in the east with Poland.<ref name=\"Kochanski36\">Kochanski (2012), ''The Eagle Unbowed'', p. 36</ref><ref name=Cieciala/> The same year, Germany slashed coal imports from Poland by half, which triggered the [[German\u2013Polish customs war|German\u2013Polish trade war]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Zara S.

The limited defense budget allowed minimal mechanization; most weapons were produced in Poland, but the production rate was low ([[7TP]] tank is a prime example), and foreign exchange was scarce.\nThe fact that Poland was halfway through the rearming process that was to end in 1942 did not help. Ten divisions were never mobilized. The cancellation of the mobilization, under the pressure from France and Great Britain, and restarting the mobilization less than a week later created confusion.

In 1931 it developed the [[PZL P.11]], the most advanced fighter in the world of the early 1930s.  In the mid-1930s its successor the P-24 was even better armed and faster, but Poland exported it to earn currency, forcing the use of semi-obsolete [[PZL P.11]] and a couple dozen old PZL P.7 fighters.  They were no match against the German Messerschmitt 109 which could fly higher, was better armed, and flew 100 km/h faster. In spite of the shortcomings, at least 110 victories were credited to the P.11 for the loss of about 30 of their own. The [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] was an excellent twin-engine medium bomber; Poland had 36 ready-to-fight when the war started.  In 1939 Poland had 390 combat planes that were mostly obsolescent.

The Polish government had no choice, but to claim that an attack either by the Germans or by the Soviets would have been successfully repelled. The Polish government could not afford a capitulation of the Polish public because of the industrialization projects such as [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)]], nearly finished by early 1939,  and the projects that were to follow it.\n\n===Foreign policy 1935\u201339===\n{{main|J\u00f3zef Beck}}\nAfter the death of Pi\u0142sudski in May 1935, policies in Poland were set by five senior officials, including President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]]; Vice-President [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]]; the Premier, [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]]; and Marshal [[Edward Smigly-Rydz]], the Commander-in-Chief of the army.  Foreign policy was the exclusive domain of the Foreign Minister, Colonel [[J\u00f3zef Beck]]. Elections were held but there was no democracy and the Sejm was merely a rubber stamp.

At the end of March 1939, Britain and France announced that if Germany invaded Poland they would declare war. In terms of helping Poland in an actual war, everyone realized they could do very little. The hope was that the threat of a two-front war would deter Germany, especially since it had to worry about the role of the Soviet Union. Hitler thought Britain and France were bluffing, but he handled the Soviet problem in late August, by a stunning agreement with Stalin in what amounted to a friendly alliance, which included secret provisions to partition Poland\u2014and indeed divide up much of eastern Europe<ref>Richard Overy, ''The Road to War: the Origins of World War II'' (1989) pp. 1-20.</ref>  The British and French offer was not a bluff\u2014they declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland, but neither was in a position to provide serious help.

At the same time, the exact boundaries of the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not desired, though mentioned as an opening gambit by [[Roman Dmowski]]. Much of this land had been controlled by the Russian Empire since the Partitions of Poland and its inhabitants were struggling to create their own states (such as [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and the Baltics: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).

[[Lenin]], leader of the new communist government of Russia, saw Poland as the bridge over which communism would pass into the labor class of a disorganized postwar Germany. And the issue was further complicated as some of the disputed regions had assumed various economic and political identities since the partition in the late 18th century while some did not have an ethnically Polish majority in the first place they were still viewed by Poles as their historic regions, since they envisioned Poland as a multiethnic state. In the end, the negotiations broke down, sinking Pi\u0142sudski's idea of [[Mi\u0119dzymorze]] federation; instead, wars like the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] or the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] decided the borders of the region for the next two decades.\n\nThe [[Polish-Soviet war]], began in 1919, was the most important of the regional wars.  Pi\u0142sudski first carried out a [[Kiev Offensive|major military thrust]] into [[Ukraine]] in 1920 and in May Polish-Ukrainian forces reached Kiev. Just a few weeks later, however, the Polish offensive was met with a Soviet counter-offensive, and Polish forces were forced into a retreat by the [[Red Army]]. Poland was driven out of Ukraine and back into the Polish heartland.  Most observers at the time marked Poland for extinction and Bolshevization,<ref>Margaret MacMillan, ''Paris: 1919'' (2001) p. 227.</ref> However at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] Pi\u0142sudski organized a stunning counterattack that won a famous victory.<ref>Norman Davies, ''White Eagle, Red Star: The Polish-Soviet War 1919-1920 and The Miracle on the Vistula'' (2003) pp. 188-225.</ref> This \"Miracle on the Vistula\" became an iconic victory in Polish memory. Pi\u0142sudski resumed the offensive, pushing the Red forces east. Eventually both sides, exhausted, signed [[Treaty of Riga|a compromise peace treaty at Riga]] in early 1921 that divided the disputed territories of [[Belarus]] and Ukraine between the two combatants.<ref name=\"Sandra Halperin 1996 pp. 40, 41\"/>  These acquisitions were recognized by the international agreement with the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. The treaty gave Poland an eastern border well beyond what the peacemakers in Paris had envisioned, and added 4,000,000 Ukrainians, 2,000,000 Jews, and 1,000,000 Belarusians to Poland's minority population.<ref>Margaret MacMillan, \u2018\u2019Paris: 1919\u2019\u2019 (2001) p. 228.</ref>\n\nIn [[Soviet historiography]], the Polish-Soviet War was also referred to as \"the war against [[White (political adjective)|White]] Poles\", with epithet \"White Poles\" (''belopoliaki''<ref>{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=NAZm2EdxKqkC&pg=PA101 |page = 101|title = Critical Companion to the Russian Revolution, 1914-1921|author = Vladimir Iu. Cherniaev|isbn = 0253333334|year = 1997}}</ref>) alleging the \"counter-revolutionary\" character of Poland at the time, in an analogy with Russian [[White Movement]].\n\nIn 1922, in the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War and [[Polish-Lithuanian War]], Poland also officially annexed [[Republic of Central Lithuania|Central Lithuania]] following a [[plebiscite]], which was never recognised by Lithuania.\n\nThe Riga arrangement influenced the fate of the entire region for the years to come. Ukrainians and Belarusians found themselves without a country or province of their own, and [[Polish minority in the Soviet Union|some Polish speakers]] also found themselves within the borders of the [[Soviet Union]]. The latter experienced [[Collectivization in the USSR|forced collectivistion]], state terror, suppression of religion, [[Polish operation of the NKVD|purges]], labor camps and famine. The newly formed [[Second Polish Republic]], one third of whose citizens were non-ethnic Poles, engaged in promoting Polish identity, culture and language at the expense of the country's ethnic minorities who felt alienated by the process.\n\n==From democracy to authoritarian government==\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita 1938.svg|thumb|Poland during the interwar years.]]\nReborn Poland faced a host of daunting challenges: extensive war damage, a ravaged economy, a population one-third composed of wary [[national minorities]], an economy largely under control of German industrial interests, and a need to reintegrate the three zones that had been forcibly kept apart during the era of partition. Poland's formal political life began in 1921 with adoption of a [[March Constitution of Poland|constitution]] that designed Poland as a republic modeled after the [[French Third Republic]], vesting most authority in the legislature, the Sejm. This was mainly to prevent Pi\u0142sudski from establishing himself as a dictator. A multitude of political parties emerged, of which there were four major and dozens of minor ones. All had very different ideologies and voter bases, and could scarcely agree on any major issue. There had been no serious consideration of re-establishing a monarchy, and although the great Polish noble families continued to have their names mentioned in newspapers, it was mostly in the society pages.  The chief parties were the left-wing [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"|Polish Peasant Party]] (PSL) and on the right [[National Democracy]] party (ND) led by Dmowski.\n\n[[File:Poland1937linguistic.jpg|thumb|Poland, ethnic minorities (by language) 1937]]\nThe new, inexperienced government faced serious problems; already there was rampant corruption among government officials; a dizzying turnover of cabinets caused confusion and distrust.<ref>Watt, pp. 183-5.</ref>  At a deeper level there was profound disagreement about inclusiveness in the new state.  [[Roman Dmowski]] envisioned an ethnically-homogeneous Polish nation, and a pro-Western, anti-German path to modernization; he also espoused strong anti-Semitic attitudes, and emphasized that Poland should be a Catholic and hierarchical state.<ref>Piotr S.

In practice that meant ignoring the minority vote at home and seeking agreements with nearby countries. Universal suffrage gave the minorities a voice, especially when they formed a coalition, the [[Bloc of National Minorities]] (BMN) led by the Jews and including the others who together comprised a third of the population and 20% of the vote. However the districts were [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] to minimize minority representation. The BMN helped elect [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] as president on the PSL ticket in 1922, but he came under nasty attacks from the right and was assassinated after five days in office. The BMN coalition declined in significance and shut down in 1930 as the different groups cut their own deals with the government on isolated issues.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aviel Roshwald|title=Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914-23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ba97xyhIZDcC&pg=PA168|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|page=168|isbn=9780203187722}}</ref><ref>Davies, ''God's Playground'' 2:426.</ref>\n\n===Coup of 1926===\nAfter the constitution was adopted, Pi\u0142sudski resigned from office, unhappy with the limited role of the executive branch. But he continued to keep a close eye on political developments. The ineffectiveness of the Sejm led some of his inner circle to suggest that he launch a military coup and regain power; he said no. By 1926 he was persuaded and launched the coup of May 1926, which succeeded with little violence. For the next decade, Pi\u0142sudski dominated Polish affairs as [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] of a generally popular [[centrist]] regime, although he never held a formal title except for minister of defense. He retained the 1921 constitution, and the noisy, ineffective Sejm continued to operate, but it nearly always gave him what he wanted. Critics of the regime were occasionally arrested, but most were sued for libel. The marshal portrayed himself as a national saviour who was above partisan politics, and gained more popular support by distancing himself from the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. In 1935 a new [[Polish Constitution of 1935|Polish Constitution]] was adopted, but Pi\u0142sudski soon died and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 successors drifted toward open [[authoritarianism]]. Opposition voices were increasingly harassed or jailed, a situation that was not surprising in view of the regime's growing fears over national security.\n\nIn many respects, the Second Republic fell short of the high expectations of 1918. As happened elsewhere in [[Central Europe]], with the exception of [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], the attempt to implant democracy did not succeed. Governments polarized between right- and left-wing factions, neither of which was prepared to honor the actions taken by the other.<ref>Polonsky, Antony. (1972).

Greenwood.</ref>\n\n===Economic and social problems===\nSerious difficulties arose in dealing with foreign assets and internal minorities.\n\nThe government nationalized foreign-owned assets and operated them because there was insufficient domestic capital to buy them, and because it was easier than determining who should get what. Overall, Poland had a higher degree of state involvement in the economy and less foreign investment than any other nation in eastern Europe. This emphasis on economic centralisation hampered Poland's development. The economy was largely rural, and the worldwide [[Great Depression]] that began in 1929 saw hardship in every sector. Worst hit were the peasants whose incomes plunged 50% or more. The government had few solutions except to reduce its own spending as tax revenues fell.<ref>Watt, ''Bitter Glory,'' pp. 293-96.</ref><ref>M. C. Kaser and E. A. Radice, eds., ''The Economic History of Eastern Europe 1919-1975: Volume II: Interwar Policy, The War, and Reconstruction'' (1987) ch. 8.</ref>\n\n====Minorities====\nAbout a third of the total population were members of minorities, including five or six million [[Ukrainians]], over three million [[Jews]], one and a half million [[Belarusians]], and some 800,000 [[Germans]].<ref>Peter D. Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945: An Interpretive and Documentary History of the Second Republic'' (Routledge 2004), p. 79.</ref> These minorities were increasingly alienated, complaining that they were marginalized in politics and denied rights Poland had agreed to in treaties. Historian [[Peter Stachura|Peter D. Stachura]] has examined the ethnic issue in interwar Poland and summarizes the consensus of historians, he writes:\n:\"It is undeniable that the Second Republic did not face any greater challenge than that of devising a policy towards the minorities that would bring harmony and peaceful coexistence rather than bitterness, confrontation and strife. The historiographical verdict is that Poland signally failed to address this question in a satisfactory manner. Indeed, the vast majority of historians have adopted a highly censorious attitude towards the multitude of policies and attitudes which were pursued towards the minorities by the state. Often influenced by Communist, Marxist, Soviet or liberal political and ideological perspectives, they refer unequivocally to 'oppression', 'persecution', 'terror', 'discrimination', even 'murder', as the salient characteristics of an intrinsically chauvinistic Polish approach that was designed to relegate the minorities to the status of second-class citizens. Such a situation, it is argued, meant that Poland failed repeatedly to respect the formal statutory guarantees which were introduced after 1918, notably through the Minorities' Treaty of 1919, the Treaty of Riga (Article VII) in 1921, and the Polish constitutions of 1921 and 1935.\"<ref>Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945'' (2004) p. 80.</ref>\n\nStachura himself thinks that historians have been too harsh in their negative judgment. He notes that Poland had to contend with \"an obstreperous and fundamentally disloyal German minority\" that was incited by \"fanatical\" German nationalists next door.  Poles talked of forced assimilation and seizure of industrial assets, but the governments before 1926 were too weak to carry them out. After 1926 Pi\u0142sudski had no interest in so doing.  The Germans in Poland had above-average incomes, had a full panoply of civic organizations and German-language schools, and were represented in the Sejm. A stalemate resulted. Their status became a major threat after Hitler came to power in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]] in 1933, because \"the overwhelming majority of these Germans became ardent Nazis in the 1930s and a 'fifth column' when Poland was attacked in September 1939.\"<ref>Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945'' (2004), p. 82.</ref>\n\nRelations with the much larger Ukrainian minority, who formed 15% or so of the national population and were in the majority in several eastern provinces, were even more strained. The Ukrainians were poor peasants who resented their Polish landlords and the government's policy of [[Polonization|polonizing]] them. The schools after 1924 were bilingual (students had to learn Polish), and government offices were not allowed to use Ukrainian. Some Ukrainians tried sabotage, and the government cracked down with mass arrests; it tolerated Polish arson of Ukrainian community centers.  Orthodox churches were closed, especially in [[Volhynia]] province.  Some men went underground and tried to assassinate Ukrainians who collaborated with the government, as well as top Polish officials.  A compromise was reached in 1935 that somewhat quieted the situation, but the Polish Army saw a war with the USSR looming and refused to support the policy.<ref>Stachura, ''Poland, 1918-1945'' (2004), pp. 82-83.</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Orest Subtelny|title=Ukraine: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktyM07I9HXwC&pg=PT389|year=2009|edition=4th|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=389\u201394|isbn=9781442697287}}</ref><ref>Davies, ''God's Playground,'' pp. 405-7.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] worsened in the 1930s,  [[antisemitism]] began to rise even though Poland was home to over three million Jews (10 per cent of Poland's population), the largest Jewish population in Europe at the time. The impoverished Jewish families relied on their own local charities, which by 1929 had reached unprecedented proportions, providing services such as religion, education, health and other services to the value of 200 million [[z\u0142oty]] a year,<ref>Joseph Marcus, [https://books.google.com/books?id=82ncGA4GuN4C  ''Social and political history of the Jews in Poland, 1919-1939''], p. 47.</ref> thanks in part to Jewish ''[[per capita]]'' income among the working Jews more than 40% higher than that of Polish non-Jews.<ref>[[Yehuda Bauer]]: A History of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee 1929-1939'' (1983) Chapter 1. A Time of Crisis: 1929-1932.</ref>\n\nFrom the 1920s the Polish government excluded Jews from receiving government bank credits, public sector employment, and obtaining business licenses. From the 1930s limits were placed on Jewish enrollment in university education, Jewish shops, Jewish export firms, [[Shechita]], Jewish admission to the medical and legal professions, Jews in business associations, etc. While in 1921-22 25% of students were Jews, by 1938-9 the proportion went down to 8%. The far-right [[National Democracy]] (Endeks) organized anti-Jewish boycotts. Following the death of Poland's ruler [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] in 1935, the Endeks intensified their efforts. In 1937 the Endeks passed resolutions that  \"its main aim and duty must be to remove the Jews from all spheres of social, economic, and cultural life in Poland\". The government in response organized the [[Camp of National Unity]] (OZON); OZON advocated mass emigration of Jews from Poland, boycott of Jews, [[Numerus clausus#Poland|numerus clausus]] (see also [[Ghetto benches]]), and other limitation on Jewish rights. At the same time the Polish government supported the [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[Irgun]], training its members in [[Tatra Mountains]] and in 1937 the Polish authorities began to deliver large amounts of weapons to the Jewish underground in Palestine, capable of arming up to 10,000 men.

Polish agriculture suffered from the usual handicaps of Eastern European nations: technological backwardness, low productivity, and lack of capital and access to markets. The former German areas in the west had better rainfall and soil quality and were the most productive, while the former Russian and Austrian areas were below-average. The Polish peasantry believed that it would be so much better if they owned their land and did not pay rents to a landowner. They endorsed [[agrarianism]] and called for land redistribution away from large estates to peasants. This was done and also many very small farms were consolidated into viable units.  Land reforms were undertaken along ethnic lines. In the west, Germans who had been made foreigners in 1919 quickly lost their land. In the east by contrast, Ukrainian and Belarusian peasants tilled for Polish landowners and no serious moves toward land redistribution were taken.  No alternative industrial jobs were developed and underemployment was high in rural areas.<ref>Richard Watt, ''Bitter Glory'' pp. 196-209.</ref><ref>Witold Staniewicz, \"The Agrarian Problem in Poland between the Two World Wars,\" ''Slavonic & East European Review'' (1999) 43#100 pp. 23-33.

His practical experience as a farm manager combined with socialist, \"single-tax,\" and Slavic communal ideas shaped his worldview. He proposed a form of agrarian socialism with large state farms to counteract the inefficiency of very small holdings. In independent Poland, he advocated expropriation of gentry estates. His observation of peasant individualism convinced him that Poland should combine voluntary collectivism and individual possession of the leased land. His pragmatism left room even for private peasant ownership, despite his Marxism.<ref>K.J.

Poland with 35 million people had a large population but a thin industrial base; its war plans focused on the Soviet Union instead of Germany. Poland had long borders with two more powerful dictatorships, Hitler's Germany and Stalin's USSR. Poland was increasingly isolated. Overy says that of all the new states in Europe:\n:\"Poland was almost certainly the most disliked and her Foreign Minister the most distrusted.  Poland's pursuit of an independent line left her bereft of any close friends by the end of 1938\u2026.  The Western powers saw Poland as a greedy revisionist power, illiberal, anti-Semitic, pro-German; Beck was a 'menace,' 'arrogant and treacherous.'\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Overy |first1=Richard |title=The Road To War: The Origins of World War II |date=1989 |page=9}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1921, Poland signed a secret [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)|military agreement with France]], which obliged each party to mutual aid in the event of German aggression. In March 1921, the Poles signed a treaty of [[Polish\u2013Romanian Alliance|mutual assistance with Romania]], directed against the threat from the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Watt |first1=Richard M. |title=Bitter Glory: Poland and its Fate, 1918-1939 |date=1982 |pages=178-179}}</ref>\n\nPoland sought to be the leader of an [[intermarium|independent bloc of nations]] between the Soviet Union and Germany that would unite to fend off those powers.  However, Poland ran into so many disputes with its smaller neighbors that it was never able to build a bloc. At first, France favored Poland, because France wanted an ally against Germany; if Germany faced a two-front war, it would be less likely to attack France. France was especially helpful at the 1919 Paris conference and in the 1920s when it resisted British efforts to weaken Poland. After 1935, however, France distrusted Beck and lost interest in Eastern Europe and Poland stood increasingly alone.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\n[[Locarno Treaties|In 1925]], Berlin formally recognized its post-1918 boundaries in the west with France, but not in the east with Poland.<ref name=\"Kochanski36\">Kochanski (2012), ''The Eagle Unbowed'', p. 36</ref><ref name=Cieciala/> The same year, Germany slashed coal imports from Poland by half, which triggered the [[German\u2013Polish customs war|German\u2013Polish trade war]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Zara S.

The limited defense budget allowed minimal mechanization; most weapons were produced in Poland, but the production rate was low ([[7TP]] tank is a prime example), and foreign exchange was scarce.\nThe fact that Poland was halfway through the rearming process that was to end in 1942 did not help. Ten divisions were never mobilized. The cancellation of the mobilization, under the pressure from France and Great Britain, and restarting the mobilization less than a week later created confusion.  Moreover, not only did the [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation#1939 September Campaign|German military]] and [[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz|civilian volunteers]] commit war crimes against the ethnic Poles and Polish Jews, they spread rumors of massive ethnic cleansing which lead thousands of people to flee the German advance and made military maneuver difficult.<ref>Walter M.

In 1931 it developed the [[PZL P.11]], the most advanced fighter in the world of the early 1930s.  In the mid-1930s its successor the P-24 was even better armed and faster, but Poland exported it to earn currency, forcing the use of semi-obsolete [[PZL P.11]] and a couple dozen old PZL P.7 fighters.  They were no match against the German Messerschmitt 109 which could fly higher, was better armed, and flew 100 km/h faster. In spite of the shortcomings, at least 110 victories were credited to the P.11 for the loss of about 30 of their own. The [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] was an excellent twin-engine medium bomber; Poland had 36 ready-to-fight when the war started.  In 1939 Poland had 390 combat planes that were mostly obsolescent. Germany had 2800 new fighter planes plus bombers and transports.<ref>Halik Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed'' p. 54.</ref><ref>Adam Zamoyski, ''The Forgotten Few: The Polish Air Force in the Second World War'' (2000) ch 1-3 [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0781804213/ excerpt and text search]</ref>\n\nThe Poles, in spite of their desperate situation, managed to win two battles against the invading Soviets,  including [[Battles of Parczew, Jab\u0142o\u0144 and Milan\u00f3w|one]] where the Soviet infantry was charging the Polish positions marching shoulder to shoulder, making them into an extremely easy target to the machine guns, and some of the Soviet POW's switched sides to the Polish.\n\nPoles broke the early diplomatic version of  [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher and transferred the results to France and United Kingdom.\n\nIn spite of its shortcomings, the Polish military can easily be ranked in the top 10 strongest national militaries as of 1939; not because the Polish military was so great, but because other national military forces were so weak and backward. Zaloga and Madej point out, in \"The Polish Campaign 1939\" that Poland had one of the largest tank forces on Earth, as of 1939 bigger than the task force of the USA.<ref>Steven Zaloga and Victor Madej, The Polish Campaign 1939 Hardcover \u2013 March 1985.</ref>\n\nThe relative strength of the Polish armed forces and the fear of the Polish military might be shown by Lithuania ([[1938 Polish ultimatum to Lithuania]]) made the Polish government's propaganda believable to the public. The Polish government had no choice, but to claim that an attack either by the Germans or by the Soviets would have been successfully repelled. The Polish government could not afford a capitulation of the Polish public because of the industrialization projects such as [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)]], nearly finished by early 1939,  and the projects that were to follow it.\n\n===Foreign policy 1935\u201339===\n{{main|J\u00f3zef Beck}}\nAfter the death of Pi\u0142sudski in May 1935, policies in Poland were set by five senior officials, including President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]]; Vice-President [[Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski]]; the Premier, [[Felicjan S\u0142awoj Sk\u0142adkowski]]; and Marshal [[Edward Smigly-Rydz]], the Commander-in-Chief of the army.  Foreign policy was the exclusive domain of the Foreign Minister, Colonel [[J\u00f3zef Beck]]. Elections were held but there was no democracy and the Sejm was merely a rubber stamp.  Watt notes that these men had emerged victorious from their struggles for independence and had never known conquest.  \"Courage, flair, heroism, devouring ambition, all these they had in abundance; realism and worst-case analysis, let alone defeatism or appeasement, were alien to them entirely.\"<ref>Donald Cameron Watt, ''How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War 1938-1939'' (1989) p. 58.</ref>\n\nPoland's dream of leading a bloc of neutral nations in Eastern Europe collapsed after 1933 with the advent of Hitler's openly expansionist [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime in Germany and the obvious waning of France's desire to resist Germany's expansion. Pi\u0142sudski retained the French connection but had progressively less faith in its usefulness. Hitler's long-term goals included annexing Polish territories and subordinating the remaining parts of Poland, an idea that he revealed to his closest circle already in 1933<ref>Diemut Majer, ''Non-Germans Under the Third Reich: The Nazi Judicial and Administrative System in Germany and Occupied Eastern Europe with Special Regard to Occupied Poland, 1939-1945'' says \"As early as the fall of 1933 Hitler had laid out before his most intimate circle his concept of a future Europe from the Atlantic to the Caucasus.

Accordingly, the Polish leadership rejected German proposals of cooperation against Russia.

Germany also pressed for the incorporation of Danzig, a Nazi ruled city-state with a 90% German population that had been separated from Germany in 1920 and functioning as a [[Free City of Danzig|Free City]] in a [[customs union]] with Poland ever since.<ref>For early German propaganda calling for the return of the corridor and Danzig to Germany, see Anna M.

Poland was at the time allied with Romania and France.\n\nTwo critical developments caught Poland by surprise.  At the end of March 1939, Britain and France announced that if Germany invaded Poland they would declare war. In terms of helping Poland in an actual war, everyone realized they could do very little. The hope was that the threat of a two-front war would deter Germany, especially since it had to worry about the role of the Soviet Union. Hitler thought Britain and France were bluffing, but he handled the Soviet problem in late August, by a stunning agreement with Stalin in what amounted to a friendly alliance, which included secret provisions to partition Poland\u2014and indeed divide up much of eastern Europe<ref>Richard Overy, ''The Road to War: the Origins of World War II'' (1989) pp. 1-20.</ref>  The British and French offer was not a bluff\u2014they declared war on Germany when it invaded Poland, but neither was in a position to provide serious help.  Poland itself had a million-man army (and another million in the reserves), but fell far short in terms of training, air power, artillery, tanks, machine guns, radios, and trucks. The Polish military budget was about 2% of Germany's; its commanding general Marshal Smigly-Rydz was not well prepared for the challenge.<ref>Kochanski, ''The Eagle Unbowed'' (2012) p. 52.</ref>\n\n===Polish Corridor and Danzig===\nThe Germans wanted restoration of the pre-Versailles Treaty borders and so they launched new demands on Poland.<ref>[[William L.

In 1925, he became Commandant of the 6th Military District ([[Tasmania]]). He was promoted to  full colonel in 1926 and became commandant of the 5th Military District ([[Western Australia]]) in August 1927. He was promoted to brigadier in January 1929 and was [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Governor General of Australia|Governor General]] from 1931 to 1935. Jess was involved in organising the centennial celebrations in Western Australia and then in 1933 in Victoria. For this he was created a [[Knight Bachelor]] in the 1935 New Year's List.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34135|date=22 February 1935|page=1269}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1934, Jess was appointed adjutant general, and became a member of the Military Board. He was promoted to the rank of major general in July 1935.\n\n==Second World War==\nWith the outbreak of the Second World War, Jess was awarded the [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in June 1939,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=34633|date=8 June 1939|page=3854|supp=y}}</ref> and promoted to lieutenant general on 12 December 1939. As Adjutant General, Jess had been appointed chairman of the Department of Defence's Manpower Committee in September 1938 and was responsible for greatly increasing the size of the militia. he relinquished this post to Major General [[Thomas Blamey|Blamey]]. When Blamey was appointed to command the [[Australian 6th Division|6th Division]] in September 1939, Jess transferred from Adjutant General to this post.\n\nJess retained the post until March 1944. He became Director of Women's National Services (AWAS) in 1943 and organised the [[Australian Women's Land Army]]. With a strength of over 3,000, this organisation employed women on jobs throughout Australia.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter leaving the Department of Labour and National Service in March 1944, Jess became involved in a survey and classification of Army records, compiling a report of the activities of the AMF from 1929 to 1939. His work was unfinished when he went on sick leave in July 1945. On 1 April 1946 he was placed on the retired list. He died at the [[Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital]] in Melbourne on 16 June 1948 and was cremated with full military honours.\n\nJess was also a prolific artist; when he joined the Victorian Volunteer Cadets in 1899, he started making artworks of the uniforms of various units. Shortly before his death, Jess' watercolour paintings of 19th- and 20th-century Australian and British military uniforms were purchased by the [[Australian War Memorial]] in [[Canberra]]. His hand carved and painted models of military figures were exhibited and housed at the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]].<ref name=Clark/> They were subsequently shown at the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] in Melbourne and are now in private collections in Melbourne.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Austin|first=Ronald J.|title=A Soldier's Soldier: A Life of Lieutenant General Sir Carl Herman Jess|year=2001|place=McCrae, Victoria|publisher=Slouch Hat Publications|isbn=0958529612}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |author=Mallett,  Ross |url=http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~rmallett/Generals/index.html |title=Carl Jess |work=General Officers of the First AIF |publisher=[[Australian Defence Force Academy]] |year= |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304021921/http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~rmallett/Generals/index.html |archive-date=4 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}\n\n{{Australian Generals of World War I}}\n{{Australian Generals of World War II}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jess, Carl}}\n[[Category:1884 births]]\n[[Category:1948 deaths]]\n[[Category:Australian generals]]\n[[Category:Australian military personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Australian military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:Australian Commanders of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Australian Companions of the Distinguished Service Order]]\n[[Category:Australian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George]]\n[[Category:Australian Companions of the Order of the Bath]]\n[[Category:Knights Bachelor]]\n[[Category:People from Bendigo]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)]]\n[[Category:Australian people of German descent]]\n", "name_user": "Ejess", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jess"}

Within Parson's lifetime, the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times,{{sfn|Parsons|1911}} and the total output from turbo-generators constructed by his firm [[C. A. Parsons and Company]] and by their licensees, for land purposes alone, had exceeded thirty million horse-power.<ref name=\"birrcastle.com\"/>\n\nA number of other variations of turbines have been developed that work effectively with steam. The ''de Laval turbine'' (invented by [[Gustaf de Laval]]) accelerated the steam to full speed before running it against a turbine blade.  De Laval's [[Steam turbine#Impulse turbines|impulse turbine]] is simpler, less expensive and does not need to be pressure-proof. It can operate with any pressure of steam, but is considerably less efficient.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Auguste Rateau]] developed a pressure compounded impulse turbine using the de Laval principle as early as 1896,{{sfn|Giampaolo|2014|p=9}} obtained a US patent in 1903, and applied the turbine to a French torpedo boat in 1904.  He taught at the \u00c9cole des mines de Saint-\u00c9tienne for a decade until 1897, and later founded a successful company that was incorporated into the [[Alstom]] firm after his death.  One of the founders of the modern theory of steam and gas turbines was [[Aurel Stodola]], a Slovak physicist and engineer and professor at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute (now [[ETH]]) in Zurich. His work ''Die Dampfturbinen und ihre Aussichten als W\u00e4rmekraftmaschinen'' (English: The Steam Turbine and its prospective use as a Heat Engine) was published in Berlin in 1903. A further book ''Dampf und Gas-Turbinen'' (English: Steam and Gas Turbines) was published in 1922.{{sfn|Stodola|2013}}\n\nThe ''Brown-Curtis turbine'', an [[#Impulse turbines|impulse]] type, which had been originally developed and patented by the U.S. company International Curtis Marine Turbine Company, was developed in the 1900s in conjunction with [[John Brown & Company]]. It was used in John Brown-engined merchant ships and warships, including liners and Royal Navy warships.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe present-day manufacturing industry for steam turbines is dominated by Chinese power equipment makers.

There are several classifications for modern steam turbines.\n\n===Blade and stage design===\n[[File:Turbines impulse v reaction.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Schematic diagram outlining the difference between an impulse and a 50% reaction turbine]]\n\nTurbine blades are of two basic types, blades and [[nozzles]]. Blades move entirely due to the impact of steam on them and their profiles do not converge. This results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades. A turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an [[Impulse turbines|impulse turbine]], {{visible anchor|Curtis turbine}}, [[Pressure compounding in turbines|Rateau turbine]], or [[#History|Brown-Curtis turbine]]. Nozzles appear similar to blades, but their profiles converge near the exit. This results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles. Nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit. A turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a [[Reaction turbine|reaction turbine]] or [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons turbine]].\n\nExcept for low-power applications, turbine blades are arranged in multiple stages in series, called [[Compounding of steam turbines|compounding]], which greatly improves [[#Turbine efficiency|efficiency]] at low speeds.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=7-8}} A reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles. Multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops, resulting in a '''pressure-compounded''' turbine. Impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded, velocity-compounded, or pressure-velocity compounded. A pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades, with multiple stages for compounding. This is also known as a Rateau turbine, after its inventor. A '''velocity-compounded''' impulse stage (invented by Curtis and also called a \"Curtis wheel\") is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades. This divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=20-22}} A series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a '''pressure-velocity compounded''' turbine.\n\n[[File:AEG marine steam turbine (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Diagram of an AEG marine steam turbine circa 1905]]\n\nBy 1905, when steam turbines were coming into use on fast ships (such as {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}) and in land-based power applications, it had been determined that it was desirable to use one or more Curtis wheels at the beginning of a multi-stage turbine (where the steam pressure is highest), followed by reaction stages. This was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=23-25}} This is illustrated in the drawing of the German 1905 [[AEG]] marine steam turbine. The steam from the [[boiler]]s enters from the right at high pressure through a [[throttle]], controlled manually by an operator (in this case a [[sailor]] known as the throttleman). It passes through five Curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages (the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle) before exiting at low pressure, almost certainly to a [[surface condenser|condenser]]. The condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam, and condenses the steam into [[boiler feedwater|feedwater]] to be returned to the boilers. On the left are several additional reaction stages (on two large rotors) that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation, with steam admitted by a separate throttle. Since ships are rarely operated in reverse, efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines, so only a few stages are used to save cost.\n\n===Blade design challenges===\nA major challenge facing turbine design was reducing the [[creep (deformation)|creep]] experienced by the blades. Because of the high temperatures and high stresses of operation, steam turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes  significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and [[superalloy]]s with solid-solution strengthening and [[grain boundary strengthening]] are used in blade designs.\n\nProtective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit [[oxidation]]. These coatings are often stabilized [[zirconium dioxide]]-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment.{{sfn|Tamarin|2002|p=5\u2013}}\n\nThe nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The [[microstructure]] of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase \u2013 a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium \u2013 promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure.{{sfn|Bhadeshia|2003}}\n\n[[Refractory]] elements such as [[rhenium]] and [[ruthenium]] can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance, strength, and creep resistance.{{sfn|Latief|Kakehi|2013}}\n\n===Steam supply and exhaust conditions===\n[[File:BalNPP m st2.jpg|thumb|A low-pressure steam turbine in a nuclear power plant. These turbines exhaust steam at a pressure below atmospheric.]]\n\nTurbine types include condensing, non-condensing, reheat, extraction and induction.\n\nCondensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants. These turbines receive steam from a [[boiler]] and exhaust it to a [[surface condenser|condenser]]. The exhausted steam is at a pressure well below atmospheric, and is in a partially condensed state, typically of a [[steam quality|quality]] near 90%.\n\nNon-condensing or back pressure turbines are most widely used for process steam applications, in which the steam will be used for additional purposes after being exhausted from the turbine. The exhaust pressure is controlled by a regulating valve to suit the needs of the process steam pressure. These are commonly found at refineries, district heating units, pulp and paper plants, and [[desalination]] facilities where large amounts of low pressure process steam are needed.\n\nReheat turbines are also used almost exclusively in electrical power plants. In a reheat turbine, steam flow exits from a high-pressure section of the turbine and is returned to the boiler where additional superheat is added. The steam then goes back into an intermediate pressure section of the turbine and continues its expansion. Using reheat in a cycle increases the work output from the turbine and also the expansion reaches conclusion before the steam condenses, thereby minimizing the erosion of the blades in last rows. In most of the cases, maximum number of reheats employed in a cycle is 2 as the cost of super-heating the steam negates the increase in the work output from turbine.\n\nExtracting type turbines are common in all applications. In an extracting type turbine, steam is released from various stages of the turbine, and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler [[feedwater heater]]s to improve overall cycle efficiency.  Extraction flows may be controlled with a valve, or left uncontrolled. Extracted steam results in a [[power loss factor|loss of power]] in the downstream stages of the turbine.\n\nInduction turbines introduce low pressure steam at an intermediate stage to produce additional power.\n\n===Casing or shaft arrangements===\nThese arrangements include single casing, tandem compound and cross compound turbines. Single casing units are the most basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator. Tandem compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator. A cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds. A cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications. A typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below; this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear, with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine.\n\n[[File:Starboard turbine sets of Furutaka and Aoba class cruisers.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Starboard steam turbine machinery arrangement of Japanese ''Furutaka''- and ''Aoba''-class cruisers.]]\n\n===Two-flow rotors===\n[[File:Turbine Philippsburg-1.jpg|thumb|A two-flow turbine rotor. The steam enters in the middle of the shaft, and exits at each end, balancing the axial force.]]\n\nThe moving steam imparts both a tangential and axial thrust on the turbine shaft, but the axial thrust in a simple turbine is unopposed. To maintain the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an opposing force. [[Thrust bearings]] can be used for the shaft bearings, the rotor can use dummy pistons, it can be '''double flow'''- the steam enters in the middle of the shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a '''double flow''' rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called '''two-flow''', '''double-axial-flow''', or '''double-exhaust'''. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine.<ref name=\"phdengineer\">{{cite web |title=Steam Turbines (Course No. M-3006) |url=http://www.pdhengineer.com/Course%20Files/Completed%20Course%20PDF%20Files/Mechanical/Steam%20Turbines.pdf |accessdate=2011-09-22 |publisher=PhD Engineer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402185518/http://www.pdhengineer.com/Course%20Files/Completed%20Course%20PDF%20Files/Mechanical/Steam%20Turbines.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Principle of operation and design==\nAn ideal steam turbine is considered to be an [[isentropic process]], or constant entropy process, in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine. No steam turbine is truly isentropic, however, with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20\u201390% based on the application of the turbine. The interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or ''buckets''. One set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft. The sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances, with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage.\n\nPractical thermal efficiency of a steam turbine varies with turbine size, load condition, gap losses and friction losses. They reach top values up to about 50% in a {{convert|1200|MW|abbr=on}} turbine; smaller ones have a lower efficiency.{{Citation needed |date=September 2016}} To maximize turbine efficiency the steam is expanded, doing work, in a number of stages. These stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines. Most steam turbines use a mixture of the reaction and impulse designs: each stage behaves as either one or the other, but the overall turbine uses both. Typically, lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher pressure stages are impulse type.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Impulse turbines===\n[[File:TurbineBlades.jpg|border|thumb|A selection of impulse turbine blades]]\n\nAn impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets. These jets contain significant kinetic energy,  which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades, as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades, with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage.\nAs the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure (atmospheric pressure, or more usually, the condenser vacuum). Due to this high ratio of expansion of steam, the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity. The steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle. The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss.\n\nThe law of [[angular momentum|moment of momentum]] states that the sum of the moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the [[control volume]] is equal to the net time change of angular momentum flux through the control volume.\n\nThe swirling fluid enters the control volume at radius <math>r_1</math> with tangential velocity <math>V_{w1}</math> and leaves at radius <math>r_2</math> with tangential velocity <math>V_{w2}</math>.\n\n[[File:Edited blade design 1.png|border|alt=Velocity triangles at the inlet and outlet on the blades of a turbo-machine.|thumb|Velocity triangle]]\n\nA [[velocity triangle]] paves the way for a better understanding of the relationship between the various velocities.

Therefore, the tangential force on the blades is <math> F_u = \\dot{m}(V_{w1}-V_{w2}) </math>.

As <math>\\alpha_1 </math> increases, the work done on the blades reduces, but at the same time surface area of the blade reduces, therefore there are less frictional losses.\n\n===Reaction turbines===\nIn the ''reaction turbine'', the [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor]] blades themselves are arranged to form convergent [[nozzle]]s. This type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor. Steam is directed onto the rotor by the fixed vanes of the [[stator]]. It leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumference of the rotor. The steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades. A pressure drop occurs across both the stator and the rotor, with steam accelerating through the stator and decelerating through the rotor, with no net change in steam velocity across the stage but with a decrease in both pressure and temperature, reflecting the work performed in the driving of the rotor.\n\n'''Blade efficiency'''\n\nEnergy input to the blades in a stage:\n\n<math>E = {\\Delta h}</math> is equal to the kinetic energy supplied to the fixed blades (f) + the kinetic energy supplied to the moving blades (m).\n\nOr, <math>{E}</math> = enthalpy drop over the fixed blades, <math>{\\Delta h_f}</math> + enthalpy drop over the moving blades, <math>{\\Delta h_m}</math>.\n\nThe effect of expansion of steam over the moving blades is to increase the relative velocity at the exit. Therefore, the relative velocity at the exit <math>V_{r2}</math> is always greater than the relative velocity at the inlet <math>V_{r1}</math>.\n\nIn terms of velocities, the enthalpy drop over the moving blades is given by:\n\n<math>{\\Delta h_m} = \\frac{V_{r2}^2 - V_{r1}^2}{2}</math>\n(it contributes to a change in static pressure)\n\nThe enthalpy drop in the fixed blades, with the assumption that the velocity of steam entering the fixed blades is equal to the velocity of steam leaving the previously moving blades is given by:\n\n[[File:Edited blade design.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Velocity diagram]]\n\n<math>{\\Delta h_f}</math> =  <math>\\frac{V_1^2 - V_0^2}{2}</math>  where V<sub>0</sub> is the inlet velocity of steam in the nozzle\n\n<math>V_{0}</math> is very small and hence can be neglected\n\nTherefore, <math>{\\Delta h_f}</math> =  <math>\\frac{V_1^2}{2}</math>\n\n<math>E = {\\Delta h_f+\\Delta h_m}</math>\n\n<math>E = \\frac{V_1^2}{2} + \\frac{V_{r2}^2 - V_{r1}^2}{2}</math>\n\nA very widely used design has half [[degree of reaction]] or 50% reaction and this is known as '''Parson's turbine'''.

When warming up a steam turbine for use, the main steam stop valves (after the boiler) have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine.  Also, a [[turning gear]] is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent [[Thermal shock|uneven expansion]].  After first rotating the turbine by the turning gear, allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane (no bowing), then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine, first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10\u201315&nbsp;RPM (0.17\u20130.25&nbsp;Hz) to slowly warm the turbine. The warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours.<ref name=EEA_EPA_report/>\n\nDuring normal operation, rotor imbalance can lead to vibration, which, because of the high rotation velocities, could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine. Also, turbines are run with high-quality steam: either [[Superheated steam|superheated (dry) steam]], or [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturated]] steam with a high dryness fraction. This prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades (moisture carry over).  Also, liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft.  To prevent this, along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam, condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine.\n\nMaintenance requirements of modern steam turbines are simple and incur low costs (typically around $0.005 per kWh);<ref name=EEA_EPA_report>{{cite web|title=Technology Characterization: Steam Turbines |date=December 2008|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/documents/catalog_chptech_steam_turbines.pdf|publisher= U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=25 February 2013 | page =13 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118235558/http://www.epa.gov/chp/documents/catalog_chptech_steam_turbines.pdf|archivedate=18 November 2012}}</ref>  their operational life often exceeds 50 years.<ref name=EEA_EPA_report/>\n\n===Speed regulation===\n[[File:Turbine generator systems1.png|thumb|upright=1.65|Diagram of a steam turbine generator system]]\n\nThe control of a turbine with a [[Steam turbine governing|governor]] is essential, as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications (such as the generation of alternating current electricity) require precise speed control.{{sfn|Whitaker|2006|p=35}} Uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip, which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close. If these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart, often catastrophically. Turbines are expensive to make, requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials.\n\nDuring normal operation in synchronization with the electricity network, power plants are governed with a five percent [[droop speed control]]. This means the full load speed is 100% and the no-load speed is 105%. This is required for the stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants. Normally the changes in speed are minor. Adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a [[centrifugal governor]]. Generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed Droop and Power Generation.

[[Superheated]] steam (or dry saturated steam, depending on application) leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure. At entry to the turbine, the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle (a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine). When the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor. A force is created on the blades due to the pressure of the vapor on the blades causing them to move. A generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft, and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used. The steam leaves the turbine as a [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturated vapor]] (or liquid-vapor mix depending on application) at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roymech.co.uk/Related/Thermos/Thermos_Steam_Turbine.html|title=Thermodynamics Steam Turbine|website=www.roymech.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108032718/http://roymech.co.uk/Related/Thermos/Thermos_Steam_Turbine.html|archivedate=2011-01-08}}</ref> The first law enables us to find a formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass. Assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific [[enthalpy]] we arrive at the following equation\n: <math> \\frac {\\dot{W}}{\\dot{m}}=h_3-h_4 </math>\n\nwhere\n* '''\u1e86''' is the rate at which work is developed per unit time\n* '''\u1e41''' is the rate of mass flow through the turbine\n\n====Isentropic efficiency====\nTo measure how well a turbine is performing we can look at its [[isentropic]] efficiency. This compares the actual performance of the turbine with the performance that would be achieved by an ideal, isentropic, turbine.{{sfn|Moran|Shapiro|Boettner|Bailey|2010|p=}}  When calculating this efficiency, heat lost to the surroundings is assumed to be zero. Steam's starting pressure and temperature is the same for both the actual and the ideal turbines, but at turbine exit, steam's energy content ('specific enthalpy') for the actual turbine is greater than that for the ideal turbine because of irreversibility in the actual turbine. The specific enthalpy is evaluated at the same steam pressure for the actual and ideal turbines in order to give a good comparison between the two.\n\nThe isentropic efficiency is found by dividing the actual work by the ideal work.{{sfn|Moran|Shapiro|Boettner|Bailey|2010|p=}}\n: <math>\\eta_t = \\frac {h_3-h_4}{h_3-h_{4s}} </math>\n\nwhere\n* '''''h<sub>3</sub>''''' is the specific enthalpy at state three\n* '''''h<sub>4</sub>''''' is the specific enthalpy at state 4 for the actual turbine\n* '''''h<sub>4s</sub>''''' is the specific enthalpy at state 4s for the isentropic turbine\n\n(but note that the adjacent diagram does not show state 4s: it is vertically below state 3)\n\n==Direct drive==\n[[File:Dampfturbine 5 MW mit ELIN Generator.jpg|thumb|A direct-drive 5 MW steam turbine fuelled with [[biomass]]]]\n\n[[electricity generation|Electrical power stations]] use large steam turbines driving [[electric generator]]s to produce most (about 80%) of the world's electricity. The advent of large steam turbines made central-station electricity generation practical, since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky, and operated at slow speeds.  Most central stations are [[fossil fuel power plant]]s and [[nuclear power plant]]s; some installations use [[geothermal]] steam, or use [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) to create the steam.  Steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large [[centrifugal pump]]s, such as [[feedwater pump]]s at a [[thermal power plant]].\n\nThe turbines used for electric power generation are most often directly coupled to their generators.  As the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to the frequency of the electric power system, the most common speeds are 3,000&nbsp;RPM for 50&nbsp;Hz systems, and 3,600&nbsp;RPM for 60&nbsp;Hz systems.  Since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants, with lower steam [[Vapor quality|quality]], the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds, but with four-pole generators, to reduce erosion of turbine blades.{{sfn|Leyzerovich|2005|p=111}}\n\n==Marine propulsion==\n{{Redirect|Turbine Steam Ship||TS (disambiguation)}}\n{{see also|Marine steam engine}}\n[[File:Turbinia At Speed.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Turbinia]]'', 1894, the first steam turbine-powered ship]]\n[[File:SS MAUI high and low pressure turbines 1917.png|right|thumb|High and low pressure turbines for {{SS|Maui|1916|6}}.]]\n[[File:Wirnik turbiny parowej ORP Wicher.jpg|thumb|Parsons turbine from the 1928 Polish destroyer {{ORP|Wicher|1928|2}}.]]\n\nIn [[steamship]]s, advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size, lower maintenance, lighter weight, and lower vibration. A steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of RPM, while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 RPM; consequently, precise (thus expensive) reduction gears are usually required, although numerous early ships through [[World War I]], such as ''[[Turbinia]]'', had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts. Another alternative is [[turbo-electric transmission]], in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts; precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime.  Turbo-electric drive was most used in large US warships designed during World War I and in some fast liners, and was used in some troop transports and mass-production [[Buckley-class destroyer escort|destroyer escorts]] in [[World War II]].\n\nThe higher cost of turbines and the associated gears or generator/motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power, although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency. To reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years.\n\n===Early development===\nThe development of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894-1935 was dominated by the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed (less than 300 rpm) of the ship's propeller at an overall cost competitive with [[marine steam engine|reciprocating engines]]. In 1894, efficient reduction [[gear]]s were not available for the high powers required by ships, so [[direct drive]] was necessary. In ''Turbinia'', which has direct drive to each propeller shaft, the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines (one on each shaft) in series, probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series. Also, there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=26-31}} The high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first US turbine-powered [[destroyer]]s, {{USS|Smith|DD-17|6}}, launched in 1909, which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at {{convert|28.35| kn}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=23-24}}\n\nThe use of turbines in several casings exhausting steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications, and is a form of [[#Types|cross-compounding]]. The first turbine was called the high pressure (HP) turbine, the last turbine was the low pressure (LP) turbine, and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure (IP) turbine. A much later arrangement than ''Turbinia'' can be seen on {{RMS|Queen Mary}} in [[Long Beach, California]], launched in 1934, in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected to the ends of the two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox. They are the HP, 1st IP, 2nd IP, and LP turbines.\n\n===Cruising machinery and gearing===\nThe quest for economy was even more important when cruising speeds were considered. Cruising speed is roughly 50% of a warship's maximum speed and 20-25% of its maximum power level.  This would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired. Although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range, turbine efficiency was greatly reduced, and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges. A solution that proved useful through most of the steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine. This was an extra turbine to add even more stages, at first attached directly to one or more shafts, exhausting to a stage partway along the HP turbine, and not used at high speeds. As reduction gears became available around 1911, some ships, notably the [[battleship]] {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|6}}, had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines. Reduction gears allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft, but were expensive to manufacture.\n\nCruising turbines competed at first with reciprocating engines for fuel economy. An example of the retention of reciprocating engines on fast ships was the famous {{RMS|Titanic}} of 1911, which along with her sisters {{RMS|Olympic}} and {{ship|HMHS|Britannic}} had triple-expansion engines on the two outboard shafts, both exhausting to an LP turbine on the center shaft. After adopting turbines with the {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|1}}s launched in 1909, the [[United States Navy]] reverted to reciprocating machinery on the {{sclass-|New York|battleship|1}}s of 1912, then went back to turbines on ''Nevada'' in 1914. The lingering fondness for reciprocating machinery was because the US Navy had no plans for capital ships exceeding {{convert|21|kn}} until after World War I, so top speed was less important than economical cruising. The United States had acquired the [[Philippines]] and [[Hawaii]] as territories in 1898, and lacked the British [[Royal Navy]]'s worldwide network of [[coaling station]]s. Thus, the US Navy in 1900-1940 had the greatest need of any nation for fuel economy, especially as the prospect of war with [[Japan]] arose following World War I. This need was compounded by the US not launching any cruisers 1908\u20131920, so destroyers were required to perform long-range missions usually assigned to cruisers. So, various cruising solutions were fitted on US destroyers launched 1908\u20131916. These included small reciprocating engines and geared or ungeared cruising turbines on one or two shafts. However, once fully geared turbines proved economical in initial cost and fuel they were rapidly adopted, with cruising turbines also included on most ships. Beginning in 1915 all new Royal Navy destroyers had fully geared turbines, and the United States followed in 1917.\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]], speed was a priority until the [[Battle of Jutland]] in mid-1916 showed that in the [[battlecruiser]]s too much armour had been sacrificed in its pursuit. The British used exclusively turbine-powered warships from 1906. Because they recognized that a significant cruising range would be desirable given their worldwide empire, some warships, notably the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|1}}s, were fitted with cruising turbines from 1912 onwards following earlier experimental installations.\n\nIn the US Navy, the {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer|1}}s, launched 1935\u201336, introduced double-reduction gearing. This further increased the turbine speed above the shaft speed, allowing smaller turbines than single-reduction gearing. Steam pressures and temperatures were also increasing progressively, from {{convert|300| psi|abbr=on}}/{{convert|425| F }} [saturated steam] on the World War I-era {{sclass-|Wickes|destroyer|4}} to {{convert|615| psi|abbr=on}}/{{convert|850| F }} [superheated steam] on some World War II {{Sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|1}}s and later ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/1500ton|title=1,500-ton destroyers in World War II|website=destroyerhistory.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105215828/http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/1500ton/|archivedate=2013-11-05}}</ref>{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=472}} A standard configuration emerged of an axial-flow high-pressure turbine (sometimes with a cruising turbine attached) and a double-axial-flow low-pressure turbine connected to a double-reduction gearbox.

Over the next eight years the US Navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers (initially ordered as {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}}s). Ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned, but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].\n\nAlthough ''New Mexico'' was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931\u20131933 refit, the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers. This system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts. The system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port, with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems.\n\nSome ocean liners were also built with turbo-electric drive, as were some troop transports and mass-production [[Buckley-class destroyer escort|destroyer escorts]] in [[World War II]]. However, when the US designed the \"treaty cruisers\", beginning with {{USS|Pensacola|CA-24|6}} launched in 1927, geared turbines were used to conserve weight, and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter.\n\n===Current usage===\nSince the 1980s, steam turbines have been replaced by [[gas turbine]]s on fast ships and by [[diesel engine]]s on other ships; exceptions are [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] and [[LNG carrier]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ship-technology.com/news/newsmitsubishi-heavy-starts-construction-of-first-sayaendo-series-lng-carrier/ |title=Mitsubishi Heavy starts construction of first Sayaendo series LNG carrier |date=December 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807050807/http://www.ship-technology.com/news/newsmitsubishi-heavy-starts-construction-of-first-sayaendo-series-lng-carrier |archivedate=2014-08-07 }}</ref> Some [[auxiliary ship]]s continue to use steam propulsion.\n\nIn the U.S. Navy, the conventionally powered steam turbine is still in use on all but one of the [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship|Wasp-class]] amphibious assault ships. The [[Royal Navy]] decommissioned its last conventional steam-powered surface warship class, the {{sclass-|Fearless|landing platform dock}}, in 2002.  In 2013, the [[French Navy]] ended its steam era with the decommissioning of its last {{sclass-|Tourville|frigate}}. Amongst the other [[blue-water navies]], the Russian Navy currently operates steam-powered {{sclass-|Kuznetsov|aircraft carrier}}s and  {{sclass-|Sovremenny|destroyer}}s. The [[Indian Navy]] currently operates INS ''Vikramaditya'', a modified {{sclass-|Kiev|aircraft carrier}}; it also operates three {{sclass-|Brahmaputra|frigate}}s commissioned in the early 2000s and one {{sclass-|Godavari|frigate}} scheduled for decommissioning. The Chinese Navy currently operates steam-powered {{sclass-|Kuznetsov|aircraft carrier}}s, {{sclass-|Sovremenny|destroyer}}s along with {{sclass-|Luda|destroyer}}s and the lone [[Type 051B destroyer]]. The [[Egyptian Navy]] and the [[Republic of China Navy]] respectively operate two and six former U.S. {{sclass-|Knox|frigate}}s. The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] currently operates two steam-powered {{sclass-|Condell|frigate}}s (modified {{sclass-|Leander|frigate}}s). Most other naval forces either retired or re-engined their steam-powered warships by 2010. As of 2017, the [[Mexican Navy]] operates four steam-powered former U.S. {{sclass-|Knox|frigate}} and two steam-powered former U.S. {{sclass-|Bronstein|frigate}}.\n\nToday, propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50%, yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50%, especially in marine applications.{{sfn|Deckers|2003|p=14-15}}{{sfn|Leyzerovich|2002}}<ref name=\"TakaishiEtAl2008\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf|title=Approach to High Efficiency Diesel and Gas Engines|last1=Takaishi|first1=Tatsuo|last2=Numata|first2=Akira|date=March 2008|work=Technical Review|publisher=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|language=|access-date=6 May 2019|quote=|last3=Nakano|first3=Ryouji|last4=Sakaguchi|first4=Katsuhiko|volume=45|issue=1}}</ref> Diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required. Thus, conventional steam power is used in very few new ships. An exception is [[LNG carrier]]s which often find it more economical to use [[LNG carrier#Reliquefaction and boil-off|boil-off gas]] with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it.\n\n[[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] use a nuclear reactor to create steam for turbines.  Nuclear power is often chosen where diesel power would be impractical (as in [[submarine]] applications) or the logistics of refuelling pose significant problems (for example, [[icebreaker]]s). It has been estimated that the reactor fuel for the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine|1}}s is sufficient to last 40 circumnavigations of the globe \u2013 potentially sufficient for the vessel's entire service life. Nuclear propulsion has only been applied to a very few [[Nuclear marine propulsion#Civilian nuclear ships|commercial vessels]] due to the expense of maintenance and the regulatory controls required on nuclear systems and fuel cycles.\n\n==Locomotives==\n{{Main|Steam turbine locomotive}}\n\nA steam turbine locomotive engine is a [[steam locomotive]] driven by a steam turbine. The first steam turbine rail locomotive was built in 1908 for the Officine Meccaniche Miani Silvestri Grodona Comi, Milan, Italy. In 1924 [[Krupp]] built the steam turbine locomotive T18 001, operational in 1929, for [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]].\n\nThe main advantages of a steam turbine locomotive are better rotational balance and reduced [[hammer blow]] on the track. However, a disadvantage is less flexible output power so that turbine locomotives were best suited for long-haul operations at a constant output power.{{sfn|Streeter|2007|p=85}}\n\n==Testing==\nBritish, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test steam turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems.\n\nIn the United States, [[ASME]] has produced several performance test codes on steam turbines. These include ASME PTC 6\u20132004, Steam Turbines, ASME PTC 6.2-2011, Steam Turbines in [[Combined cycle|Combined Cycles]], PTC 6S-1988, Procedures for Routine Performance Test of Steam Turbines. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing steam turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 6, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.{{sfn|Sanders|2004|p=292}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Balancing machine]]\n* [[Mercury vapour turbine]]\n* [[Steam engine]]\n* [[Tesla turbine]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite news|title=Global gas and steam turbine market to reach $43.5bn by 2020|url=http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2014/07/gas-and-steam-turbine-revenues-to-hit-43-49bn-by-2020.html|publisher=Power Engineering International|date=July 31, 2014|first=Tildy|last=Bayar|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web|first=H.

Within Parson's lifetime, the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times,{{sfn|Parsons|1911}} and the total output from turbo-generators constructed by his firm [[C. A. Parsons and Company]] and by their licensees, for land purposes alone, had exceeded thirty million horse-power.<ref name=\"birrcastle.com\"/>\n\nA number of other variations of turbines have been developed that work effectively with steam. The ''de Laval turbine'' (invented by [[Gustaf de Laval]]) accelerated the steam to full speed before running it against a turbine blade.  De Laval's [[Steam turbine#Impulse turbines|impulse turbine]] is simpler, less expensive and does not need to be pressure-proof. It can operate with any pressure of steam, but is considerably less efficient.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[Auguste Rateau]] developed a pressure compounded impulse turbine using the de Laval principle as early as 1896,{{sfn|Giampaolo|2014|p=9}} obtained a US patent in 1903, and applied the turbine to a French torpedo boat in 1904.  He taught at the \u00c9cole des mines de Saint-\u00c9tienne for a decade until 1897, and later founded a successful company that was incorporated into the [[Alstom]] firm after his death.  One of the founders of the modern theory of steam and gas turbines was [[Aurel Stodola]], a Slovak physicist and engineer and professor at the Swiss Polytechnical Institute (now [[ETH]]) in Zurich. His work ''Die Dampfturbinen und ihre Aussichten als W\u00e4rmekraftmaschinen'' (English: The Steam Turbine and its prospective use as a Heat Engine) was published in Berlin in 1903. A further book ''Dampf und Gas-Turbinen'' (English: Steam and Gas Turbines) was published in 1922.{{sfn|Stodola|2013}}\n\nThe ''Brown-Curtis turbine'', an [[#Impulse turbines|impulse]] type, which had been originally developed and patented by the U.S. company International Curtis Marine Turbine Company, was developed in the 1900s in conjunction with [[John Brown & Company]]. It was used in John Brown-engined merchant ships and warships, including liners and Royal Navy warships.\n\n==Manufacturing==\nThe present-day manufacturing industry for steam turbines is dominated by Chinese power equipment makers.

There are several classifications for modern steam turbines.\n\n===Blade and stage design===\n[[File:Turbines impulse v reaction.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Schematic diagram outlining the difference between an impulse and a 50% reaction turbine]]\n\nTurbine blades are of two basic types, blades and [[nozzles]]. Blades move entirely due to the impact of steam on them and their profiles do not converge. This results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades. A turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an [[Impulse turbines|impulse turbine]], {{visible anchor|Curtis turbine}}, [[Pressure compounding in turbines|Rateau turbine]], or [[#History|Brown-Curtis turbine]]. Nozzles appear similar to blades, but their profiles converge near the exit. This results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles. Nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit. A turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a [[Reaction turbine|reaction turbine]] or [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons turbine]].\n\nExcept for low-power applications, turbine blades are arranged in multiple stages in series, called [[Compounding of steam turbines|compounding]], which greatly improves [[#Turbine efficiency|efficiency]] at low speeds.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=7-8}} A reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles. Multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops, resulting in a '''pressure-compounded''' turbine. Impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded, velocity-compounded, or pressure-velocity compounded. A pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades, with multiple stages for compounding. This is also known as a Rateau turbine, after its inventor. A '''velocity-compounded''' impulse stage (invented by Curtis and also called a \"Curtis wheel\") is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades. This divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=20-22}} A series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a '''pressure-velocity compounded''' turbine.\n\n[[File:AEG marine steam turbine (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol VI).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Diagram of an AEG marine steam turbine circa 1905]]\n\nBy 1905, when steam turbines were coming into use on fast ships (such as {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}) and in land-based power applications, it had been determined that it was desirable to use one or more Curtis wheels at the beginning of a multi-stage turbine (where the steam pressure is highest), followed by reaction stages. This was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=23-25}} This is illustrated in the drawing of the German 1905 [[AEG]] marine steam turbine. The steam from the [[boiler]]s enters from the right at high pressure through a [[throttle]], controlled manually by an operator (in this case a [[sailor]] known as the throttleman). It passes through five Curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages (the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle) before exiting at low pressure, almost certainly to a [[surface condenser|condenser]]. The condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam, and condenses the steam into [[boiler feedwater|feedwater]] to be returned to the boilers. On the left are several additional reaction stages (on two large rotors) that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation, with steam admitted by a separate throttle. Since ships are rarely operated in reverse, efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines, so only a few stages are used to save cost.\n\n===Blade design challenges===\nA major challenge facing turbine design was reducing the [[creep (deformation)|creep]] experienced by the blades. Because of the high temperatures and high stresses of operation, steam turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms. As temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency, creep becomes  significant. To limit creep, thermal coatings and [[superalloy]]s with solid-solution strengthening and [[grain boundary strengthening]] are used in blade designs.\n\nProtective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit [[oxidation]]. These coatings are often stabilized [[zirconium dioxide]]-based ceramics. Using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy. This reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade. Oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades, which is especially important in the high-temperature environment.{{sfn|Tamarin|2002|p=5\u2013}}\n\nThe nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance. The [[microstructure]] of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition. A uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase \u2013 a combination of nickel, aluminum, and titanium \u2013 promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure.{{sfn|Bhadeshia|2003}}\n\n[[Refractory]] elements such as [[rhenium]] and [[ruthenium]] can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength. The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase, thus preserving the [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance, strength, and creep resistance.{{sfn|Latief|Kakehi|2013}}\n\n===Steam supply and exhaust conditions===\n[[File:BalNPP m st2.jpg|thumb|A low-pressure steam turbine in a nuclear power plant. These turbines exhaust steam at a pressure below atmospheric.]]\n\nTurbine types include condensing, non-condensing, reheat, extraction and induction.\n\nCondensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants. These turbines receive steam from a [[boiler]] and exhaust it to a [[surface condenser|condenser]]. The exhausted steam is at a pressure well below atmospheric, and is in a partially condensed state, typically of a [[steam quality|quality]] near 90%.\n\nNon-condensing or back pressure turbines are most widely used for process steam applications, in which the steam will be used for additional purposes after being exhausted from the turbine. The exhaust pressure is controlled by a regulating valve to suit the needs of the process steam pressure. These are commonly found at refineries, district heating units, pulp and paper plants, and [[desalination]] facilities where large amounts of low pressure process steam are needed.\n\nReheat turbines are also used almost exclusively in electrical power plants. In a reheat turbine, steam flow exits from a high-pressure section of the turbine and is returned to the boiler where additional superheat is added. The steam then goes back into an intermediate pressure section of the turbine and continues its expansion. Using reheat in a cycle increases the work output from the turbine and also the expansion reaches conclusion before the steam condenses, thereby minimizing the erosion of the blades in last rows. In most of the cases, maximum number of reheats employed in a cycle is 2 as the cost of super-heating the steam negates the increase in the work output from turbine.\n\nExtracting type turbines are common in all applications. In an extracting type turbine, steam is released from various stages of the turbine, and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler [[feedwater heater]]s to improve overall cycle efficiency.  Extraction flows may be controlled with a valve, or left uncontrolled. Extracted steam results in a [[power loss factor|loss of power]] in the downstream stages of the turbine.\n\nInduction turbines introduce low pressure steam at an intermediate stage to produce additional power.\n\n===Casing or shaft arrangements===\nThese arrangements include single casing, tandem compound and cross compound turbines. Single casing units are the most basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator. Tandem compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator. A cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds. A cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications. A typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below; this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear, with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine.\n\n[[File:Starboard turbine sets of Furutaka and Aoba class cruisers.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Starboard steam turbine machinery arrangement of Japanese ''Furutaka''- and ''Aoba''-class cruisers.]]\n\n===Two-flow rotors===\n[[File:Turbine Philippsburg-1.jpg|thumb|A two-flow turbine rotor. The steam enters in the middle of the shaft, and exits at each end, balancing the axial force.]]\n\nThe moving steam imparts both a tangential and axial thrust on the turbine shaft, but the axial thrust in a simple turbine is unopposed. To maintain the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an opposing force. [[Thrust bearings]] can be used for the shaft bearings, the rotor can use dummy pistons, it can be '''double flow'''- the steam enters in the middle of the shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a '''double flow''' rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called '''two-flow''', '''double-axial-flow''', or '''double-exhaust'''. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine.<ref name=\"phdengineer\">{{cite web |title=Steam Turbines (Course No. M-3006) |url=http://www.pdhengineer.com/Course%20Files/Completed%20Course%20PDF%20Files/Mechanical/Steam%20Turbines.pdf |accessdate=2011-09-22 |publisher=PhD Engineer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402185518/http://www.pdhengineer.com/Course%20Files/Completed%20Course%20PDF%20Files/Mechanical/Steam%20Turbines.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 }}</ref>\n\n==Principle of operation and design==\nAn ideal steam turbine is considered to be an [[isentropic process]], or constant entropy process, in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine. No steam turbine is truly isentropic, however, with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20\u201390% based on the application of the turbine. The interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or ''buckets''. One set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft. The sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances, with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage.\n\nPractical thermal efficiency of a steam turbine varies with turbine size, load condition, gap losses and friction losses. They reach top values up to about 50% in a {{convert|1200|MW|abbr=on}} turbine; smaller ones have a lower efficiency.{{Citation needed |date=September 2016}} To maximize turbine efficiency the steam is expanded, doing work, in a number of stages. These stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines. Most steam turbines use a mixture of the reaction and impulse designs: each stage behaves as either one or the other, but the overall turbine uses both. Typically, lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher pressure stages are impulse type.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Impulse turbines===\n[[File:TurbineBlades.jpg|border|thumb|A selection of impulse turbine blades]]\n\nAn impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets. These jets contain significant kinetic energy,  which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades, as the steam jet changes direction. A pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades, with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage.\nAs the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure (atmospheric pressure, or more usually, the condenser vacuum). Due to this high ratio of expansion of steam, the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity. The steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle. The loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss.\n\nThe law of [[angular momentum|moment of momentum]] states that the sum of the moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the [[control volume]] is equal to the net time change of angular momentum flux through the control volume.\n\nThe swirling fluid enters the control volume at radius <math>r_1</math> with tangential velocity <math>V_{w1}</math> and leaves at radius <math>r_2</math> with tangential velocity <math>V_{w2}</math>.\n\n[[File:Edited blade design 1.png|border|alt=Velocity triangles at the inlet and outlet on the blades of a turbo-machine.|thumb|Velocity triangle]]\n\nA [[velocity triangle]] paves the way for a better understanding of the relationship between the various velocities.

As <math>\\alpha_1 </math> increases, the work done on the blades reduces, but at the same time surface area of the blade reduces, therefore there are less frictional losses.\n\n===Reaction turbines===\nIn the ''reaction turbine'', the [[Rotor (turbine)|rotor]] blades themselves are arranged to form convergent [[nozzle]]s. This type of turbine makes use of the reaction force produced as the steam accelerates through the nozzles formed by the rotor. Steam is directed onto the rotor by the fixed vanes of the [[stator]]. It leaves the stator as a jet that fills the entire circumference of the rotor. The steam then changes direction and increases its speed relative to the speed of the blades. A pressure drop occurs across both the stator and the rotor, with steam accelerating through the stator and decelerating through the rotor, with no net change in steam velocity across the stage but with a decrease in both pressure and temperature, reflecting the work performed in the driving of the rotor.\n\n'''Blade efficiency'''\n\nEnergy input to the blades in a stage:\n\n<math>E = {\\Delta h}</math> is equal to the kinetic energy supplied to the fixed blades (f) + the kinetic energy supplied to the moving blades (m).\n\nOr, <math>{E}</math> = enthalpy drop over the fixed blades, <math>{\\Delta h_f}</math> + enthalpy drop over the moving blades, <math>{\\Delta h_m}</math>.\n\nThe effect of expansion of steam over the moving blades is to increase the relative velocity at the exit. Therefore, the relative velocity at the exit <math>V_{r2}</math> is always greater than the relative velocity at the inlet <math>V_{r1}</math>.\n\nIn terms of velocities, the enthalpy drop over the moving blades is given by:\n\n<math>{\\Delta h_m} = \\frac{V_{r2}^2 - V_{r1}^2}{2}</math>\n(it contributes to a change in static pressure)\n\nThe enthalpy drop in the fixed blades, with the assumption that the velocity of steam entering the fixed blades is equal to the velocity of steam leaving the previously moving blades is given by:\n\n[[File:Edited blade design.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Velocity diagram]]\n\n<math>{\\Delta h_f}</math> =  <math>\\frac{V_1^2 - V_0^2}{2}</math>  where V<sub>0</sub> is the inlet velocity of steam in the nozzle\n\n<math>V_{0}</math> is very small and hence can be neglected\n\nTherefore, <math>{\\Delta h_f}</math> =  <math>\\frac{V_1^2}{2}</math>\n\n<math>E = {\\Delta h_f+\\Delta h_m}</math>\n\n<math>E = \\frac{V_1^2}{2} + \\frac{V_{r2}^2 - V_{r1}^2}{2}</math>\n\nA very widely used design has half [[degree of reaction]] or 50% reaction and this is known as '''Parson's turbine'''. This consists of symmetrical rotor and stator blades.\nFor this turbine the velocity triangle is similar and we have:\n\n<math>\\alpha_1  = \\beta_2 </math>,  <math>\\beta_1  = \\alpha_2 </math>\n\n<math>V_1 = V_{r2}</math>,  <math>V_{r1} = V_2</math>\n\nAssuming ''Parson\u2019s turbine'' and obtaining all the expressions we get\n\n<math>{E} = {V_1^2}-\\frac{V_{r1}^2}{2}</math>\n\nFrom the inlet velocity triangle we have <math>{V_{r1}^2} = {V_1^2+U^2-2UV_1\\cos\\alpha_1}</math>\n\n<math>{E} = {V_1^2-\\frac{V_1^2}{2}-\\frac{U^2}{2}+\\frac{2UV_1\\cos\\alpha_1}{2}}</math>\n\n<math>{E} = \\frac{V_1^2-U^2+2UV_1\\cos\\alpha_1}{2}</math>\n\nWork done (for unit mass flow per second): <math>{W} = {U * \\Delta V_w} = {U*(2*V_1\\cos\\alpha_1-U)}</math>\n\nTherefore, the '''blade efficiency''' is given by\n\n<math>{\\eta_b} = \\frac{2U(2V_1\\cos\\alpha_1-U)}{V_1^2-U^2+2V_1U\\cos\\alpha_1}</math>\n\n'''Condition of maximum blade efficiency'''\n\n[[File:Edited comparing efficiencies.png|thumb|upright=1.5| Comparing Efficiencies of Impulse and Reaction turbines]]\n\nIf <math>{\\rho} = \\frac{U}{V_1}</math>, then\n\n<math>{(\\eta_b)_{max}} = \\frac{2\\rho(\\cos\\alpha_1-\\rho)}{V_1^2-U^2+2UV_1\\cos\\alpha_1}</math>\n\nFor maximum efficiency  <math>{d\\eta_b\\over d\\rho} = 0</math>, we get\n\n<math>{(1-\\rho^2+2\\rho\\cos \\alpha_1)(4\\cos \\alpha_1-4\\rho) -2\\rho(2\\cos \\alpha_1- \\rho)(-2\\rho+2\\cos \\alpha_1) = 0}</math>\n\nand this finally gives <math>{\\rho_{opt}} = \\frac{U}{V_1} = {\\cos \\alpha_1}</math>\n\nTherefore, <math>{(\\eta_b)_{max}}</math> is found by putting the value of <math>{\\rho} =  {\\cos \\alpha_1}</math> in the expression of blade efficiency\n\n<math>{(\\eta_b)_{reaction}} = \\frac{2\\cos^2\\alpha_1}{1+\\cos^2\\alpha_1}</math>\n\n<math>{(\\eta_b)_{impulse}} = {\\cos^2\\alpha_1}</math>\n\n===Operation and maintenance===\n[[File:Modern Steam Turbine Generator.jpg|thumb|A modern steam turbine generator installation]]\n\nBecause of the high pressures used in the steam circuits and the materials used, steam turbines and their casings have high [[Volumetric heat capacity#Thermal inertia|thermal inertia]]. When warming up a steam turbine for use, the main steam stop valves (after the boiler) have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine.  Also, a [[turning gear]] is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent [[Thermal shock|uneven expansion]].  After first rotating the turbine by the turning gear, allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane (no bowing), then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine, first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10\u201315&nbsp;RPM (0.17\u20130.25&nbsp;Hz) to slowly warm the turbine. The warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours.<ref name=EEA_EPA_report/>\n\nDuring normal operation, rotor imbalance can lead to vibration, which, because of the high rotation velocities, could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing. To reduce this risk, considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine. Also, turbines are run with high-quality steam: either [[Superheated steam|superheated (dry) steam]], or [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturated]] steam with a high dryness fraction. This prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades (moisture carry over).  Also, liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft.  To prevent this, along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam, condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine.\n\nMaintenance requirements of modern steam turbines are simple and incur low costs (typically around $0.005 per kWh);<ref name=EEA_EPA_report>{{cite web|title=Technology Characterization: Steam Turbines |date=December 2008|url=http://www.epa.gov/chp/documents/catalog_chptech_steam_turbines.pdf|publisher= U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=25 February 2013 | page =13 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118235558/http://www.epa.gov/chp/documents/catalog_chptech_steam_turbines.pdf|archivedate=18 November 2012}}</ref>  their operational life often exceeds 50 years.<ref name=EEA_EPA_report/>\n\n===Speed regulation===\n[[File:Turbine generator systems1.png|thumb|upright=1.65|Diagram of a steam turbine generator system]]\n\nThe control of a turbine with a [[Steam turbine governing|governor]] is essential, as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications (such as the generation of alternating current electricity) require precise speed control.{{sfn|Whitaker|2006|p=35}} Uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip, which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close. If these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart, often catastrophically. Turbines are expensive to make, requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials.\n\nDuring normal operation in synchronization with the electricity network, power plants are governed with a five percent [[droop speed control]]. This means the full load speed is 100% and the no-load speed is 105%. This is required for the stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants. Normally the changes in speed are minor. Adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a [[centrifugal governor]]. Generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speed Droop and Power Generation.

[[Superheated]] steam (or dry saturated steam, depending on application) leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure. At entry to the turbine, the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle (a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine). When the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor. A force is created on the blades due to the pressure of the vapor on the blades causing them to move. A generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft, and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used. The steam leaves the turbine as a [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturated vapor]] (or liquid-vapor mix depending on application) at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roymech.co.uk/Related/Thermos/Thermos_Steam_Turbine.html|title=Thermodynamics Steam Turbine|website=www.roymech.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110108032718/http://roymech.co.uk/Related/Thermos/Thermos_Steam_Turbine.html|archivedate=2011-01-08}}</ref> The first law enables us to find a formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass.

This compares the actual performance of the turbine with the performance that would be achieved by an ideal, isentropic, turbine.{{sfn|Moran|Shapiro|Boettner|Bailey|2010|p=}}  When calculating this efficiency, heat lost to the surroundings is assumed to be zero. Steam's starting pressure and temperature is the same for both the actual and the ideal turbines, but at turbine exit, steam's energy content ('specific enthalpy') for the actual turbine is greater than that for the ideal turbine because of irreversibility in the actual turbine. The specific enthalpy is evaluated at the same steam pressure for the actual and ideal turbines in order to give a good comparison between the two.\n\nThe isentropic efficiency is found by dividing the actual work by the ideal work.{{sfn|Moran|Shapiro|Boettner|Bailey|2010|p=}}\n: <math>\\eta_t = \\frac {h_3-h_4}{h_3-h_{4s}} </math>\n\nwhere\n* '''''h<sub>3</sub>''''' is the specific enthalpy at state three\n* '''''h<sub>4</sub>''''' is the specific enthalpy at state 4 for the actual turbine\n* '''''h<sub>4s</sub>''''' is the specific enthalpy at state 4s for the isentropic turbine\n\n(but note that the adjacent diagram does not show state 4s: it is vertically below state 3)\n\n==Direct drive==\n[[File:Dampfturbine 5 MW mit ELIN Generator.jpg|thumb|A direct-drive 5 MW steam turbine fuelled with [[biomass]]]]\n\n[[electricity generation|Electrical power stations]] use large steam turbines driving [[electric generator]]s to produce most (about 80%) of the world's electricity. The advent of large steam turbines made central-station electricity generation practical, since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky, and operated at slow speeds.  Most central stations are [[fossil fuel power plant]]s and [[nuclear power plant]]s; some installations use [[geothermal]] steam, or use [[concentrated solar power]] (CSP) to create the steam.  Steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large [[centrifugal pump]]s, such as [[feedwater pump]]s at a [[thermal power plant]].\n\nThe turbines used for electric power generation are most often directly coupled to their generators.  As the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to the frequency of the electric power system, the most common speeds are 3,000&nbsp;RPM for 50&nbsp;Hz systems, and 3,600&nbsp;RPM for 60&nbsp;Hz systems.  Since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants, with lower steam [[Vapor quality|quality]], the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds, but with four-pole generators, to reduce erosion of turbine blades.{{sfn|Leyzerovich|2005|p=111}}\n\n==Marine propulsion==\n{{Redirect|Turbine Steam Ship||TS (disambiguation)}}\n{{see also|Marine steam engine}}\n[[File:Turbinia At Speed.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Turbinia]]'', 1894, the first steam turbine-powered ship]]\n[[File:SS MAUI high and low pressure turbines 1917.png|right|thumb|High and low pressure turbines for {{SS|Maui|1916|6}}.]]\n[[File:Wirnik turbiny parowej ORP Wicher.jpg|thumb|Parsons turbine from the 1928 Polish destroyer {{ORP|Wicher|1928|2}}.]]\n\nIn [[steamship]]s, advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size, lower maintenance, lighter weight, and lower vibration. A steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of RPM, while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 RPM; consequently, precise (thus expensive) reduction gears are usually required, although numerous early ships through [[World War I]], such as ''[[Turbinia]]'', had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts. Another alternative is [[turbo-electric transmission]], in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts; precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime.  Turbo-electric drive was most used in large US warships designed during World War I and in some fast liners, and was used in some troop transports and mass-production [[Buckley-class destroyer escort|destroyer escorts]] in [[World War II]].\n\nThe higher cost of turbines and the associated gears or generator/motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power, although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency. To reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years.\n\n===Early development===\nThe development of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894-1935 was dominated by the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed (less than 300 rpm) of the ship's propeller at an overall cost competitive with [[marine steam engine|reciprocating engines]]. In 1894, efficient reduction [[gear]]s were not available for the high powers required by ships, so [[direct drive]] was necessary. In ''Turbinia'', which has direct drive to each propeller shaft, the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines (one on each shaft) in series, probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series. Also, there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds.{{sfn|Parsons|1911|pp=26-31}} The high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first US turbine-powered [[destroyer]]s, {{USS|Smith|DD-17|6}}, launched in 1909, which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at {{convert|28.35| kn}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=23-24}}\n\nThe use of turbines in several casings exhausting steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications, and is a form of [[#Types|cross-compounding]]. The first turbine was called the high pressure (HP) turbine, the last turbine was the low pressure (LP) turbine, and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure (IP) turbine. A much later arrangement than ''Turbinia'' can be seen on {{RMS|Queen Mary}} in [[Long Beach, California]], launched in 1934, in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected to the ends of the two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox. They are the HP, 1st IP, 2nd IP, and LP turbines.\n\n===Cruising machinery and gearing===\nThe quest for economy was even more important when cruising speeds were considered. Cruising speed is roughly 50% of a warship's maximum speed and 20-25% of its maximum power level.  This would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired. Although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range, turbine efficiency was greatly reduced, and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges. A solution that proved useful through most of the steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine. This was an extra turbine to add even more stages, at first attached directly to one or more shafts, exhausting to a stage partway along the HP turbine, and not used at high speeds. As reduction gears became available around 1911, some ships, notably the [[battleship]] {{USS|Nevada|BB-36|6}}, had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines. Reduction gears allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft, but were expensive to manufacture.\n\nCruising turbines competed at first with reciprocating engines for fuel economy. An example of the retention of reciprocating engines on fast ships was the famous {{RMS|Titanic}} of 1911, which along with her sisters {{RMS|Olympic}} and {{ship|HMHS|Britannic}} had triple-expansion engines on the two outboard shafts, both exhausting to an LP turbine on the center shaft. After adopting turbines with the {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|1}}s launched in 1909, the [[United States Navy]] reverted to reciprocating machinery on the {{sclass-|New York|battleship|1}}s of 1912, then went back to turbines on ''Nevada'' in 1914. The lingering fondness for reciprocating machinery was because the US Navy had no plans for capital ships exceeding {{convert|21|kn}} until after World War I, so top speed was less important than economical cruising. The United States had acquired the [[Philippines]] and [[Hawaii]] as territories in 1898, and lacked the British [[Royal Navy]]'s worldwide network of [[coaling station]]s. Thus, the US Navy in 1900-1940 had the greatest need of any nation for fuel economy, especially as the prospect of war with [[Japan]] arose following World War I. This need was compounded by the US not launching any cruisers 1908\u20131920, so destroyers were required to perform long-range missions usually assigned to cruisers. So, various cruising solutions were fitted on US destroyers launched 1908\u20131916. These included small reciprocating engines and geared or ungeared cruising turbines on one or two shafts. However, once fully geared turbines proved economical in initial cost and fuel they were rapidly adopted, with cruising turbines also included on most ships. Beginning in 1915 all new Royal Navy destroyers had fully geared turbines, and the United States followed in 1917.\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]], speed was a priority until the [[Battle of Jutland]] in mid-1916 showed that in the [[battlecruiser]]s too much armour had been sacrificed in its pursuit. The British used exclusively turbine-powered warships from 1906. Because they recognized that a significant cruising range would be desirable given their worldwide empire, some warships, notably the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|1}}s, were fitted with cruising turbines from 1912 onwards following earlier experimental installations.\n\nIn the US Navy, the {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer|1}}s, launched 1935\u201336, introduced double-reduction gearing. This further increased the turbine speed above the shaft speed, allowing smaller turbines than single-reduction gearing. Steam pressures and temperatures were also increasing progressively, from {{convert|300| psi|abbr=on}}/{{convert|425| F }} [saturated steam] on the World War I-era {{sclass-|Wickes|destroyer|4}} to {{convert|615| psi|abbr=on}}/{{convert|850| F }} [superheated steam] on some World War II {{Sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|1}}s and later ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/1500ton|title=1,500-ton destroyers in World War II|website=destroyerhistory.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105215828/http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/1500ton/|archivedate=2013-11-05}}</ref>{{sfn|Friedman|2004|p=472}} A standard configuration emerged of an axial-flow high-pressure turbine (sometimes with a cruising turbine attached) and a double-axial-flow low-pressure turbine connected to a double-reduction gearbox.

Amphibious and auxiliary ships continued to use {{convert|600| psi|abbr=on}} steam post-World War II, with {{USS|Iwo Jima|LHD-7|6}}, launched in 2001, possibly the last non-nuclear steam-powered ship built for the US Navy.\n\n===Turbo-electric drive===\n[[File:50letPob pole.JPG|thumb|{{ship|NS|50 Let Pobedy}}, a nuclear icebreaker with nuclear-turbo-electric propulsion]]\n\n[[Turbo-electric transmission|Turbo-electric drive]] was introduced on the battleship {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|6}}, launched in 1917. Over the next eight years the US Navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers (initially ordered as {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|1}}s). Ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned, but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].\n\nAlthough ''New Mexico'' was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931\u20131933 refit, the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers. This system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts. The system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port, with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems.\n\nSome ocean liners were also built with turbo-electric drive, as were some troop transports and mass-production [[Buckley-class destroyer escort|destroyer escorts]] in [[World War II]]. However, when the US designed the \"treaty cruisers\", beginning with {{USS|Pensacola|CA-24|6}} launched in 1927, geared turbines were used to conserve weight, and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter.\n\n===Current usage===\nSince the 1980s, steam turbines have been replaced by [[gas turbine]]s on fast ships and by [[diesel engine]]s on other ships; exceptions are [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] and [[LNG carrier]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ship-technology.com/news/newsmitsubishi-heavy-starts-construction-of-first-sayaendo-series-lng-carrier/ |title=Mitsubishi Heavy starts construction of first Sayaendo series LNG carrier |date=December 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807050807/http://www.ship-technology.com/news/newsmitsubishi-heavy-starts-construction-of-first-sayaendo-series-lng-carrier |archivedate=2014-08-07 }}</ref> Some [[auxiliary ship]]s continue to use steam propulsion.\n\nIn the U.S. Navy, the conventionally powered steam turbine is still in use on all but one of the [[Wasp-class amphibious assault ship|Wasp-class]] amphibious assault ships. The [[Royal Navy]] decommissioned its last conventional steam-powered surface warship class, the {{sclass-|Fearless|landing platform dock}}, in 2002.  In 2013, the [[French Navy]] ended its steam era with the decommissioning of its last {{sclass-|Tourville|frigate}}. Amongst the other [[blue-water navies]], the Russian Navy currently operates steam-powered {{sclass-|Kuznetsov|aircraft carrier}}s and  {{sclass-|Sovremenny|destroyer}}s. The [[Indian Navy]] currently operates INS ''Vikramaditya'', a modified {{sclass-|Kiev|aircraft carrier}}; it also operates three {{sclass-|Brahmaputra|frigate}}s commissioned in the early 2000s and one {{sclass-|Godavari|frigate}} scheduled for decommissioning. The Chinese Navy currently operates steam-powered {{sclass-|Kuznetsov|aircraft carrier}}s, {{sclass-|Sovremenny|destroyer}}s along with {{sclass-|Luda|destroyer}}s and the lone [[Type 051B destroyer]]. The [[Egyptian Navy]] and the [[Republic of China Navy]] respectively operate two and six former U.S. {{sclass-|Knox|frigate}}s. The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] currently operates two steam-powered {{sclass-|Condell|frigate}}s (modified {{sclass-|Leander|frigate}}s). Most other naval forces either retired or re-engined their steam-powered warships by 2010. As of 2017, the [[Mexican Navy]] operates four steam-powered former U.S. {{sclass-|Knox|frigate}} and two steam-powered former U.S. {{sclass-|Bronstein|frigate}}.\n\nToday, propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50%, yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50%, especially in marine applications.{{sfn|Deckers|2003|p=14-15}}{{sfn|Leyzerovich|2002}}<ref name=\"TakaishiEtAl2008\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mhi.co.jp/technology/review/pdf/e451/e451021.pdf|title=Approach to High Efficiency Diesel and Gas Engines|last1=Takaishi|first1=Tatsuo|last2=Numata|first2=Akira|date=March 2008|work=Technical Review|publisher=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|language=|access-date=6 May 2019|quote=|last3=Nakano|first3=Ryouji|last4=Sakaguchi|first4=Katsuhiko|volume=45|issue=1}}</ref> Diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required. Thus, conventional steam power is used in very few new ships. An exception is [[LNG carrier]]s which often find it more economical to use [[LNG carrier#Reliquefaction and boil-off|boil-off gas]] with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it.\n\n[[Nuclear marine propulsion|Nuclear-powered ships and submarines]] use a nuclear reactor to create steam for turbines.  Nuclear power is often chosen where diesel power would be impractical (as in [[submarine]] applications) or the logistics of refuelling pose significant problems (for example, [[icebreaker]]s). It has been estimated that the reactor fuel for the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{sclass-|Vanguard|submarine|1}}s is sufficient to last 40 circumnavigations of the globe \u2013 potentially sufficient for the vessel's entire service life. Nuclear propulsion has only been applied to a very few [[Nuclear marine propulsion#Civilian nuclear ships|commercial vessels]] due to the expense of maintenance and the regulatory controls required on nuclear systems and fuel cycles.\n\n==Locomotives==\n{{Main|Steam turbine locomotive}}\n\nA steam turbine locomotive engine is a [[steam locomotive]] driven by a steam turbine. The first steam turbine rail locomotive was built in 1908 for the Officine Meccaniche Miani Silvestri Grodona Comi, Milan, Italy. In 1924 [[Krupp]] built the steam turbine locomotive T18 001, operational in 1929, for [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]].\n\nThe main advantages of a steam turbine locomotive are better rotational balance and reduced [[hammer blow]] on the track. However, a disadvantage is less flexible output power so that turbine locomotives were best suited for long-haul operations at a constant output power.{{sfn|Streeter|2007|p=85}}\n\n==Testing==\nBritish, German, other national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test steam turbines. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems.\n\nIn the United States, [[ASME]] has produced several performance test codes on steam turbines. These include ASME PTC 6\u20132004, Steam Turbines, ASME PTC 6.2-2011, Steam Turbines in [[Combined cycle|Combined Cycles]], PTC 6S-1988, Procedures for Routine Performance Test of Steam Turbines. These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing steam turbines. The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes, including PTC 6, is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance.{{sfn|Sanders|2004|p=292}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Balancing machine]]\n* [[Mercury vapour turbine]]\n* [[Steam engine]]\n* [[Tesla turbine]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n*{{cite news|title=Global gas and steam turbine market to reach $43.5bn by 2020|url=http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2014/07/gas-and-steam-turbine-revenues-to-hit-43-49bn-by-2020.html|publisher=Power Engineering International|date=July 31, 2014|first=Tildy|last=Bayar|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web|first=H.
