He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945|1945]].\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in [[Bolton, Massachusetts]], Robinson was a catcher in the minor [[New England League]] in [[1885 in baseball|1885]] and made it to the major leagues in [[1886 in baseball|1886]] with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], where he remained until 1890. He lasted in the majors until {{Baseball year|1902}}, playing much of his career with two separate Baltimore Orioles franchises \u2013 from 1890 to 1899 with the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Orioles team]] which folded after the [[1899 in baseball|1899]] [[National League]] season, and in 1901\u201302 with the [[American League]] team which moved to New York City in {{Baseball year|1903}} and became the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]].  He also spent one season, {{Baseball year|1900}}, with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n[[File:Wilbert Robinson Baseball Card.JPG|100px|thumb|left|1895 Baseball Card]]\nOver the course of his career, Robinson played 1,316&nbsp;games as a catcher, which prepared him for his second baseball career as a manager. The star catcher of the Orioles dynasty which won three straight titles from 1894 to 1896, he compiled a career [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .273, with a peak of .353 in the heavy-hitting season of 1894. Durable behind the plate, he caught a [[wikt:tripleheader|triple-header]] in 1896, followed by a double-header the following day. He also was the first catcher to play directly behind the batter at all times, as the previous practice had been to play farther back when there were fewer than two strikes. A highlight of his career was a seven-[[hit (baseball)|hit]] game June 10, 1892. He also batted in 11 runs in that game; on September 16, {{Baseball year|1924}}, as manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], he saw that record eclipsed as [[Jim Bottomley]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] batted in 12 runs. (Robinson, whose team was in contention for the pennant at the time, lamented, \"Why did he have to save all those hits for us? Couldn't he have made some of them against [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|McGraw]]?\")\n\n== AL Orioles ==\nRobinson and McGraw joined as business partners in the [[Baltimore Orioles (1901\u201302)|Baltimore Orioles]], a team that would debut in the new [[American League]] in 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1664595762.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+13,+1900&author=&pub=The+Sun+(1837\u20131985)&desc=BASEBALL+DEAL+MADE&pqatl=google|title=archives \u2013 baltimoresun.com \u2013 BASEBALL DEAL MADE|website=pqasb.pqarchiver.com}}</ref> McGraw served as player-manager of the AL Orioles in 1901 and the beginning of the 1902 season, at which point he departed to the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. Robinson succeeded McGraw as manager of the Orioles.\n\nAfter the season, McGraw enticed Robinson to be his pitching coach from 1903 to 1913, during which time the Giants won five NL pennants.\n\n== Brooklyn Dodgers ==\nRobinson would not don the manager's cap again in the majors until {{Baseball year|1914}}, when he took over the [[Brooklyn]] franchise in the National League. The team was known by various nicknames, including Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Dodgers, but during Robinson's managerial tenure, which lasted until {{Baseball year|1931}}, the club was as often referred to as the \"Robins\" in honor of their manager, who had acquired the nickname \"Uncle Robbie.\" (The frequently error-prone Dodger teams of this era were also sometimes derisively known as \"Uncle Robbie's Daffiness Boys.\")\n\nIn his 18 years at the helm of the Brooks, Robinson compiled a record of 1,375\u20131,341, including National League championships in {{Baseball year|1916}} and {{Baseball year|1920}} \u2013 Brooklyn's only pennants between 1901 and 1940. Those two clubs lost in the [[World Series]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]], respectively. His 1,375 NL victories were, at the time, the 3rd-highest total in NL history, trailing only the totals of McGraw (then with 2,652) and [[Fred Clarke]] (1,602).\n\nRobinson was highly regarded for his ability to draw outstanding performances from his pitching staffs, a result of his many years as a catcher. Among the pitchers he guided to success were [[Joe McGinnity]] with both Orioles teams and the Giants, [[Rube Marquard]] with the Giants, and [[Dazzy Vance]] and [[Burleigh Grimes]] with the Dodgers. Another pitcher who would later recall Robinson's excellent advice, although they never played together during a regular season, was [[John K. Tener|John Tener]], who in the 1910s served simultaneously as NL president and [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor of Pennsylvania]].\n\nRobinson was manager when [[Al L\u00f3pez]] started out as a catcher in the majors. Robinson watched Lopez' style and finally hollered, \"Tell that punk he got two hands to catch with! Never mind the {{linktext|Fancy Dan}} stuff.\" Lopez went on to eventually surpass Robinson's record of games behind the plate.\n\n==Robinson and Ruth Law==\n{{norefs|section|date = June 2017}}\nOn March 13, {{Baseball year|1915}}, at [[spring training]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], Robinson decided to try to set a record of sorts by catching a baseball dropped from an [[aircraft|airplane]] being flown 525 feet (160&nbsp;m) overhead. [[Ruth Law]], the [[aviator]], supposedly forgot to bring a baseball and instead dropped a grapefruit, which splattered all over the manager. The grapefruit made such a mess that Robinson thought he had lost his eye because of the acid and the bloodlike splatter that covered him.  He quickly realized that it was a joke when he saw his teammates burst out in laughter.

He was inducted into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1945|1945]].\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in [[Bolton, Massachusetts]], Robinson was a catcher in the minor [[New England League]] in [[1885 in baseball|1885]] and made it to the major leagues in [[1886 in baseball|1886]] with the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]], where he remained until 1890. He lasted in the majors until {{Baseball year|1902}}, playing much of his career with two separate Baltimore Orioles franchises \u2013 from 1890 to 1899 with the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Orioles team]] which folded after the [[1899 in baseball|1899]] [[National League]] season, and in 1901\u201302 with the [[American League]] team which moved to New York City in {{Baseball year|1903}} and became the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]].  He also spent one season, {{Baseball year|1900}}, with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n[[File:Wilbert Robinson Baseball Card.JPG|100px|thumb|left|1895 Baseball Card]]\nOver the course of his career, Robinson played 1,316&nbsp;games as a catcher, which prepared him for his second baseball career as a manager. The star catcher of the Orioles dynasty which won three straight titles from 1894 to 1896, he compiled a career [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .273, with a peak of .353 in the heavy-hitting season of 1894. Durable behind the plate, he caught a [[wikt:tripleheader|triple-header]] in 1896, followed by a double-header the following day. He also was the first catcher to play directly behind the batter at all times, as the previous practice had been to play farther back when there were fewer than two strikes. A highlight of his career was a seven-[[hit (baseball)|hit]] game June 10, 1892. He also batted in 11 runs in that game; on September 16, {{Baseball year|1924}}, as manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], he saw that record eclipsed as [[Jim Bottomley]] of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] batted in 12 runs. (Robinson, whose team was in contention for the pennant at the time, lamented, \"Why did he have to save all those hits for us? Couldn't he have made some of them against [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] manager [[John McGraw (baseball)|McGraw]]?\")\n\n== AL Orioles ==\nRobinson and McGraw joined as business partners in the [[Baltimore Orioles (1901\u201302)|Baltimore Orioles]], a team that would debut in the new [[American League]] in 1901.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/1664595762.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+13,+1900&author=&pub=The+Sun+(1837\u20131985)&desc=BASEBALL+DEAL+MADE&pqatl=google|title=archives \u2013 baltimoresun.com \u2013 BASEBALL DEAL MADE|website=pqasb.pqarchiver.com}}</ref> McGraw served as player-manager of the AL Orioles in 1901 and the beginning of the 1902 season, at which point he departed to the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. Robinson succeeded McGraw as manager of the Orioles.\n\nAfter the season, McGraw enticed Robinson to be his pitching coach from 1903 to 1913, during which time the Giants won five NL pennants.\n\n== Brooklyn Dodgers ==\nRobinson would not don the manager's cap again in the majors until {{Baseball year|1914}}, when he took over the [[Brooklyn]] franchise in the National League. The team was known by various nicknames, including Bridegrooms, Superbas, and Dodgers, but during Robinson's managerial tenure, which lasted until {{Baseball year|1931}}, the club was as often referred to as the \"Robins\" in honor of their manager, who had acquired the nickname \"Uncle Robbie\".  (The frequently error-prone Dodger teams of this era were also sometimes derisively known as \"Uncle Robbie's Daffiness Boys\".)\n\nIn his 18 years at the helm of the Brooks, Robinson compiled a record of 1375\u20131341, including National League championships in {{Baseball year|1916}} and {{Baseball year|1920}} \u2013 Brooklyn's only pennants between 1901 and 1940. Those two clubs lost in the [[World Series]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[Cleveland Indians]], respectively. His 1375 NL victories were, at the time, the 3rd-highest total in NL history, trailing only the totals of McGraw (then with 2652) and [[Fred Clarke]] (1602).\n\nRobinson was highly regarded for his ability to draw outstanding performances from his pitching staffs, a result of his many years as a catcher. Among the pitchers he guided to success were [[Joe McGinnity]] with both Orioles teams and the Giants, [[Rube Marquard]] with the Giants, and [[Dazzy Vance]] and [[Burleigh Grimes]] with the Dodgers. Another pitcher who would later recall Robinson's excellent advice, although they never played together during a regular season, was [[John K. Tener|John Tener]], who in the 1910s served simultaneously as NL president and [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor of Pennsylvania]].\n\nRobinson was manager when [[Al L\u00f3pez]] started out as a catcher in the majors. Robinson watched Lopez' style and finally hollered, \"Tell that punk he got two hands to catch with! Never mind the {{linktext|Fancy Dan}} stuff.\" Lopez went on to eventually surpass Robinson's record of games behind the plate.\n\n==Robinson and Ruth Law==\n{{norefs|section|date = June 2017}}\nOn March 13, {{Baseball year|1915}}, at [[spring training]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]], Robinson decided to try to set a record of sorts by catching a baseball dropped from an [[aircraft|airplane]] being flown 525 feet (160&nbsp;m) overhead. [[Ruth Law]], the [[aviator]], supposedly forgot to bring a baseball and instead dropped a grapefruit, which splattered all over the manager. The grapefruit made such a mess that Robinson thought he had lost his eye because of the acid and the bloodlike splatter that covered him.  He quickly realized that it was a joke when he saw his teammates burst out in laughter. Outfielder [[Casey Stengel]], later a successful manager himself, is generally believed to have convinced Law to make the switch.  From this point on Robinson referred to airplanes as fruit flies.\n\n==Retirement and death==\nAfter his retirement from managing, Robinson became the president of the [[Atlanta Crackers]] minor league team. He died in [[Atlanta]] at 71 years of age following a [[Cerebrovascular accident|brain hemorrhage]], and was buried in the [[New Cathedral Cemetery]] in Baltimore.\n\n==Family==\nRobinson's brother, [[Fred Robinson (baseball)|Fred Robinson]], also played briefly in the majors, appearing in 3 games for the {{Baseball year|1884}} [[Cincinnati Outlaw Reds]] of the [[Union Association]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Wilbert Robinson HOF plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|right|110px|Plaque of Wilbert Robinson at the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]]]\nRobinson was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1945 by the Old-Timers Committee.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball runs batted in records]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball managers by wins]]\n*[[List of Major League Baseball player-managers]]\n*[[List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{bbhof|robinson-wilbert}}\n{{baseballstats |mlb=121322 |espn=26865 |br=r/robinwi01 |fangraphs=1011078 |brm=robins001wil |retro=R/Probiw101}}\n{{baseball-reference manager|robinwi01}}\n*[https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/5536caf5 Wilbert Robinson] at SABR (Baseball BioProject)\n*[http://thedeadballera.com/Obits/Obits_R/Robinson.Wilbert.Obit.html Wilbert Robinson] at The Deadball Era\n*{{findagrave|4214}}\n\n{{1945 Baseball HOF}}\n{{Baseball Hall of Fame members}}\n{{New York Yankees HOF}}\n{{St. Louis Cardinals HOF}}\n{{1894 Baltimore Orioles}}\n{{1895 Baltimore Orioles}}\n{{1896 Baltimore Orioles}}\n{{1901 Baltimore Orioles}}\n{{Baltimoreoriolesmanager (1901\u20131902)}}\n{{Los Angeles Dodgers managers}}\n{{Los Angeles Dodgers Presidents}}\n{{Los Angeles Dodgers}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Robinson, Wilbert}}\n[[Category:1863 births]]\n[[Category:1934 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century baseball players]]\n[[Category:Atlanta Crackers managers]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles (AA) players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles (IL) managers]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles (IL) players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles (NL) players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles (1901\u201302) players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Orioles (1901\u20131902) managers]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn Robins executives]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn Robins managers]]\n[[Category:Haverhill (minor league baseball) players]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball catchers]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball player-managers]]\n[[Category:Minor league baseball managers]]\n[[Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:New York Giants (NL) coaches]]\n[[Category:People from Bolton, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:People from Hudson, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Philadelphia Athletics (AA) players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Cardinals players]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBrooklyn Dodgers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilbert_Robinson"}

If numbers differ by one order of magnitude, ''x'' is ''about'' ten times different in quantity than ''y''.  If values differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100.

Order&nbsp;of<br />magnitude\n|}\n\n===Calculating the order of magnitude===\nThe order of magnitude of a number is, intuitively speaking, the number of powers of 10 contained in the number.  More precisely, the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the [[common logarithm]], usually as the [[integer]] part of the logarithm, obtained by [[truncation]].  For example, the number {{val|4000000}} has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602; its order of magnitude is 6.  When truncating, a number of this order of magnitude is between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>. In a similar example, with the phrase \"He had a seven-figure income\", the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one, so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6. An order of magnitude is an approximate position on a [[logarithmic scale]].\n\n===Order-of-magnitude estimate===\nAn order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable, whose precise value is unknown, is an estimate [[Rounding|rounded]] to the nearest power of ten.  For example, an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the [[human]] [[population]] of the [[Earth]]) is 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]. To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude, one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer.  Thus {{val|4000000}}, which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602, has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude, because \"nearest\" implies rounding rather than truncation.  For a number written in scientific notation, this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example, the nearest order of magnitude for {{val|1.7|e=8}} is 8, whereas the nearest order of magnitude for {{val|3.7|e=8}} is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a [[zeroth order approximation]].\n\n===Order of magnitude difference===\nAn order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10.  For example, the mass of the planet [[Saturn]] is 95 times that of [[Earth]], so Saturn is ''two orders of magnitude'' more massive than Earth.  Order-of-magnitude differences are called '''[[decade (log scale)|decades]]''' when measured on a [[logarithmic scale]].\n\n==Non-decimal orders of magnitude==\n{{see also|Logarithmic scale}}\nOther orders of magnitude may be calculated using [[Radix|bases]] other than 10. The ancient Greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred (about 2.512) as bright as the nearest weaker [[Magnitude (astronomy)|level of brightness]], and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is (100<sup>1/5</sup>)<sup>5</sup> or a '''factor''' of 100 times brighter.\n\nThe different [[decimal]] [[numeral systems]] of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows  what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base {{val|1000000}}. It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is {{val|1000000}}. But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with [[Long and short scales|other meaning]] than in the first chapter) are not names of the ''orders of'' magnitudes, they are names of \"magnitudes\", that is the ''numbers'' {{val|1000000000000}} etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|The IEC standard prefixes]] with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.\n\nThe ancient [[apparent magnitude]]s for the brightness of stars uses the base <math>\\sqrt[5]{100} \\approx 2.512</math> and is reversed. The modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.\n\n===Extremely large numbers===\nFor extremely [[large numbers]], a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their [[Logarithm#Inverses of other exponential functions|double logarithm]] or [[super-logarithm]]. Rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very \"round numbers\", rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the \"nearest\" round number.\n\nThe double logarithm yields the categories:\n: ..., 1.0023\u20131.023, 1.023\u20131.26, 1.26\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>100</sup>, 10<sup>100</sup>\u201310<sup>{{val|1000|fmt=none}}</sup>, ...\n(the first two mentioned, and the extension to the left, may not be very useful, they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left).\n\nThe super-logarithm yields the categories:<!-- 0-1 doesn't seem right -->\n:0\u20131, 1\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>, 10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup></sup>, ...

(see [[Large numbers#Standardized system of writing very large numbers|notation of extremely large numbers]])\n\nFor extremely small numbers (in the sense of close to zero) neither method is suitable directly, but the generalized order of magnitude of the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] can be considered.\n\nSimilar to the [[logarithmic scale#Graphic representation|logarithmic scale]] one can have a double logarithmic scale (example provided [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death|here]]) and super-logarithmic scale. The intervals above all have the same length on them, with the \"midpoints\" actually midway. More generally, a point midway between two points corresponds to the [[generalised f-mean|generalised ''f''-mean]] with ''f''(''x'') the corresponding function log log ''x'' or slog ''x''. In the case of log log ''x'', this mean of two numbers (e.g. 2 and 16 giving 4) does not depend on the base of the logarithm, just like in the case of log ''x'' ([[geometric mean]], 2 and 8 giving 4), but unlike in the case of log log log ''x'' (4 and {{val|65536}} giving 16 if the base is 2, but not otherwise).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Big O notation]]\n* [[Decibel]]\n* [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode]]\n* [[Names of large numbers]]\n* [[Names of small numbers]]\n* [[Number sense]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (energy)]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]]\n* [[Scientific notation]]\n* [[CJK Compatibility|Unicode symbols for CJK Compatibility]] includes [[International System of Units|SI]] Unit symbols\n* [[Valuation (algebra)]], an algebraic generalization of \"order of magnitude\"\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov, Isaac]] ''The Measure of the Universe'' (1983)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://htwins.net/scale2/ The Scale of the Universe 2 ] Interactive tool from [[Planck length]] 10<sup>\u221235</sup> meters to universe size 10<sup>27</sup>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html Cosmos &ndash; an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos] &ndash; from Digital Nature Agency\n* [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index.html Powers of 10], a graphic animated illustration that starts with a view of the [[Milky Way]] at 10<sup>23</sup> meters and ends with [[subatomic particle]]s at 10<sup>\u221216</sup> meters.\n* [http://www.vendian.org/envelope/TemporaryURL/what_is_oom.html What is Order of Magnitude?]\n\n{{orders of magnitude wide}}\n\n[[Category:Orders of magnitude| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Scale of numbers with a fixed ratio}}\n[[File:Orders of magnitude (english annotations).png|thumb|The scale of everything.

[[Logarithmic distribution]]s are common in nature and\nconsidering the order of magnitude of values sampled from such a distribution can be more intuitive. When the reference value is ten the order of magnitude can be understood as the number of digits in the base-10 representation of the value. Similarly, if the reference value is one of certain powers of two, the magnitude can be understood as the amount of computer memory needed to store the exact integer value.\n\n[[Difference (mathematics)|Differences]] in order of magnitude can be [[measured]] on a base-10 [[logarithmic scale]] in \u201c[[Decade (log scale)|decades]]\u201d (i.e., factors of ten).<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/orders.html\n |title      = Orders of Magnitude\n |last       = Brians \n |first      = Paus\n |accessdate = 9 May 2013\n}}</ref> Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]].\n\n==Definition==\nGenerally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of Magnitude|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderofMagnitude.html|website=Wolfram MathWorld|accessdate=3 January 2017|quote=Physicists and engineers use the phrase \"order of magnitude\" to refer to the smallest power of ten needed to represent a quantity.}}</ref> To work out the order of magnitude of a number <math>N</math>, the number is first expressed in the following form:\n:<math>N =a\\times10^b</math>\nwhere <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\leq a<\\sqrt{10}</math>.

The ancient Greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred (about 2.512) as bright as the nearest weaker [[Magnitude (astronomy)|level of brightness]], and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is (100<sup>1/5</sup>)<sup>5</sup> or a '''factor''' of 100 times brighter.\n\nThe different [[decimal]] [[numeral systems]] of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows  what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base {{val|1000000}}. It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is {{val|1000000}}. But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with [[Long and short scales|other meaning]] than in the first chapter) are not names of the ''orders of'' magnitudes, they are names of \"magnitudes\", that is the ''numbers'' {{val|1000000000000}} etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Order of magnitude !! Is [[Common logarithm|log<sub>10</sub>]] of !! Is log<sub>{{val|1000000}}</sub> of !! Short scale !! Long scale\n|-\n| 1 || align=right |   {{val|10}}          || align=right |             {{val|1000000}} || align=right |     million || align=right |  million\n|-\n| 2 || align=right |  {{val|100}}          || align=right |       {{val|1000000000000}} || align=right |    trillion || align=right |  billion\n|-\n| 3 || align=right | {{val|1000|fmt=none}} || align=right | {{val|1000000000000000000}} || align=right | quintillion || align=right | trillion\n|}\n\n[[SI]] units in the table at right are used together with [[SI prefix]]es, which were devised with mainly base 1000 magnitudes in mind. [[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|The IEC standard prefixes]] with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.\n\nThe ancient [[apparent magnitude]]s for the brightness of stars uses the base <math>\\sqrt[5]{100} \\approx 2.512</math> and is reversed. The modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.\n\n===Extremely large numbers===\nFor extremely [[large numbers]], a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their [[Logarithm#Inverses of other exponential functions|double logarithm]] or [[super-logarithm]]. Rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very \"round numbers\", rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the \"nearest\" round number.\n\nThe double logarithm yields the categories:\n: ..., 1.0023\u20131.023, 1.023\u20131.26, 1.26\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>100</sup>, 10<sup>100</sup>\u201310<sup>{{val|1000|fmt=none}}</sup>, ...\n(the first two mentioned, and the extension to the left, may not be very useful, they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left).\n\nThe super-logarithm yields the categories:<!-- 0-1 doesn't seem right -->\n:0\u20131, 1\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>, 10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup></sup>, ... [[tetration|or]]\n\n:0\u2013<sup>0</sup>10, <sup>0</sup>10\u2013<sup>1</sup>10, <sup>1</sup>10\u2013<sup>2</sup>10, <sup>2</sup>10\u2013<sup>3</sup>10, <sup>3</sup>10\u2013<sup>4</sup>10, ...\n\nThe \"midpoints\" which determine which round number is nearer are in the first case:\n:1.076, 2.071, 1453, {{val|4.20|e=31}}, {{val|1.69|e=316}},...\nand, depending on the interpolation method, in the second case\n:\u22120.301, 0.5, 3.162, {{val|1453|fmt=none}}, {{val|1|e=1453|fmt=none}}, <math>(10 \\uparrow)^1 10^{1453}</math>, <math>(10 \\uparrow)^2 10^{1453}</math>,... (see [[Large numbers#Standardized system of writing very large numbers|notation of extremely large numbers]])\n\nFor extremely small numbers (in the sense of close to zero) neither method is suitable directly, but the generalized order of magnitude of the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] can be considered.\n\nSimilar to the [[logarithmic scale#Graphic representation|logarithmic scale]] one can have a double logarithmic scale (example provided [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death|here]]) and super-logarithmic scale. The intervals above all have the same length on them, with the \"midpoints\" actually midway. More generally, a point midway between two points corresponds to the [[generalised f-mean|generalised ''f''-mean]] with ''f''(''x'') the corresponding function log log ''x'' or slog ''x''. In the case of log log ''x'', this mean of two numbers (e.g. 2 and 16 giving 4) does not depend on the base of the logarithm, just like in the case of log ''x'' ([[geometric mean]], 2 and 8 giving 4), but unlike in the case of log log log ''x'' (4 and {{val|65536}} giving 16 if the base is 2, but not otherwise).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Big O notation]]\n* [[Decibel]]\n* [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode]]\n* [[Names of large numbers]]\n* [[Names of small numbers]]\n* [[Number sense]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (energy)]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]]\n* [[Scientific notation]]\n* [[CJK Compatibility|Unicode symbols for CJK Compatibility]] includes [[International System of Units|SI]] Unit symbols\n* [[Valuation (algebra)]], an algebraic generalization of \"order of magnitude\"\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov, Isaac]] ''The Measure of the Universe'' (1983)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://htwins.net/scale2/ The Scale of the Universe 2 ] Interactive tool from [[Planck length]] 10<sup>\u221235</sup> meters to universe size 10<sup>27</sup>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html Cosmos &ndash; an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos] &ndash; from Digital Nature Agency\n* [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index.html Powers of 10], a graphic animated illustration that starts with a view of the [[Milky Way]] at 10<sup>23</sup> meters and ends with [[subatomic particle]]s at 10<sup>\u221216</sup> meters.\n* [http://www.vendian.org/envelope/TemporaryURL/what_is_oom.html What is Order of Magnitude?]\n\n{{orders of magnitude wide}}\n\n[[Category:Orders of magnitude| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n", "name_user": "Thtatithticth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Add comma.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude"}

In 1915, Guido Panerai invented gun sights that were illuminated by a radium-226/zinc sulfide powder enclosed in small, hermetically sealed vessels.<ref>https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/032676034/publication/GB191512270A?q=GB191512270</ref> Radiomir, the name for the radium-based luminous mixture is derived from \"radio mire\", which is Italian for \"radium sights\".\nPanerai became an official supplier to the [[Regia Marina]] (the Royal Italian Navy), supplying all kinds of technical equipment and precision instruments.{{Sfn|Panerai|2011a}} All Panerai watches, except for the GPF 2/56 were designed and manufactured by [[Rolex|Rolex SA]] using [[pocket watch]] [[watch movement|movements]] made by Swiss manufacturer [[Cort\u00e9bert]]. The main driving forces behind the production of the first professional diving watches were Hans Wilsdorf of Rolex and Giuseppe Panerai.\n\nThe Florence-based workshop produced wrist-worn diving instruments and, between 1935 and 1970, delivered around 1,600 watches (c. 35 2533s, 1000 3646s, 24 6152s, 36 6154s, 500 6152/1s, and 60 GPF 2/56s), most of them to the Italian [[Marina Militare]].{{Sfn|Prince|2003}} All watches, except for the GPF 2/56, were made by Rolex, and G. Panerai e Figlio produced only the dials for these watches. Panerai dials were rendered luminous with Radiomir, a highly radioactive [[radium]]-based self-luminous compound, and later in around 1965, with Luminor, a harmless compound activated by [[tritium]].<ref>https://perezcope.com/2019/11/30/luminor-2020-debunking-panerais-fictional-history-of-tritium-based-lume/</ref>\n\nThe GPF 2/56 (Egiziano Grosso) was produced for the Egyptian Navy in 1956. By 1970, the company ceased to provide watches to the Marina Militare, as they were neither cost-effective nor met the naval specifications. In 1993 it then moved to launch its products in the civilian market. Following its acquisition of Panerai, Richemont repositioned Panerai as a luxury watch brand and increased prices.{{Sfn|Christie's|2007}}\n\nOne of the rarest Panerai watches is a Second World War Military Diver watch. This historic watch was acquired by a British soldier named George H. Rowson in WW2 <ref>{{cite web|title=Military Diving Watch|url= https://oracleoftime.com/ww2-panerai-military-diver-auction/| work=OracleTime|accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref> where he obtained it via a [[Kommando_Spezialkr\u00e4fte_Marine|German frogman]] during a thwarted attempt by the Germans to destroy the [[Nijmegen railway bridge|Nijmegen Bridge]] in the Netherlands, in September 1944.\n\n==Products==\n[[File:Radiomircalifornia.jpg|thumb|Ref. 3646 from 1944 with Rolex \"California\" dial]]\nPanerai offers watches across four marketing lines: Historic, Contemporary, Manifattura and Special Editions in runs of 500, 1000, 2000 or 4000 units\u2014each carrying an issue number on the case back.

For example, in 2006 issued the ''1936 [[California dial|California Dial]] Radiomir'' special edition, a reissue of the first Panerai model presented to the Italian [[Marina Militare]] with production limited to 1936 units.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Ferrari branded Panerai products===\nWhen [[Ferrari]]'s contract with rival watchmaker [[Girard-Perregaux]] expired in 2005, Ferrari and Panerai entered into a five-year agreement to design, manufacture and distribute Panerai watches carrying the Ferrari trademark.

Notable products include the Luminor and Radiomir wristwatches.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}\n[[File:Panerai 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Employee of Panerai in front of the watch store in Florence in 1860]]\n\nGiovanni Panerai (1825\u20131897) opened up his first watch shop in [[Florence, Italy]] in 1860.{{Sfn|Panerai|2011}} Giovanni's grandson Guido Panerai (1873\u20131934) expanded the watch shop \"Orologeria Svizzera\"<ref>https://perezcope.com/2018/02/22/orologeria-svizzera-the-watch-shop/</ref> and took over his wife's family business, a mechanical workshop. In 1915, Guido Panerai invented gun sights that were illuminated by a radium-226/zinc sulfide powder enclosed in small, hermetically sealed vessels.<ref>https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/032676034/publication/GB191512270A?q=GB191512270</ref> Radiomir, the name for the radium-based luminous mixture is derived from \"radio mire\", which is Italian for \"radium sights\".\nPanerai became an official supplier to the [[Regia Marina]] (the Royal Italian Navy), supplying all kinds of technical equipment and precision instruments.{{Sfn|Panerai|2011a}} All Panerai watches, except for the GPF 2/56 were designed and manufactured by [[Rolex|Rolex SA]] using [[pocket watch]] [[watch movement|movements]] made by Swiss manufacturer [[Cort\u00e9bert]]. The main driving forces behind the production of the first professional diving watches were Hans Wilsdorf of Rolex and Giuseppe Panerai.\n\nThe Florence-based workshop produced wrist-worn diving instruments and, between 1935 and 1970, delivered around 1,600 watches (c. 35 2533s, 1000 3646s, 24 6152s, 36 6154s, 500 6152/1s, and 60 GPF 2/56s), most of them to the Italian [[Marina Militare]].{{Sfn|Prince|2003}} All watches, except for the GPF 2/56, were made by Rolex and G. Panerai e Filgio produced only the dials for these watches. Panerai dials were rendered luminous with Radiomir, a highly radioactive [[radium]]-based self-luminous compound, and later in around 1965, with Luminor, a harmless compound activated by [[tritium]].<ref>https://perezcope.com/2019/11/30/luminor-2020-debunking-panerais-fictional-history-of-tritium-based-lume/</ref>\n\nThe GPF 2/56 (Egiziano Grosso) was produced for the Egyptian Navy in 1956. By 1970, the company ceased to provide watches to the Marina Militare, as they were neither cost-effective nor met the naval specifications. In 1993 it then moved to launch its products in the civilian market. Following its acquisition of Panerai, Richemont repositioned Panerai as a luxury watch brand and increased prices.{{Sfn|Christie's|2007}}\n\nOne of the rarest Panerai watches is a Second World War Military Diver watch. This historic watch was acquired by a British soldier named George H. Rowson in WW2 <ref>{{cite web|title=Military Diving Watch|url= https://oracleoftime.com/ww2-panerai-military-diver-auction/| work=OracleTime|accessdate=31 January 2019}}</ref> where he obtained it via a [[Kommando_Spezialkr\u00e4fte_Marine|German frogman]] during a thwarted attempt by the Germans to destroy the [[Nijmegen railway bridge|Nijmegen Bridge]] in the Netherlands, in September 1944.\n\n==Products==\n[[File:Radiomircalifornia.jpg|thumb|Ref. 3646 from 1944 with Rolex \"California\" dial]]\nPanerai offers watches across four marketing lines: Historic, Contemporary, Manifattura and Special Editions in runs of 500, 1000, 2000 or 4000 units\u2014each carrying an issue number on the case back. The company issues Special Editions by year. For example, in 2006 issued the ''1936 [[California dial|California Dial]] Radiomir'' special edition, a reissue of the first Panerai model presented to the Italian [[Marina Militare]] with production limited to 1936 units.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Ferrari branded Panerai products===\nWhen [[Ferrari]]'s contract with rival watchmaker [[Girard-Perregaux]] expired in 2005, Ferrari and Panerai entered into a five-year agreement to design, manufacture and distribute Panerai watches carrying the Ferrari trademark. The collection was branded '''Ferrari engineered by Panerai'''  and consisted of two product lines marketed as  \"Granturismo\" and \"Scuderia\". The collection consisted of 11 models priced between [[United States Dollar|US$]]5,000 and US$30,000.{{Sfn|Strandberg|2006}}.
