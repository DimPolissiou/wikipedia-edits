This left them seven points behind United, with two games to go, confirming the Manchester club as champions once more.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] who each lasted one season in the league, along with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] who went down after seven seasons.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2005\u201306 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] (playing in the top flight for the first time ever), [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (playing top flight football for the first time in twelve years) and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] (returning after a six-year absence). They replaced [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], ending their top flight spells of four, two and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2006\u201307 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

As the Revolutionary War progressed, [[Early Modern France|French]] aid, resources and military thinking helped shape the new army. A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], who taught [[Prussian Army]] tactics and organizational skills.\n\n[[File:Bataille Yorktown.jpg|thumb|left|The storming of Redoubt No. 10 in the [[Siege of Yorktown]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] prompted Great Britain's government to begin negotiations, resulting in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and Great Britain's recognition of the United States as an independent state.]]\nThe army fought numerous pitched battles and in the South in 1780 and 1781, at times using the [[Fabian strategy]] and the [[hit-and-run tactics]], under the leadership of Major General [[Nathanael Greene]], hit where the British were weakest to wear down their forces. Washington led victories against the British at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], but lost a series of battles in the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]] in 1776 and the [[Philadelphia campaign]] in 1777. With a decisive victory at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] and the help of the French, the Continental Army prevailed against the British.\n\nAfter the war, the Continental Army was quickly given land certificates and disbanded in a reflection of the [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] distrust of standing armies. State militias became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of [[First American Regiment|a regiment]] to guard the [[Northwest Territory|Western Frontier]] and one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army.

By march 1799 Congress created an \"Eventual Army\" of 30,000 men, including three regiments of cavalry. Both \"armies\" existed only on paper, but equipment for 3,000 men and horses was procured and stored.<ref>Gregory J.W.Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry: An Illustrated History, 1776-1944'', University of Oklahoma Press 2003 (1983), pp. 36\u201439</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Early wars on the Frontier====\n{{further|Army on the Frontier}}\n[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Andrew Jackson]] standing on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Highlanders]] during the [[Battle of New Orleans|defense of New Orleans]], the final major and most one-sided battle of the War of 1812]]\n\nThe [[War of 1812]], the second and last war between the United States and Great Britain, had mixed results.  The U.S. Army did not conquer Canada but it did destroy Native American resistance to expansion in the [[Old Northwest]] and it validated its independence by stopping two major British invasions in 1814 and 1815. After [[Battle of Lake Erie|taking control of Lake Erie]] in 1813, the U.S. Army seized parts of western Upper Canada, [[Battle of York|burned York]] and [[Battle of the Thames|defeated Tecumseh]], which caused his [[Western Confederacy]] to collapse. Following U.S. victories in the Canadian province of Upper Canada, British troops who had dubbed the U.S. Army \"Regulars, by God!\", were able to capture and [[Burning of Washington|burn Washington]], which was defended by militia, in 1814. The regular army, however proved they were professional and capable of defeating the British army during the [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invasions of Plattsburgh]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]], prompting British agreement on the previously rejected terms of a [[status quo]] ante bellum. Two weeks after a treaty was signed (but not ratified), [[Andrew Jackson]] defeated the British in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] and [[Siege of Fort St. Philip (1815)|Siege of Fort St. Philip]], and became a national hero. U.S. troops and sailors [[Capture of HMS Cyane and HMS Levant|captured HMS Cyane]], [[Capture of HMS Cyane and HMS Levant|Levant]] and [[Capture of HMS Cyane and HMS Levant|Penguin]] in the final engagements of the war. Per the treaty, both sides (the United States and Great Britain) returned to the geographical status quo. Both navies kept the warships they had seized during the conflict.\n\nThe army's major campaign against the Indians was fought in [[Florida]] against [[Seminole]]s. It took long wars (1818\u20131858) to finally defeat the Seminoles and move them to Oklahoma. The usual strategy in Indian wars was to seize control of the Indians' winter food supply, but that was no use in Florida where there was no winter. The second strategy was to form alliances with other Indian tribes, but that too was useless because the Seminoles had destroyed all the other Indians when they entered Florida in the late eighteenth century.<ref>Ron Field and Richard Hook, ''The Seminole Wars 1818\u201358'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army fought and won the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848), which was a defining event for both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/|title=The U.S.-Mexican War \u2013 PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> The U.S. victory resulted in acquisition of territory that eventually became all or parts of the states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\n====American Civil War====\n{{further|Union Army}}\n[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L.

''The Atlas of the Civil War'', (Philadelphia, PA, 2010)</ref> The Confederates had the advantage of defending a large territory in an area where disease caused twice as many deaths as combat. The Union pursued a strategy of seizing the coastline, blockading the ports, and taking control of the river systems. By 1863, the Confederacy was being strangled. Its eastern armies fought well, but the western armies were defeated one after another until the Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 along with the Tennessee River.  In the [[Vicksburg Campaign]] of 1862\u20131863, General [[Ulysses Grant]] seized the [[Mississippi River]] and cut off the Southwest.  Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties, he had General [[Robert E. Lee]] under siege in Richmond as General [[William T. Sherman]] captured Atlanta and marched through Georgia and [[the Carolinas]].  The Confederate capital was abandoned in April 1865 and Lee subsequently surrendered his army at Appomattox Court House. All other Confederate armies surrendered within a few months.\n\nThe war remains the deadliest conflict in U.S. history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 men on both sides. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6.4% in [[Northern United States|the North]] and 18% in [[Southern United States|the South]].<ref>Maris Vinovskis (1990).

The loss of the divisions did not sit well with the states. Their objections included the inadequate maneuver element mix for those that remained and the end to the practice of rotating divisional commands among the states that supported them.

Since the 1933 amendment to the [[National Defense Act of 1916]], all Army National Guard soldiers have held dual status. They serve as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and as a reserve members of the U.S. Army under the authority of the president, in the Army National Guard of the United States.\n\nSince the adoption of the total force policy, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, reserve component soldiers have taken a more active role in U.S. military operations. For example, Reserve and Guard units took part in the [[Gulf War]], peacekeeping in [[Kosovo]], Afghanistan and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n\n===Army commands and army service component commands===\n[[File:Headquarters US Army SSI.png|25px]] [[United States Department of the Army|Headquarters, United States Department of the Army]] (HQDA):\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Army Commands\n!Current commander\n!Location of headquarters\n|-\n|[[File:United States Army Forces Command SSI.svg|20px]] [[United States Army Forces Command]] (FORSCOM) || GEN [[Michael X.

Both reserve components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month \u2013 known as [[Battle Assembly|battle assemblies]] or unit training assemblies (UTAs) \u2013 and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]] of the [[United States Code]], while the National Guard is organized under [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32]]. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the U.S. Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors.

The central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular, i.e., all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division. As specified before the 2013 end-strength re-definitions, the three major types of ground combat brigades are:\n* [[Brigade Combat Team#Heavy brigade combat team|Armored]] brigades, with strength of 4,743 troops as of 2014.\n* [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team|Stryker]] brigades, with strength of 4,500 troops as of 2014.\n* [[Brigade Combat Team#Infantry Brigade Combat Team|Infantry]] brigades, with strength of 4,413 troops as of 2014.\n\nIn addition, there are combat support and service support modular brigades. Combat support brigades include [[Combat Aviation Brigade|aviation]] (CAB) brigades, which will come in heavy and light varieties, [[Fires Brigade|fires]] (artillery) brigades (now transforms to division artillery) and [[Battlefield Surveillance Brigade|expeditionary military intelligence brigades]]. [[Combat service support]] brigades include [[Sustainment Brigade|sustainment]] brigades and come in several varieties and serve the standard support role in an army.\n\n===Combat maneuver organizations===\n:''To track the effects of the 2018 budget cuts, see [[Transformation of the United States Army#Divisions and brigades]]''\nThe U.S. Army currently consists of 10 active divisions and one deployable division headquarters (7th Infantry Division) as well as several independent units.

In June 2013, the Army announced plans to downsize to 32 active combat brigade teams by 2015 to match a reduction in active duty strength to 490,000 soldiers. Army chief of staff Raymond Odierno projected that the Army was to shrink to \"450,000 in the active component, 335,000 in the National Guard and 195,000 in U.S. Army Reserve\" by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/140768/CSA__SMA_hold_virtual_town_hall/|title=CSA Odierno and SMA Chandler virtual town hall, Jan 6, 2015|publisher=Army.mil|date=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> However, this plan was scrapped by the new administration and now the Army plans to grow by 16,000 soldiers to a total of 476,000 by October 2017.

[[Basic training]] consists of 10&nbsp;weeks \"this does not include processing & out-processing\" most recruits followed by Advanced Individualized Training (AIT) where they receive training for their [[List of United States Army careers|military occupational specialties (MOS)]]. Some individual's MOSs range anywhere from 14\u201320 weeks of One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines Basic Training and AIT. The length of AIT school varies by the MOS. The length of time spent in AIT depends on the MOS of the soldier and some highly technical MOS training may require many months (e.g., foreign language translators). Depending on the needs of the army, [[United States Army Basic Training#Basic Combat Training|Basic Combat Training]] for combat arms soldiers is conducted at a number of locations, but two of the longest-running are the Armor School and the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], both at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia. Sergeant Major of the Army Dailey notes that an infantrymen's pilot program for [[One Station Unit Training]] (OSUT) extends 8 weeks beyond Basic Training and AIT, to 22 weeks. The pilot, designed to boost infantry readiness, is due to end in December 2018.

The smallest of these is the 60&nbsp;mm [[M224 mortar|M224]], normally assigned at the infantry company level.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m224.html M224], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> At the next higher echelon, infantry battalions are typically supported by a section of 81&nbsp;mm [[M252 mortar]]s.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m252.html M252], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> The largest mortar in the army's inventory is the 120&nbsp;mm [[M120 mortar|M120/M121]], usually employed by mechanized units.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m120.html M120], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref>\n\nFire support for light infantry units is provided by towed howitzers, including the 105&nbsp;mm [[M119 howitzer|M119A1]]<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m119.html M119], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> and the 155&nbsp;mm [[M777 howitzer|M777]] (which will replace the [[M198 howitzer|M198]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/lw155.htm|title=M777 Lightweight 155mm howitzer (LW155)|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army utilizes a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an Anti-Armor Capability. The [[AT4]] is an unguided projectile that can destroy armor and bunkers at ranges up to 500 meters. The [[FIM-92 Stinger]] is a shoulder-launched, heat seeking anti-aircraft missile. The [[FGM-148 Javelin]] and [[BGM-71 TOW]] are anti-tank guided missiles.\n\n===Vehicles===\n[[File:Patrol in Iraq, March 2008.jpg|thumb|A U.S. soldier on patrol with the support of a [[Humvee]] vehicle]]\n\nU.S. Army doctrine puts a premium on mechanized warfare.

These include the [[AH-64 Apache]] [[attack helicopter]],<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/aircraft/apache.html Apache], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] utility tactical transport helicopter<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/aircraft/blackhawk.html Blackhawk], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> and the [[CH-47 Chinook]] heavy-lift transport helicopter.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/aircraft/chinook.html Chinook], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> Restructuring plans call for reduction of 750 aircraft and from 7 to 4 types.<ref>{{citation|last=Stevenson|first=Beth|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-army-continues-to-face-financial-challenge-of-rotary-fleet-408160/|title= US Army continues to face financial challenge of rotary fleet maintenance|work=[[Flightglobal]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123011643/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-army-continues-to-face-financial-challenge-of-rotary-fleet-408160/|archivedate=23 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]], the Army agreed to limit its fixed-wing aviation role to administrative mission support (light unarmed aircraft which cannot operate from forward positions). For [[UAV]]s, the Army is deploying at least one company of drone [[MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]s to each Active Army division.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2015/01/08/army-to-build-dedicated-drone-runway-at-fort-bliss/|title=Army to build dedicated drone runway at Fort Bliss|first=Kyle|last=Jahner|date=7 August 2017|website=Army Times}}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\n{{main|Uniforms of the United States Army}}\n[[File:Army greens.jpg|thumb|The 2020 Army Greens uniform]]\n\nThe [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU) currently features a camouflage pattern known as [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]] (OCP); OCP replaced a pixel-based pattern known as [[Universal Camouflage Pattern]] (UCP) in 2019.\n\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-6.jpeg|thumb|An element of the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]], wearing ASUs, representing the United States at the 2010 Victory Day commemoration in [[Moscow]]]]\n\nOn 11 November 2018, the Army announced a new version of 'Army Greens' based on uniforms worn during World War II will become the standard garrison service uniform.<ref name=ArmyGreens>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/213650/us_army_to_roll_out_new_army_greens_uniform|title=U.S. Army to roll out new Army Greens uniform|website=Army.mil}}</ref> The blue [[Army Service Uniform]] will remain as the dress uniform.

The U.S. Army's black beret is no longer worn with the ACU for garrison duty, having been permanently replaced with the patrol cap. After years of complaints that it was not suited well for most work conditions, Army chief of staff General [[Martin Dempsey]] eliminated it for wear with the ACU in June 2011. Soldiers who are currently in a unit in jump status still wear berets, whether the wearer is parachute-qualified or not (maroon beret), while members of [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]]s (SFABs) wear brown berets. Members of the 75th Ranger Regiment and the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade (tan beret) and Special Forces (rifle green beret) may wear it with the Army Service Uniform for non-ceremonial functions. Unit commanders may still direct the wear of patrol caps in these units in training environments or motor pools.\n\n===Tents===\nThe Army has relied heavily on [[tent]]s to provide the various facilities needed while on deployment (Force Provider Expeditionary (FPE)).<ref name=asawsh2018 />{{rp|p.146}} The most common tent uses for the military are as temporary [[barracks]] (sleeping quarters), [[Mess#U.S. Army|DFAC]] buildings (dining facilities),<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/209838/automated_meal_entitlement_system_food_trucks_to_improve_soldier_dining_experience Joe Lacdan (August 13, 2018) Automated meal entitlement system, food trucks to improve Soldier dining experience] Accomplishes paperwork reduction based on reading each soldier's Common Access Card at each use at DFAC.</ref> forward operating bases (FOBs), after action review (AAR), tactical operations center (TOC), morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities, as well as security checkpoints. Furthermore, most of these tents are set up and operated through the support of [[U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center|Natick Soldier Systems Center]].  Each FPE contains billeting, latrines, showers, laundry and kitchen facilities for 50\u2013150 Soldiers,<ref name=asawsh2018 />{{rp|p.146}} and is stored in [[Reorganization plan of United States Army#Prepositioned stocks|Army Prepositioned Stocks 1, 2, 4 and 5]].  This provisioning allows combatant commanders to position soldiers as required in their [[Area of Responsibility]], within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThe U.S. Army is beginning to use a more modern tent called the [[deployable rapid assembly shelter]] (DRASH). In 2008, DRASH became part of the Army's Standard Integrated Command Post System.<ref name=\"SICPS\">[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/06/18/NG-DHS-Technologies-to-support-SICPSTMSS/UPI-57811213812923/ NG, DHS Technologies to support SICPS/TMSS] United Press International</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[America's Army]]'' ([[Video game]]s for [[recruitment]])\n* [[Army CHESS]] (Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions)\n* [[Army National Guard]]\n* [[Comparative military ranks]]\n* [[History of the United States Army]]\n* [[List of active United States military aircraft]]\n* [[List of former United States Army medical units]]\n* [[List of wars involving the United States]]\n* [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)]]\n* [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] and [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]]\n* [[Soldier's Creed]]\n* [[Structure of the United States Army]]\n* [[Timeline of United States military operations]]\n* [[Transformation of the United States Army]]\n* [[U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System]]\n* [[U.S. Army Regimental System]]\n* [[United States Military Academy]]\n* [[United States Army Basic Training]]\n* [[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n* [[United States Volunteers]]\n* [[Vehicle markings of the United States military]]\n* [[Warrant Officer Candidate School (United States Army)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!-- ==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n-->\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{ACMH|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/branches.html|article=Army Birthdays}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Main list|Bibliography of United States military history}}{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite web |title=Desert Storm/Shield Valorous Unit Award (VUA) Citations|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/vua_citations.html|publisher=US Army Center of Military History|accessdate=26 December 2014}}\n* Bailey, Beth.

As the Revolutionary War progressed, [[Early Modern France|French]] aid, resources and military thinking helped shape the new army. A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], who taught [[Prussian Army]] tactics and organizational skills.\n\n[[File:Bataille Yorktown.jpg|thumb|left|The storming of Redoubt No. 10 in the [[Siege of Yorktown]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] prompted Great Britain's government to begin negotiations, resulting in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] and Great Britain's recognition of the United States as an independent state.]]\nThe army fought numerous pitched battles and in the South in 1780 and 1781, at times using the [[Fabian strategy]] and the [[hit-and-run tactics]], under the leadership of Major General [[Nathanael Greene]], hit where the British were weakest to wear down their forces. Washington led victories against the British at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]], but lost a series of battles in the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]] in 1776 and the [[Philadelphia campaign]] in 1777. With a decisive victory at [[siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] and the help of the French, the Continental Army prevailed against the British.\n\nAfter the war, the Continental Army was quickly given land certificates and disbanded in a reflection of the [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] distrust of standing armies. State militias became the new nation's sole ground army, with the exception of [[First American Regiment|a regiment]] to guard the [[Northwest Territory|Western Frontier]] and one battery of artillery guarding [[West Point]]'s arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], it was soon realized that it was necessary to field a trained standing army.

By march 1799 Congress created an \"Eventual Army\" of 30,000 men, including three regiments of cavalry. Both \"armies\" existed only on paper, but equipment for 3,000 men and horses was procured and stored.<ref>Gregory J.W.Urwin, ''The United States Cavalry: An Illustrated History, 1776-1944'', University of Oklahoma Press 2003 (1983), pp. 36\u201439</ref>\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Early wars on the Frontier====\n{{further|Army on the Frontier}}\n[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|right|General [[Andrew Jackson]] standing on the parapet of his makeshift defenses as his troops repulse attacking [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Highlanders]] during the [[Battle of New Orleans|defense of New Orleans]], the final major and most one-sided battle of the War of 1812]]\n\nThe [[War of 1812]], the second and last war between the United States and Great Britain, had mixed results.  The U.S. Army did not conquer Canada but it did destroy Native American resistance to expansion in the [[Old Northwest]] and it validated its independence by stopping two major British invasions in 1814 and 1815. After [[Battle of Lake Erie|taking control of Lake Erie]] in 1813, the U.S. Army seized parts of western Upper Canada, [[Battle of York|burned York]] and [[Battle of the Thames|defeated Tecumseh]], which caused his [[Western Confederacy]] to collapse. Following U.S. victories in the Canadian province of Upper Canada, British troops who had dubbed the U.S. Army \"Regulars, by God!\", were able to capture and [[Burning of Washington|burn Washington]], which was defended by militia, in 1814. The regular army, however proved they were professional and capable of defeating the British army during the [[Battle of Plattsburgh|invasions of Plattsburgh]] and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]], prompting British agreement on the previously rejected terms of a [[status quo]] ante bellum. Two weeks after a treaty was signed (but not ratified), [[Andrew Jackson]] defeated the British in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] and [[Siege of Fort St. Philip (1815)|Siege of Fort St. Philip]], and became a national hero. U.S. troops and sailors [[Capture of HMS Cyane and HMS Levant|captured HMS Cyane]], [[Capture of HMS Cyane and HMS Levant|Levant]] and [[Capture of HMS Cyane and HMS Levant|Penguin]] in the final engagements of the war. Per the treaty, both sides (the United States and Great Britain) returned to the geographical status quo. Both navies kept the warships they had seized during the conflict.\n\nThe army's major campaign against the Indians was fought in [[Florida]] against [[Seminole]]s. It took long wars (1818\u20131858) to finally defeat the Seminoles and move them to Oklahoma. The usual strategy in Indian wars was to seize control of the Indians' winter food supply, but that was no use in Florida where there was no winter. The second strategy was to form alliances with other Indian tribes, but that too was useless because the Seminoles had destroyed all the other Indians when they entered Florida in the late eighteenth century.<ref>Ron Field and Richard Hook, ''The Seminole Wars 1818\u201358'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army fought and won the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u20131848), which was a defining event for both countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/|title=The U.S.-Mexican War \u2013 PBS|work=pbs.org|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> The U.S. victory resulted in acquisition of territory that eventually became all or parts of the states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\n====American Civil War====\n{{further|Union Army}}\n[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L.

''The Atlas of the Civil War'', (Philadelphia, PA, 2010)</ref> The Confederates had the advantage of defending a large territory in an area where disease caused twice as many deaths as combat. The Union pursued a strategy of seizing the coastline, blockading the ports, and taking control of the river systems. By 1863, the Confederacy was being strangled. Its eastern armies fought well, but the western armies were defeated one after another until the Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 along with the Tennessee River.  In the [[Vicksburg Campaign]] of 1862\u20131863, General [[Ulysses Grant]] seized the [[Mississippi River]] and cut off the Southwest.  Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties, he had General [[Robert E. Lee]] under siege in Richmond as General [[William T. Sherman]] captured Atlanta and marched through Georgia and [[the Carolinas]].  The Confederate capital was abandoned in April 1865 and Lee subsequently surrendered his army at Appomattox Court House. All other Confederate armies surrendered within a few months.\n\nThe war remains the deadliest conflict in U.S. history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 men on both sides. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6.4% in [[Northern United States|the North]] and 18% in [[Southern United States|the South]].<ref>Maris Vinovskis (1990).

The loss of the divisions did not sit well with the states. Their objections included the inadequate maneuver element mix for those that remained and the end to the practice of rotating divisional commands among the states that supported them.

Since the 1933 amendment to the [[National Defense Act of 1916]], all Army National Guard soldiers have held dual status. They serve as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and as a reserve members of the U.S. Army under the authority of the president, in the Army National Guard of the United States.\n\nSince the adoption of the total force policy, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, reserve component soldiers have taken a more active role in U.S. military operations. For example, Reserve and Guard units took part in the [[Gulf War]], peacekeeping in [[Kosovo]], Afghanistan and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].\n\n===Army commands and army service component commands===\n[[File:Headquarters US Army SSI.png|25px]] [[United States Department of the Army|Headquarters, United States Department of the Army]] (HQDA):\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Army Commands\n!Current commander\n!Location of headquarters\n|-\n|[[File:United States Army Forces Command SSI.svg|20px]] [[United States Army Forces Command]] (FORSCOM) || GEN [[Michael X.

Both reserve components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month \u2013 known as [[Battle Assembly|battle assemblies]] or unit training assemblies (UTAs) \u2013 and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]] of the [[United States Code]], while the National Guard is organized under [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32]]. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the U.S. Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors.

The central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular, i.e., all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division. As specified before the 2013 end-strength re-definitions, the three major types of ground combat brigades are:\n* [[Brigade Combat Team#Heavy brigade combat team|Armored]] brigades, with strength of 4,743 troops as of 2014.\n* [[Stryker Brigade Combat Team|Stryker]] brigades, with strength of 4,500 troops as of 2014.\n* [[Brigade Combat Team#Infantry Brigade Combat Team|Infantry]] brigades, with strength of 4,413 troops as of 2014.\n\nIn addition, there are combat support and service support modular brigades. Combat support brigades include [[Combat Aviation Brigade|aviation]] (CAB) brigades, which will come in heavy and light varieties, [[Fires Brigade|fires]] (artillery) brigades (now transforms to division artillery) and [[Battlefield Surveillance Brigade|expeditionary military intelligence brigades]]. [[Combat service support]] brigades include [[Sustainment Brigade|sustainment]] brigades and come in several varieties and serve the standard support role in an army.\n\n===Combat maneuver organizations===\n:''To track the effects of the 2018 budget cuts, see [[Transformation of the United States Army#Divisions and brigades]]''\nThe U.S. Army currently consists of 10 active divisions and one deployable division headquarters (7th Infantry Division) as well as several independent units.

In June 2013, the Army announced plans to downsize to 32 active combat brigade teams by 2015 to match a reduction in active duty strength to 490,000 soldiers. Army chief of staff Raymond Odierno projected that the Army was to shrink to \"450,000 in the active component, 335,000 in the National Guard and 195,000 in U.S. Army Reserve\" by 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/140768/CSA__SMA_hold_virtual_town_hall/|title=CSA Odierno and SMA Chandler virtual town hall, Jan 6, 2015|publisher=Army.mil|date=|accessdate=2 May 2016}}</ref> However, this plan was scrapped by the new administration and now the Army plans to grow by 16,000 soldiers to a total of 476,000 by October 2017.

[[Basic training]] consists of 10&nbsp;weeks \"this does not include processing & out-processing\" most recruits followed by Advanced Individualized Training (AIT) where they receive training for their [[List of United States Army careers|military occupational specialties (MOS)]]. Some individual's MOSs range anywhere from 14\u201320 weeks of One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines Basic Training and AIT. The length of AIT school varies by the MOS. The length of time spent in AIT depends on the MOS of the soldier and some highly technical MOS training may require many months (e.g., foreign language translators). Depending on the needs of the army, [[United States Army Basic Training#Basic Combat Training|Basic Combat Training]] for combat arms soldiers is conducted at a number of locations, but two of the longest-running are the Armor School and the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], both at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia. Sergeant Major of the Army Dailey notes that an infantrymen's pilot program for [[One Station Unit Training]] (OSUT) extends 8 weeks beyond Basic Training and AIT, to 22 weeks. The pilot, designed to boost infantry readiness, is due to end in December 2018.

The smallest of these is the 60&nbsp;mm [[M224 mortar|M224]], normally assigned at the infantry company level.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m224.html M224], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> At the next higher echelon, infantry battalions are typically supported by a section of 81&nbsp;mm [[M252 mortar]]s.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m252.html M252], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> The largest mortar in the army's inventory is the 120&nbsp;mm [[M120 mortar|M120/M121]], usually employed by mechanized units.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m120.html M120], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref>\n\nFire support for light infantry units is provided by towed howitzers, including the 105&nbsp;mm [[M119 howitzer|M119A1]]<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/indirect/m119.html M119], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> and the 155&nbsp;mm [[M777 howitzer|M777]] (which will replace the [[M198 howitzer|M198]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/lw155.htm|title=M777 Lightweight 155mm howitzer (LW155)|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army utilizes a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an Anti-Armor Capability. The [[AT4]] is an unguided projectile that can destroy armor and bunkers at ranges up to 500 meters. The [[FIM-92 Stinger]] is a shoulder-launched, heat seeking anti-aircraft missile. The [[FGM-148 Javelin]] and [[BGM-71 TOW]] are anti-tank guided missiles.\n\n===Vehicles===\n[[File:Patrol in Iraq, March 2008.jpg|thumb|A U.S. soldier on patrol with the support of a [[Humvee]] vehicle]]\n\nU.S. Army doctrine puts a premium on mechanized warfare.

These include the [[AH-64 Apache]] [[attack helicopter]],<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/aircraft/apache.html Apache], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> the [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] utility tactical transport helicopter<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/aircraft/blackhawk.html Blackhawk], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> and the [[CH-47 Chinook]] heavy-lift transport helicopter.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/factfiles/equipment/aircraft/chinook.html Chinook], U.S. Army Fact Files</ref> Restructuring plans call for reduction of 750 aircraft and from 7 to 4 types.<ref>{{citation|last=Stevenson|first=Beth|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-army-continues-to-face-financial-challenge-of-rotary-fleet-408160/|title= US Army continues to face financial challenge of rotary fleet maintenance|work=[[Flightglobal]]|publisher=Reed Business Information|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=23 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123011643/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/us-army-continues-to-face-financial-challenge-of-rotary-fleet-408160/|archivedate=23 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Johnson-McConnell agreement of 1966]], the Army agreed to limit its fixed-wing aviation role to administrative mission support (light unarmed aircraft which cannot operate from forward positions). For [[UAV]]s, the Army is deploying at least one company of drone [[MQ-1C Gray Eagle]]s to each Active Army division.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2015/01/08/army-to-build-dedicated-drone-runway-at-fort-bliss/|title=Army to build dedicated drone runway at Fort Bliss|first=Kyle|last=Jahner|date=7 August 2017|website=Army Times}}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\n{{main|Uniforms of the United States Army}}\n[[File:Army greens.jpg|thumb|The 2020 Army Greens uniform]]\n\nThe [[Army Combat Uniform]] (ACU) currently features a camouflage pattern known as [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]] (OCP); OCP replaced a pixel-based pattern known as [[Universal Camouflage Pattern]] (UCP) in 2019.\n\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-6.jpeg|thumb|An element of the [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]], wearing ASUs, representing the United States at the 2010 Victory Day commemoration in [[Moscow]]]]\n\nOn 11 November 2018, the Army announced a new version of 'Army Greens' based on uniforms worn during World War II will become the standard garrison service uniform.<ref name=ArmyGreens>{{Cite web|url=https://www.army.mil/article/213650/us_army_to_roll_out_new_army_greens_uniform|title=U.S. Army to roll out new Army Greens uniform|website=Army.mil}}</ref> The blue [[Army Service Uniform]] will remain as the dress uniform.

The U.S. Army's black beret is no longer worn with the ACU for garrison duty, having been permanently replaced with the patrol cap. After years of complaints that it was not suited well for most work conditions, Army chief of staff General [[Martin Dempsey]] eliminated it for wear with the ACU in June 2011. Soldiers who are currently in a unit in jump status still wear berets, whether the wearer is parachute-qualified or not (maroon beret), while members of [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]]s (SFABs) wear brown berets. Members of the 75th Ranger Regiment and the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade (tan beret) and Special Forces (rifle green beret) may wear it with the Army Service Uniform for non-ceremonial functions. Unit commanders may still direct the wear of patrol caps in these units in training environments or motor pools.\n\n===Tents===\nThe Army has relied heavily on [[tent]]s to provide the various facilities needed while on deployment (Force Provider Expeditionary (FPE)).<ref name=asawsh2018 />{{rp|p.146}} The most common tent uses for the military are as temporary [[barracks]] (sleeping quarters), [[Mess#U.S. Army|DFAC]] buildings (dining facilities),<ref>[https://www.army.mil/article/209838/automated_meal_entitlement_system_food_trucks_to_improve_soldier_dining_experience Joe Lacdan (August 13, 2018) Automated meal entitlement system, food trucks to improve Soldier dining experience] Accomplishes paperwork reduction based on reading each soldier's Common Access Card at each use at DFAC.</ref> forward operating bases (FOBs), after action review (AAR), tactical operations center (TOC), morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities, as well as security checkpoints. Furthermore, most of these tents are set up and operated through the support of [[U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center|Natick Soldier Systems Center]].  Each FPE contains billeting, latrines, showers, laundry and kitchen facilities for 50\u2013150 Soldiers,<ref name=asawsh2018 />{{rp|p.146}} and is stored in [[Reorganization plan of United States Army#Prepositioned stocks|Army Prepositioned Stocks 1, 2, 4 and 5]].  This provisioning allows combatant commanders to position soldiers as required in their [[Area of Responsibility]], within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThe U.S. Army is beginning to use a more modern tent called the [[deployable rapid assembly shelter]] (DRASH). In 2008, DRASH became part of the Army's Standard Integrated Command Post System.<ref name=\"SICPS\">[http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2008/06/18/NG-DHS-Technologies-to-support-SICPSTMSS/UPI-57811213812923/ NG, DHS Technologies to support SICPS/TMSS] United Press International</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* ''[[America's Army]]'' ([[Video game]]s for [[recruitment]])\n* [[Army CHESS]] (Computer Hardware Enterprise Software and Solutions)\n* [[Army National Guard]]\n* [[Comparative military ranks]]\n* [[History of the United States Army]]\n* [[List of active United States military aircraft]]\n* [[List of former United States Army medical units]]\n* [[List of wars involving the United States]]\n* [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)]]\n* [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] and [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps]]\n* [[Soldier's Creed]]\n* [[Structure of the United States Army]]\n* [[Timeline of United States military operations]]\n* [[Transformation of the United States Army]]\n* [[U.S. Army Combat Arms Regimental System]]\n* [[U.S. Army Regimental System]]\n* [[United States Military Academy]]\n* [[United States Army Basic Training]]\n* [[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n* [[United States Volunteers]]\n* [[Vehicle markings of the United States military]]\n* [[Warrant Officer Candidate School (United States Army)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<!-- ==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n-->\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{ACMH|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/faq/branches.html|article=Army Birthdays}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Main list|Bibliography of United States military history}}{{Library resources box}}\n* {{cite web |title=Desert Storm/Shield Valorous Unit Award (VUA) Citations|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/vua_citations.html|publisher=US Army Center of Military History|accessdate=26 December 2014}}\n* Bailey, Beth.

Under the terms of the peace agreement, a [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (2005\u201311)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]] was created and run by the SPLM with a promise that a referendum would be held on independence in 2011. During the six years period of autonomy, the desire for independence kept in-fighting within the SPLM in check, but disputes arose over how to share the oil revenues.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=176}} Between 2006-2009, sells of oil brought in an annual average of $2.1 billion U.S dollars to the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=176}} Disputes between leading personalities in the SPLM over how to appropriate the oil revenues led to recurring tensions.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=176}} After the 2011 referendum led to 98% of voters choosing independence from the Sudan, on 9 July 2011 South Sudan became an independent nation.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=206}}\n\nIn 2010, after a disputed election, [[George Athor]] led the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement]] in rebellion against the government. The same year, a faction of the South Sudan Democratic Movement, called the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A - Cobra Faction|Cobra Faction]], led by [[David Yau Yau]] rebelled against the government they accused of being prejudiced against the [[Murle people|Murle]]. His faction signed a cease-fire with the government in 2011 and his militia was reintegrated into the army but he then defected again in 2012. After the army's notorious [[Shilluk people#violence|2010 disarmament campaign]] with widespread abuses of the [[Shilluk people]], who were alleging persecution by the ruling [[Dinka]], [[John Uliny]] from the Shilluk people began a rebellion, leading the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction|Upper Nile faction]] of the South Sudan Democratic Movement. [[Gabriel Tang]], who led a militia allied to Khartoum during the Second Sudanese Civil War, clashed regularly with the SPLA until 2011 when his soldiers were reintegrated into the national army. In 2011, [[Peter Gadet]] led a rebellion with the [[South Sudan Liberation Army]], but was reintegrated into the army the same year.

Under the terms of the peace agreement, a [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (2005\u201311)|Southern Sudan Autonomous Region]] was created and run by the SPLM with a promise that a referendum would be held on independence in 2011. During the six years period of autonomy, the desire for independence kept in-fighting within the SPLM in check, but disputes arose over how to share the oil revenues.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=176}} Between 2006-2009, sells of oil brought in an annual average of $2.1 billion U.S dollars to the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=176}} Disputes between leading personalities in the SPLM over how to appropriate the oil revenues led to recurring tensions.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=176}} After the 2011 referendum led to 98% of voters choosing independence from the Sudan, on 9 July 2011 South Sudan became an independent nation.{{sfn|Martell|2019|p=206}}\n\nIn 2010, after a disputed election, [[George Athor]] led the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement]] in rebellion against the government. The same year, a faction of the South Sudan Democratic Movement, called the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A - Cobra Faction|Cobra Faction]], led by [[David Yau Yau]] rebelled against the government they accused of being prejudiced against the [[Murle people|Murle]]. His faction signed a cease-fire with the government in 2011 and his militia was reintegrated into the army but he then defected again in 2012. After the army's notorious [[Shilluk people#violence|2010 disarmament campaign]] with widespread abuses of the [[Shilluk people]], who were alleging persecution by the ruling [[Dinka]], [[John Uliny]] from the Shilluk people began a rebellion, leading the [[South Sudan Democratic Movement#SSDM/A-Upper Nile faction|Upper Nile faction]] of the South Sudan Democratic Movement. [[Gabriel Tang]], who led a militia allied to Khartoum during the Second Sudanese Civil War, clashed regularly with the SPLA until 2011 when his soldiers were reintegrated into the national army. In 2011, [[Peter Gadet]] led a rebellion with the [[South Sudan Liberation Army]], but was reintegrated into the army the same year.

The most successful English manager in the 2000\u201301 Premier League campaign was [[Peter Reid]], whose [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] side finished seventh, having spent most of the season challenging for a place in Europe, and briefly occupied second place in the Premier League table.\n\nDespite the success achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson and [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]], the Manager of the Year Award went to [[George Burley]]. The [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] manager was in charge of a newly promoted side who began the season as relegation favourites and on a limited budget, guided his team to fifth place in the Premier League final table earning a total of 66 points - the highest total in Premier League history for a newly promoted side since the switch to a 20-team format -- and a place in the UEFA Cup for the first time in almost 20 years. 2000\u201301 was perhaps the best season yet for newly promoted teams in the Premier League. [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] finished ninth, their highest finish since the 1950s. The only newly promoted team to suffer relegation was [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who in the space of six seasons had now been relegated three times and promoted twice. Relegated in bottom place were [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], whose return to the top division after almost 80 years was over after just two seasons. The next relegation place went to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who were finally relegated after 34 successive seasons of top division football, which had brought numerous relegation battles and league finishes no higher than sixth place.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1999\u20132000 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], returning after a top flight absence of one, four and five years respectively.

Premiership''' for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth FA Premier League season and the third season running which ended with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as champions and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as runners-up. [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] became the first manager to win three successive English league titles with the same club. Liverpool, meanwhile, managed a unique cup treble \u2013 winning the [[FA Cup]], [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] and [[UEFA Cup]]. They also finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] replaced [[Mitre Sports International|Mitre]] as manufacturer of the official Premier League match ball, a contract that has since been extended multiple times, with the most recent renewal made in November 2018 to the end of the 2024\u201325 season.<ref>[https://www.premierleague.com/news/903532]</ref>\n\nUEFA Cup places went to [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], who qualified via the [[Intertoto Cup]]. None of the top six clubs in the Premier League had an English manager. The most successful English manager in the 2000\u201301 Premier League campaign was [[Peter Reid]], whose [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] side finished seventh, having spent most of the season challenging for a place in Europe, and briefly occupied second place in the Premier League table.\n\nDespite the success achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson and [[G\u00e9rard Houllier]], the Manager of the Year Award went to [[George Burley]]. The [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] manager was in charge of a newly promoted side who began the season as relegation favourites and on a limited budget, guided his team to fifth place in the Premier League final table earning a total of 66 points - the highest total in Premier League history for a newly promoted side since the switch to a 20-team format -- and a place in the UEFA Cup for the first time in almost 20 years. 2000\u201301 was perhaps the best season yet for newly promoted teams in the Premier League. [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] finished ninth, their highest finish since the 1950s. The only newly promoted team to suffer relegation was [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], who in the space of six seasons had now been relegated three times and promoted twice. Relegated in bottom place were [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], whose return to the top division after almost 80 years was over after just two seasons. The next relegation place went to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who were finally relegated after 34 successive seasons of top division football, which had brought numerous relegation battles and league finishes no higher than sixth place.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1999\u20132000 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], returning after a top flight absence of one, four and five years respectively. They replaced [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]]. They were relegated after spending fourteen, nine and one year in the top flight respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2000\u201301 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.509103 |long=-1.884786 |label_size=80|label=[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.804222 |long=-1.759022 |label_size=80|label=[[Bradford City A.F.C.|{{nowrap|Bradford City}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.448111 |long=-1.495611 |label_size=80|label=[[Coventry City F.C.|{{nowrap|Coventry City}}]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.914911 |long=-1.447233 |label_size=80|label=[[Derby County F.C.|{{nowrap|Derby County}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.055061 |long=1.144831  |label_size=80|label=[[Ipswich Town F.C.|{{nowrap|Ipswich Town}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.611402 |long=-1.082508 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;City}}]]<br>[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.578219 |long=-1.216822 |label_size=80|label=[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974    |long=-1.614    |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.914400 |long=-1.388200 |label_size=80|label=[[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]|position=bottom}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]<br/>\n[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]\n|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.4863   |long=0.0363    |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.531944 |long=0.039444|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
