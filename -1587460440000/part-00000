Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts. They marry then and there for the fourth time.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/cast/653/Tina_Lord Tina Lord profile - Soaps.com]\n* [http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/whoswho/tina.php Tina Clayton Lord profile - SoapCentral.com]\n* [http://llanviewlabyrinth.webs.com/notoriouslyremembered/1968_1989/remembered_tinalord.html Notoriously Remembered: Tina Lord]\n* [http://soapnet.go.com/soapnet/gallery/path-galleryNum_1667/category_shows/subcategory_daytimeemmysredcarpet2008 \"''OLTL'''s Tina Lord: Through the Years.\" (Photo gallery) - SOAPnet.com]\n\n{{One Life to Live}}\n{{Tina Lord actresses}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord, Tina}}\n[[Category:Fictional socialites]]\n[[Category:One Life to Live characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1978]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox soap character\n| name           = Tina Lord\n| series         = One Life to Live\n| portrayer      = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Andrea Evans]] (1978\u20131981, 1985\u20131990, 2008\u20132011)\n* [[Kelli Maroney]] (1984)\n* [[Marsha Clark]] (1984\u20131985)\n* [[Karen Witter]] (1990\u20131994)\n* [[Krista Tesreau]] (1994\u20131997)\n}}\n| first          = {{start date|1978|07|2}}\n| last           = {{end date|2011|11|15}}\n| years          = {{Flatlist|\n* 1978\u20131981\n* 1984\u20131997\n* 2008\n* 2011\n}}\n| creator        = [[Gordon Russell (writer)|Gordon Russell]]\n| introducer     = {{Plainlist|\n* Joseph Stuart\n* [[Paul Rauch]] (1984)\n* [[Frank Valentini]] (2008, 2011)\n}}\n| classification = [[List of One Life to Live characters|Past; recurring]]\n| image1         = Tina-AndreaEvans-2008-06-11.jpg\n| caption1       = Andrea Evans as Tina Lord\n| image2         = Tina-KarenWitter-1990.jpg\n| caption2       = Karen Witter as Tina Lord\n| image3         = Tina-Krista_Tesreau-1995.jpg\n| caption3       = Krista Tesreau as Tina Lord\n| alias          = {{Plainlist|\n* Tina Clayton\n* Tina Roberts\n* Tina Rogan\n* Tina Vickers\n}}\n| occupation     = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Socialite]]\n* [[Trustee]] to the [[Lord family]] estate\n* Crown Princess \n* Personal shopper\n* Interior designer\n}}\n| family         = [[Lord family|Lord]]\n| father         = [[Victor Lord]]\n| mother         = [[Irene Manning (One Life to Live)|Irene Manning Lord]]\n| stepfather     = [[Ted Clayton (One Life to Live)|Ted Clayton]]\n| brothers       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Todd Manning]]\n* [[Victor Lord, Jr.]]\n}}\n| halfbrothers   = [[Tony Lord (One Life to Live)|Tony Lord]]\n| halfsisters    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Victoria Lord]]\n* [[Meredith Lord]]\n}}\n| spouse         = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Cord Roberts]] (1986\u20131993, 2011){{efn|The first ceremony for Cord and Tina was in 1986.

She makes fast friends with Natalie, a relative newcomer and former fellow \"black sheep of the family,\" but Tina's once-loving relationship with Jessica is now fractious and antagonistic. Stunned by Jessica's cold and rude behavior, Tina is unaware that Jessica is actually \"Tess,\" her dangerous alternate personality, who has secretly emerged from Jessica's psyche to take control and seek revenge on Natalie and her lover [[Jared Banks]], whom Tess blames for the death of [[Nash Brennan]], Jessica's husband and the love of Tess's life. As Tina settles into Llanfair, she takes care to hide the stolen Mendorran Crown Jewels in Viki's wall safe, fearing she will be apprehended by international authorities. Tina grows increasingly suspicious of \"Jessica's\" strange actions when she discovers her niece has ordered construction to be done in the Llanfair basement. \"Jessica\" claims the construction work is a surprise for the family, but when Tina and her beloved [[shih tzu]] \"David Vickers\" go snooping in the basement, they discover the soundproofed secret room Tess has built below the house. Tina reflects on her memories of her father Victor Lord's own secret room, and its significance to Viki and her own alternate personalities, one of whom had imprisoned Dorian Lord below Llanfair. Remembering her own complicated relationship with Viki's alters such as Niki Smith, Tina realizes that Tess has emerged. Before Tina can alert the family, Tess traps her in the secret room.<ref>[http://www.soaps.com/onelifetolive/update/5128/Enjoy_Your_New_Digs ''One Life to Live'' recap (9/3/08) - Soaps.com]</ref> Tess discovers the jewels in the safe and threatens to not only tell the authorities, but a vengeful Carlo as well. Fearing for herself and especially Sarah, Tina begrudgingly agrees to not only stay quiet, but to help Tess drag a drugged Natalie down into the secret room. A guilty Tina tries to thwart Tess several times, but is always caught; Tina sends Jared down to the basement to find Natalie, but Tess traps him as well. Viki returns to town in time to realize that Tess is on the loose. With a bomb set to go off, Tina leads Viki and Jared's father [[Charlie Banks (One Life to Live)|Charlie Banks]] down to the secret room in time to save Natalie and Jared.

She is shocked to discover that her mother Irene is alive and well, and that the brother who has just died is not Todd, but his secret twin brother, [[Victor Lord, Jr.|Victor Lord, Jr]]. Victor has left everything to Irene. Tina sees Cord at Llanfair, but he is still angry at her for endangering other members of the family with her schemes during her 2008 visit. Tina's dog goes missing, and the search for him brings Tina and Cord closer. They reminisce about their past together and nearly kiss, but are interrupted by Clint. Tina and Viki talk about their troubled relationship, mostly influenced by Tina's many past mistakes, but the sisters decide to put the past aside. Tina's dog returns. Tina and Cord nearly get intimate with each other again after they babysit Jessica and [[Robert Ford (One Life to Live)|Robert Ford]]'s son [[Ryder Ford|Ryder]], but Natalie interrupts them. Natalie confronts Tina for being partly responsible for having her locked in the basement by Tess. Tina apologizes to Natalie, and offers to plan Natalie's upcoming wedding with [[Brody Lovett]]. Natalie accepts. Viki tells Tina that she is pushing too hard to rekindle things with Cord. Tina and Cord hash out their problems in the stables, but end up having sex. Cord tells Tina that despite this, he does not know if he can trust her again. Tina vows to regain his trust. Her commitment to changing is tested when she inherits all of Victor Jr.'s fortune, Irene's money, and ''The Sun'' newspaper. Tina is elated to be rich at last, but recalls her intentions to not be fueled by greed and hands over both fortunes and ''The Sun'' to Todd, the rightful owner. Todd, Viki, and Victor Jr.'s widow [[T\u00e9a Delgado]] are pleasantly surprised. Cord learns of Tina's benevolence, the two declare their love and share a passionate kiss. On November 15, 2011, Tina interrupts Natalie and Brody's wedding with the missing paternity test results proving that Natalie's ex-boyfriend [[John McBain (character)|John McBain]], not Brody, is the father of Natalie's baby [[Liam McBain|Liam]]. The wedding is called off. Cord proposes to Tina, who accepts.

At the height of its electoral success, the party had six [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs) and two councillors, but since 2017 it has had no councillors or MSPs.\n\n== Democratic structures ==\nThe party has two national co-spokespersons, Colin Fox and [[R\u00f3is\u00edn McLaren]],<ref name=\"auto\"/> who are elected by party members at the annual national conference, which also determines party policy. The day-to-day business of the party is handled by a small Executive Committee, which is also elected by the membership. The primary decision-making bodies are the following:\n* National Conference, convening yearly\n* National Council, convening four times a year\n* Executive Committee, convening regularly\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the Scottish Socialist Party}}\n\n=== Formation and initial electoral success ===\nThe Scottish Socialist Party emerged from the [[Scottish Socialist Alliance]] (SSA), a broad-based group of left-wing organisations in Scotland. The decision was taken to transform the SSA into a party to contest the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections to the new Scottish Parliament]], where the SSP polled well and saw [[Tommy Sheridan]], then convener of the party, elected in [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliamentary Electoral Area)|Glasgow]]. The period following that election saw sustained growth for the SSP, where it doubled in size in twelve months, and the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]] trade union affiliated to the party. In [[2003 Scottish Parliament election|2003]], the SSP was buoyed by the election of five additional MSPs across Scotland.\n\nThe party changed the character of Scottish politics by winning widespread electoral support and demonstrating how socialist ideas could be popularly presented. One of the first bills the SSP put forward in Holyrood was the [[Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001]], a popular action which successfully transformed debt recovery systems in Scotland. The party also presented bills to replace the council tax with an income-based alternative,<ref name=\"taxplan\"/> for the abolition of prescription charges,<ref name=\"prescriptions\" /> and the introduction of free school meals.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2054832.stm|title=Free school meals move fails|date=20 June 2002|accessdate=5 June 2014|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n{{wikinews|Scottish Socialist Party to split as Sheridan launches new party}}\nOn 11 November 2004, Sheridan resigned as convener of the party, citing personal reasons.

The decision was taken to transform the SSA into a party to contest the [[1999 Scottish Parliament election|first elections to the new Scottish Parliament]], where the SSP polled well and saw [[Tommy Sheridan]], then convener of the party, elected in [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliamentary Electoral Area)|Glasgow]]. The period following that election saw sustained growth for the SSP, where it doubled in size in twelve months, and the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers|RMT]] trade union affiliated to the party.

While prisons are considered punishment, they also are intended to have the purpose of future crime prevention. A recent study found that of $74 billion total spent on incarceration among federal, state and local prisons, less than 1% of that was spent on prevention and treatment. Incarceration not only harms the individual as intended, but also has unintended negative effects on the inmate's family, community, and overall society. Inmate education has been shown to reduce recidivism. Evidence shows that inmates overwhelmingly take advantage of education programs if they are available to them and if they can afford them. A recent study showed the earning a GED while incarcerate reduced recidivism rates by 14% for those under 21, and 5% for those over 21. Substance abuse is also a major issue in the prison system. Between 1996 and 2006, despite a modest population increase of 12%, the number of incarcerated individuals rose by 33% and the number of substance-abusing individuals rose by 43%. Existing treatment programs have shown solid evidence that drug treatment programs, along with support after release, are effective at reducing recidivism. Emotional and mental health counseling is a core component of successful inmate rehabilitation. Without the proper innate motivation and desire from the inmate, attempts to educate or assist with substance abuse are less effective. A study revealed that more than half of those incarcerated had a mental health problem, defined as a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem within the previous 12 months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reich |first=Jacob | title=The Economic Impact of Prison Rehabilitation Programs | website=Wharton Public Policy Initative | date=17 August 2017 | url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2059-the-economic-impact-of-prison-rehabilitation | access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref> [[California|California's]] [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile justice]] system is based on rehabilitation instead of [[Criminal punishment|punishment]].<ref>{{cite web |title= California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 202 |url= http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&sectionNum=202. |publisher= [[California Office of Legislative Counsel]] |accessdate= 2018-09-30 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Psychopathy and recidivism==\nCriminal [[recidivism]] is highly correlated with [[psychopathy]].<ref name=\"Jill S.

Some rehabilitative programs, such as [[drug court]]s, have also been criticized for [[net-widening effect|widening the net]] of penal control by sentencing more defendants to prison for violations of treatment regimes than would have gone to prison in the absence of those programs.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1893&context=journal_articles|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1\u201322}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antisocial personality disorder]]\n*[[Exodus Ministries]]\n*[[Koestler Trust]]\n*[[Susanna Meredith]]\n*[[Psychopathy]]\n*[[Recidivism]]\n*[[Rehabilitation Policy]]\n*[[Social integration]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000.

While prisons are considered punishment, they also are intended to have the purpose of future crime prevention. A recent study found that of $74 billion total spent on incarceration among federal, state and local prisons, less than 1% of that was spent on prevention and treatment. Incarceration not only harms the individual as intended, but also has unintended negative effects on the inmate's family, community, and overall society. Inmate education has been shown to reduce recidivism. Evidence shows that inmates overwhelmingly take advantage of education programs if they are available to them and if they can afford them. A recent study showed the earning a GED while incarcerate reduced recidivism rates by 14% for those under 21, and 5% for those over 21. Substance abuse is also a major issue in the prison system. Between 1996 and 2006, despite a modest population increase of 12%, the number of incarcerated individuals rose by 33% and the number of substance-abusing individuals rose by 43%. Existing treatment programs have shown solid evidence that drug treatment programs, along with support after release, are effective at reducing recidivism. Emotional and mental health counseling is a core component of successful inmate rehabilitation. Without the proper innate motivation and desire from the inmate, attempts to educate or assist with substance abuse are less effective. A study revealed that more than half of those incarcerated had a mental health problem, defined as a recent history or symptoms of a mental health problem within the previous 12 months.<ref>{{cite web |last=Reich |first=Jacob | title=The Economic Impact of Prison Rehabilitation Programs | website=Wharton Public Policy Initative | date=17 August 2017 | url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/2059-the-economic-impact-of-prison-rehabilitation | access-date=24 March 2020}}</ref> [[California|California's]] [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile justice]] system is based on rehabilitation instead of [[Criminal punishment|punishment]].<ref>{{cite web |title= California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 202 |url= http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&sectionNum=202. |publisher= [[California Office of Legislative Counsel]] |accessdate= 2018-09-30 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Psychopathy and recidivism==\nCriminal [[recidivism]] is highly correlated with [[psychopathy]].<ref name=\"Jill S.

Psychopathic individuals have been regularly observed to become more cunning and better able to hide their behaviour.

Moreover, [[due process]] concerns can be implicated by a lack of traditional safeguards of defendants' procedural rights in rehabilitative processes. Some rehabilitative programs, such as [[drug court]]s, have also been criticized for [[net-widening effect|widening the net]] of penal control by sentencing more defendants to prison for violations of treatment regimes than would have gone to prison in the absence of those programs.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1893&context=journal_articles|title=The changing purposes of criminal punishment: A retrospective on the past century and some thoughts about the next|author=Alschuler, Albert|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Winter 2003|volume=70|number=1|pages=1\u201322}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antisocial personality disorder]]\n*[[Exodus Ministries]]\n*[[Koestler Trust]]\n*[[Susanna Meredith]]\n*[[Psychopathy]]\n*[[Recidivism]]\n*[[Rehabilitation Policy]]\n*[[Social integration]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000.

The full title was \"Walwyn's Wiles, or the Manifestators manifested, ... declaring the subtle and crafy wiles, the atheistical, blasphemous soul-murdering principles and practices of Mr William Walwyn\". Walwyn's Wiles was a response to the jointly signed Leveller pamphlet \"A Manifestation\" (April 14, 1649) which whilst it denied that they intended to level men's estates also stood firm on the principles outlined in ''[[The Agreement of the People]]''. \n\nIn the ten pages of ''Wiles'' Walwyn is variously described as a [[Jesuit]], a [[bigamist]], of having persuaded a woman to commit suicide, and that he would \"destroy all government\", that he had said \"that it would never be well until all things were common\", and that he had also said that there would be \"no need for judges ... take any other tradesman that is an honest and just man and let him hear the case\".\n\nIn response Walwyn published two pamphlets \"The Fountain of Slaunder Discovered\" in which he defended his morality, and which had written a year before but held back from publication. The second pamphlet was a direct response to ''Wiles'' as its full title \"Walwyns Just Defence against the Aspertions Cast upon him, in a Late Un-Christian Pamphlet Entitled, Walwyns Wiles\" makes clear. The ''Just Defence'' contains a great deal of detail of the Leveller movement and the Independents from 1646 onwards.\n\n==Works==\n\nPolitical and Religious Writing\n* A New Petition of the Papists 1641\n* Some Considerations Tending to the Undeceiving Those, Whose Judgements Are Misinformed 1642\n* The Power of Love 1643\n* The Compassionate Samaritane 1644\n* Good Counsell to All 1644\n* A Help to the Right Understanding of a Discourse Concerning Independency 1644/5\n* [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/texts/englands-lamentable-slaverie.htm Englands Lamentable Slaverie] 1645\n* [http://www.constitution.org/lev/eng_lev_02.htm Tolleration Justified and Persecution Condemned] 1645/6\n* A Whisper in the Eare of Mr. Thomas Edwards, Minister 1645/6\n* A Word More to Mr Thomas Edwards ...

The full title was \"Walwyn's Wiles, or the Manifestators manifested, ... declaring the subtle and crafy wiles, the atheistical, blasphemous soul-murdering principles and practices of Mr William Walwyn\". Walwyn's Wiles was a response to the jointly signed Leveller pamphlet \"A Manifestation\" (April 14, 1649) which whilst it denied that they intended to level men's estates also stood firm on the principles outlined in ''[[The Agreement of the People]]''. \n\nIn the ten pages of ''Wiles'' Walwyn is variously described as a [[Jesuit]], a [[bigamist]], of having persuaded a woman to commit suicide, and that he would \"destroy all government\", that he had said \"that it would never be well until all things were common\", and that he had also said that there would be \"no need for judges ... take any other tradesman that is an honest and just man and let him hear the case\".\n\nIn response Walwyn published two pamphlets \"The Fountain of Slaunder Discovered\" in which he defended his morality, and which had written a year before but held back from publication. The second pamphlet was a direct response to ''Wiles'' as its full title \"Walwyns Just Defence against the Aspertions Cast upon him, in a Late Un-Christian Pamphlet Entitled, Walwyns Wiles\" makes clear. The ''Just Defence'' contains a great deal of detail of the Leveller movement and the Independents from 1646 onwards.\n\n==Works==\n\nPolitical and Religious Writing\n* A New Petition of the Papists 1641\n* Some Considerations Tending to the Undeceiving Those, Whose Judgements Are Misinformed 1642\n* The Power of Love 1643\n* The Compassionate Samaritane 1644\n* Good Counsell to All 1644\n* A Help to the Right Understanding of a Discourse Concerning Independency 1644/5\n* [http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/texts/englands-lamentable-slaverie.htm Englands Lamentable Slaverie] 1645\n* [http://www.constitution.org/lev/eng_lev_02.htm Tolleration Justified and Persecution Condemned] 1645/6\n* A Whisper in the Eare of Mr. Thomas Edwards, Minister 1645/6\n* A Word More to Mr Thomas Edwards ...

After the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]], Petrovi\u0107 was sacked as the manager and [[Yin Tiesheng]] was announced as the team's caretaker.\n\n===Gao Hongbo era===\nIn April 2009, China appointed the young [[Gao Hongbo]] as the new manager, replacing [[Yin Tiesheng]]. His arrival saw China opt for a new strategy, turning towards ground passing tactics and adopting the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation. It was noted that Chinese footballers had relied too heavily on the long ball tactic for almost a decade. Wei Di, the chief of the [[Chinese Football Association]], stressed that, \"Anytime, no matter win or loss, they must show their team spirit and courage. I hope, after one year's effort, the national team can give the public a new image.\"<ref name=\"WeiDi\">{{cite web|title=New boss vows to revive China's football in 5 years |url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2010-02/02/content_9417417.htm |publisher=CHINAdaily |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606235528/http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2010-02/02/content_9417417.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nUnder Gao, China drew its first game against Germany 1\u20131 in May 2009. Afterwards, China were able to gain 13 points in the during the qualification process for the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]]. This led to a revival in interest amongst some Chinese football fans as China had also won 1\u20130 against France in June 2010 as well as holding [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-finalists [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] to a 1\u20131 draw in September 2010. This led to some supporters even thinking that reaching the semifinals of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup was possible; however, China were knocked out in the group stages during the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. This led to some discontent amongst Chinese fans and it seemed that this was the reason that eventually led to the sacking of Gao as manager by the Chinese Football Association. Although Gao's winning percentage (65%) was the highest for a Chinese manager since [[Nian Weisi]] (67.86%) as well as the team having not lost since the end of the 2011 AFC Asians Cup, this was still not enough to convince the Chinese Football Association of replacing Gao. In August 2011, he was formally sacked as manager and replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho]], less than a month before the qualification process for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nBut corruption still remained a major problem in Chinese football and in 2010, Wei admitted that, \"Chinese football has degraded to an intolerable level. It has hurt the feelings of fans and Chinese people at large.\" He also added that he was confident in being able to aid Chinese men's and women's football return to the leading status in Asia and world respectively in the future. Wei pointed out six major problems which had caused the \"huge slump\" of Chinese football in the past few years while he dissected the dwindling pool of youth player selection as being a big problem along with unhealthy professional leagues affected by gambling and match-fixing scandals.<ref name=\"WeiDi\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_6191736,00.html |title=FIFA World Cup News, Results, Fixtures |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=2 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018204326/http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0%2C27032%2C12098_6191736%2C00.html |archivedate=18 October 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Appointment of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho===\nOn 13 August 2011, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho]] was appointed as the new manager of the team, signing a three-year deal for a reported annual salary of $8 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechinatimes.com/online/2011/08/1003.html |title=Camacho To Be New Coach of China National Football Team |publisher=The China Times |date=20 November 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> Wei Di, the chief of the [[Chinese Football Association]], explained the decision as being part of a long-term plan to help the country catch up with rivals [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].

match\n\n==Rivalry==\n{{see also|Konghanzheng|China\u2013Hong Kong football rivalry|China\u2013Japan football rivalry}}\nThe rivalry with Japan was exemplified after 3\u20131 defeat to this opponent in the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup Final]] when Chinese fans began to riot near the north gate of the [[Worker's Stadium]].<ref>ESPNSoccernet. [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=306466&cc=5739 'Hand of Koji' brings Japan third title] 8 August 2004</ref> The rioting was said to be provoked by controversial officiating during the tournament and the heightened anti-Japanese sentiment at the time. China's most recent tournament meeting with Japan was at the [[2017 EAFF E-1 Football Championship]] where Japan won 2\u20131. China went on to finish as third-place in the tournament, while Japan finished 2nd.\n\nAnother rivalry with fellow neighbour [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] who China played 27 matches against between 1978 and 2010, without winning a single match. The media coined the term \"[[Konghanzheng|Koreaphobia]]\" to describe this phenomenon, but China finally registered its first win against South Korea on 10 February 2010, winning 3\u20130 during the [[2010 East Asian Football Championship]] and eventually going on to win the tournament.\n\n[[China\u2013Hong Kong football rivalry|A rivalry]] with [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]] has been created due to [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict|political tension]] during [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 World Cup qualification]]. With Hong Kong fans booing the Chinese national anthem, which Team Hong Kong share with Team China, 2018 World cup qualifier matches were also very tense with both matches resulting in 0\u20130 draws. Prior to the rivalry buildup, Hong Kong was not considered as a worthy opponent due to lack of success comparing to China.\n\nChina also developed a smaller rivalry with [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]] due to the [[Chinese Civil War]] consequence. But with Chinese Taipei's football remains relatively weak, the team remains a lightly regarded opponent.\n===Head-to-head results===\n{{Main|China national football team results and

China produced a magnificent performance, beating fellow Asian powerhouses [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] and [[Iran national football team|Iran]], but ultimately fell to Japan in a controversial final match 1\u20133, thus missed the chance for the second time.

After the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]], Petrovi\u0107 was sacked as the manager and [[Yin Tiesheng]] was announced as the team's caretaker.\n\n===Gao Hongbo era===\nIn April 2009, China appointed the young [[Gao Hongbo]] as the new manager, replacing [[Yin Tiesheng]]. His arrival saw China opt for a new strategy, turning towards ground passing tactics and adopting the 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation. It was noted that Chinese footballers had relied too heavily on the long ball tactic for almost a decade. Wei Di, the chief of the [[Chinese Football Association]], stressed that, \"Anytime, no matter win or loss, they must show their team spirit and courage. I hope, after one year's effort, the national team can give the public a new image.\"<ref name=\"WeiDi\">{{cite web|title=New boss vows to revive China's football in 5 years |url=http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2010-02/02/content_9417417.htm |publisher=CHINAdaily |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=7 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606235528/http://www2.chinadaily.com.cn/sports/2010-02/02/content_9417417.htm |archivedate=6 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nUnder Gao, China drew its first game against Germany 1\u20131 in May 2009. Afterwards, China were able to gain 13 points in the during the qualification process for the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]]. This led to a revival in interest amongst some Chinese football fans as China had also won 1\u20130 against France in June 2010 as well as holding [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] quarter-finalists [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] to a 1\u20131 draw in September 2010. This led to some supporters even thinking that reaching the semifinals of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup was possible; however, China were knocked out in the group stages during the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. This led to some discontent amongst Chinese fans and it seemed that this was the reason that eventually led to the sacking of Gao as manager by the Chinese Football Association. Although Gao's winning percentage (65%) was the highest for a Chinese manager since [[Nian Weisi]] (67.86%) as well as the team having not lost since the end of the 2011 AFC Asians Cup, this was still not enough to convince the Chinese Football Association of replacing Gao. In August 2011, he was formally sacked as manager and replaced by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho]], less than a month before the qualification process for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nBut corruption still remained a major problem in Chinese football and in 2010, Wei admitted that, \"Chinese football has degraded to an intolerable level. It has hurt the feelings of fans and Chinese people at large.\" He also added that he was confident in being able to aid Chinese men's and women's football return to the leading status in Asia and world respectively in the future. Wei pointed out six major problems which had caused the \"huge slump\" of Chinese football in the past few years while he dissected the dwindling pool of youth player selection as being a big problem along with unhealthy professional leagues affected by gambling and match-fixing scandals.<ref name=\"WeiDi\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0,27032,12098_6191736,00.html |title=FIFA World Cup News, Results, Fixtures |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=2 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018204326/http://www.skysports.com/football/world-cup-2010/story/0%2C27032%2C12098_6191736%2C00.html |archivedate=18 October 2012  }}</ref>\n\n===Appointment of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho===\nOn 13 August 2011, [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho]] was appointed as the new manager of the team, signing a three-year deal for a reported annual salary of $8 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thechinatimes.com/online/2011/08/1003.html |title=Camacho To Be New Coach of China National Football Team |publisher=The China Times |date=20 November 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> Wei Di, the chief of the [[Chinese Football Association]], explained the decision as being part of a long-term plan to help the country catch up with rivals [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].

However, many critics were stunned to find China and Spain still deadlocked 0\u20130 until the 84th minute when a goal from [[David Silva]] won the match 1\u20130 for Spain. Even though they lost, this performance was viewed highly in the media. However, disappointment would soon strike again two months later when China faced [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in a friendly only to lose 1\u20130 with the lone goal coming minutes after the second half. Several months later, Camacho managed a youthful team to an 8\u20130 loss against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] on 10 September 2012 which would go on record as China's worst ever international defeat in the team's history. This massive loss also succumbed China to their worst ever FIFA ranking (109th).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/92232/brazil-vs-china/report |title=Match Report: Brazil 8\u20130 China |publisher=Goal.com |date= |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> It was the worst defeat for China since their loss to the United States in 1992.\n\nAfter a disappointing qualification process for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Camacho led China during their qualification process for the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] where in the first group match China lost 2\u20131 to [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/international/asia/asian-cup-qualification/2015-australia/group-stage/group-c/g5564/ |title=Summary \u2013 Asian Cup Qualification \u2013 Asia \u2013 Results, fixtures, tables and news \u2013 Soccerway |publisher=Uk.soccerway.com |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> Camacho then managed China on 15 June 2013 against [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]] in a shocking 5\u20131 loss to a team ranked 142 and 47 places below China.

Its capacity is 66,161, and it covers a land area of 350,000 square meters. It is used both for international matches and by the [[China Super League]] team, the [[Beijing Guoan]], and for the national team. However, China also plays in other stadiums around the country. [[Tuodong Stadium]] on the city of [[Kunming]] has the capacity of 40,000 and was used in previous [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 World Cup campaigns]]. [[Yellow Dragon Sports Center]] in [[Hangzhou]] served as China's main stadium for the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] and [[Shaanxi Province Stadium]] in [[Xi'an]] served as Team Dragon's main stadium for the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification]].\n\nPreviously, [[Shenyang]]'s [[Wulihe Stadium]] was served as the base for China's historic [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2002 FIFA World Cup campaign]], which saw China qualified, and their only, World Cup appearance.\n\nIn smaller tournaments like [[EAFF E-1 Football Championship]], [[Chongqing Olympic Sports Center]] in [[Chongqing]], and [[Wuhan Sports Center Stadium]] in [[Wuhan]] were used as home stadiums for Team Dragon. The recent [[China Cup]] also represents [[Guangxi Sports Center]] in [[Nanning]] as the team's main stadium. Some friendlies are also played in [[Tianhe Stadium]] in [[Guangzhou]].\n\n===Media coverage===\nHome and away matches are typically shown on [[CCTV-5]], [[CCTV-22|CCTV-5<sup>+</sup>]], [[Guangdong TV|GDTV-Sports]], [[Shanghai Media Group|STV-Sports]], [[China Beijing TV Station|BTV-6]], and several other local sports channels in mainland China.\n\n===Rivalries===\n{{see also|Konghanzheng|China\u2013Hong Kong football rivalry|China\u2013Japan football rivalry}}\nTraditionally, China's greatest rival has been [[Japan national football team|Japan]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Minter |first=Adam |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-19/why-chinese-hate-their-men-s-soccer-team.html |title=Why Chinese Hate Their Men's football Team |publisher=Bloomberg |date= |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> This was exemplified after Japan beat China 3\u20131 in the [[2004 AFC Asian Cup Final]] when Chinese fans began to riot near the north gate of the [[Worker's Stadium]].<ref>ESPNSoccernet. [http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=306466&cc=5739 'Hand of Koji' brings Japan third title] 8 August 2004</ref> The rioting was said to be provoked by controversial officiating during the tournament and the heightened anti-Japanese sentiment at the time. China's most recent tournament meeting with Japan was at the [[2017 EAFF E-1 Football Championship]] where Japan won 2\u20131. China went on to finish as third-place in the tournament, while Japan finished 2nd.\n\nAnother well known rivalry is also with fellow neighbour [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. China played 27 matches against South Korea between 1978 and 2010, a span of 32 years, without winning a single match (11 draws and 16 losses). The media coined the term \"[[Konghanzheng|Koreaphobia]]\" to describe this phenomenon, but China finally registered its first win against South Korea on 10 February 2010, winning 3\u20130 during the [[2010 East Asian Football Championship]] and eventually going on to win the tournament.\n\n[[China\u2013Hong Kong football rivalry|A rivalry]] with [[Hong Kong national football team|Hong Kong]] has been created due to [[Hong Kong\u2013Mainland China conflict|political tension]] during [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 World Cup qualification]]. With Hong Kong fans booing the Chinese national anthem, which Team Hong Kong share with Team China, 2018 World cup qualifier matches were also very tense with both matches resulting in 0\u20130 draws. Prior to the rivalry buildup, Hong Kong was not considered as a worthy opponent due to lack of success comparing to China.\n\nChina also developed a smaller rivalry with [[Chinese Taipei national football team|Chinese Taipei]] due to the [[Chinese Civil War]] consequence. But with Chinese Taipei's football remains relatively weak, the team remains a lightly regarded opponent.\n\n== Coaching staff ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Source<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecfa.cn/jxtz/20191029/28267.html|title=\u4e2d\u56fd\u8db3\u7403\u534f\u4f1a\u5173\u4e8e\u56fd\u5bb6\u7537\u5b50\u8db3\u7403\u961f\u96c6\u8bad\u7684\u901a\u77e5|website=thecfa.cn|date=29 October 2019|language=zh|trans-title=Notice of the Chinese Football Association on the National Men's Football Team Training}}</ref>\n|-\n!

As such, is it still relevant to most Christian churches today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/charts/denominations-beliefs |title=Compare Christian Denominations: Belief and Theology |date=March 5, 2005 |website=Religion Facts |url-status=live}}</ref> The Incarnation is always professed, though different Rites use different [[English versions of the Nicene Creed|translations]]. The current translation of the Roman Catholic Church is: \"For us men and for our salvation, he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he was born of the Virgin Mary, and became man.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/credo.htm |title=THE PROFESSION OF FAITH |website=Vatican.va |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Apostles' Creed===\n{{Main|Apostles' Creed}}\nThe Apostles' Creed includes the article of faith \"He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/credo.htm Catechism Credo]</ref> According to [[Pope John Paul II]], by his incarnation Jesus is a figure of and has united himself to every human being, including the [[Catholic Church and abortion|unborn]] at the moment of their life at [[conception (biology)|conception]].<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_25031995_evangelium-vitae.html Evangelium Vitae, 104]</ref>\n\n===Ecumenical councils===\n{{Main|Ecumenical council}}\nEventually, teaching of Alexander, [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]], and the other [[Nicene Fathers]], that the Son was consubstantial and coeternal with the Father, were defined as orthodox dogma. All divergent beliefs were defined as [[heresy|heresies]]. This included [[Docetism]], [[Arianism]], [[Nestorianism]], and [[Sabellianism]]. \n\nThe most widely accepted definitions of the incarnation and the nature of Jesus were made by the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431, and the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451. These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God: begotten from, but not created by the Father; and fully man: taking His flesh and human nature from the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. These two natures, human and divine, were [[hypostatic union|hypostatically]] united into the one [[Personhood#Christianity|personhood]] of Jesus Christ.<ref group=\"note\">[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.toc.html The Seven Ecumenical Councils], from the ''Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers'', vols. 2\u201314 (CCEL.org) Contains detailed statements from each of these councils. The First Council of Nicaea, Council of Ephesus and Council of Chalcedon are the \"First\", \"Third\" and \"Fourth\" Ecumenical Councils, respectively.</ref> According to the [[Catholic Church]], an ecumenical council's declarations are [[infallible]], making the incarnation a [[dogma in the Catholic Church]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p1s1c2a2.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church 85\u201390]</ref>\n\n===Effect===\nThe incarnation implies three facts: (1) The Divine Person of Jesus Christ; (2) The Human Nature of Jesus Christ; (3) The Hypostatic Union of the Human with the Divine Nature in the Divine Person of Jesus Christ. Without diminishing His divinity, He added to it all that is involved in being human.<ref name=\"Packer\">[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/march/25.72.html Packer, J.I., \"Incarnate Forever\", ''Christianity Today'', Vol. 48, No. 3, p.72, March 1, 2004]</ref> In Christian belief it is understood that Jesus was at the same time both fully God and fully human, two natures in one person.<ref>[http://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/articles.php/5622/archbishop-justin-addresses-muslim-council-of-wales Welby, Justin. \"Archbishop Justin addresses Muslim Council of Wales\", The Archbishop of Canterbury, October 2, 2015]</ref> The body of Christ was therefore subject to all the bodily weaknesses to which human nature is universally subject; such are hunger (Matthew.4:2), thirst (John 19:28), fatigue (John 4:6), pain, and death. They were the natural results of the human nature He assumed.<ref name=\"Drum\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07706b.htm Drum, Walter. \"The Incarnation\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia''] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 Octobrt 2016</ref>\n\nIncarnation of Jesus is also one of the key factors which, alongside humans made in image and likeness of God, forms Christian Anthropology. Specifically, Incarnation is vital for understanding the concept of [[Divinization (Christian)|Divinisation]] of the Man, most well and elaborately developed in Orthodox Christianity and most well expressed by Church Fathers, such as [[St. Athanasius of Alexandria]] (\"Therefore He was not man, and then became God, but He was God, and then became man, and that to deify us\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Athanasius |title=Against the Arians |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxi.ii.i.xi.html |chapter=Discourse I, Paragraph 39 |access-date=2012-11-06 |author-link=Athanasius of Alexandria}}</ref>), [[St Cyril of Alexandria]] (\"For we too are sons and gods by grace, and we have surely been brought to this wonderful and supernatural dignity since we have the Only Begotten Word of God dwelling within us.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=of Alexandria |first=Cyril |title=On the Unity of Christ |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-88141-133-1 |location=Crestwood, NY |pages=80}}</ref>) [[Divinization_(Christian)#Patristic_writings|and numerous others]].\n\n===Modern Protestantism===\nThe link between the incarnation and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] within [[systematic theology]] is complex. Within traditional models of the atonement, such as [[Substitutionary atonement|Substitution]], [[Satisfaction theory of atonement|Satisfaction]] or [[Christus Victor]], Christ must be human in order for the sacrifice of the cross to be efficacious, for human sins to be \"removed\" and/or \"conquered\". In his work ''The Trinity and the Kingdom of God'',<ref>''Trinit\u00e4t und Reich Gottes. Zur Gotteslehre'' 1980</ref> [[J\u00fcrgen Moltmann]] differentiated between what he called a \"fortuitous\" and a \"necessary\" incarnation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the incarnation: the Son of God became a man so that he could save us from our sins. The former, on the other hand, speaks of the incarnation as a fulfilment of the [[Love of God]], of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to \"walk in the garden\" with us. Moltmann favours \"fortuitous\" incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of \"necessity\" is to do an injustice to the [[Ministry of Jesus|life of Christ]].\n\n==Hymns and prayers==\n\n===Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic===\nThe significance of the incarnation has been extensively discussed throughout [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], and is the subject of countless [[hymn]]s and [[prayer]]s. For instance, the ''[[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]]'' (c. 400), as used by [[Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Byzantine Catholics]], includes this \"Hymn to the Only Begotten Son\":\n<blockquote><poem>O only begotten Son and Word of God,\nWho, being immortal,\nDeigned for our [[salvation]]\nTo become incarnate\nOf the holy ''[[Theotokos]]'' and [[perpetual virginity of Mary|ever-virgin]] Mary,\nAnd became man without change;\nYou were also crucified,\nO Christ our God,\nAnd by death have trampled Death,\nBeing one of the Holy Trinity,\nGlorified with the Father and the Holy Spirit\u2014\nSave us!<ref>{{Cite Catholic Catechism | part = p1 | section = s2 | chapter = c3 | article = a3 | div = #463 }}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nAdditionally, the [[Divine Liturgy of Saint James]] includes this chant of \"[[Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence]]\" in its [[offertory]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Let all mortal flesh be silent,\nand stand with fear and trembling,\nand meditate nothing earthly within itself:\u2014\nFor the King of kings and Lord of lords, \n[[Christ]] our [[God in Christianity|God]], comes forward to be [[Crucifixion of Jesus|sacrificed]], \nand to be given for [[Eucharist|food]] to the faithful;\nand the bands of [[Christian angelology|angels]] go before Him\nwith every power and dominion,\nthe many-eyed [[cherubim]],\nand the six-winged [[seraphim]],\ncovering their faces,\nand crying aloud the hymn,\n[[Alleluia]], Alleluia, Alleluia.<ref>''[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0717.htm Divine Liturgy of St. James]''.

The text of this ma\u201bneetho dates back to the 6th century and is attributed in later sources to St. Severus, the Patriarch of Antioch (c. 465\u2013538).

The Son of God, Servetus asserted, is not an eternally existing being, but rather the more abstract ''Logos'' (a manifestation of the One True God, not a separate person) incarnate. For this reason, Servetus refused to call Christ the \"eternal Son of God\" preferring \"the Son of the eternal God\" instead.<ref>[http://godglorified.com/errors_of_the_trinity.htm 'De trinitatis erroribus'], Book 7.</ref>\n\nIn describing Servetus' theology of the ''Logos'', Andrew Dibb (2005) comments: \"In Genesis God reveals Himself as the Creator. In John He reveals that He created by means of the Word, or ''Logos.'' Finally, also in John, He shows that this ''Logos'' became flesh and 'dwelt among us'. Creation took place by the spoken word, for God said 'Let there be...' The spoken word of Genesis, the ''Logos'' of John, and the Christ, are all one and the same.\"<ref>Andrew Dibb, ''Servetus, Swedenborg and the Nature of God'', University Press of America, 2005, p 93.

The French reformer [[John Calvin]], who asserted he would ensure the death of Servetus if he set foot in Geneva because of his non-Reformed views on the Trinity and the sacrament of baptism, requested he be beheaded as a traitor rather than burned as a heretic, but the authorities insisted on executing Servetus by fire.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cottret |first=Bernard |title=John Calvin |publisher=W.B.Eerdmans |year=2000 |location=Grand Rapids |pages=222\u2013225 |translator-last=McDonald |translator-first=M. Wallace |author-link=Bernard Cottret}}</ref>\n\n===English Arians===\nPost-Reformation Arians such as [[William Whiston]] often held a view of the incarnation in keeping with the personal [[pre-existence]] of Christ. Whiston considered the incarnation to be of the Logos Who had pre-existed as \"a Metaphysick existence, in potentia or in the like higher and sublimer Manner in the Father as His Wisdom or Word before His real Creation or Generation.\".<ref>James E. Force ''William Whiston, honest Newtonian'' 1985 p16</ref>\n\n=== Socinian and Unitarian ===\nServetus rejected [[Arianism]] because it denied Jesus' divinity<ref>''Restituci\u00f3n'', p. 137.</ref> so it is certain that he would have also rejected [[Socinianism]] as a form of Arianism which both rejects that Jesus is God, and, also that Jesus consciously existed before His birth, which most Arian groups accept. [[Fausto Sozzini]] and writers of the [[Polish Brethren]] such as [[Samuel Przypkowski]], [[Marcin Czechowic]] and [[Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen]] saw the incarnation as being primarily a function of [[fatherhood]]. Namely that Christ was literally both 'Son of Man' from his maternal side, and also literally 'Son of God' on his paternal side. The concept of the incarnation \u2014\"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\"\u2014 was understood as the literal ''word'' or ''logos'' of {{Bibleref2|Ps.|33:6}} having been made human by a virgin birth. Sozzini, Przypkowski and other Socinian writers were distinct from Servetus in stating that Jesus having \"come down from heaven\" was primarily in terms of Mary's miraculous conception and not in Jesus having in any literal sense been in heaven.<ref>[[George Huntston Williams]] ''The Radical Reformation''</ref><ref>[[Roland H. Bainton]]. ''The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century''</ref> Today the number of churches with Socinian Christology is very small, the main group known for this are the [[Christadelphians]], other groups include [[Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith)|CoGGC]] and [[Church of the Blessed Hope|CGAF]]. Modern [[Socinian]] or \"[[Biblical Unitarian]]\" writers generally place emphasis on \"made flesh\" not just meaning \"made a body\", but incarnation (a term these groups would avoid) requiring Jesus having the temptable and mortal nature of His mother.<ref>A.D. Norris, ''The Person of the Lord Jesus Christ'', [[The Christadelphian]], Birmingham 1982</ref>\n\n=== Oneness Pentecostalism===\nIn contrast to the traditional view of the incarnation cited above, adherents of [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] believe in the doctrine of Oneness. Although both Oneness and traditional Christianity teach that God is a ''singular'' Spirit, Oneness adherents reject the idea that God is a Trinity of persons. Oneness doctrine teaches there is one God who manifests Himself in different ways, as opposed to a Trinity, where God is seen as one being consisting of three distinct persons. \n\nTo a Oneness Pentecostal, Jesus is seen as both fully divine and fully human. The term Father refers to God Himself, who caused the conception of the Son in Mary, thus becoming the father of the child she bore. The term Son refers to the fully human person, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost refers to the manifestation of God's Spirit inside of and around His people. Thus the Father is ''not'' the Son \u2013 and this distinction is crucial \u2013 but is ''in'' the Son as the fullness of His divine nature.<ref>{David K. Bernard (1994-09-30).

Specifically, Incarnation is vital for understanding the concept of [[Divinization (Christian)|Divinisation]] of the Man, most well and elaborately developed in Orthodox Christianity and most well expressed by Church Fathers, such as [[St. Athanasius of Alexandria]] (\"Therefore He was not man, and then became God, but He was God, and then became man, and that to deify us\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Athanasius |title=Against the Arians |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf204.xxi.ii.i.xi.html |chapter=Discourse I, Paragraph 39 |access-date=2012-11-06 |author-link=Athanasius of Alexandria}}</ref>), [[St Cyril of Alexandria]] (\"For we too are sons and gods by grace, and we have surely been brought to this wonderful and supernatural dignity since we have the Only Begotten Word of God dwelling within us.\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=of Alexandria |first=Cyril |title=On the Unity of Christ |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-88141-133-1 |location=Crestwood, NY |pages=80}}</ref>) [[Divinization_(Christian)#Patristic_writings|and numerous others]].\n\n===Modern Protestantism===\nThe link between the incarnation and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] within [[systematic theology]] is complex.

In his work ''The Trinity and the Kingdom of God'',<ref>''Trinit\u00e4t und Reich Gottes.

The former, on the other hand, speaks of the incarnation as a fulfilment of the [[Love of God]], of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity, to \"walk in the garden\" with us. Moltmann favours \"fortuitous\" incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of \"necessity\" is to do an injustice to the [[Ministry of Jesus|life of Christ]].\n\n==Hymns and prayers==\n\n===Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic===\nThe significance of the incarnation has been extensively discussed throughout [[History of Christianity|Christian history]], and is the subject of countless [[hymn]]s and [[prayer]]s.

For this reason, Servetus refused to call Christ the \"eternal Son of God\" preferring \"the Son of the eternal God\" instead.<ref>[http://godglorified.com/errors_of_the_trinity.htm 'De trinitatis erroribus'], Book 7.</ref>\n\nIn describing Servetus' theology of the ''Logos'', Andrew Dibb (2005) comments: \"In Genesis God reveals Himself as the Creator. In John He reveals that He created by means of the Word, or ''Logos.'' Finally, also in John, He shows that this ''Logos'' became flesh and 'dwelt among us'. Creation took place by the spoken word, for God said 'Let there be...' The spoken word of Genesis, the ''Logos'' of John, and the Christ, are all one and the same.\"<ref>Andrew Dibb, ''Servetus, Swedenborg and the Nature of God'', University Press of America, 2005, p 93.

The French reformer [[John Calvin]], who asserted he would ensure the death of Servetus if he set foot in Geneva because of his non-Reformed views on the Trinity and the sacrament of baptism, requested he be beheaded as a traitor rather than burned as a heretic, but the authorities insisted on executing Servetus by fire.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cottret |first=Bernard |title=John Calvin |publisher=W.B.Eerdmans |year=2000 |location=Grand Rapids |pages=222\u2013225 |translator-last=McDonald |translator-first=M. Wallace |author-link=Bernard Cottret}}</ref>\n\n===English Arians===\nPost-Reformation Arians such as [[William Whiston]] often held a view of the incarnation in keeping with the personal [[pre-existence]] of Christ. Whiston considered the incarnation to be of the Logos Who had pre-existed as \"a Metaphysick existence, in potentia or in the like higher and sublimer Manner in the Father as His Wisdom or Word before His real Creation or Generation.\".<ref>James E. Force ''William Whiston, honest Newtonian'' 1985 p16</ref>\n\n=== Socinian and Unitarian ===\nServetus rejected [[Arianism]] because it denied Jesus' divinity<ref>''Restituci\u00f3n'', p. 137.</ref> so it is certain that he would have also rejected [[Socinianism]] as a form of Arianism which both rejects that Jesus is God, and, also that Jesus consciously existed before His birth, which most Arian groups accept. [[Fausto Sozzini]] and writers of the [[Polish Brethren]] such as [[Samuel Przypkowski]], [[Marcin Czechowic]] and [[Johann Ludwig von Wolzogen]] saw the incarnation as being primarily a function of [[fatherhood]]. Namely that Christ was literally both 'Son of Man' from his maternal side, and also literally 'Son of God' on his paternal side. The concept of the incarnation \u2014\"the Word became flesh and dwelt among us\"\u2014 was understood as the literal ''word'' or ''logos'' of {{Bibleref2|Ps.|33:6}} having been made human by a virgin birth. Sozzini, Przypkowski and other Socinian writers were distinct from Servetus in stating that Jesus having \"come down from heaven\" was primarily in terms of Mary's miraculous conception and not in Jesus having in any literal sense been in heaven.<ref>[[George Huntston Williams]] ''The Radical Reformation''</ref><ref>[[Roland H. Bainton]]. ''The Reformation of the Sixteenth Century''</ref> Today the number of churches with Socinian Christology is very small, the main group known for this are the [[Christadelphians]], other groups include [[Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith)|CoGGC]] and [[Church of the Blessed Hope|CGAF]]. Modern [[Socinian]] or \"[[Biblical Unitarian]]\" writers generally place emphasis on \"made flesh\" not just meaning \"made a body\", but incarnation (a term these groups would avoid) requiring Jesus having the temptable and mortal nature of His mother.<ref>A.D. Norris, ''The Person of the Lord Jesus Christ'', [[The Christadelphian]], Birmingham 1982</ref>\n\n=== Oneness Pentecostalism===\nIn contrast to the traditional view of the incarnation cited above, adherents of [[Oneness Pentecostalism]] believe in the doctrine of Oneness. Although both Oneness and traditional Christianity teach that God is a ''singular'' Spirit, Oneness adherents reject the idea that God is a Trinity of persons. Oneness doctrine teaches there is one God who manifests Himself in different ways, as opposed to a Trinity, where God is seen as one being consisting of three distinct persons. \n\nTo a Oneness Pentecostal, Jesus is seen as both fully divine and fully human. The term Father refers to God Himself, who caused the conception of the Son in Mary, thus becoming the father of the child she bore. The term Son refers to the fully human person, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost refers to the manifestation of God's Spirit inside of and around His people. Thus the Father is ''not'' the Son \u2013 and this distinction is crucial \u2013 but is ''in'' the Son as the fullness of His divine nature.<ref>{David K. Bernard (1994-09-30).
