The chorion and the [[amnion]] together form the [[amniotic sac]].  It is formed by extraembryonic [[mesoderm]] and the two layers of [[trophoblast]] that surround the embryo and other membranes. The [[chorionic villi]] emerge from the chorion, invade the [[endometrium]], and allow the transfer of nutrients from maternal blood to fetal blood.\n\n===Layers===\nThe chorion consists of two layers: an outer formed by the [[trophoblast]], and an inner formed by the somatic [[mesoderm]]; the [[amnion]] is in contact with the latter.\n\nThe trophoblast is made up of an internal layer of cubical or prismatic cells, the [[cytotrophoblast]] or layer of Langhans, and an external layer of richly nucleated protoplasm devoid of cell boundaries, the [[syncytiotrophoblast]].\n\n===Growth===\nThe chorion undergoes rapid proliferation and forms numerous [[process (anatomy)|process]]es, the ''[[chorionic villi]]'', which invade and destroy the [[uterine decidua]], while simultaneously absorbing nutritive materials from it for the growth of the [[embryo]].\n\nThe chorionic villi are at first small and non-vascular, and consist of the trophoblast only, but they increase in size and [[wikt:ramify|ramify]], whereas the mesoderm, carrying branches of the umbilical vessels, grows into them, and they are [[vascularized]].\n\nBlood is carried to the villi by the paired [[umbilical arteries]], which branch into [[chorionic arteries]] and enter the [[chorionic villi]] as [[cotyledon arteries]]. After circulating through the capillaries of the villi, the blood is returned to the embryo by the [[umbilical vein]]. Until about the end of the second month of [[pregnancy]], the villi cover the entire chorion, and are almost uniform in size; but, after this, they develop unequally.\n\n===Parts===\nThe part of the chorion that is in contact with the [[Decidua#Structure|decidua capsularis]] undergoes atrophy, so that by the fourth month scarcely a trace of the villi is left. This part of the chorion becomes smooth, and is named the chorion laeve (from the Latin word ''levis'', meaning smooth). As it takes no share in the formation of the placenta, this is also named the non-placental part of the chorion. As the chorion grows, the chorion laeve comes in contact with the decidua parietalis and these layers fuse.\n\nThe villi at the embryonic pole, which is in contact with the [[decidua basalis]], increase greatly in size and complexity, and hence this part is named the chorion frondosum.\n\nThus the placenta develops from the chorion frondosum and the decidua basalis.\n\n===Monochorionic twins===\n{{main|Monochorionic twins}}\n''Monochorionic twins'' are [[twins]] that share the same [[placenta]].

Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means and aspired to create a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the Vatican, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy, and recognized the independence of [[Vatican City]].\n\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to expand the sphere of influence of [[Italian fascism]]. In 1923, he began the \"[[Pacification of Libya]]\" and [[Corfu incident|ordered the bombing of Corfu]] in retaliation for the murder of an Italian general. In 1936, Mussolini formed [[Italian East Africa]] (AOI) by merging [[Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] following the [[Abyssinian crisis]] and the [[Second Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]]. In 1939, Italian forces occupied [[Albania]]. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful [[Italian military intervention in Spain]] in favor of [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish civil war]]. Initially, Mussolini's Italy tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war by taking part in the [[Stresa front]], the [[Lytton Report]], the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the [[Four-Power Pact]] and the [[Munich Agreement]]. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by [[Axis powers|aligning]] with Germany and Japan. Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of [[World War II]].\n\nOn 10 June 1940\u2014with the [[Fall of France]] imminent\u2014Italy officially entered the war and eventually occupied [[Italian occupation of France|parts of south-east France]], [[Italian occupation of Corsica|Corsica]], and [[Tunisian campaign|Tunisia]]. Mussolini planned to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the [[British Empire]] in Africa and the Middle East, known as the \"parallel war\", while expecting the collapse of the UK in the [[European theatre of world war II|European theatre]]. The Italians [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]], [[Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II|bombed Mandatory Palestine]], and [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|occupied British Somaliland]] with initial success. However, the British government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victories in Eastern and Western Europe; plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In October 1940, Mussolini sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoIlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&dq=Italian+forces+in+Greece+british+air+force#v=onepage&q=Italian%20forces%20in%20Greece%20british%20air%20force&f=false |title = The Desert Air Force in World War II: Air Power in the Western Desert, 1940-1942|isbn = 9781526703798|last1 = Delve|first1 = Ken Delve|date = 31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan campaign]] was significantly prolonged until the definition of the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] and [[Occupation of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

Gasti, that describe his background and his position on the First World War that resulted in his ousting from the Italian Socialist Party. The Inspector General wrote:\n{{bquote|Professor Benito Mussolini,&nbsp;... 38, revolutionary socialist, has a police record; elementary school teacher qualified to teach in secondary schools; former first secretary of the Chambers in Cesena, Forl\u00ec, and Ravenna; after 1912 editor of the newspaper ''Avanti!'' to which he gave a violent suggestive and intransigent orientation. In October 1914, finding himself in opposition to the directorate of the Italian Socialist party because he advocated a kind of active neutrality on the part of Italy in the War of the Nations against the party's tendency of absolute neutrality, he withdrew on the twentieth of that month from the directorate of ''Avanti!'' Then on the fifteenth of November [1914], thereafter, he initiated publication of the newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', in which he supported\u2014in sharp contrast to ''Avanti!'' and amid bitter polemics against that newspaper and its chief backers\u2014the thesis of Italian intervention in the war against the militarism of the Central Empires. For this reason he was accused of moral and political unworthiness and the party thereupon decided to expel him&nbsp;... Thereafter he&nbsp;... undertook a very active campaign in behalf of Italian intervention, participating in demonstrations in the piazzas and writing quite violent articles in Popolo d'Italia&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\" />}}\n\nIn his summary, the Inspector also noted:\n{{bquote|He was the ideal editor of ''Avanti!'' for the Socialists. In that line of work he was greatly esteemed and beloved. Some of his former comrades and admirers still confess that there was no one who understood better how to interpret the spirit of the proletariat and there was no one who did not observe his apostasy with sorrow. This came about not for reasons of self-interest or money. He was a sincere and passionate advocate, first of vigilant and armed neutrality, and later of war; and he did not believe that he was compromising with his personal and political honesty by making use of every means\u2014no matter where they came from or wherever he might obtain them\u2014to pay for his newspaper, his program and his line of action. This was his initial line. It is difficult to say to what extent his socialist convictions (which he never either openly or privately abjure) may have been sacrificed in the course of the indispensable financial deals which were necessary for the continuation of the struggle in which he was engaged&nbsp;... But assuming these modifications did take place&nbsp;... he always wanted to give the appearance of still being a socialist, and he fooled himself into thinking that this was the case.<ref>''Mediterranean Fascism 1919\u20131945'' Edited by Charles F.

We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us!&nbsp;... Class cannot destroy the nation.

In such circumstances the class movement finds itself impaired by an inauspicious historic climate.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}}}\n\nMussolini continued to promote the need of a revolutionary vanguard elite to lead society. He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}\nThough he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy's history, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Carlo Pisacane]]. As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalize and transform it to recognize the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=193}} This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini; other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Sergio Panunzio]] had also denounced classical [[Marxism]] in favor of intervention.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Mussolini bersagliere.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Mussolini as a ''[[bersagliere]]'' during WWI]]\n\nThese basic political views and principles formed the basis of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the ''Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista'' in 1914, who called themselves ''Fascisti'' (Fascists).{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=193, 195}} At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=195\u201396}} Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even [[democratic socialist]]s who opposed the war such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]] said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=196}}\n\nMussolini became an ally with the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] politician and journalist [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] and\u2014like him\u2014entered the Army and served in the war. \"He was sent to the zone of operations where he was seriously injured by the explosion of a grenade.\"<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\"/>\n\nThe Inspector General continued:\n{{bquote|He was promoted to the rank of corporal \"for merit in war\".

Mussolini utilized works of [[Plato]], [[Georges Sorel]], [[Nietzsche]], and the economic ideas of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], to develop fascism. Mussolini admired Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', which he often read for inspiration.{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=39}} ''The Republic'' expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties in the interest of the state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state.<ref>Sharma, Urmila.

The right to colonize the neighboring [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920\u20131947)|Slovene ethnic areas]] and the Mediterranean, being inhabited by what were alleged to be less developed peoples, was justified on the grounds that Italy was allegedly suffering from overpopulation.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nBorrowing the idea first developed by [[Enrico Corradini]] before 1914 of the natural conflict between \"[[plutocratic]]\" nations like Britain and \"proletarian\" nations like Italy, Mussolini claimed that Italy's principal problem was that \"plutocratic\" countries like Britain were blocking Italy from achieving the necessary ''spazio vitale'' that would let the Italian economy grow.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=48\u201350}} Mussolini equated a nation's potential for economic growth with territorial size, thus in his view the problem of poverty in Italy could only be solved by winning the necessary ''spazio vitale''.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=50}}\n\nThough [[biological racism]] was less prominent in Fascism than in [[National Socialism]], right from the start the ''spazio vitale'' concept had a strong racist undercurrent. Mussolini asserted there was a \"natural law\" for stronger peoples to subject and dominate \"inferior\" peoples such as the \"barbaric\" Slavic peoples of Yugoslavia. He stated in a September 1920 speech: {{quote|When dealing with such a race as Slavic\u2014inferior and barbarian\u2014we must not pursue the carrot, but the stick policy&nbsp;...

In Mussolini's thinking, [[demography]] was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die. Hence, the importance of [[natalism]] to Mussolini, since only by increasing the birth rate could Italy ensure that its future as a great power that would win its ''spazio vitale'' would be assured.

The Italian government rarely interfered with the blackshirts' actions, owing in part to a looming threat and widespread fear of a communist revolution. The Fascisti grew rapidly; within two years they transformed themselves into the [[National Fascist Party]] at a congress in Rome.

The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and ultimately thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Adrian|title=The Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy, 1919\u20131929|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-55394-0|pages=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\n=== Appointment as Prime Minister ===\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterized by a right-wing coalition government composed of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the [[Italian People's Party (1919\u20131926)|Popular Party]]. The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state with himself as supreme leader (''[[Il Duce]]''), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia|Il Popolo]]'', which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, [[Arnaldo Mussolini|Arnaldo]]. To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time). He favored the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'') and the progressive identification of the party with the state.

Dumini was imprisoned for two years.

First, he went beyond the vague promise of future national renewal, and proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country along fascist lines. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media, including such new forms as motion pictures and radio. Fourth, he created a mass membership party, with free programs for young men, young women, and various other groups who could therefore be more readily mobilized and monitored. He shut down all alternative political formations and parties (but this step was not an innovation by any means). Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.<ref>Konrad Jarausch, ''Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century'' (2015) pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\n=== Police state ===\n{{See also|Assassination attempts on Benito Mussolini}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini.gif|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini seated portrait in suit and tie facing left|Mussolini in his early years in power]]\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a [[police state]]. A law passed on 24 December 1925\u2014Christmas Eve for the largely [[Roman Catholic]] country\u2014changed Mussolini's formal title from \"President of the Council of Ministers\" to \"Head of the Government\", although he was still called \"Prime Minister\" by most non-Italian news sources. He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King. While the [[Statuto Albertino|Italian constitution]] stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda. This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and [[podest\u00e0]]s appointed by the [[Italian Senate]] replaced elected mayors and councils.\n\nOn 7 April 1926, Mussolini survived a first assassination attempt by [[Violet Gibson]], an Irish woman and daughter of [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]], who was deported after her arrest.<ref name=thetimesapr081926>The Times, Thursday, 8 April 1926; p. 12; Issue 44240; column A</ref> On 31 October 1926, 15-year-old [[Anteo Zamboni]] attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna.

In the same year, an electoral law abolished parliamentary elections. Instead, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] selected a single list of candidates to be approved by [[Referendum|plebiscite]]. The Grand Council had been created five years earlier as a party body but was \"constitutionalized\" and became the highest constitutional authority in the state. On paper, the Grand Council had the power to recommend Mussolini's removal from office, and was thus theoretically the only check on his power. However, only Mussolini could summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. To gain control of the South, especially [[Sicily]], he appointed [[Cesare Mori]] as a Prefect of the city of Palermo, with the charge of eradicating [[the Mafia]] at any price. In the telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori:{{quote|Your Excellency has carte blanche; the authority of the State must absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily. If the laws still in force hinder you, this will be no problem, as we will draw up new laws.<ref>Arrigo Petacco, ''L'uomo della provvidenza: Mussolini, ascesa e caduta di un mito'', Milano, Mondadori, 2004, p. 190</ref>}}Mori did not hesitate to lay siege to towns, using torture, and holding women and children as hostages to oblige suspects to give themselves up. These harsh methods earned him the nickname of \"Iron Prefect\". In 1927, Mori's inquiries brought evidence of collusion between [[the Mafia]] and the Fascist establishment, and he was dismissed for length of service in 1929, at which time the number of murders in [[Palermo Province]] had decreased from 200 to 23.

His earliest (and one of the best known) was the ''Battle for Wheat'', by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them [[Littoria]] and [[Sabaudia]]) on land reclaimed by draining the [[Pontine Marshes]]. In [[Sardinia]], a model agricultural town was founded and named ''Mussolinia'', but has long since been renamed [[Arborea]]. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high [[tariff]]s were imposed.<ref>Clark, Martin, ''Modern Italy'', Pearson Longman, 2008, p. 322</ref> The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government [[subsidy|subsidies]] given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.\n\n[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inaugurazione Littoria with massed parade in 1932|The inauguration of Littoria in 1932]]\n\nMussolini also initiated the \"Battle for Land\", a policy based on [[land reclamation]] outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the [[unemployment|unemployed]] and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Wheat (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 [[peasant]]s resettled on the redistributed land, and [[peasant]] poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.\n\nIn 1930, in the Doctrine of Fascism he wrote, \"The so-called crisis can only be settled by State action and within the orbit of the State.\"<ref>Mussolini, Benito, The Doctrine of Fascism, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1479216345}}, p. 21</ref> He tried to combat [[economic recession]] by introducing a \"Gold for the Fatherland\" initiative, encouraging the public to voluntarily donate [[gold jewelry]] to government officials in exchange for steel [[wristband]]s bearing the words \"Gold for the Fatherland\". Even [[Rachele Mussolini]] donated her wedding ring. The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the [[national bank]]s.\n\nGovernment control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed [[price control]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Carl F.

The regime promoted a lavish [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy#Personality cult|cult of personality]] centered on the figure of Mussolini. He pretended to incarnate the new fascist [[\u00dcbermensch]], promoting an aesthetic of exasperated [[Machismo|Machism]] that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta|title=Fascist spectacle : the aesthetics of power in Mussolini's Italy|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22677-7|page=67|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref> At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defense, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|MVSN]] or \"Blackshirts\", who terrorized incipient resistance in the cities and provinces. He would later form the [[OVRA]], an institutionalized [[secret police]] that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.\n\nMussolini also portrayed himself as a valiant sportsman and a skilled musician. All teachers in schools and universities had to swear an oath to defend the fascist regime. Newspaper editors were all personally chosen by Mussolini, and only those in possession of a certificate of approval from the Fascist Party could practice journalism. These certificates were issued in secret; Mussolini thus skillfully created the illusion of a \"free press\". The trade unions were also deprived of any independence and were integrated into what was called the [[corporate state|\"corporative\" system]]. The aim, inspired by medieval [[guild]]s and never completely achieved, was to place all Italians in various professional organizations or ''corporations'', all under clandestine governmental control.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Benito Mussolini saluting crowd|From 1925, Mussolini styled himself ''[[Il Duce]]'' (the leader)]]\nLarge sums of money were spent on highly visible public works and on international prestige projects. These included as the [[Blue Riband]] ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']]; setting aeronautical records with the world's fastest [[seaplane]], the [[Macchi M.C.72]]; and the transatlantic flying boat cruise of [[Italo Balbo]], which was greeted with much fanfare in the United States when it landed in Chicago in 1933.\n\nThe principles of the [[The Doctrine of Fascism|doctrine of Fascism]] were laid down in an article by eminent philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] and Mussolini himself that appeared in 1932 in the ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]''. Mussolini always portrayed himself as an intellectual, and some historians agree.<ref>Bosworth, ''Mussolini '' pp. 58\u201359</ref> Gunther called him \"easily the best educated and most sophisticated of the dictators\", and the only national leader of 1940 who was an intellectual.{{r|gunther1940}} German historian [[Ernst Nolte]] said that \"His command of contemporary philosophy and political literature was at least as great as that of any other contemporary European political leader.\"<ref>Ernst Nolte, ''Three Faces of Fascism: Action Fran\u00e7aise, Italian Fascism, National Socialism'' (1966) p. 200</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!-- first four paragraphs have no citations -->\n[[File:Has seven 1 a.jpg|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini being cheered by Fascist Blackshirt youth in 1935|Benito Mussolini and Fascist [[Blackshirt]] youth in 1935]]\nNationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by [[Prime Minister of Italy|cabinets]]\u2014such as those of [[Giovanni Giolitti]], including traditional schooling. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], a revolutionary [[cultural movement]] which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for \"a school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for \"the by now prehistoric and [[Technophobia|troglodyte]] [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] courses\", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the [[Arditi]] soldiers (\"[learning] to advance on hands and knees in front of razing machine gun fire; to wait open-eyed for a crossbeam to move sideways over their heads etc.\"). It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: [[Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista]] (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and ''Gruppi Universitari Fascisti'' (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.\n\nAfter the March on Rome that brought Mussolini to power, the Fascists started considering ways to politicize Italian society, with an accent on education. Mussolini assigned former [[Arditi|ardito]] and deputy-secretary for Education [[Renato Ricci]] the task of \"reorganizing the youth from a moral and physical point of view.\" Ricci sought inspiration with [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], meeting with him in England, as well as with [[Bauhaus]] artists in Germany. The [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] was created through Mussolini's decree of 3 April 1926, and was led by Ricci for the following eleven years. It included children between the ages of 8 and 18, grouped as the Balilla and the Avanguardisti.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Colorized photograph of Mussolini wearing the [[commander-in-chief]] uniform]]\nAccording to Mussolini: \"Fascist education is moral, physical, social, and military: it aims to create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views\". Mussolini structured this process taking in view the emotional side of childhood: \"Childhood and adolescence alike&nbsp;... cannot be fed solely by concerts, theories, and abstract teaching. The truth we aim to teach them should appeal foremost to their fantasy, to their hearts, and only then to their minds\".\n\nThe \"educational value set through action and example\" was to replace the established approaches. Fascism opposed its version of [[idealism]] to prevalent [[rationalism]], and used the Opera Nazionale Balilla to circumvent educational tradition by imposing the collective and hierarchy, as well as Mussolini's own [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].\n\nAnother important constituent of the Fascist cultural policy was [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1929, a concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was signed, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the [[Papacy]] that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the [[Papal States]] by the [[House of Savoy]] during the [[unification of Italy]]. The [[Lateran treaties]], by which the Italian state was at last recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognized by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope [[Pius XI]] acclaimed Mussolini as \"the Man of Providence\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fattorini|first=Emma|title=Hitler, Mussolini and the Vatican: Pope Pius XI and the speech that was never made|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4488-2|page=xi|edition=[English edition]}}</ref>\n\nThe 1929 treaty included a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honor and dignity of the Pope by prosecuting offenders.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN1944220320080919 Comic escapes prosecution for insulting pope (Oddly Enough) Reuters], (Friday 19 September 2008 1:15&nbsp;pm EDT) By Phil Stewart</ref> In 1927, Mussolini was re-[[baptism|baptized]] by a Roman Catholic priest.

In the 1920s, Italy's foreign policy was based on the traditional idea of Italy maintaining \"equidistant\" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise \"determinant weight\", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa.<ref>Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pp. 129 & 141</ref> In the meantime, since for Mussolini demography was destiny, he carried out relentless natalist policies designed to increase the birthrate; for example, in 1924 making advocating or giving information about contraception a criminal offense, and in 1926 ordering every Italian woman to double the number of children that they were willing to bear.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 27.</ref> For Mussolini, Italy's current population of 40 million was insufficient to fight a major war, and he needed to increase the population to at least 60 million Italians before he would be ready for war.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 26.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mussolini inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]]]]\nIn his early years in power, Mussolini operated as a pragmatic statesman, trying to achieve some advantages, but never at the risk of war with Britain and France.

Factories all over Italy were brought to a virtual standstill because [[raw materials]], such as coal and oil, were lacking. Additionally, there was a chronic shortage of food, and what food was available was being sold at nearly confiscatory prices. Mussolini's once-ubiquitous propaganda machine lost its grip on the people; a large number of Italians turned to [[Vatican Radio]] or [[BBC World Service|Radio London]] for more accurate news coverage.

Mussolini feared that with the losses in Tunisia and North Africa, the next logical step for [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s armies would be to come across the Mediterranean and attack the Italian peninsula. Within a few days of the Allied landings on Sicily in July 1943, it was obvious Mussolini's army was on the brink of collapse. This led Hitler to summon Mussolini to a meeting in [[Feltre]] on 19 July 1943. By this time, Mussolini was so shaken from stress that he could no longer stand Hitler's boasting.

This was done both to discourage any Fascists from continuing the fight, and as an act of revenge for the hanging of many partisans in the same place by Axis authorities. The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse. Fascist loyalist [[Achille Starace]] was captured and sentenced to death and then taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini. Starace, who once said of Mussolini \"He is a god,\"<ref>Quoted in \"Mussolini: A New Life\", p. 276 by Nicholas Burgess Farrell. 2004</ref> saluted what was left of his leader just before he was shot. The body of Starace was subsequently hung up next to that of Mussolini.\n\nAfter his death and the display of his corpse in Milan, Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the [[Cimitero Maggiore di Milano|Musocco]] cemetery, to the north of the city. On [[Easter Sunday]] 1946, his body was located and dug up by [[Domenico Leccisi]] and two other [[neo-fascism|neo-Fascists]].\n\nOn the loose for months\u2014and a cause of great anxiety to the new Italian democracy\u2014Mussolini's body was finally \"recaptured\" in August, hidden in a small trunk at the [[Certosa di Pavia]], just outside Milan. Two [[Franciscan Order|Fransciscan]] brothers were subsequently charged with concealing the corpse, though it was discovered on further investigation that it had been constantly on the move. Unsure what to do, the authorities held the remains in a kind of political limbo for ten years, before agreeing to allow them to be re-interred at [[Predappio]] in [[Romagna]], his birthplace. [[Adone Zoli]], the then-current prime minister, contacted [[Rachele Mussolini|Donna Rachele]], the dictator's widow, to tell her he was returning the remains, as he needed the support of the far-right in parliament, including Leccisi himself. In Predappio the dictator was buried in a crypt (the only posthumous honor granted to Mussolini).

Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted.<ref name=\"timeswife\"/> With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, [[Edda Mussolini|Edda]] (1910\u20131995) and Anna Maria (1929\u20131968), the latter of whom married in [[Ravenna]] on 11 June 1960 to Nando Pucci Negri; and three sons: [[Vittorio Mussolini|Vittorio]] (1916\u20131997), [[Bruno Mussolini|Bruno]] (1918\u20131941) and [[Romano Mussolini|Romano]] (1927\u20132006).

Like most of his generation he dramatised human affairs in incurably geographical patches, and like most of the masterful men of his time his belief in his power to mould the life about him carried him beyond sanity. From the beginning his was an ill-balanced temperament; he would be blatant at one moment, and weeping at another. He beat at the knees of Mother Reality like an unteachable child. He wanted war and conquest, triumph over definable enemies, fierce alliances, and unforgettable antagonisms. He wanted glory. He died, as his last words testify, completely unaware of the fact that the rational treatment of human affairs does not admit of that bilaterality which the traditions of warfare require. \"Do we win?\" he said.\n\nHe persuaded himself and he persuaded great multitudes of people that two great systems of ideas faced each other in the world, \"Leftism\" and \"Rightism\", and that he and his associated Dictators embodied the latter.

After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes,<ref name=Haugen_p9_71>[[#Haugen|Haugen]], pp. 9, 71</ref> Mussolini and his followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a [[one-party state|one-party dictatorship]]. Within five years, Mussolini had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means and aspired to create a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state. In 1929, Mussolini signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the Vatican, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the Papacy, and recognized the independence of [[Vatican City]].\n\nMussolini's foreign policy aimed to expand the sphere of influence of [[Italian fascism]]. In 1923, he began the \"[[Pacification of Libya]]\" and [[Corfu incident|ordered the bombing of Corfu]] in retaliation for the murder of an Italian general. In 1936, Mussolini formed [[Italian East Africa]] (AOI) by merging [[Eritrea]], [[Italian Somaliland|Somalia]] and [[Ethiopia]] following the [[Abyssinian crisis]] and the [[Second Italo\u2013Ethiopian War]]. In 1939, Italian forces occupied [[Albania]]. Between 1936 and 1939, Mussolini ordered the successful [[Italian military intervention in Spain]] in favor of [[Francisco Franco]] during the [[Spanish civil war]]. Initially, Mussolini's Italy tried to avoid the outbreak of a second global war by taking part in the [[Stresa front]], the [[Lytton Report]], the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the [[Four-Power Pact]] and the [[Munich Agreement]]. However, Italy then alienated itself from Britain and France by [[Axis powers|aligning]] with Germany and Japan. Germany [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, resulting in declarations of war by France and the UK and the start of [[World War II]].\n\nOn 10 June 1940\u2014with the [[Fall of France]] imminent\u2014Italy officially entered the war and eventually occupied [[Italian occupation of France|parts of south-east France]], [[Italian occupation of Corsica|Corsica]], and [[Tunisian campaign|Tunisia]]. Mussolini planned to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the [[British Empire]] in Africa and the Middle East, known as the \"parallel war\", while expecting the collapse of the UK in the [[European theatre of world war II|European theatre]]. The Italians [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]], [[Italian bombing of Mandatory Palestine in World War II|bombed Mandatory Palestine]], and [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|occupied British Somaliland]] with initial success. However, the British government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting [[Axis Powers|Axis]] victories in Eastern and Western Europe; plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In October 1940, Mussolini sent Italian forces into Greece, starting the [[Greco-Italian War]]. The [[Royal Air Force]] prevented the Italian invasion and allowed the Greeks to push the Italians back to Albania.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoIlDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT85&dq=Italian+forces+in+Greece+british+air+force#v=onepage&q=Italian%20forces%20in%20Greece%20british%20air%20force&f=false |title = The Desert Air Force in World War II: Air Power in the Western Desert, 1940-1942|isbn = 9781526703798|last1 = Delve|first1 = Ken Delve|date = 31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan campaign]] was significantly prolonged until the definition of the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] and [[Occupation of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].

He was influenced by [[Anti-Austrian sentiment|anti-Austrian]] Italian nationalist sentiments, believing that the war offered Italians in Austria-Hungary the chance to liberate themselves from rule of the [[Hapsburg|Habsburgs]]. He eventually decided to declare support for the war by appealing to the need for socialists to overthrow the [[Hohenzollern]] and Habsburg monarchies in Germany and Austria-Hungary who he said had consistently repressed socialism.<ref name=\"Emile Ludwig 1969. p. 321\">Emil Ludwig.

He argued that the fall of Hohenzollern and Habsburg monarchies and the repression of \"reactionary\" Turkey would create conditions beneficial for the working class. While he was supportive of the Entente powers, Mussolini responded to the conservative nature of [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] by stating that the mobilization required for the war would undermine Russia's reactionary authoritarianism and the war would bring Russia to social revolution. He said that for Italy the war would complete the process of ''[[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]'' by uniting the Italians in Austria-Hungary into Italy and by allowing the common people of Italy to be participating members of the Italian nation in what would be Italy's first national war. Thus he claimed that the vast social changes that the war could offer meant that it should be supported as a revolutionary war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=189}}\n\nAs Mussolini's support for the intervention solidified, he came into conflict with socialists who opposed the war. He attacked the opponents of the war and claimed that those proletarians who supported [[pacifism]] were out of step with the proletarians who had joined the rising interventionist [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] that was preparing Italy for a revolutionary war. He began to criticize the Italian Socialist Party and socialism itself for having failed to recognize the national problems that had led to the outbreak of the war.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=191}} He was expelled from the party for his support of intervention.\n\nThe following excerpts are from a police report prepared by the Inspector-General of Public Security in Milan, G. Gasti, that describe his background and his position on the First World War that resulted in his ousting from the Italian Socialist Party. The Inspector General wrote:\n{{bquote|Professor Benito Mussolini,&nbsp;... 38, revolutionary socialist, has a police record; elementary school teacher qualified to teach in secondary schools; former first secretary of the Chambers in Cesena, Forl\u00ec, and Ravenna; after 1912 editor of the newspaper ''Avanti!'' to which he gave a violent suggestive and intransigent orientation. In October 1914, finding himself in opposition to the directorate of the Italian Socialist party because he advocated a kind of active neutrality on the part of Italy in the War of the Nations against the party's tendency of absolute neutrality, he withdrew on the twentieth of that month from the directorate of ''Avanti!'' Then on the fifteenth of November [1914], thereafter, he initiated publication of the newspaper ''Il Popolo d'Italia'', in which he supported\u2014in sharp contrast to ''Avanti!'' and amid bitter polemics against that newspaper and its chief backers\u2014the thesis of Italian intervention in the war against the militarism of the Central Empires. For this reason he was accused of moral and political unworthiness and the party thereupon decided to expel him&nbsp;...

This came about not for reasons of self-interest or money. He was a sincere and passionate advocate, first of vigilant and armed neutrality, and later of war; and he did not believe that he was compromising with his personal and political honesty by making use of every means\u2014no matter where they came from or wherever he might obtain them\u2014to pay for his newspaper, his program and his line of action. This was his initial line.

We used to believe that the concept was totally without substance. Instead we see the nation arise as a palpitating reality before us!&nbsp;... Class cannot destroy the nation.

He no longer advocated a proletarian vanguard, but instead a vanguard led by dynamic and revolutionary people of any social class.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=192}}\nThough he denounced orthodox socialism and class conflict, he maintained at the time that he was a nationalist socialist and a supporter of the legacy of nationalist socialists in Italy's history, such as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], and [[Carlo Pisacane]]. As for the Italian Socialist Party and its support of orthodox socialism, he claimed that his failure as a member of the party to revitalize and transform it to recognize the contemporary reality revealed the hopelessness of orthodox socialism as outdated and a failure.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=193}} This perception of the failure of orthodox socialism in the light of the outbreak of World War I was not solely held by Mussolini; other pro-interventionist Italian socialists such as [[Filippo Corridoni]] and [[Sergio Panunzio]] had also denounced classical [[Marxism]] in favor of intervention.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=195}}\n\n[[File:Mussolini bersagliere.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Mussolini as a ''[[bersagliere]]'' during WWI]]\n\nThese basic political views and principles formed the basis of Mussolini's newly formed political movement, the ''Fasci Rivoluzionari d'Azione Internazionalista'' in 1914, who called themselves ''Fascisti'' (Fascists).{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=193, 195}} At this time, the Fascists did not have an integrated set of policies and the movement was small, ineffective in its attempts to hold mass meetings, and was regularly harassed by government authorities and orthodox socialists.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|pp=195\u201396}} Antagonism between the interventionists, including the Fascists, versus the anti-interventionist orthodox socialists resulted in violence between the Fascists and socialists. The opposition and attacks by the anti-interventionist revolutionary socialists against the Fascists and other interventionists were so violent that even [[democratic socialist]]s who opposed the war such as [[Anna Kuliscioff]] said that the Italian Socialist Party had gone too far in a campaign of silencing the freedom of speech of supporters of the war. These early hostilities between the Fascists and the revolutionary socialists shaped Mussolini's conception of the nature of Fascism in its support of political violence.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=196}}\n\nMussolini became an ally with the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] politician and journalist [[Cesare Battisti (politician)|Cesare Battisti]] and\u2014like him\u2014entered the Army and served in the war. \"He was sent to the zone of operations where he was seriously injured by the explosion of a grenade.\"<ref name=\"Mediterranean4\"/>\n\nThe Inspector General continued:\n{{bquote|He was promoted to the rank of corporal \"for merit in war\".

Mussolini utilized works of [[Plato]], [[Georges Sorel]], [[Nietzsche]], and the economic ideas of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], to develop fascism. Mussolini admired Plato's ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', which he often read for inspiration.{{sfn|Moseley|2004|p=39}} ''The Republic'' expounded a number of ideas that fascism promoted, such as rule by an elite promoting the state as the ultimate end, opposition to democracy, protecting the class system and promoting class collaboration, rejection of egalitarianism, promoting the militarization of a nation by creating a class of warriors, demanding that citizens perform civic duties in the interest of the state, and utilizing state intervention in education to promote the development of warriors and future rulers of the state.<ref>Sharma, Urmila.

The right to colonize the neighboring [[Slovene minority in Italy (1920\u20131947)|Slovene ethnic areas]] and the Mediterranean, being inhabited by what were alleged to be less developed peoples, was justified on the grounds that Italy was allegedly suffering from overpopulation.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=50\u201351}}\n\nBorrowing the idea first developed by [[Enrico Corradini]] before 1914 of the natural conflict between \"[[plutocratic]]\" nations like Britain and \"proletarian\" nations like Italy, Mussolini claimed that Italy's principal problem was that \"plutocratic\" countries like Britain were blocking Italy from achieving the necessary ''spazio vitale'' that would let the Italian economy grow.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|pp=48\u201350}} Mussolini equated a nation's potential for economic growth with territorial size, thus in his view the problem of poverty in Italy could only be solved by winning the necessary ''spazio vitale''.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=50}}\n\nThough [[biological racism]] was less prominent in Fascism than in [[National Socialism]], right from the start the ''spazio vitale'' concept had a strong racist undercurrent.

In Mussolini's thinking, [[demography]] was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die.

By Mussolini's reckoning, the Italian population had to reach 60 million to enable Italy to fight a major war\u2014hence his relentless demands for Italian women to have more children in order to reach that number.{{sfn|Kallis|2002|p=52}}\n\nMussolini and the fascists managed to be simultaneously [[revolutionary]] and [[Traditionalist Conservatism|traditionalist]];<ref>{{cite journal |jstor= 1852268 |author= Roland Sarti |title= Fascist Modernization in Italy: Traditional or Revolutionary |date= 8 January 2008 |pages= 1029\u201345 |volume= 75 |issue= 4 |journal= The American Historical Review |doi= 10.2307/1852268}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |publisher= Appstate.edu |title= Mussolini's Italy |date= 8 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080415145038/http://www.appstate.edu/~brantzrw/history3134/mussolini.html |archivedate= 15 April 2008}}</ref> because this was vastly different from anything else in the political climate of the time, it is sometimes described{{by whom|date=July 2016}} as \"The Third Way\".<ref>{{Cite book |last= Macdonald | first= Hamish |title= Mussolini and Italian Fascism |publisher= Nelson Thornes |url= https://books.google.com/?id=221W9vKkWrcC&pg=PT17&dq=%22third+way%22+mussolini |isbn= 978-0-7487-3386-6 |year= 1999}}</ref> The Fascisti, led by one of Mussolini's close confidants, [[Dino Grandi]], formed armed squads of war veterans called [[blackshirts]] (or ''[[Squadrismo|squadristi]]'') with the goal of restoring order to the streets of Italy with a strong hand. The blackshirts clashed with communists, socialists, and anarchists at parades and demonstrations; all of these factions were also involved in clashes against each other. The Italian government rarely interfered with the blackshirts' actions, owing in part to a looming threat and widespread fear of a communist revolution. The Fascisti grew rapidly; within two years they transformed themselves into the [[National Fascist Party]] at a congress in Rome.

On the morning of 28 October, [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|King Victor Emmanuel III]], who according to the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] held the supreme military power, refused the government request to declare [[martial law]], which led to Facta's resignation. The King then handed over power to Mussolini (who stayed in his headquarters in Milan during the talks) by asking him to form a new government. The King's controversial decision has been explained by historians as a combination of delusions and fears; Mussolini enjoyed wide support in the military and among the industrial and agrarian elites, while the King and the conservative establishment were afraid of a possible civil war and ultimately thought they could use Mussolini to restore law and order in the country, but failed to foresee the danger of a totalitarian evolution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lyttelton|first=Adrian|title=The Seizure of Power: Fascism in Italy, 1919\u20131929|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-55394-0|pages=75\u201377}}</ref>\n\n=== Appointment as Prime Minister ===\nAs Prime Minister, the first years of Mussolini's rule were characterized by a right-wing coalition government composed of Fascists, nationalists, liberals, and two Catholic clerics from the [[Italian People's Party (1919\u20131926)|Popular Party]]. The Fascists made up a small minority in his original governments. Mussolini's domestic goal was the eventual establishment of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state with himself as supreme leader (''[[Il Duce]]''), a message that was articulated by the Fascist newspaper ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia|Il Popolo]]'', which was now edited by Mussolini's brother, [[Arnaldo Mussolini|Arnaldo]]. To that end, Mussolini obtained from the legislature dictatorial powers for one year (legal under the Italian constitution of the time). He favored the complete restoration of state authority, with the integration of the ''Fasci di Combattimento'' into the armed forces (the foundation in January 1923 of the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'') and the progressive identification of the party with the state. In political and social economy, he passed legislation that favored the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes (privatizations, liberalizations of rent laws and dismantlement of the unions).<ref name=\"Living History 2\" />\n\nIn 1923, Mussolini sent Italian forces to invade [[Corfu]] during the [[Corfu incident]].

First, he went beyond the vague promise of future national renewal, and proved the movement could actually seize power and operate a comprehensive government in a major country along fascist lines. Second, the movement claimed to represent the entire national community, not a fragment such as the working class or the aristocracy. He made a significant effort to include the previously alienated Catholic element. He defined public roles for the main sectors of the business community rather than allowing it to operate backstage. Third, he developed a cult of one-man leadership that focused media attention and national debate on his own personality. As a former journalist, Mussolini proved highly adept at exploiting all forms of mass media, including such new forms as motion pictures and radio. Fourth, he created a mass membership party, with free programs for young men, young women, and various other groups who could therefore be more readily mobilized and monitored. He shut down all alternative political formations and parties (but this step was not an innovation by any means). Like all dictators he made liberal use of the threat of extrajudicial violence, as well as actual violence by his Blackshirts, to frighten his opposition.<ref>Konrad Jarausch, ''Out of Ashes: A new history of Europe in the 20th century'' (2015) pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\n=== Police state ===\n{{See also|Assassination attempts on Benito Mussolini}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini.gif|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini seated portrait in suit and tie facing left|Mussolini in his early years in power]]\nBetween 1925 and 1927, Mussolini progressively dismantled virtually all constitutional and conventional restraints on his power and built a [[police state]]. A law passed on 24 December 1925\u2014Christmas Eve for the largely [[Roman Catholic]] country\u2014changed Mussolini's formal title from \"President of the Council of Ministers\" to \"Head of the Government\", although he was still called \"Prime Minister\" by most non-Italian news sources. He was no longer responsible to Parliament and could be removed only by the King. While the [[Statuto Albertino|Italian constitution]] stated that ministers were responsible only to the sovereign, in practice it had become all but impossible to govern against the express will of Parliament. The Christmas Eve law ended this practice, and also made Mussolini the only person competent to determine the body's agenda. This law transformed Mussolini's government into a de facto legal dictatorship. Local autonomy was abolished, and [[podest\u00e0]]s appointed by the [[Italian Senate]] replaced elected mayors and councils.\n\nOn 7 April 1926, Mussolini survived a first assassination attempt by [[Violet Gibson]], an Irish woman and daughter of [[Edward Gibson, 1st Baron Ashbourne|Lord Ashbourne]], who was deported after her arrest.<ref name=thetimesapr081926>The Times, Thursday, 8 April 1926; p. 12; Issue 44240; column A</ref> On 31 October 1926, 15-year-old [[Anteo Zamboni]] attempted to shoot Mussolini in Bologna.

In the same year, an electoral law abolished parliamentary elections. Instead, the [[Grand Council of Fascism]] selected a single list of candidates to be approved by [[Referendum|plebiscite]]. The Grand Council had been created five years earlier as a party body but was \"constitutionalized\" and became the highest constitutional authority in the state. On paper, the Grand Council had the power to recommend Mussolini's removal from office, and was thus theoretically the only check on his power. However, only Mussolini could summon the Grand Council and determine its agenda. To gain control of the South, especially [[Sicily]], he appointed [[Cesare Mori]] as a Prefect of the city of Palermo, with the charge of eradicating [[the Mafia]] at any price. In the telegram, Mussolini wrote to Mori:{{quote|Your Excellency has carte blanche; the authority of the State must absolutely, I repeat absolutely, be re-established in Sicily. If the laws still in force hinder you, this will be no problem, as we will draw up new laws.<ref>Arrigo Petacco, ''L'uomo della provvidenza: Mussolini, ascesa e caduta di un mito'', Milano, Mondadori, 2004, p. 190</ref>}}Mori did not hesitate to lay siege to towns, using torture, and holding women and children as hostages to oblige suspects to give themselves up. These harsh methods earned him the nickname of \"Iron Prefect\". In 1927, Mori's inquiries brought evidence of collusion between [[the Mafia]] and the Fascist establishment, and he was dismissed for length of service in 1929, at which time the number of murders in [[Palermo Province]] had decreased from 200 to 23.

His earliest (and one of the best known) was the ''Battle for Wheat'', by which 5,000 new farms were established and five new agricultural towns (among them [[Littoria]] and [[Sabaudia]]) on land reclaimed by draining the [[Pontine Marshes]]. In [[Sardinia]], a model agricultural town was founded and named ''Mussolinia'', but has long since been renamed [[Arborea]]. This town was the first of what Mussolini hoped would have been thousands of new agricultural settlements across the country. The Battle for Wheat diverted valuable resources to wheat production away from other more economically viable crops. Landowners grew wheat on unsuitable soil using all the advances of modern science, and although the wheat harvest increased, prices rose, consumption fell and high [[tariff]]s were imposed.<ref>Clark, Martin, ''Modern Italy'', Pearson Longman, 2008, p. 322</ref> The tariffs promoted widespread inefficiencies and the government [[subsidy|subsidies]] given to farmers pushed the country further into debt.\n\n[[File:Inaugurazione Littoria 001.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inaugurazione Littoria with massed parade in 1932|The inauguration of Littoria in 1932]]\n\nMussolini also initiated the \"Battle for Land\", a policy based on [[land reclamation]] outlined in 1928. The initiative had a mixed success; while projects such as the draining of the Pontine Marsh in 1935 for agriculture were good for propaganda purposes, provided work for the [[unemployment|unemployed]] and allowed for great land owners to control subsidies, other areas in the Battle for Land were not very successful. This program was inconsistent with the Battle for Wheat (small plots of land were inappropriately allocated for large-scale wheat production), and the Pontine Marsh was lost during World War II. Fewer than 10,000 [[peasant]]s resettled on the redistributed land, and [[peasant]] poverty remained high. The Battle for Land initiative was abandoned in 1940.\n\nIn 1930, in the Doctrine of Fascism he wrote, \"The so-called crisis can only be settled by State action and within the orbit of the State.\"<ref>Mussolini, Benito, The Doctrine of Fascism, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1479216345}}, p. 21</ref> He tried to combat [[economic recession]] by introducing a \"Gold for the Fatherland\" initiative, encouraging the public to voluntarily donate [[gold jewelry]] to government officials in exchange for steel [[wristband]]s bearing the words \"Gold for the Fatherland\". Even [[Rachele Mussolini]] donated her wedding ring. The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the [[national bank]]s.\n\nGovernment control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed [[price control]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Carl F.

The regime promoted a lavish [[Propaganda of Fascist Italy#Personality cult|cult of personality]] centered on the figure of Mussolini. He pretended to incarnate the new fascist [[\u00dcbermensch]], promoting an aesthetic of exasperated [[Machismo|Machism]] that attributed to him quasi-divine capacities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Falasca-Zamponi|first=Simonetta|title=Fascist spectacle : the aesthetics of power in Mussolini's Italy|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22677-7|page=67|edition=1st pbk.}}</ref> At various times after 1922, Mussolini personally took over the ministries of the interior, foreign affairs, colonies, corporations, defense, and public works. Sometimes he held as many as seven departments simultaneously, as well as the premiership. He was also head of the all-powerful Fascist Party and the armed local fascist militia, the [[Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale|MVSN]] or \"Blackshirts\", who terrorized incipient resistance in the cities and provinces. He would later form the [[OVRA]], an institutionalized [[secret police]] that carried official state support. In this way he succeeded in keeping power in his own hands and preventing the emergence of any rival.\n\nMussolini also portrayed himself as a valiant sportsman and a skilled musician. All teachers in schools and universities had to swear an oath to defend the fascist regime. Newspaper editors were all personally chosen by Mussolini, and only those in possession of a certificate of approval from the Fascist Party could practice journalism. These certificates were issued in secret; Mussolini thus skillfully created the illusion of a \"free press\". The trade unions were also deprived of any independence and were integrated into what was called the [[corporate state|\"corporative\" system]]. The aim, inspired by medieval [[guild]]s and never completely achieved, was to place all Italians in various professional organizations or ''corporations'', all under clandestine governmental control.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini Roman Salute.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Benito Mussolini saluting crowd|From 1925, Mussolini styled himself ''[[Il Duce]]'' (the leader)]]\nLarge sums of money were spent on highly visible public works and on international prestige projects. These included as the [[Blue Riband]] ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']]; setting aeronautical records with the world's fastest [[seaplane]], the [[Macchi M.C.72]]; and the transatlantic flying boat cruise of [[Italo Balbo]], which was greeted with much fanfare in the United States when it landed in Chicago in 1933.\n\nThe principles of the [[The Doctrine of Fascism|doctrine of Fascism]] were laid down in an article by eminent philosopher [[Giovanni Gentile]] and Mussolini himself that appeared in 1932 in the ''[[Enciclopedia Italiana]]''. Mussolini always portrayed himself as an intellectual, and some historians agree.<ref>Bosworth, ''Mussolini '' pp. 58\u201359</ref> Gunther called him \"easily the best educated and most sophisticated of the dictators\", and the only national leader of 1940 who was an intellectual.{{r|gunther1940}} German historian [[Ernst Nolte]] said that \"His command of contemporary philosophy and political literature was at least as great as that of any other contemporary European political leader.\"<ref>Ernst Nolte, ''Three Faces of Fascism: Action Fran\u00e7aise, Italian Fascism, National Socialism'' (1966) p. 200</ref>\n\n=== Culture ===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!-- first four paragraphs have no citations -->\n[[File:Has seven 1 a.jpg|thumb|alt=Benito Mussolini being cheered by Fascist Blackshirt youth in 1935|Benito Mussolini and Fascist [[Blackshirt]] youth in 1935]]\nNationalists in the years after World War I thought of themselves as combating the liberal and domineering institutions created by [[Prime Minister of Italy|cabinets]]\u2014such as those of [[Giovanni Giolitti]], including traditional schooling. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], a revolutionary [[cultural movement]] which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for \"a school for physical courage and patriotism\", as expressed by [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for \"the by now prehistoric and [[Technophobia|troglodyte]] [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]] courses\", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the [[Arditi]] soldiers (\"[learning] to advance on hands and knees in front of razing machine gun fire; to wait open-eyed for a crossbeam to move sideways over their heads etc.\"). It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: [[Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista]] (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and ''Gruppi Universitari Fascisti'' (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.\n\nAfter the March on Rome that brought Mussolini to power, the Fascists started considering ways to politicize Italian society, with an accent on education. Mussolini assigned former [[Arditi|ardito]] and deputy-secretary for Education [[Renato Ricci]] the task of \"reorganizing the youth from a moral and physical point of view.\" Ricci sought inspiration with [[Robert Baden-Powell]], the founder of [[Scouting]], meeting with him in England, as well as with [[Bauhaus]] artists in Germany. The [[Opera Nazionale Balilla]] was created through Mussolini's decree of 3 April 1926, and was led by Ricci for the following eleven years. It included children between the ages of 8 and 18, grouped as the Balilla and the Avanguardisti.\n\n[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Colorized photograph of Mussolini wearing the [[commander-in-chief]] uniform]]\nAccording to Mussolini: \"Fascist education is moral, physical, social, and military: it aims to create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views\". Mussolini structured this process taking in view the emotional side of childhood: \"Childhood and adolescence alike&nbsp;... cannot be fed solely by concerts, theories, and abstract teaching. The truth we aim to teach them should appeal foremost to their fantasy, to their hearts, and only then to their minds\".\n\nThe \"educational value set through action and example\" was to replace the established approaches. Fascism opposed its version of [[idealism]] to prevalent [[rationalism]], and used the Opera Nazionale Balilla to circumvent educational tradition by imposing the collective and hierarchy, as well as Mussolini's own [[Cult of personality|personality cult]].\n\nAnother important constituent of the Fascist cultural policy was [[Roman Catholicism]]. In 1929, a concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] was signed, ending decades of struggle between the Italian state and the [[Papacy]] that dated back to the 1870 takeover of the [[Papal States]] by the [[House of Savoy]] during the [[unification of Italy]]. The [[Lateran treaties]], by which the Italian state was at last recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, and the independence of Vatican City was recognized by the Italian state, were so much appreciated by the ecclesiastic hierarchy that Pope [[Pius XI]] acclaimed Mussolini as \"the Man of Providence\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Fattorini|first=Emma|title=Hitler, Mussolini and the Vatican: Pope Pius XI and the speech that was never made|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-7456-4488-2|page=xi|edition=[English edition]}}</ref>\n\nThe 1929 treaty included a legal provision whereby the Italian government would protect the honor and dignity of the Pope by prosecuting offenders.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN1944220320080919 Comic escapes prosecution for insulting pope (Oddly Enough) Reuters], (Friday 19 September 2008 1:15&nbsp;pm EDT) By Phil Stewart</ref> In 1927, Mussolini was re-[[baptism|baptized]] by a Roman Catholic priest.

At the center of his vision lay the dream to forge a new [[Roman Empire]] in Africa and the [[Balkans]], vindicating the so-called \"[[mutilated victory]]\" of 1918 imposed by the \"plutodemocracies\" (Britain and France) that betrayed the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and usurped the supposed \"natural right\" of Italy to achieve supremacy in the Mediterranean basin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burgwyn|first=H.

In the 1920s, Italy's foreign policy was based on the traditional idea of Italy maintaining \"equidistant\" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise \"determinant weight\", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and Africa.<ref>Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge, 2000 pp. 129 & 141</ref> In the meantime, since for Mussolini demography was destiny, he carried out relentless natalist policies designed to increase the birthrate; for example, in 1924 making advocating or giving information about contraception a criminal offense, and in 1926 ordering every Italian woman to double the number of children that they were willing to bear.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 27.</ref> For Mussolini, Italy's current population of 40 million was insufficient to fight a major war, and he needed to increase the population to at least 60 million Italians before he would be ready for war.<ref>Strang, Bruce ''On the Fiery March'', New York: Praeger, 2003 p. 26.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mussolini truppe Etiopia.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Mussolini inspecting troops during the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]]]]\nIn his early years in power, Mussolini operated as a pragmatic statesman, trying to achieve some advantages, but never at the risk of war with Britain and France.

In 1929, Mussolini ordered his Army General Staff to begin planning for aggression against France and Yugoslavia.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> In July 1932, Mussolini sent a message to German Defense Minister General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], suggesting an anti-French Italo-German alliance, an offer Schleicher responded to favorably, albeit with the condition that Germany needed to rearm first.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> In late 1932\u2013early 1933, Mussolini planned to launch a surprise attack against both France and Yugoslavia that was to begin in August 1933.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/> Mussolini's planned war of 1933 was only stopped when he learned that the French ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' had broken the Italian military codes, and that the French, being forewarned of all the Italian plans, were well prepared for the Italian attack.<ref name=\"Sullivan pp. 178\u2013203\"/>\n\nAfter [[Adolf Hitler]] came into power, threatening Italian interests in Austria and the Danube basin, Mussolini proposed the [[Four Power Pact]] with Britain, France and Germany in 1933. When the Austrian 'austro-fascist' Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss#Assassination|Engelbert Dollfuss]] with dictatorial power was assassinated on 25 July 1934 by National-Socialist supporters, Mussolini even threatened Germany with war in the event of a German invasion of Austria.

Historians are still divided about the reasons for the attack on Ethiopia in 1935.

One of those executed was his son-in-law, [[Galeazzo Ciano]]. As Head of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini used much of his time to write his memoirs. Along with his autobiographical writings of 1928, these writings would be combined and published by [[Da Capo Press]] as ''My Rise and Fall''. In an interview in January 1945 by Madeleine Mollier, a few months before he was captured and executed by Italian anti-fascist partisans, he stated flatly: \"Seven years ago, I was an interesting person.

This was done both to discourage any Fascists from continuing the fight, and as an act of revenge for the hanging of many partisans in the same place by Axis authorities. The corpse of the deposed leader was subject to ridicule and abuse. Fascist loyalist [[Achille Starace]] was captured and sentenced to death and then taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini. Starace, who once said of Mussolini \"He is a god,\"<ref>Quoted in \"Mussolini: A New Life\", p. 276 by Nicholas Burgess Farrell. 2004</ref> saluted what was left of his leader just before he was shot. The body of Starace was subsequently hung up next to that of Mussolini.\n\nAfter his death and the display of his corpse in Milan, Mussolini was buried in an unmarked grave in the [[Cimitero Maggiore di Milano|Musocco]] cemetery, to the north of the city. On [[Easter Sunday]] 1946, his body was located and dug up by [[Domenico Leccisi]] and two other [[neo-fascism|neo-Fascists]].\n\nOn the loose for months\u2014and a cause of great anxiety to the new Italian democracy\u2014Mussolini's body was finally \"recaptured\" in August, hidden in a small trunk at the [[Certosa di Pavia]], just outside Milan. Two [[Franciscan Order|Fransciscan]] brothers were subsequently charged with concealing the corpse, though it was discovered on further investigation that it had been constantly on the move. Unsure what to do, the authorities held the remains in a kind of political limbo for ten years, before agreeing to allow them to be re-interred at [[Predappio]] in [[Romagna]], his birthplace. [[Adone Zoli]], the then-current prime minister, contacted [[Rachele Mussolini|Donna Rachele]], the dictator's widow, to tell her he was returning the remains, as he needed the support of the far-right in parliament, including Leccisi himself. In Predappio the dictator was buried in a crypt (the only posthumous honor granted to Mussolini).

The couple had a son the following year and named him Benito Albino Mussolini. In December 1915, Mussolini married [[Rachele Mussolini|Rachele Guidi]], who had been his mistress since 1910. Due to his upcoming political ascendency, the information about his first marriage was suppressed, and both his first wife and son were later persecuted.<ref name=\"timeswife\"/> With Rachele, Mussolini had two daughters, [[Edda Mussolini|Edda]] (1910\u20131995) and Anna Maria (1929\u20131968), the latter of whom married in [[Ravenna]] on 11 June 1960 to Nando Pucci Negri; and three sons: [[Vittorio Mussolini|Vittorio]] (1916\u20131997), [[Bruno Mussolini|Bruno]] (1918\u20131941) and [[Romano Mussolini|Romano]] (1927\u20132006).

The 1988 U.S. Women's Open remains her only [[LPGA major]], but she won the [[Women's British Open]] in 1994, when it was recognised as a major championship by the [[Ladies European Tour]], but not by the LPGA Tour. She also finished second five times in three other major championships.\n\nHer best finish on the LPGA Tour money list is third in [[1994 LPGA Tour|1994]]. She also finished top ten in [[1996 LPGA Tour|1996]], [[1997 LPGA Tour|1997]] and [[1998 LPGA Tour|1998]].\n\nThroughout her career on the LPGA Tour, she continued to play on the [[Ladies European Tour]], as well as in [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. She won four times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]]. In [[1994 Ladies European Tour|1994]] Neumann topped the LET Order of Merit, was voted ''[[Golf World]]'''s Most Improved Golfer and awarded [[Swedish Golfer of the Year]] for the third time.\n\nNeumann played in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team against United States, six times in a row, [[1990 Solheim Cup|1990]], [[1992 Solheim Cup|1992]], [[1994 Solheim Cup|1994]], [[1996 Solheim Cup|1996]], [[1998 Solheim Cup|1998]], and [[2000 Solheim Cup|2000]]. She captained the team to victory in August, [[2013 Solheim Cup|2013]] at [[Colorado Golf Club]] in [[Parker, Colorado]], the first time team Europe won the cup on foreign soil, and the first time Europe won consecutive cups. Neumann won the [[Women's World Cup of Golf]] for Sweden in 2006 with [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]].\n\nShe was recognized during the LPGA\u2019s 50th Anniversary in 2000 as one of the LPGA\u2019s top 50 players and teachers.\n\nOn June 7, 2006, the Ladies European Tour announced that Neumann has earned Lifetime Membership of the LET, at the time a feat achieved by six other golfers, [[Helen

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]]. In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series was being shot, and Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script. Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no writing credits in the final cut. The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story. Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films. Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise. Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref> ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than its predecessor, ''Casino Royale''. {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Garda Lake]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate.

Directed by [[Marc Forster]] and written by [[Paul Haggis]], [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]], it is a direct sequel to [[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']], and the second film to star [[Daniel Craig]] as the fictional [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. The film also stars [[Olga Kurylenko]], [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Gemma Arterton]], [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Judi Dench]]. In the film, Bond seeks revenge for the death of his lover, [[Vesper Lynd]], and is assisted by [[Camille Montes]], who is plotting revenge for the murder of her own family. The trail eventually leads them to wealthy businessman [[Dominic Greene]], a member of the [[Quantum (James Bond)|Quantum]] organisation<!-- \"Organisation\" is British spelling, and the article uses British spelling -->, which intends to stage a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' in Bolivia to [[Water privatization in Bolivia|seize control of their water supply]]. \n\nProducer [[Michael G. Wilson]] developed the film's plot while the previous film in the series was being shot, and Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script. Although Craig and Forster wrote some sections themselves during the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|screenwriter strike]],<ref name=Goldberg /> they received no writing credits in the final cut. The title was chosen from a 1959<!-- The story was first published in November 1959 in ''Modern Woman's Magazine'', q.v. For Your Eyes Only (short story collection) for the citation --> short story in [[Ian Fleming]]'s ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', though the film does not contain any elements of that story. Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]]. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage [[Douglas DC-3]] was used for a flight sequence, and [[Dennis Gassner]]'s set designs are reminiscent of [[Ken Adam]]'s work on several early ''Bond'' films. Taking a course away from the usual [[List of James Bond villains|Bond villains]], Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.\n\nThe film was also marked by its frequent depictions of violence, with a 2012 study by the [[University of Otago]] in New Zealand finding it to be the most violent film in the franchise. Whereas ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' featured 109 \"trivial or severely violent\" acts, ''Quantum of Solace'' had a count of 250\u2014the most depictions of violence in any ''Bond'' film\u2014even more prominent since it was also the shortest film in the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|title=Sean Connery was the girliest Bond|publisher=Meeja|date=10 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2011|location=Australia|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108212058/http://meeja.com.au/2012/sean-connery-was-the-girliest-bond/|archivedate=8 January 2013}}</ref> ''Quantum of Solace'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 29 October 2008, garnering generally polarized reviews, which mainly praised Craig's performance, the darker, grittier and realistic tone and the film's action sequences, but felt that the film was less impressive than its predecessor, ''Casino Royale''. {{As of|2016|September}}, it is the fourth-highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film, without adjusting for inflation, earning $589&nbsp;million worldwide, and becoming the [[2008 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2008]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please remember to keep it short and around 600 words per WikiProject Films/Style guidelines, and that a spoiler warning is unnecessary per Wikipedia:Spoiler. -->\nMoments after the end of the previous film, James Bond is driving from [[Garda Lake]] to [[Siena]], Italy, with the captured [[List of James Bond villains#Casino Royale 2006|Mr. White]] in the [[Trunk (automobile)|boot]] of his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]]. After evading pursuers Bond delivers White to [[M (James Bond)|M]], who interrogates him regarding the then unknown organisation, [[SPECTRE#Rebooted continuity|Quantum]]. M's [[bodyguard]], Craig Mitchell, is a double agent and attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in [[Haiti]], Edmund Slate. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill [[Camille Montes]] at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur [[List of James Bond villains#Quantum of Solace|Dominic Greene]]. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president, in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\n\nAfter rescuing Camille from Medrano, Bond follows Greene to a performance of ''[[Tosca]]'' in [[Bregenz]], Austria. Meanwhile, the head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s South American section, Gregg Beam, strikes a noninterference deal with Greene for access to putative stocks of Bolivian oil, which the CIA believes to be the reason for Greene's interest in the land. Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A [[Counter Terrorism Command|Special Branch]] bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines, an advisor to the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and she has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally [[List of James Bond allies#Ren\u00e9 Mathis|Ren\u00e9 Mathis]] to accompany him to [[Bolivia]]. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields, a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her, and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police, paid off by Greene and Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the policemen are killed.\n\nThe following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a [[monopoly]]. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in [[Petroleum|crude oil]]. Bond meets CIA Agent [[Felix Leiter]], who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the [[Atacama Desert]] to finalise their agreement. Warned by Leiter, he evades the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] when they attempt to kill him.\n\nAt an [[eco hotel]] in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that he now controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, and Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Bolivia's sole provider of water at significantly higher rates; if Medrano refuses, Greene will deprive the country of water until it [[societal collapse|collapses]]. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum. Bond leaves him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil. \n\nBond travels to [[Kazan]], Russia, where he finds [[Vesper Lynd]]'s former lover, Yusef Kabira, a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections and is indirectly responsible for her death. Bond tells Kabira's latest target, Corrine Veneau, a [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|Canadian Intelligence]] agent, of Kabira's true intentions, thus sparing her Vesper's fate. He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]].
