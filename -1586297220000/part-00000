Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal [[mecha]] known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.\n\nHumanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.\n\nThe inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien \"Tharsis Cache\"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.\n\nThe Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.\n\nThe game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs a simulation, ''Starsiege'' offers players the ability to pilot a wide variety of massive bipedal war machines known as ''[[HERCULAN]]''s (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short), as well as several [[tank]]s. Set in 2829, ''Starsiege'' contains an array of advanced technology, and numerous upgrades are available for each vehicle. ''Starsiege'' takes place across a number of planets and moons in the solar system, offering a range of different locations throughout the game and in multiplayer battles, including Earth, Titan, Luna, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. There are two campaigns, Human and Cybrid.\n\nGameplay in ''Starsiege'' revolves around mechanized combat - piloting HERCs and tanks in combat against opposing vehicles. Both types of vehicles can be controlled via any combination of keyboard, joystick, or mouse input. Starsiege abandoned the \"torso-twist\" gameplay mechanic common in many mecha simulations (including preceding games in the series), a feature that would normally allow the user to swivel the HERC's upper body independently of its legs. In Starsiege, torso orientation is fixed forward, but the player can move the aiming recticle across the screen with a mouse, a feature [[GameSpot]] compared to playing a first-person shooter.<ref name=\"gamespot.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starsiege-review/1900-2535855/ |title=Starsiege Review |last=Kasavin |first=Greg |date=March 24, 1999 |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 2, 2017}}</ref> In both campaigns, the player is eventually assigned squadmates and is able to issue basic commands to them.<ref name=\"ign.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/04/07/starsiege |title=Starsiege |last=Blevins |first=Tal |date=April 6, 1999 |website=[[IGN]]}}</ref>\n\nEvery vehicle has unique performance, though this can be modified somewhat through customization of parts.

Played out in various locations throughout the solar system, the story examines both civil unrest in the colonies and an all-or-nothing genocidal invasion by the machines. Bipedal [[mecha]] known as HERCs are the mainstay of ground-based combat, and the focus of gameplay.\n\nHumanity is nominally united in an interplanetary Empire, led from Earth by the Immortal Emperor Solomon Petresun. Petresun's policy is the defence of Earth at all costs. While Earth is prosperous and well protected, the colonies on Luna, Mars, and Venus suffer from increasingly harsh regulations and production quotas. The combat units of the Empire are represented by the Imperial Police, Terran Defense Force and the Imperial Knights. The former paramilitary group is responsible for maintaining order in the colonies. The Terran Defense Force are the standard military with bases from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. The Knights, led by Grand Master Caanon Weathers, are the military's elite and are provided with the best pilots and equipment.\n\nThe inequality between the colonies and Earth foments rebellion. In 2802 there are two guerilla movements on Mars, one that concentrates on destroying and capturing Imperial infrastructure and supplies and another bent on killing Imperial personnel and sympathizers. Both groups operate from underground bases and make do with modified mining HERCs and tanks. The rebels partially offset their disadvantages with superior weapons taken from the alien \"Tharsis Cache\"; an underground stockpile of alien technology discovered by rebels while digging new tunnels. Eventually the rebellion becomes too great for the police to contain and the Knights are deployed to Mars to crush the insurrection.\n\nThe Cybrids are a race of sentient robots responsible for the first Earthsiege. They are led by the first Cybrid, Prometheus, who is revered with god-like status. The Cybrids established themselves in the outer solar system after being defeated two centuries before during the first Earthsiege. Since then they have built up their strength for another bid to destroy humanity and claim Earth for their own. Like the Martian rebels, the Cybrids discover their own cache of alien weapons and adapt it to use, but their cache is inferior to the Tharsis Cache.\n\nThe game offers two story campaigns, with different endings. The Human campaign puts the player in control of a Martian rebel, initially fighting the Empire before humanity unites against the Cybrid invasion midway through the campaign. The human campaign culminates in an attack on Prometheus on Pluto. The Cybrid campaign starts with their invasion across the outer colonies and proceeds to Earth, ending in an assault on the Imperial palace to kill Petresun.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs a simulation, ''Starsiege'' offers players the ability to pilot a wide variety of massive bipedal war machines known as ''[[HERCULAN]]''s (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short), as well as several [[tank]]s. Set in 2829, ''Starsiege'' contains an array of advanced technology, and numerous upgrades are available for each vehicle. ''Starsiege'' takes place across a number of planets and moons in the solar system, offering a range of different locations throughout the game and in multiplayer battles, including Earth, Titan, Luna, Mars, Venus, and Mercury. There are two campaigns, Human and Cybrid.\n\nGameplay in ''Starsiege'' revolves around mechanized combat - piloting HERCs and tanks in combat against opposing vehicles. Both types of vehicles can be controlled via any combination of keyboard, joystick, or mouse input. Starsiege abandoned the \"torso-twist\" gameplay mechanic common in many mecha simulations (including preceding games in the series), a feature that would normally allow the user to swivel the HERC's upper body independently of its legs. In Starsiege, torso orientation is fixed forward, but the player can move the aiming recticle across the screen with a mouse, a feature [[GameSpot]] compared to playing a first-person shooter.<ref name=\"gamespot.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starsiege-review/1900-2535855/ |title=Starsiege Review |last=Kasavin |first=Greg |date=March 24, 1999 |website=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=July 2, 2017}}</ref> In both campaigns, the player is eventually assigned squadmates and is able to issue basic commands to them.<ref name=\"ign.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/04/07/starsiege |title=Starsiege |last=Blevins |first=Tal |date=April 6, 1999 |website=[[IGN]]}}</ref>\n\nEvery vehicle has unique performance, though this can be modified somewhat through customization of parts.

LSCG, a party with a pro-independence agenda, is claimed to having used MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS) maintained close ties to [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic.\n\nAfter the death of Metropolitan Antonije, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedei\u0107. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. By 1997, the DPS administration in Montenegro led by [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] began to distance itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and started supporting and financing the Church, which received support from both the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]]; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned. By this time, LSCG had distanced itself from MOC almost completely.\n\nOn January 17, 2001, MOC was officially registered as a non-governmental organization at the local department of the Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior.<ref name=\"moc\">{{cite web|url = http://tmp.cpc.org.me/mne/saopstenja.php?id=1 |title = O registraciji crnogorske pravoslavne crkve |date = 22 March 2001 |publisher = MOC Official Website |language = Montenegrin |trans-title = About Montenegrin Orthodox Church Registration |accessdate = 7 July 2010}}</ref> In the absence of any other relevant and more current piece of legislation, this registration was done by calling on the ''Law on the Legal Position of Religious Communities'' from 1977 when Montenegro was a [[SR Montenegro|socialist republic]] within [[SFR Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn 2007, MOC attempted to expand its activities beyond the borders of Montenegro.

At a General Montenegrin People's Assembly formed by the MOC in Cetinje on January 6, 1997, he was chosen by traditional public acclamation the Head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. In the Church of St. Paraskeva in [[Sofia]], on March 15, 1998, he was ordained as bishop by [[Bulgarian Alternative Synod]]'s head Patriarch Pimen and seven Metropolitans and [[Episcop]]s of his [[synod]]. He was enthroned to Metropolitan of Montenegrin Orthodox Church in [[Cetinje]] on October 31, 1998, in the presence of several hundred believers and supporters of Montenegrin Orthodox Church.\n\n[[Metropolitan Mihailo]] had worked as a professor for the Serbian Orthodox Church and then as a priest of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in [[Italy]], where he uncanonically created a Serbian Orthodox Municipality out of the Greek Church, leading after a number of scandals, including [[adultery]] and accusations of [[embezzlement]], to his permanent suspension from the Church in 1995. After becoming Metropolitan of the MOC in 1997, he was fully [[excommunicated]] by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. During his pastoral visit in Argentina in 2007, the Metropolitan Mihailo met Cardinal Bergoglio, current [[Pope Francis]].\n\nOn January 11, 2007, MOC restored its own [[Holy Synod]] and proclaimed its first decree in which it confirms its [[autocephalous]] status. The Holy Synod is constituted by archpriests of MOC, led by [[Metropolitan Mihailo]]. The Holy Synod divided Montenegro in five [[eparchies]] &ndash; Cetinjska, Dukljanska, Primorska, Ostro\u0161ka and Beranska.\n\nOne of the prominent members of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was Jelisej Lalatovi\u0107, a former Serb monk from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], defrocked for stealing of church property and falsification of church seals.

LSCG, a party with a pro-independence agenda, is claimed to having used MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS) maintained close ties to [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic.\n\nAfter the death of Metropolitan Antonije, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedei\u0107. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. By 1997, the DPS administration in Montenegro led by [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] began to distance itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and started supporting and financing the Church, which received support from both the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]]; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned. By this time, LSCG had distanced itself from MOC almost completely.\n\nOn January 17, 2001, MOC was officially registered as a non-governmental organization at the local department of the Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior.<ref name=\"moc\">{{cite web|url = http://tmp.cpc.org.me/mne/saopstenja.php?id=1 |title = O registraciji crnogorske pravoslavne crkve |date = 22 March 2001 |publisher = MOC Official Website |language = Montenegrin |trans-title = About Montenegrin Orthodox Church Registration |accessdate = 7 July 2010}}</ref> In the absence of any other relevant and more current piece of legislation, this registration was done by calling on the ''Law on the Legal Position of Religious Communities'' from 1977 when Montenegro was a [[SR Montenegro|socialist republic]] within [[SFR Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn 2007, MOC attempted to expand its activities beyond the borders of Montenegro.

At a General Montenegrin People's Assembly formed by the MOC in Cetinje on January 6, 1997, he was chosen by traditional public acclamation the Head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. In the Church of St. Paraskeva in [[Sofia]], on March 15, 1998, he was ordained as bishop by [[Bulgarian Alternative Synod]]'s head Patriarch Pimen and seven Metropolitans and [[Episcop]]s of his [[synod]]. He was enthroned to Metropolitan of Montenegrin Orthodox Church in [[Cetinje]] on October 31, 1998, in the presence of several hundred believers and supporters of Montenegrin Orthodox Church.\n\n[[Metropolitan Mihailo]] had worked as a professor for the Serbian Orthodox Church and then as a priest of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in [[Italy]], where he uncanonically created a Serbian Orthodox Municipality out of the Greek Church, leading after a number of scandals, including [[adultery]] and accusations of [[embezzlement]], to his permanent suspension from the Church in 1995. After becoming Metropolitan of the MOC in 1997, he was fully [[excommunicated]] by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. During his pastoral visit in Argentina in 2007, the Metropolitan Mihailo met Cardinal Bergoglio, current [[Pope Francis]].\n\nOn January 11, 2007, MOC restored its own [[Holy Synod]] and proclaimed its first decree in which it confirms its [[autocephalous]] status. The Holy Synod is constituted by archpriests of MOC, led by [[Metropolitan Mihailo]]. The Holy Synod divided Montenegro in five [[eparchies]] &ndash; Cetinjska, Dukljanska, Primorska, Ostro\u0161ka and Beranska.\n\nOne of the prominent members of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was Jelisej Lalatovi\u0107, a former Serb monk from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], defrocked for stealing of church property and falsification of church seals. In early 2010 he joined with the Croatian Orthodox Union for the formation of the Croatian Orthodox Church and became its chief in [[Zadar]]. Lalatovi\u0107 was immediately expelled from the MOC on the grounds of spreading unrest and immorality in the church, the MOC officially dismissing its connections with the formation of the COC.<ref>Vesti Online, [http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Ex-YU/36667/Crnogorski-raspop-vraca-delo-Pavelica Crnogorski raspop vra\u0107a delo Paveli\u0107a], 14. 03. 2010.</ref><ref>Vesti Online, [http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Ex-YU/36940/Jelisej-iskljucen-iz-CPC-zbog-nemorala- Jelisej isklju\u010den iz CPC zbog nemorala], 15. 03. 2010.</ref>\n\n==Service==\n===In Montenegro===\nThe Montenegrin Orthodox Church currently holds its regular services in several Chapels in the area of Montenegro's royal capital, [[Cetinje]], as well as in its newly built Temple in Kotor.

[[Benjamin Holt]] attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to {{convert|7.5|ft}} tall and {{convert|6|ft}} wide, producing a tractor {{convert|46|ft}} wide. But this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive and difficult to maintain.\n\n[[File:Cat45-mojave.jpg|thumb|Two [[Holt tractor|Holt 45]] gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the [[Mojave Desert]] during construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in 1909.]]\nAnother solution considered was to lay a temporary [[plank road]] ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a {{convert|40|hp}} Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy [[Delta (landform)|delta land]] of [[Sacramento \u2013 San Joaquin River Delta|Roberts Island]].<ref name=\"laird\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |date=March 3, 2009 |title=Benjamin Holt (1849\u20131920): The Father of the Caterpillar tractor |first=Gwenyth Laird |last=Pernie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803071138/http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nContemporaneously [[Richard Hornsby & Sons]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, developed a steel plate tracked vehicle which it patented in 1904. This tractor steered by differential braking of the tracks and did not require the forward tiller steering wheel for steering making it the first to do so.  Several tractors were made and sold to operate in the Yukon, one example of which was in operation until 1927 remnants of which still exist to this day. However, Hornsby were unable to interest the British Military in 1907, although soldiers who witnessed the trials nicknamed the machine a caterpillar.  Hornsby therefore found a limited market for their tractor so they sold their patent to Holt in 1911, the same year Holt trademarked \"Caterpillar\".\n\nCompany photographer Charles Clements was reported to have observed that the tractor crawled like a [[caterpillar]],<ref name=\"about-inventors\">{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/bstartinventions/a/bulldozer.htm |title=History of Bulldozers| first= Mary |last=Bellis|publisher= About.com |accessdate=2010-02-28 }}</ref> and Holt seized on the metaphor. \"Caterpillar it is.

Military contracts formed the major part of the company's production. When the war ended, Holt's planned expansion to meet the military's needs was abruptly terminated. The heavy-duty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers. The company's situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.\n\n[[C. L. Best|C. L. Best Gas Tractor Company]], formed by Clarence Leo Best in 1910 and Holt's primary competitor, had during the war received government support enabling it to supply farmers with the smaller agricultural tractors they needed.<ref name=ohecat/><ref name=acmoc3>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmoc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=35&limit=1&limitstart=3 |title=Caterpillar History |accessdate=2010-02-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719235730/https://www.acmoc.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=14&Itemid=35&limit=1&limitstart=3 |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> As a result, Best had gained a considerable market advantage over Holt by war's end. Best also assumed considerable debt to allow it to continue expansion, especially production of its new Best Model 60 \"Tracklayer\".\n\nBoth companies were adversely impacted by the transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy, which contributed to a nationwide [[Depression of 1920\u201321|depression]], further inhibiting sales.

CTCT develops positioning and control products for earthmoving and paving machines in the construction and mining industries, using technologies such as GNSS, optical total stations, lasers and sonics. The products are used in a range of applications where the operator of the machine benefits from having accurate horizontal and vertical guidance. CTCT is based in [[Dayton, Ohio]], and started its operations on April 1, 2002.\n\n===Agriculture products===\nCaterpillar introduced the ''Challenger'' range of agricultural [[tractors]] as the result of several development programs over a long period of time. The program started in the 1970s and involved both D6-based units and Grader power units. A parallel program was also developing wheeled high hp tractors based on using the articulated loading shovel chassis was latter merged with the crawler team. The result was the Challenger Tractor and the \"Mobi-Trac\" system.\n\nThe Challenger has been marketed in Europe as [[Claas]] machines since 1997, with Caterpillar marketing the Claas-built Lexion combine range in the USA. Claas and Caterpillar formed a joint venture, ''Claas Omaha'', to build [[combine harvester]]s in Omaha, Nebraska, USA under the ''CAT'' brand. In 2002, Cat sold its stake to Claas, and licensed the use of ''CAT'' and the CAT yellow livery to Claas. They are marketed as ''Lexion'' combines now.\n\nAlso in 2002, Caterpillar sold the ''Challenger'' tracked tractor business to [[AGCO]] and licensed the use of the Challenger and CAT names and livery to them. This ended Cat's venture into agriculture.\n\n===Financial products and brand licensing===\nCaterpillar provides financing and insurance to customers via its worldwide dealer network <ref name=about/> and generates income through the licensing of the Caterpillar and CAT trademarks and logos.\n\n=== Brand licensing ===\n[[File:Caterpillar-brand work boot.jpg|right|thumb|Caterpillar-branded work boots manufactured by [[Wolverine World Wide]]]]\n\nCaterpillar sells the right to manufacture, market and sell products bearing the Cat trademark to licensees worldwide.

Several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations.\n\nIn 1992, the [[United Auto Workers]] conducted a five-month strike against Caterpillar. In response, Caterpillar threatened to replace Caterpillar's entire unionized work force. Over ten thousand UAW members struck again in 1994\u20131995 for 17 months, a record at that time. The strike ended with the UAW deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by Caterpillar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Caterpillar-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Caterpillar Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref> In 1994, Caterpillar offered a contract to the UAW members that would have raised the salary of top workers from $35,000 to $39,000 per year.

It suspended [[research and development]] work, sending thousands of engineers and other non-bargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members.\n\nRather than continuing to fight the United Auto Workers, Caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor. One way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms.

The violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with [[defeat device]]s, devices that regulated emissions during pre-sale tests, but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving. Consequently, these engines \"...emit up to triple the permissible level of smog-forming [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx). In 1998 alone, these violating vehicles emitted 1.3 million tons of additional NOx \u2013 an amount equal to the emissions of 65 million cars.\" For this reason, Caterpillar was named the \"Clean Air Villain of the Month\" for August 2000 by the [[Clean Air Trust]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.cleanairtrust.org/villain.0800.html\n|title=Six Diesel Engine Companies\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n|date=2000-08-01\n|work=Clean Air Villain of the Month\n|publisher=Clean Air Trust\n}}</ref> The consent decree provided that $83 million be paid in civil penalties and determined new deadlines for meeting emissions standards.

Those investigations uncovered significant changes in Caterpillar's offshore tax strategy, culminating in the creation of the new Swiss subsidiary Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) in [[Geneva]]. In 1999, the former Caterpillar executive Daniel Schlicksup accused the company of funneling profits from replacement parts to Switzerland where it had no warehouses or factories. The Internal Revenue Service found the firm liable for a billion dollars of unpaid taxes for the years 2007 to 2009.<ref name=\"A Fine Mess\">{{cite book|last1=Reid|first1=T.

[[Benjamin Holt]] attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to {{convert|7.5|ft}} tall and {{convert|6|ft}} wide, producing a tractor {{convert|46|ft}} wide. But this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive and difficult to maintain.\n\n[[File:Cat45-mojave.jpg|thumb|Two [[Holt tractor|Holt 45]] gas crawler tractors team up to pull a long wagon train in the [[Mojave Desert]] during construction of the [[Los Angeles Aqueduct]] in 1909.]]\nAnother solution considered was to lay a temporary [[plank road]] ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a {{convert|40|hp}} Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy [[Delta (landform)|delta land]] of [[Sacramento \u2013 San Joaquin River Delta|Roberts Island]].<ref name=\"laird\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |date=March 3, 2009 |title=Benjamin Holt (1849\u20131920): The Father of the Caterpillar tractor |first=Gwenyth Laird |last=Pernie |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803071138/http://www.wastehandling.com/ME2/Audiences/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&id=47C5DE563581487B9E4394B939909F9E&tier=4 |archivedate=August 3, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nContemporaneously [[Richard Hornsby & Sons]] in Grantham, Lincolnshire, England, developed a steel plate tracked vehicle which it patented in 1904. This tractor steered by differential braking of the tracks and did not require the forward tiller steering wheel for steering making it the first to do so.

However, Hornsby were unable to interest the British Military in 1907, although soldiers who witnessed the trials nicknamed the machine a caterpillar.

About 300 employees will work in the new office at an as-yet undecided location once the transition is complete. The company indefinitely suspended planning for the new Peoria headquarters in the fall of 2015 after announcing a restructuring effort that called for up to 10,000 jobs to be cut and about 20 facilities around the world to be closed or consolidated. The changes contributed to $2.3 billion in savings in 2016, but sales and revenue for last year still were more than 40 percent below peak levels of 2012.

That company had collaborated with Hornsby in the development of the vehicles demonstrated to the British military in 1907, providing the paraffin (kerosene) engines.\n\nHolt's track-type tractors played a support role in World War I.

Military contracts formed the major part of the company's production. When the war ended, Holt's planned expansion to meet the military's needs was abruptly terminated. The heavy-duty tractors needed by the military were unsuitable for farmers. The company's situation worsened when artillery tractors were returned from Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company struggled with the transition from wartime boom to peacetime bust. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.\n\n[[C. L. Best|C. L.

The result was the Challenger Tractor and the \"Mobi-Trac\" system.\n\nThe Challenger has been marketed in Europe as [[Claas]] machines since 1997, with Caterpillar marketing the Claas-built Lexion combine range in the USA. Claas and Caterpillar formed a joint venture, ''Claas Omaha'', to build [[combine harvester]]s in Omaha, Nebraska, USA under the ''CAT'' brand. In 2002, Cat sold its stake to Claas, and licensed the use of ''CAT'' and the CAT yellow livery to Claas. They are marketed as ''Lexion'' combines now.\n\nAlso in 2002, Caterpillar sold the ''Challenger'' tracked tractor business to [[AGCO]] and licensed the use of the Challenger and CAT names and livery to them.

Several news reports at the time indicated that products were piling up so high in facilities that replacement workers could barely make their way to their work stations.\n\nIn 1992, the [[United Auto Workers]] conducted a five-month strike against Caterpillar. In response, Caterpillar threatened to replace Caterpillar's entire unionized work force. Over ten thousand UAW members struck again in 1994\u20131995 for 17 months, a record at that time. The strike ended with the UAW deciding to return to work without a contract despite record revenues and profits by Caterpillar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Caterpillar-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Caterpillar Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}</ref> In 1994, Caterpillar offered a contract to the UAW members that would have raised the salary of top workers from $35,000 to $39,000 per year.

It suspended [[research and development]] work, sending thousands of engineers and other non-bargained for employees into their manufacturing and assembly facilities to replace striking or locked out union members.\n\nRather than continuing to fight the United Auto Workers, Caterpillar chose to make itself less vulnerable to the traditional bargaining tactics of organized labor. One way was by outsourcing much of their parts production and warehouse work to outside firms. In another move, according to UAW officials and industry analysts, Caterpillar began to execute a \"southern strategy\".<ref name=southernstrategy>{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/1996/06/24/story1.html |title=Caterpillar rolls into Lee County |first=Matthew |last=Burns |date=1996-06-24 |work=Triangle Business Journal |publisher=American City Business Journals, Inc |location=Raleigh, North Carolina |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x2zbdaXu?url=http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/1996/06/24/story1.html |archivedate=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=2011-03-08 |quote=Locating plants in non-union states such as North Carolina is part of Caterpillar's effort to decrease the impact of organized labor on production, according to union officials and analysts. |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}</ref> This involved opening new, smaller plants, termed \"focus facilities\", in [[right-to-work law|right-to-work]] states.

Caterpillar's Cast Metals Organization in Mapleton worked with the American Foundry Society to help produce a rule to reduce hazardous waste in scrap metal that meet strict quality requirements, and also allow foundries to continue recycling certain types of scrap and maintain a competitive cost structure. Caterpillar's Mossville Engine Center formed a team to look at used oil reuse and recycle processes that forced MEC to send large amounts of used oil off-site for recycling, and developed an updated system for reclaiming it for reuse on-site.

The violation involves over a million diesel engines sold with [[defeat device]]s, devices that regulated emissions during pre-sale tests, but that could be disabled in favor of better performance during subsequent highway driving. Consequently, these engines \"...emit up to triple the permissible level of smog-forming [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx).

Those investigations uncovered significant changes in Caterpillar's offshore tax strategy, culminating in the creation of the new Swiss subsidiary Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) in [[Geneva]]. In 1999, the former Caterpillar executive Daniel Schlicksup accused the company of funneling profits from replacement parts to Switzerland where it had no warehouses or factories.
