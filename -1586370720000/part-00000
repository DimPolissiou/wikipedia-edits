The result was the L.3, which was renamed the M.3 in 1917 to recognise the change in design from Lohner influenced to a Macchi design. Only the unequal-span biplane wings were inherited from the L.2; a new and refined hull and strut-mounted [[tailplane]] were designed. Like its predecessors, the new plane was powered by a single [[Isotta Fraschini]] engine strut mounted between the two wings and driving a [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] propeller. It was armed with a single [[machine gun]] on a trainable mounting and could also carry four light bombs. In 1916, one aircraft gained the world altitude record for a [[seaplane]] when it climbed to 5,400&nbsp;m (17,700&nbsp;ft) in 41 minutes.\n\n==Operational history==\nOver 200 M.3s were built and delivered to the Royal Italian Navy and were used on a variety of missions which including [[Bomber|bombing]], [[reconnaissance]], patrol and escort. For a short period in 1917, it was also used as a [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]]. Several aircraft were used in commando-style operations behind Austrian lines. The aircraft were highly regarded by the Royal Italian Navy and they were used on bombing raids and pioneered the Italian use of aerial photography. After [[World War I]], the type was used by training units until 1924.\n\nIn 1919, an L.3 which belonged to the Italian Military Mission in Argentina connected Buenos Aires with Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay for the first time. This plane was later donated to the Paraguayan government. [[Lieutenant]] Arturo Escario, who was already a pilot, trained in the L.3 in Argentina. This plane was destroyed in an accident on 30 September 1919.

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

He was arrested by czarist police in 1891, and again in 1892. Upon his release he moved to [[Zurich]], then to [[Paris]] and finally to [[London]]. In England he helped publish the Polish Socialist periodical ''Przed\u015bwit'' (\u201cThe Dawn\u201d). Active in the socialist movement, he often travelled undercover to Russian Poland, and became friends with [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. He also studied the cooperative movement, and on returning to Poland legally in 1906 he spent time working to develop Polish cooperatives. During [[World War I]] he considered [[Imperial Germany]] to be Poland\u2019s main enemy. With the Russian evacuation in 1915, he moved to [[Moscow]], and there in 1917 was elected president of the Council of Polish Parties\u2019 Union. He returned to [[Warsaw]] after the [[October Revolution]] and from January 1919 to July 1920 served as minister of the interior in two separate cabinets of the new [[Second Polish Republic]]. When the Republic's president [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was assassinated in December 1922, Wojciechowski was chosen to succeed him.\n\nDuring his presidency, Wojciechowski and his erstwhile friend military [[Polish General Staff|chief of staff]] Pi\u0142sudski disagreed on the political direction of the nation: Wojciechowski supported continued parliamentary government, while [[Pi\u0142sudski]] favoured a more [[authoritarian]] approach. In May 1926, due to the worsening economic issues of the country, Pi\u0142sudski staged the successful [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], after which Wojciechowski resigned from his post.<ref>Zygmunt Kaczmarek, ''Trzej prezydenci II Rzeczypospolitej'' (Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy Zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w Zawodowych, 1988), p. 167</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski was born on 15 March 1869 in [[Kalisz]] into a Polish noble family with strong ties to the [[intelligentsia]]. He was one of seven children of [[Second Lieutenant]] Feliks Wojciechowski (1825-1881), a caretaker of a prison in Kalisz who participated during the [[January Uprising]], and his wife Florentyna Vorhoff. He was raised in a spirit of patriotism and devotion to his homeland. In 1888, he graduated in the [[Kalisz|Men's Classical Junior High School in Kalisz]] and began his studies at the [[University of Warsaw|Imperial University of Warsaw]] where he studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics until 1891. He belonged to the circle of the most active conspirators, participant of the secret student groups for self-improvement. Wojciechowski was active during his studies, first in the conspiratorial organization [[Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\"]], and later in the burgeoning socialist movement. By 1892, he had abandoned his studies and chose the life of an exile after his second arrest and detention by the czarist police, first going to [[Zurich]] and then [[Paris]]. There he learned the trade of typesetter with which he supported himself. \n\nIn 1892, Wojciechowski co-founded the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and many nationalist and socialists met in Paris where they participated in the following year, on the first, illegally organized party conference in [[Vilnius]], where he met [[Pi\u0142sudski]]. In 1893, after he was deported from France. He found his new centre of life in London, where he worked as a typesetter, printer, journalist and publisher. He travelled several more times illegally to [[Congress Poland]] and the [[Russian Empire]] and smuggled printing machine components and publications into the country. Together with Pi\u0142sudski, he formed the backbone of the socialist movement in Russian Poland. In 1899, he married [[Maria Wojciechowska]], a daughter of a wealthy landowner of [[szlachta]] descent.<ref>Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski, \"Moje wspomnienia\" (Warszawa\u2013Lw\u00f3w: Ksi\u0105\u017cnica-Atlas, 1938), pp. 53\u201355, 130</ref>\n\n=== Political movements and career ===\nAfter 1905, he left the Polish Socialist Party over disagreements on the political future of Poland and its relations to the international class struggle. After the amnesty in 1906, he returned to Warsaw and took part in the cooperative movement by [[Edward Abramowski]]. During World War I, Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski believed that Germany posed the biggest threat to Poland and thus decided to stay in Russia rather than side with his erstwhile friend Pi\u0142sudski. After the Russian evacuation of Congress Poland of 1915, he moved to Moscow where he remained active in Polish political circles. After the fall of the Tsarist regime was elected President of the Council of Polish Parties\u2019 Union, and heavily engaged on behalf of the  [[Polish Army]] in Russia in 1918. He was forced to leave Moscow under threat of arrest once the Bolshevik regime seized power. On 15 January 1919, the Chief of State nominated him, Minister of Internal Affairs, in both the Cabinet of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] and [[Leopold Skulski]], whom Wojciechowski replaced during his numerous absences from the country. During this time, Wojciechowski also participated in the drafting of the Polish constitution.<ref>Zygmunt Kaczmarek, ''Trzej prezydenci II Rzeczypospolitej'' (Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy Zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w Zawodowych, 1988), pp. 114\u2013119</ref>\n\n== Presidency ==\n\n===1922 Presidential elections===\n{{main|1922 Polish presidential elections}}\n\n====First election====\n\nIn the [[1922 Polish legislative election|legislative elections]], Wojciechowski served as the candidate for the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] though he failed to win a seat. After the legislative elections, a balance appeared between the left and right forces. This situation also preponderated in the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]], which was to select a new [[President of Poland]] and produce a new [[1922 Polish presidential elections|presidential election]]. Pi\u0142sudski did not want to put up his candidacy, and [[Wincenty Witos]] was perceived as a person communicating with the right and not paying attention to the interests of rural villages. Therefore, the [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] put forward and appointed Wojciechowski as the new candidate for the presidency not involved in current political games. He accepted this decision, but when the [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]] informed that [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] planned to withdraw from the [[1922 Polish presidential elections|presidential race]]. Witos persuaded Narutowicz not to do that.\n\nWojciechowski was defeated in the fourth ballot to the landowner [[Count]] [[Maurycy Zamoyski]] who received 228 votes and Wojciechowski only reached 152 votes. Ate the time of the elections, the main candidates were Zamoyski and Wojciechowski. Narutowicz's good result was a surprise. Once the long voting was over, Zamoyski and Narutowicz advanced to the fifth ballot. Narutowicz finally won the election with the support of \"Piast\" (Wojciechowski was eliminated on the fourth round). Narutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the [[National Democracy]] movement), and of the centrist Polish People\u2019s Party \u201cPiast\u201d. This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first President of the Second Polish Republic.\n\n====Second election====\n\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz|assassination of President Narutowicz]] by the ultra-nationalist painter [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]] on 16 December 1922, [[Marshal of the Sejm]] [[Maciej Rataj]], who served briefly as acting head of state after the assassination, set the date of a new presidential election on 20 December 1922. The right-wings put forward the candidacy of Professor [[Kazimierz Morawski (philologist)|Kazimierz Morawski]]. Wojciechowski was nominated again as a compromise candidate and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski. Originally, Witos recommended his own party vote for Morawski. The left-wing opposed this and decided to vote for Wojciechowski, however, in connection with the events that led to the murder of Narutowicz. As a result of the internal party discussion, it was decided to support Wojciechowski's candidacy. In the first round, Wojciechowski secured 298 votes, with Morawski only gaining 221 votes, Wojciechowski won the election and became the second President of Poland. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/stanislaw-wojciechowski.html|title=Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski|website=memim.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the election, representatives of the National Assembly appeared in Wojciechowski's residence to notify him about his election as President. He considered that the will of the [[Sejm]] and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] should be followed. Alfons Erdman appeared at Wojciechowski's office and demanded him to abstain from accepting his choice. It was nevertheless too late, Wojciechowski decided that delay in this matter was improper. On 20 December 1922, Wojciechowski took the presidential oath and became [[President (government title)|President]].\n\n===Tenure===\n\n[[File:Benes i Wojciechowski.jpg|thumb|left|Wojciechowski with the Czechoslovakian President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], 1925]]\n[[File:Wojciechowski i Zaruski.jpg|thumb|left|Wojciechowski with Genera\u0142 [[Mariusz Zaruski]] near the [[Saxon Palace]] in Warsaw, 1926]]\nDuring his presidency, Wojciechowski attempted to be an enthusiastic politician, who was involved in the performance of the government. He actively supported the non-parliamentary ministry of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]]. The height of the president's political influence corresponded with Grabski's cabinet period of activity. Wojciechowski participated in the Political Committee of the Council of Ministers and had an impact on the content of ordinances on the [[Polish Z\u0142oty|currency reform]], created under special powers of attorney granted to the cabinet by the [[Sejm]]. Wojciechowski attempted to shape the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish constitutional system]] by introducing a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. The mission of forming a new government was entrusted to the leader of the largest group participating in the overthrow of the previous cabinet, and when Wojciechowski failed to select a cabinet, he advocated leaving the old cabinet or establishing a non-parliamentary cabinet. Wojciechowski used this method after the fall of the second cabinet of [[Wincenty Witos]] when he committed the purpose of setting a new ministry to [[Stanis\u0142aw Thugutt]]. Another indication of Wojciechowski's constitutional system was the adoption, opposite to the provisions of the constitution that the Sejm was assembling enduringly, and not in the session system. Wojciechowski never closed the session of the Sejm, which was dictated by the constitution.\n\nWojciechowski tried to maintain good relations with [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], who was in perpetual dispute with the succeeding cabinets and some parliamentary groups. The reason for the conflict was the organization of military authorities. Pi\u0142sudski always saw Wojciechowski as a person who would take his side. When in June 1923, [[Stanis\u0142aw Szeptycki]] addressed to the Sejm a bill on the highest military authorities, announcing the liquidation of the powerful military council, who Pi\u0142sudski served as the chairman, flared up a sharp dispute between him and the Marshal. Wojciechowski tried to settle this dispute. Accordingly, Pi\u0142sudski sent a letter to the president in which he addressed him with the words ''\"You have acted as a hangover in the matter of honour, which does not respect the rights of honour and forgets that honour belongs to people personally, not officially.\"'' Wojciechowski tried to negotiate between the opposing parties, including took into account the [[Maciej Rataj]]'s commentaries, who objected to committing the position of [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]] to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski|Sikorski]]. Pi\u0142sudski did not want to compromise and treated Wojciechowski, as what Rataj regarded, defiantly and as a servant. \n\nOn 5 September 1924, Wojciechowski visited the Polish city of [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). At the end of Kopernika and Legion\u00f3w Street, an explosive charge was thrown towards the car where the president was travelling. Fortuitously, the bomb did not explode and the assassin was arrested. The suspect of the assassination was Teofil Olszewski from the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]], who tried to illegally cross the [[Germany\u2013Poland border|German border]] near [[Bytom]] and was arrested by the [[Germans]] when on 3 October 1924. Olszewski was convicted of crossing the border illegally for two weeks in prison, suspended for one year, and then granted political refugee status in Germany and permission to settle in Marienburg ([[Malbork]]), close to the Polish border. It was believed that the assassin was Stanis\u0142aw Steiger, an employee of a commercial company and a student of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], was responsible. The man was arrested and imprisoned throughout the trial. He was threatened with the death penalty, but then the new circumstances of the assassination came to light. The first trial against Steiger took place on 15 and 16 September 1924 ere the District Court in Lviv. The prosecutor was Alfred Laniewski, and the defender was lawyer Micha\u0142 Grek. The Regional Court referred the case to ordinary proceedings with the participation of sworn judges. In the proceedings, Steiger was defended by lawyer Natan Loewenstein. The trial during which Loewenstein gave his defence speech did not take place until 16 December 1925. Steiger spent all this time in custody. Gratitude to the lawyer's speech, which Loewenstein published in Lviv a year later, the accused was cleared of the charges and acquitted.\n\nOn May 7, 1925, Wojciechowski travelled from [[Warsaw]] to [[Krak\u00f3w]] with the entire ceremonial held by the president. After receiving a report at the station from the commander of the honour company, Wojciechowski asked him if the soldiers were singing religious songs. After receiving a proof answer, Wojciechowski instructed the soldiers to sing some of them. They sang for about twenty minutes until the train left. Such behaviour of the president caused an understandable sensation in the country.\n\n===Fall from power===\n{{main|May Coup (Poland)}}\n\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski act of resignation 15.05. 1926.jpg|thumb|right|Wojciechowski's written resignation after his surrender in May Coup]]\nIn November 1925, the government of [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]] was replaced by the government of [[Aleksander Skrzy\u0144ski]], which had received support from the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] and the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]] became the new government's [[Minister of Military Affairs|minister of military affairs]].  However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]], formed by [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] and [[Christian Union of National Unity]] ([[Chjeno-Piast]]). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], who viewed the constant power shifts in the [[Sejm]] as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a [[trade war]] with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the [[Treaty of Locarno]] on October 16. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure a postwar territorial settlement in return for normalized relations with defeated Germany. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier), said that he was \"ready to fight the evil\" of sejmocracy and promised a \"sanation\" (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities. \n\nThe night of 11 May to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembert\u00f3w, where they pledged their support to Pi\u0142sudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the [[Wis\u0142a River]]. Meanwhile, Wincenty Witos' government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Pi\u0142sudski met Wojciechowski on the [[Poniatowski Bridge]]. [[Major]] [[Marian Porwit]] who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Pi\u0142sudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Pi\u0142sudski demanded the resignation of Witos' cabinet, while the President demanded Pi\u0142sudski's capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president's departure, Major Porwit refused Pi\u0142sudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos' cabinet decided to move from [[Belweder]] to [[Wilan\u00f3w]]. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. \nAfter transferring to [[Wilan\u00f3w]], Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to [[Pozna\u0144]] and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Bartel]], with Pi\u0142sudski as the new [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. On 31 May 1926, the [[Zgromadzenie Narodowe|National Assembly]] nominated Pi\u0142sudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] became the new president; Pi\u0142sudski, however, wielded much greater '' de facto'' power than his military ministry nominally gave him.\n\n== Later life ==\n\n===Scientific career===\n\nFollowing the resignation, Wojciechowski worked as a lecturer at the [[Warsaw School of Economics]] and the College of Agriculture in Warsaw. Wojciechowski served as the Director of the Cooperative Scientific Institute and later sat on the Scientific Council of the Institute. He published hermetic publications on cooperative activity, which he engaged in before he became an active politician. He wrote books such as the Organization of Agricultural Products Sales and the History of Polish Cooperatives until 1914. In 1937, he was the co-founder of the opposition [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]].\n\n===Second World War===\n\nOn 10 November 1939, the [[Gestapo]] arrested Wojciehowski's son, Edmund as part of [[German AB-Aktion in Poland]], he was threatened with execution, as were other representatives of the Polish [[intelligentsia]] caught on the streets. He was later released on 4 April 1940 because of [[Jerzy Antoni Potocki]], a former adjacent of [[Jozef Pi\u0142sudski]]. He later arrested on 12 July 1940 again because he was one of the 70 Warsaw lawyers who did not agree to remove Jewish associates from the [[Lawyers in Poland|Bar Council]]. The Germans offered his release in exchange for Wojciechowski signing a declaration stating that the [[Polish government-in-exile]] was constitutionally illegal. Wojciechowski refused to sign the declaration and Edmund was transferred on 15 August 1940 to the [[Auschwitz]] as one of the 1666 people of the first transport from [[Warsaw]], where he soon died of [[typhus]] on 23 February 1941. The family received a telegram sent from the concentration camp informing Wojciechowski about his son's passing, and soon an urn of ashes containing the remains of Edmund was sent back to his parents. During the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the ill Wojciechowski along with his wife Maria was rounded up by the [[Nazis]] and sent to the [[Destruction of Warsaw|Durchgangslager 121]], a transit camp in [[Pruszk\u00f3w]].\n\n===Death and Legacy===\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski retired to private life. He died in Go\u0142\u0105bki (now [[Ursus, Warsaw|Ursus]]) in 1953, at the age of 84. He was buried in Pow\u0105zki in Warsaw. Until the end of his life, he was convinced that everything that was bad in the history of Poland began during the May revolution.\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski experienced a political life, not unlike that of many Central European politicians during the early 20th century. A radical in his youth, his ideology matured and grew more conservative with age. He was at the forefront of over a quarter-century of Polish political development and is considered one of the founders of the modern independent Polish state. Historians in their opinion unanimously indicate that Wojciechowski remains a figure greatly underrated, they believe it should be remembered that his presidency fell on a particularly turbulent period in [[Polish history]]. He managed to make history as an outstanding politician and statesman and will remain in history as a relentless defender of democratic values and a prominent patriot.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{gallery\t\n|width=180px |height=180px\t\n|File:Hans de Segesser-Brunegg after giving letters of credence to Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski (1924).jpg|The presentation of credentials to the President of the Republic of Poland, Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski by the Envoy of Switzerland to Poland Hans de Segeseer-Brunegg, 1924. \t\n|File:Wizyta prezydenta Stanis\u0142awa Wojciechowskiego w Gnie\u017anie z okazji Wystawy Rolniczo-Przemys\u0142owo-Handlowej, wrzesie\u0144 1925 r..jpg|President Wojciechowski in [[Gniezno]] to tour the Exhibitions of Agriculture and Commerce, 1925.\t\t\n|File:Zapiski Wojciechowskiego (HistoriaPolski str.187).jpg|President Wojciechowski's handwritten description of his meeting with Pi\u0142sudski on the [[Poniatowski Bridge]] during the May Coup in 1926.\t\n|File:President Stanislaw Wojciechowski in Pruszkow Transit Camp.jpg|Wojciechowski with his wife Maria Kiersnowska (right) in Durchgangslager 121 in Pruszk\u00f3w, after being expelled from Warsaw at the end of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (October 1944).\t\n|File:Wojciechowski.jpg|A modern caricature of President Wojciechowski.\t\n|File:The grave of Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski in Pow\u0105zki cemetery (16361310923).jpg|The grave of Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski, his wife and son in Pow\u0105zki cemetery.\t\n|File:Wojciechowski.png|Official Presidential Portrait of Wojciechowski\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Presidents of Poland]]\n* [[Polish Socialist Party]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* ''Polish President: a Co-operator'' The Co-operative League of USACo-operation IX 1923: 67. <!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any -->\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090516003950/http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=469 ''Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski.''

In 1922 he was elected the second [[President of the Republic of Poland]] following the assassination of [[Gabriel Narutowicz]]. He was ousted by the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup d'\u00c9tat]] of 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/646442/Stanislaw-Wojciechowski|title=Stanislaw Wojciechowski (president of Poland)|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nWhile a student at the [[University of Warsaw]], Wojciechowski worked for the Polish Socialist movement, which at the time was a major force in the Polish independence effort. He was arrested by czarist police in 1891, and again in 1892. Upon his release he moved to [[Zurich]], then to [[Paris]] and finally to [[London]]. In England he helped publish the Polish Socialist periodical ''Przed\u015bwit'' (\u201cThe Dawn\u201d). Active in the socialist movement, he often travelled undercover to Russian Poland, and became friends with [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]]. He also studied the cooperative movement, and on returning to Poland legally in 1906 he spent time working to develop Polish cooperatives. During [[World War I]] he considered [[Imperial Germany]] to be Poland\u2019s main enemy. With the Russian evacuation in 1915, he moved to [[Moscow]], and there in 1917 was elected president of the Council of Polish Parties\u2019 Union. He returned to [[Warsaw]] after the [[October Revolution]] and from January 1919 to July 1920 served as minister of the interior in two separate cabinets of the new [[Second Polish Republic]]. When the Republic's president [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was assassinated in December 1922, Wojciechowski was chosen to succeed him.\n\nDuring his presidency, Wojciechowski and his erstwhile friend military [[Polish General Staff|chief of staff]] Pi\u0142sudski disagreed on the political direction of the nation: Wojciechowski supported continued parliamentary government, while [[Pi\u0142sudski]] favoured a more [[authoritarian]] approach. In May 1926, due to the worsening economic issues of the country, Pi\u0142sudski staged the successful [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]], after which Wojciechowski resigned from his post.<ref>Zygmunt Kaczmarek, ''Trzej prezydenci II Rzeczypospolitej'' (Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy Zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w Zawodowych, 1988), p. 167</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski was born on 15 March 1869 in [[Kalisz]] into a Polish noble family with strong ties to the [[intelligentsia]]. He was one of seven children of [[Second Lieutenant]] Feliks Wojciechowski (1825-1881), a caretaker of a prison in Kalisz who participated during the [[January Uprising]], and his wife Florentyna Vorhoff. He was raised in a spirit of patriotism and devotion to his homeland. In 1888, he graduated in the [[Kalisz|Men's Classical Junior High School in Kalisz]] and began his studies at the [[University of Warsaw|Imperial University of Warsaw]] where he studied at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics until 1891. He belonged to the circle of the most active conspirators, participant of the secret student groups for self-improvement. Wojciechowski was active during his studies, first in the conspiratorial organization [[Association of the Polish Youth \"Zet\"]], and later in the burgeoning socialist movement. By 1892, he had abandoned his studies and chose the life of an exile after his second arrest and detention by the czarist police, first going to [[Zurich]] and then [[Paris]]. There he learned the trade of typesetter with which he supported himself. \n\nIn 1892, Wojciechowski co-founded the [[Polish Socialist Party]] and many nationalist and socialists met in Paris where they participated in the following year, on the first, illegally organized party conference in [[Vilnius]], where he met [[Pi\u0142sudski]]. In 1893, after he was deported from France. He found his new centre of life in London, where he worked as a typesetter, printer, journalist and publisher. He travelled several more times illegally to [[Congress Poland]] and the [[Russian Empire]] and smuggled printing machine components and publications into the country. Together with Pi\u0142sudski, he formed the backbone of the socialist movement in Russian Poland. In 1899, he married [[Maria Wojciechowska]], a daughter of a wealthy landowner of [[szlachta]] descent.<ref>Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski, \"Moje wspomnienia\" (Warszawa\u2013Lw\u00f3w: Ksi\u0105\u017cnica-Atlas, 1938), pp. 53\u201355, 130</ref>\n\n=== Political movements and career ===\nAfter 1905, he left the Polish Socialist Party over disagreements on the political future of Poland and its relations to the international class struggle. After the amnesty in 1906, he returned to Warsaw and took part in the cooperative movement by [[Edward Abramowski]]. During World War I, Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski believed that Germany posed the biggest threat to Poland and thus decided to stay in Russia rather than side with his erstwhile friend Pi\u0142sudski. After the Russian evacuation of Congress Poland of 1915, he moved to Moscow where he remained active in Polish political circles. After the fall of the Tsarist regime was elected President of the Council of Polish Parties\u2019 Union, and heavily engaged on behalf of the  [[Polish Army]] in Russia in 1918. He was forced to leave Moscow under threat of arrest once the Bolshevik regime seized power. On 15 January 1919, the Chief of State nominated him, Minister of Internal Affairs, in both the Cabinet of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] and [[Leopold Skulski]], whom Wojciechowski replaced during his numerous absences from the country. During this time, Wojciechowski also participated in the drafting of the Polish constitution.<ref>Zygmunt Kaczmarek, ''Trzej prezydenci II Rzeczypospolitej'' (Warszawa: Instytut Wydawniczy Zwi\u0105zk\u00f3w Zawodowych, 1988), pp. 114\u2013119</ref>\n\n== Presidency ==\n\n===1922 Presidential elections===\n{{main|1922 Polish presidential elections}}\n\n====First election====\n\nIn the [[1922 Polish legislative election|legislative elections]], Wojciechowski served as the candidate for the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] though he failed to win a seat. After the legislative elections, a balance appeared between the left and right forces. This situation also preponderated in the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]], which was to select a new [[President of Poland]] and produce a new [[1922 Polish presidential elections|presidential election]]. Pi\u0142sudski did not want to put up his candidacy, and [[Wincenty Witos]] was perceived as a person communicating with the right and not paying attention to the interests of rural villages. Therefore, the [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] put forward and appointed Wojciechowski as the new candidate for the presidency not involved in current political games. He accepted this decision, but when the [[Polish People's Party \"Wyzwolenie\"]] informed that [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] planned to withdraw from the [[1922 Polish presidential elections|presidential race]]. Witos persuaded Narutowicz not to do that.\n\nWojciechowski was defeated in the fourth ballot to the landowner [[Count]] [[Maurycy Zamoyski]] who received 228 votes and Wojciechowski only reached 152 votes. Ate the time of the elections, the main candidates were Zamoyski and Wojciechowski. Narutowicz's good result was a surprise. Once the long voting was over, Zamoyski and Narutowicz advanced to the fifth ballot. Narutowicz finally won the election with the support of \"Piast\" (Wojciechowski was eliminated on the fourth round). Narutowicz prevailed thanks to the votes of the left, of the representatives for national minorities vote (these representatives were determined to defeat the [[National Democracy]] movement), and of the centrist Polish People\u2019s Party \u201cPiast\u201d. This last group, initially inclined toward Zamoyski, unexpectedly switched its backing to Narutowicz instead. Eventually, Narutowicz won 289 votes, whereas Zamoyski won only 227 votes, and so Narutowicz was elected the first President of the Second Polish Republic.\n\n====Second election====\n\nFollowing the [[Assassination of Gabriel Narutowicz|assassination of President Narutowicz]] by the ultra-nationalist painter [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]] on 16 December 1922, [[Marshal of the Sejm]] [[Maciej Rataj]], who served briefly as acting head of state after the assassination, set the date of a new presidential election on 20 December 1922. The right-wings put forward the candidacy of Professor [[Kazimierz Morawski]]. Wojciechowski was nominated again as a compromise candidate and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski. Originally, Witos recommended his own party vote for Morawski. The left-wing opposed this and decided to vote for Wojciechowski, however, in connection with the events that led to the murder of Narutowicz. As a result of the internal party discussion, it was decided to support Wojciechowski's candidacy. In the first round, Wojciechowski secured 298 votes, with Morawski only gaining 221 votes, Wojciechowski won the election and became the second President of Poland. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://memim.com/stanislaw-wojciechowski.html|title=Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski|website=memim.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the election, representatives of the National Assembly appeared in Wojciechowski's residence to notify him about his election as President. He considered that the will of the [[Sejm]] and the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] should be followed. Alfons Erdman appeared at Wojciechowski's office and demanded him to abstain from accepting his choice. It was nevertheless too late, Wojciechowski decided that delay in this matter was improper. On 20 December 1922, Wojciechowski took the presidential oath and became [[President (government title)|President]].\n\n===Tenure===\n\n[[File:Benes i Wojciechowski.jpg|thumb|left|Wojciechowski with the Czechoslovakian President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], 1925]]\n[[File:Wojciechowski i Zaruski.jpg|thumb|left|Wojciechowski with Genera\u0142 [[Mariusz Zaruski]] near the [[Saxon Palace]] in Warsaw, 1926]]\nDuring his presidency, Wojciechowski attempted to be an enthusiastic politician, who was involved in the performance of the government. He actively supported the non-parliamentary ministry of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]]. The height of the president's political influence corresponded with Grabski's cabinet period of activity. Wojciechowski participated in the Political Committee of the Council of Ministers and had an impact on the content of ordinances on the [[Polish Z\u0142oty|currency reform]], created under special powers of attorney granted to the cabinet by the [[Sejm]]. Wojciechowski attempted to shape the [[Constitution of Poland|Polish constitutional system]] by introducing a [[constructive vote of no confidence]]. The mission of forming a new government was entrusted to the leader of the largest group participating in the overthrow of the previous cabinet, and when Wojciechowski failed to select a cabinet, he advocated leaving the old cabinet or establishing a non-parliamentary cabinet. Wojciechowski used this method after the fall of the second cabinet of [[Wincenty Witos]] when he committed the purpose of setting a new ministry to [[Stanis\u0142aw Thugutt]]. Another indication of Wojciechowski's constitutional system was the adoption, opposite to the provisions of the constitution that the Sejm was assembling enduringly, and not in the session system. Wojciechowski never closed the session of the Sejm, which was dictated by the constitution.\n\nWojciechowski tried to maintain good relations with [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], who was in perpetual dispute with the succeeding cabinets and some parliamentary groups. The reason for the conflict was the organization of military authorities. Pi\u0142sudski always saw Wojciechowski as a person who would take his side. When in June 1923, [[Stanis\u0142aw Szeptycki]] addressed to the Sejm a bill on the highest military authorities, announcing the liquidation of the powerful military council, who Pi\u0142sudski served as the chairman, flared up a sharp dispute between him and the Marshal. Wojciechowski tried to settle this dispute. Accordingly, Pi\u0142sudski sent a letter to the president in which he addressed him with the words ''\"You have acted as a hangover in the matter of honour, which does not respect the rights of honour and forgets that honour belongs to people personally, not officially.\"'' Wojciechowski tried to negotiate between the opposing parties, including took into account the [[Maciej Rataj]]'s commentaries, who objected to committing the position of [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]] to [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski|Sikorski]]. Pi\u0142sudski did not want to compromise and treated Wojciechowski, as what Rataj regarded, defiantly and as a servant. \n\nOn 5 September 1924, Wojciechowski visited the Polish city of [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). At the end of Kopernika and Legion\u00f3w Street, an explosive charge was thrown towards the car where the president was travelling. Fortuitously, the bomb did not explode and the assassin was arrested. The suspect of the assassination was Teofil Olszewski from the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]], who tried to illegally cross the [[Germany\u2013Poland border|German border]] near [[Bytom]] and was arrested by the [[Germans]] when on 3 October 1924. Olszewski was convicted of crossing the border illegally for two weeks in prison, suspended for one year, and then granted political refugee status in Germany and permission to settle in Marienburg ([[Malbork]]), close to the Polish border. It was believed that the assassin was Stanis\u0142aw Steiger, an employee of a commercial company and a student of [[Halakha|Jewish law]], was responsible. The man was arrested and imprisoned throughout the trial. He was threatened with the death penalty, but then the new circumstances of the assassination came to light. The first trial against Steiger took place on 15 and 16 September 1924 ere the District Court in Lviv. The prosecutor was Alfred Laniewski, and the defender was lawyer Micha\u0142 Grek. The Regional Court referred the case to ordinary proceedings with the participation of sworn judges. In the proceedings, Steiger was defended by lawyer Natan Loewenstein. The trial during which Loewenstein gave his defence speech did not take place until 16 December 1925. Steiger spent all this time in custody. Gratitude to the lawyer's speech, which Loewenstein published in Lviv a year later, the accused was cleared of the charges and acquitted.\n\nOn May 7, 1925, Wojciechowski travelled from [[Warsaw]] to [[Krak\u00f3w]] with the entire ceremonial held by the president. After receiving a report at the station from the commander of the honour company, Wojciechowski asked him if the soldiers were singing religious songs. After receiving a proof answer, Wojciechowski instructed the soldiers to sing some of them. They sang for about twenty minutes until the train left. Such behaviour of the president caused an understandable sensation in the country.\n\n===Fall from power===\n{{main|May Coup (Poland)}}\n\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski act of resignation 15.05. 1926.jpg|thumb|right|Wojciechowski's written resignation after his surrender in May Coup]]\nIn November 1925, the government of [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Grabski]] was replaced by the government of [[Aleksander Skrzy\u0144ski]], which had received support from the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] and the [[Polish Socialist Party]]. General [[Lucjan \u017beligowski]] became the new government's [[Minister of Military Affairs|minister of military affairs]].  However, after the PPS withdrew its support, this government also fell and was replaced by that of Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]], formed by [[Polish People's Party \"Piast\" (1913\u201331)|Polish People's Party \"Piast\"]] and [[Christian Union of National Unity]] ([[Chjeno-Piast]]). However, the new government had even less popular support than the previous ones, and pronouncements from [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], who viewed the constant power shifts in the [[Sejm]] as chaotic and damaging, set the stage for a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Apart from domestic turmoil, Polish politics had been shaken by a [[trade war]] with Germany, begun in June 1925, and by the signing of the [[Treaty of Locarno]] on October 16. Under the terms of the treaty, the World War I western European [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] powers and the new states of Central and Eastern Europe sought to secure a postwar territorial settlement in return for normalized relations with defeated Germany. On 10 May 1926, a coalition government of Christian Democrats and Agrarians was formed, and that same day J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, in an interview with Kurier Poranny (the Morning Courier), said that he was \"ready to fight the evil\" of sejmocracy and promised a \"sanation\" (restoration to health) of political life. The newspaper edition was confiscated by the authorities. \n\nThe night of 11 May to 12 May, a state of alert was declared in the Warsaw military garrison, and some units marched to Rembert\u00f3w, where they pledged their support to Pi\u0142sudski. On 12 May, they marched on Warsaw and captured bridges over the [[Wis\u0142a River]]. Meanwhile, Wincenty Witos' government declared a state of emergency. At about 17:00 hours, Marshal Pi\u0142sudski met Wojciechowski on the [[Poniatowski Bridge]]. [[Major]] [[Marian Porwit]] who commanded one of the troops loyal to the government), reported to the president, then reported to Pi\u0142sudski and witnessed the discussion between the two dignitaries. Pi\u0142sudski demanded the resignation of Witos' cabinet, while the President demanded Pi\u0142sudski's capitulation. After the failure of negotiations and the president's departure, Major Porwit refused Pi\u0142sudski to let him cross the bridge. On 14 May, at about 13:00 hours, Witos' cabinet decided to move from [[Belweder]] to [[Wilan\u00f3w]]. Wojciechowski allowed this decision an hour later. \nAfter transferring to [[Wilan\u00f3w]], Wojciechowski and Witos negotiated with the commanders of troops loyal to the cabinet. The military decided they should move to [[Pozna\u0144]] and maintain the armed struggle from beyond. Eventually, to prevent the Warsaw fighting from turning into a country-wide civil war, both Wojciechowski and Witos decided to resign and issued an order to their troops to cease fratricidal fighting. A new government was formed under Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Bartel]], with Pi\u0142sudski as the new [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. On 31 May 1926, the [[Zgromadzenie Narodowe|National Assembly]] nominated Pi\u0142sudski to be president, but he declined. Eventually [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] became the new president; Pi\u0142sudski, however, wielded much greater '' de facto'' power than his military ministry nominally gave him.\n\n== Later life ==\n\n===Scientific career===\n\nFollowing the resignation, Wojciechowski worked as a lecturer at the [[Warsaw School of Economics]] and the College of Agriculture in Warsaw. Wojciechowski served as the Director of the Cooperative Scientific Institute and later sat on the Scientific Council of the Institute. He published hermetic publications on cooperative activity, which he engaged in before he became an active politician. He wrote books such as the Organization of Agricultural Products Sales and the History of Polish Cooperatives until 1914. In 1937, he was the co-founder of the opposition [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]].\n\n===Second World War===\n\nOn 10 November 1939, the [[Gestapo]] arrested Wojciehowski's son, Edmund as part of [[German AB-Aktion in Poland]], he was threatened with execution, as were other representatives of the Polish [[intelligentsia]] caught on the streets. He was later released on 4 April 1940 because of [[Jerzy Antoni Potocki]], a former adjacent of [[Jozef Pi\u0142sudski]]. He later arrested on 12 July 1940 again because he was one of the 70 Warsaw lawyers who did not agree to remove Jewish associates from the [[Lawyers in Poland|Bar Council]]. The Germans offered his release in exchange for Wojciechowski signing a declaration stating that the [[Polish government-in-exile]] was constitutionally illegal. Wojciechowski refused to sign the declaration and Edmund was transferred on 15 August 1940 to the [[Auschwitz]] as one of the 1666 people of the first transport from [[Warsaw]], where he soon died of [[typhus]] on 23 February 1941. The family received a telegram sent from the concentration camp informing Wojciechowski about his son's passing, and soon an urn of ashes containing the remains of Edmund was sent back to his parents. During the [[Warsaw Uprising]], the ill Wojciechowski along with his wife Maria was rounded up by the [[Nazis]] and sent to the [[Destruction of Warsaw|Durchgangslager 121]], a transit camp in [[Pruszk\u00f3w]].\n\n===Death and Legacy===\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski retired to private life. He died in Go\u0142\u0105bki (now [[Ursus, Warsaw|Ursus]]) in 1953, at the age of 84. He was buried in Pow\u0105zki in Warsaw. Until the end of his life, he was convinced that everything that was bad in the history of Poland began during the May revolution.\n\nStanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski experienced a political life, not unlike that of many Central European politicians during the early 20th century. A radical in his youth, his ideology matured and grew more conservative with age. He was at the forefront of over a quarter-century of Polish political development and is considered one of the founders of the modern independent Polish state. Historians in their opinion unanimously indicate that Wojciechowski remains a figure greatly underrated, they believe it should be remembered that his presidency fell on a particularly turbulent period in [[Polish history]]. He managed to make history as an outstanding politician and statesman and will remain in history as a relentless defender of democratic values and a prominent patriot.\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{gallery\t\n|width=180px |height=180px\t\n|File:Hans de Segesser-Brunegg after giving letters of credence to Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski (1924).jpg|The presentation of credentials to the President of the Republic of Poland, Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski by the Envoy of Switzerland to Poland Hans de Segeseer-Brunegg, 1924. \t\n|File:Wizyta prezydenta Stanis\u0142awa Wojciechowskiego w Gnie\u017anie z okazji Wystawy Rolniczo-Przemys\u0142owo-Handlowej, wrzesie\u0144 1925 r..jpg|President Wojciechowski in [[Gniezno]] to tour the Exhibitions of Agriculture and Commerce, 1925.\t\t\n|File:Zapiski Wojciechowskiego (HistoriaPolski str.187).jpg|President Wojciechowski's handwritten description of his meeting with Pi\u0142sudski on the [[Poniatowski Bridge]] during the May Coup in 1926.\t\n|File:President Stanislaw Wojciechowski in Pruszkow Transit Camp.jpg|Wojciechowski with his wife Maria Kiersnowska (right) in Durchgangslager 121 in Pruszk\u00f3w, after being expelled from Warsaw at the end of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] (October 1944).\t\n|File:Wojciechowski.jpg|A modern caricature of President Wojciechowski.\t\n|File:The grave of Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski in Pow\u0105zki cemetery (16361310923).jpg|The grave of Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski, his wife and son in Pow\u0105zki cemetery.\t\n|File:Wojciechowski.png|Official Presidential Portrait of Wojciechowski\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Presidents of Poland]]\n* [[Polish Socialist Party]]\n\n==References==\n\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* ''Polish President: a Co-operator'' The Co-operative League of USACo-operation IX 1923: 67. <!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any -->\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090516003950/http://www.president.pl/x.node?id=469 ''Stanis\u0142aw Wojciechowski.''
