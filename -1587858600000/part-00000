She published several volumes of poetry, and performed her work at festivals and on [[BBC Radio]].\n\nIn the last 10 years of her life, Landesman performed more frequently, often in evenings in which she would recite her poetry, sing her songs, and occasionally talk about her life and work. In 2003 she appeared in New York at [[Joe's Pub]] with [[Jackie Cain]] and [[Bob Dorough]]. In October 2008 she returned to St Louis to do a one-woman show at the [[Gaslight Theatre]].\n\nThroughout 2010 and 2011, Landesman made bi-monthly appearances at [[RADA]] for Farrago poetry, and every six months hosted a lunchtime concert at The [[606 Club]] in London. In May 2010 the [[South Bank Centre]] presented ''A Night Out with Fran Landesman'' at the [[Purcell Room]], and in April 2011 the [[Leicester Square Theatre]] presented ''An Evening with Fran Landesman'' as part of the ''Art of Song Festival''. Her last appearance was at RADA on July 21, 2011, two days before her death at the age of 83.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8663810/Fran-Landesman.html Obituary: Fran Landesman], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', July 26, 2011.

Boston and New York, Houghton Mifflin Company. p. 105.</ref> He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use [[flanking maneuver]]s and [[feint]]s. A student of [[Socrates]], Xenophon is known for his writings and recording the history of his time (late-5th and early-4th centuries BC), in such works as  ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' and ''[[Hellenica]]'', which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC), thus representing a thematic continuation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.\n\nAs one of the Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries), Xenophon participated in [[Cyrus the Younger]]'s failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]]. He recounted the events in ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', his most notable history. Like [[Plato]], Xenophon is an authority on Socrates, about whom he wrote several books of dialogues (the ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'') and an ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', which recounts [[Trial of Socrates|the philosopher's trial in 399 BC]].\n\nXenophon's works span several genres and are written in plain-language [[Attic Greek]], for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the [[Ancient Greek]] language. In the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] observed that, as a writer, Xenophon of Athens was known as the \u201cAttic Muse\u201d, for the sweetness of his diction (2.6{{clarify|date=November 2019}}).\n\n==Life==\n===Early years===\nXenophon was born around 431 BC, near the city of Athens, to Gryllus, of the [[deme]] [[Erchia]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]]. His father was a member of a wealthy equestrian family.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650658/Xenophon |title=Xenophon |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> The history of his youth is little attested before 401 BC, when he was convinced by his Boeotian friend Proxenus (''Anabasis'' 3.1.9) to participate in the military expedition led by Cyrus the Younger against his elder brother, King Artaxerxes II of Persia.\n\n===''Anabasis''===\n{{main|Anabasis (Xenophon)}}\n[[File:Expedition of the Ten Thousand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Route of [[Xenophon]] and the Ten Thousand (red line) in the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The satrapy of [[Cyrus the Younger]] is delineated in green.]]\n\n====Expedition with Cyrus the Younger====\nWritten years after these events, Xenophon's book ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (Greek: \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, literally \"going up\")<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29na%2Fbasis \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> is his record of the entire expedition of Cyrus against the Persians and the Greek mercenaries\u2019 journey home. Xenophon writes that he had asked the veteran Socrates for advice on whether to go with Cyrus, and that Socrates referred him to the divinely inspired [[Pythia]]. Xenophon's query to the oracle, however, was not whether or not to accept Cyrus' invitation, but \"to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune\". The oracle answered his question and told him to which gods to pray and sacrifice. When Xenophon returned to Athens and told Socrates of the oracle's advice, Socrates chastised him for asking so disingenuous a question (''Anabasis'' 3.1.5\u20137).\n\nUnder the pretext of fighting [[Tissaphernes]], the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Ionia]], Cyrus assembled a massive army composed of native Persian soldiers, but also a large number of Greeks. Prior to waging war against Artaxerxes, Cyrus proposed that the enemy was the [[Pisidia]]ns, and so the Greeks were unaware that they were to battle against the larger army of King Artaxerxes II (''Anabasis'' 1.1.8\u201311). At [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] the soldiers became aware of Cyrus's plans to depose the king, and as a result, refused to continue (''Anabasis'' 1.3.1). However, [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]], a Spartan general, convinced the Greeks to continue with the expedition. The army of Cyrus met the army of Artaxerxes II in the [[Battle of Cunaxa]]. Despite effective fighting by the Greeks, Cyrus was killed in the battle (''Anabasis'' 1.8.27\u20131.9.1). Shortly thereafter, Clearchus was invited to a peace conference, where, alongside four other generals and many captains, he was betrayed and executed (''Anabasis'' 2.5.31\u201332).\n\n====Return====\n[[File:Xenophon and the ten thousand hail the sea.jpg|thumb|Xenophon leading his Ten Thousand through Persia to the Black Sea. 19th century illustration.]]\nThe [[mercenary|mercenaries]], known as the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]], found themselves without leadership far from the sea, deep in hostile territory near the heart of [[Mesopotamia]], with a hostile population and armies to deal with. They elected new leaders, including Xenophon himself.\n\nDodge says of Xenophon's generalship, \"Xenophon is the father of the system of retreat, the originator of all that appertains to the science of rear-guard fighting. He reduced its management to a perfect method. More originality in tactics has come from the Anabasis than from any dozen other books. Every system of war looks to this as to the fountain-head when it comes to rearward movements, as it looks to Alexander for a pattern of resistless and intelligent advance. Necessity to Xenophon was truly the mother of invention, but the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior. No general ever possessed a grander moral ascendant over his men. None ever worked for the safety of his soldiers with greater ardor or to better effect.\"<ref>Dodge, pp. 105-106</ref>  \n \nXenophon and his men initially had to deal with volleys by a minor force of harassing Persian missile cavalry. Every day, these cavalry, finding no opposition from the Ten Thousand, moved cautiously closer and closer. One night, Xenophon formed a body of archers and light cavalry. When the Persian cavalry arrived the next day, now firing within several yards, Xenophon suddenly unleashed his new cavalry in a shock charge, smashing into the stunned and confused enemy, killing many and routing the rest.<ref>Witt, p. 123</ref>  Tissaphernes pursued Xenophon with a vast force, and when the Greeks reached the wide and deep [[Great Zab]] River, it seemed they were surrounded. However, Xenophon quickly devised a plan: all goats, cows, sheep and donkeys were slaughtered and their bodies stuffed with hay, laid across the river and sewn up and covered with dirt so as not to be slippery. This created a bridge across which Xenophon led his men before the Persians could get to them. That Xenophon was able to acquire the means of feeding his force in the heart of a vast empire with a hostile population was astonishing. Dodge notes, \"On this retreat also was first shown the necessary, if cruel, means of arresting a pursuing enemy by the systematic devastation of the country traversed and the destruction of its villages to deprive him of food and shelter. And Xenophon is moreover the first who established in rear of the phalanx a reserve from which he could at will feed weak parts of his line. This was a superb first conception.\"<ref>Dodge, p. 107</ref>\n\n[[File:Xenophon Anabasis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Xenophon's ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brownson |first1=Carlson L. (Carleton Lewis) |title=Xenophon; |date=1886 |publisher=Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press |url=https://archive.org/details/xenophon03xeno/page/n5}}</ref>]]\nThe Ten Thousand eventually made their way into the land of the Carduchians, a wild tribe inhabiting the mountains of modern southeastern Turkey. The Carduchians were \"a fierce, war-loving race, who had never been conquered. Once the Great King had sent into their country an army of 120,000 men, to subdue them, but of all that great host not one had ever seen his home again.\"<ref>Witt, p. 136</ref> The Ten Thousand made their way in and were fired at by stones and arrows for several days before they reached a defile where the main Carduchian host sat. In  the Battle of the Carduchian Defile, Xenophon had 8,000 men feint at this host and marched the other 2,000 to a pass revealed by a prisoner under the cover of a rainstorm, and \"having made their way to the rear of the main pass, at daylight, under cover of the morning mist, they boldly pushed in upon the astonished Carducians. The blare of their many trumpets gave notice of their successful detour to Xenophon, as well as added to the confusion of the enemy. The main army at once joined in the attack from the valley side, and the Carducians were driven from their stronghold.\"<ref>Dodge, p. 109</ref> After heavy mountain fighting in which Xenophon showed the calm and patience needed for the situation, the Greeks made their way to the northern foothills of the mountains at the Centrites River, only to find a major Persian force blocking the route north. With the Carduchians surging toward the Greek rear, Xenophon again faced the threat of total destruction in battle. Xenophon's scouts quickly found another ford, but the Persians moved and blocked this as well. Xenophon sent a small force back toward the other ford, causing the anxious Persians to detach a major part of their force parallel. Xenophon stormed and completely overwhelmed the force at his ford, while the Greek detachment made a forced march to this bridgehead. This was among the first attacks in depth ever made, 23 years after [[Battle of Delium|Delium]] and 30 years before [[Epaminondas|Epaminondas\u2019]] more famous use of it at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]].\n\n[[File:Xenophon bust.jpg|thumb|Xenophon, [[Aphrodisias]] Museum.]]\nWinter by now arrived as the Greeks marched through Armenia \"absolutely unprovided with clothing suitable for such weather\",<ref>Witt, p. 166</ref>  inflicting more casualties than they suffered during a skillful ambush of a local satrap's force and the flanking of another force in this period. At a period when the Greeks were in desperate need of food, they decided upon attacking a wooden castle known to have had storage. The castle, however, was stationed on a hill surrounded by forest. Xenophon ordered small parties of his men to appear on the hill road, and when the defenders fired, one soldier would leap into the trees, and he \"did this so often that at last there was quite a heap of stones lying in front of him, but he himself was untouched.\" Then, \"the other men followed his example, and made it a sort of game, enjoying the sensation, pleasant alike to old and young, of courting danger for a moment, and then quickly escaping it. When the stones were almost exhausted, the soldiers raced one another over the exposed part of the road\", storming the fortress, which, with most of the garrison now neutralized, barely put up a fight.<ref>Witt, pp. 175-176</ref>\n\nSoon after, Xenophon's men reached [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] (''Anabasis'' 4.8.22). Before their departure, the Greeks made an alliance with the locals and fought one last battle against the [[Colchis|Colchians]], vassals of the Persians, in mountainous country. Xenophon ordered his men to deploy the line extremely thin so as to overlap the enemy, keeping a strong reserve. The Colchians, seeing they were being outflanked, divided their army to check the Greek deployment, opening a gap in their line through which Xenophon rushed in his reserves, scoring a brilliant Greek victory.<ref>Witt, pp. 181-184</ref>\n\nThey then made their way westward back to [[Greece]] via [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (''Anabasis'' 6.3.16). Once there, they helped [[Seuthes II]] make himself king of [[Thrace]], before being recruited into the army of the Spartan general [[Thimbron (fl. 400\u2013391 BC)|Thibron]]. The Spartans were at war with Tissaphernes and [[Pharnabazus II]], Persian [[satrap]]s in [[Anatolia]], probably on account of the aforementioned treacherous slaughter of their general Clearchus. Xenophon\u2019s military activity with these Spartans marks the final episodes of the ''Anabasis'' (Books 6\u20137).\n\nFilled with a plethora of originality and tactical genius, Xenophon's conduct of the retreat caused Dodge to name the Athenian knight the greatest general that preceded Alexander the Great.<ref>Dodge, Theodore Ayrault. Great Captains: A Course of Six Lectures on the Art of War. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York: 1890. p. 7</ref>\n\n==Xenophon's politics==\nXenophon has long been associated with the opposition of democracy.<ref>Gray, ''Xenophon'', page 19 (preface): \"Xenophon has been called undemocratic in more contexts than can be mentioned.\" {{ISBN|9780199216185}}</ref> Although Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy, or at least the aristocracy, especially in light of his associations with Sparta, none of his works explicitly attack democracy, unless his account of democratic proceedings in the Anabasis be interpreted as anti-democracy when deliberations are intimidated by cries of \"pelt\" if a speaker says something others disagree with. Some scholars<ref>Farrell, Christopher A. 2012. \"Laconism and Democracy: Re-reading the Lakedaimoni\u014dn Politeia and Re-thinking Xenophon\" in Joanne Paul ed., ''Governing Diversities'', pp. 10\u201335, Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.</ref> go so far as to say his views aligned with those of the democracy in his time. However, certain works of Xenophon, in particular the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', seem to show his oligarchic politics. This historical-fiction serves as a forum for Xenophon to subtly display his political inclinations.\n\n===''Cyropaedia''===\n====Relations between Medes and Persians in the ''Cyropaedia''====\n[[File:Xenophon Cyropaedia.jpg|thumb|upright|Xenophon's ''[[Cyropaedia]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ashley Cooper |first1=Maurice |title=Cyrop\u00e6dia; or, The institution of Cyrus, .. |date=1803 |publisher=London.

Swan for Vernor and Hood [etc.] |url=https://archive.org/details/cyropdiaorinstit00xeno/page/n3}}</ref>]]\nXenophon wrote the ''Cyropaedia'' to outline his political and moral philosophy. He did this by endowing a fictional version of the boyhood of [[Cyrus the Great]],  founder of the first [[Persian Empire]], with the qualities of what Xenophon considered the ideal ruler. Historians have asked whether Xenophon's portrait of Cyrus was accurate or if Xenophon imbued Cyrus with events from Xenophon's own life. The consensus is that Cyrus\u2019s career is best outlined in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]. But Steven Hirsch writes, \"Yet there are occasions when it can be confirmed from Oriental evidence that Xenophon is correct where Herodotus is wrong or lacks information. A case in point involves the ancestry of Cyrus.\"<ref>Steven W. Hirsch, \"1001 Iranian Nights: History and Fiction in Xenophon\u2019s ''Cyropaedia''\", in ''The Greek Historians: Literature and History: Papers Presented to A. E. Raubitschek''. Saratoga CA: ANMA Libr, 1985, p. 80.</ref> Herodotus contradicts Xenophon at several other points, most notably in the matter of Cyrus\u2019s relationship with the Median Kingdom. Herodotus says that Cyrus led a rebellion against his maternal grandfather, [[Astyages]] king of Media, and defeated him, thereafter (improbably) keeping Astyages in his court for the remainder of his life (''Histories'' 1.130). The Medes were thus \"reduced to subjection\" (1.130) and became \"slaves\" (1.129) to the Persians 20 years before the capture of Babylon in 539 BC.\n\nThe ''Cyropaedia'' relates instead that Astyages died and was succeeded by his son Cyaxares II, the maternal uncle of Cyrus (1.5.2). In the initial campaign against the Lydians, Babylonians and their allies, the Medians were led by Cyaxares and the Persians by Cyrus, who was crown prince of the Persians, since his father was still alive (4.5.17).  Xenophon relates that at this time the Medes were the strongest of the kingdoms that opposed the Babylonians (1.5.2). There is an echo of this statement, verifying Xenophon and contradicting Herodotus, in the Harran Stele, a document from the court of [[Nabonidus]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Pritchard |editor-first=James B. |title=Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament |publisher=Princeton Univ. Press |edition=3rd |date=1969 |location=Princeton |pages=562\u201363 }}</ref> In the entry for year 14 or 15 of his reign (542-540 BC), Nabonidus speaks of his enemies as the kings of Egypt, the Medes, and the Arabs. There is no mention of the Persians,\nalthough according to Herodotus and the current consensus the Medians had been made \"slaves\" of the Persians several years previously. It does not seem that Nabonidus would be completely misled about who his enemies were, or who was really in control over the Medes and Persians just one to three years before his kingdom fell to their armies.\n\nOther archaeological evidence supporting Xenophon\u2019s picture of a confederation of Medes and Persians, rather than a subjugation of the Medes by the Persians, comes from the bas-reliefs in the stairway at [[Persepolis]]. These show no distinction in official rank or status between the Persian and Median nobility. Although Olmstead followed the consensus view that Cyrus subjugated the Medes, he nevertheless wrote, \"Medes were honored equally with Persians; they were employed in high office and were chosen to lead Persian armies.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Olmsted |first=A. T. |title=History of the Persian Empire |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |date=1948 |page=37 }}</ref> A more extensive list of considerations related to the credibility of the ''Cyropaedia\u2019s'' picture of the relationship between the Medes and Persians is found on the ''[[Cyropaedia#Credibility of the Cyropaedia\u2019s account of Cyrus\u2019s rise to power|Cyropaedia]]'' page.\n\n[[File:Persepolis carvings.JPG|thumb|Bas-reliefs of Persian soldiers together with Median soldiers are prevalent in Persepolis. The ones with rounded caps are Median.]]\nBoth Herodotus (1.123,214) and Xenophon (1.5.1,2,4, 8.5.20) present Cyrus as about 40 years old when his forces captured Babylon. In the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]], there is mention of the death of the wife of the king (name not given) within a month after the capture of Babylon.<ref>Pritchard, ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p. 306b.</ref> It has been conjectured that this was Cyrus\u2019s first wife, which lends credibility to the ''Cyropaedia''\u2019s statement (8.5.19) that Cyaxares II gave his daughter in marriage to Cyrus soon (but not immediately) after the fall of the city, with the kingdom of Media as her dowry. When Cyaxares died about two years later the Median kingdom passed peaceably to Cyrus, so that this would be the true beginning of the Medo-Persian Empire under just one monarch.\n\n====Persians as centaurs====\nThe ''Cyropaedia'' as a whole lavishes a great deal of praise on the first Persian emperor, [[Cyrus the Great]], on account of his virtue and leadership quality, and it was through his greatness that the Persian Empire held together. Thus this book is normally read as a positive treatise about Cyrus. However, following the lead of [[Leo Strauss]], David Johnson suggests that there is a subtle but strong layer to the book in which Xenophon conveys criticism of not only the Persians but the Spartans and Athenians as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\">Johnson, D. M. 2005. \"Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon\u2019s \u2018Cyropaedia\u2019\", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177\u2013207.</ref>\n\nIn section 4.3 of the ''Cyropaedia'' Cyrus makes clear his desire to institute cavalry. He even goes so far to say that he desires that no Persian ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=kalokagaqos&la=greek#Perseus:text:1999.04.0058:entry=kaloka)gaqo/s-contents kalokagathos]'' (\"noble and good man\" literally, or simply \"noble\") ever be seen on foot but always on a horse, so much so that the Persians may actually seem to be [[centaur]]s (4.3.22\u201323). Centaurs were often thought of as creatures of ill repute,  which makes even Cyrus\u2019 own advisors wary of the label. His minister Chrysantas admires the centaurs for their dual nature, but also warns that the dual nature does not allow centaurs to fully enjoy or act as either one of their aspects in full (4.3.19\u201320).\n\nIn labelling Persians as centaurs through the mouth of Cyrus, Xenophon plays upon the popular post-Persian-war propagandistic paradigm of using mythological imagery to represent the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Greco-Persian conflict]]. Examples of this include the wedding of the [[Lapiths]], giantomachy, [[Trojan War]], and [[Amazonomachy]] on the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]]. Johnson reads even more deeply into the centaur label. He believes that the unstable dichotomy of man and horse found in a centaur is indicative of the unstable and unnatural alliance of Persian and Mede formulated by Cyrus.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> The Persian hardiness and austerity is combined with the luxuriousness of the Medes, two qualities that cannot coexist. He cites the regression of the Persians directly after the death of Cyrus as a result of this instability, a union made possible only through the impeccable character of Cyrus.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> In a further analysis of the centaur model, Cyrus is likened to a centaur such as [[Chiron]], a noble example from an ignoble race. Thus this entire paradigm seems to be a jab at the Persians and an indication of Xenophon\u2019s general distaste for the Persians.\n\n====Against empire/monarchy====\n[[File:Papiri frammentari con elleniche di senofonte, PSI X 1197, oxyrhynchos 90-150 dc ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Fragments of Xenophon's ''[[Hellenica]]'', Papyrus PSI 1197, [[Laurentian Library]], Florence.]]\nThe strength of Cyrus in holding the empire together is praiseworthy according to Xenophon. However, the empire began to decline upon the death of Cyrus. By this example Xenophon sought to show that empires lacked stability and could only be maintained by a person of remarkable prowess, such as Cyrus.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> Cyrus is idealized greatly in the narrative. Xenophon displays Cyrus as a lofty, temperate man. This is not to say that he was not a good ruler, but he is depicted as surreal and not subject to the foibles of other men. By showing that only someone who is almost beyond human could conduct such an enterprise as empire, Xenophon indirectly censures imperial design. Thus he also reflects on the state of his own reality in an even more indirect fashion, using the example of the Persians to decry the attempts at empire made by Athens and Sparta.<ref>Johnson, D. M. 2005. \"Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon\u2019s \u2018Cyropaedia\u2019\", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177\u2013207</ref> Although partially graced with hindsight, having written the ''Cyropaedia'' after the downfall of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, this work criticizes the Greek attempts at empire and \"monarchy\", dooming them to failure.\n\n====Against democracy====\nAnother passage that Johnson cites as criticism of monarchy and empire concerns the devaluation of the ''homot\u012bmoi''. The manner in which this occurs seems also to be a subtle jab at democracy. ''Homot\u012bmoi'' were highly and thoroughly educated and thus became the core of the soldiery as heavy infantry. As the name ''homot\u012bmoi'' (\"equal\", or \"same honours\" i.e. \"peers\") suggests, their small band (1000 when Cyrus fought the [[Assyria]]ns) shared equally in the spoils of war.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> However, in the face of overwhelming numbers in a campaign against the Assyrians, Cyrus armed the commoners with similar arms instead of their normal light ranged armament (''Cyropaedia'' 2.1.9). Argument ensued as to how the spoils would now be split, and Cyrus enforced a meritocracy. Many ''homot\u012bmoi'' found this unfair because their military training was no better than the commoners, only their education, and hand-to-hand combat was less a matter of skill than strength and bravery. As Johnson asserts, this passage decries imperial meritocracy and corruption, for the ''homot\u012bmoi'' now had to sychophantize to the emperor for positions and honours;<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> from this point they were referred to as ''ent\u012bmoi'', no longer of the \"same honours\" but having to be \"in\" to get the honour. On the other hand, the passage seems to be critical of democracy, or at least sympathetic to aristocrats within democracy, for the ''homot\u012bmoi'' (aristocracy/oligarchs) are devalued upon the empowerment of the commoners (''demos''). Although empire emerges in this case, this is also a sequence of events associated with democracy. Through his dual critique of empire and democracy, Xenophon subtly relates his support of oligarchy.\n\n===''Constitution of the Spartans''===\n{{main|Polity of the Lacedaemonians}}\nThe Spartans wrote nothing about themselves, or if they did it is lost. Therefore, what we know about them comes exclusively from outsiders like Xenophon. Xenophon\u2019s affinity for the Spartans is clear in the Constitution of the Spartans, as well as his penchant for oligarchy. The opening line reads:\n\n{{quote|It occurred to me one day that Sparta, though among the most thinly populated of states, was evidently the most powerful and most celebrated city in Greece; and I fell to wondering how this could have happened. But when I considered the institutions of the Spartans, I wondered no longer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xenophon, Constitution of the Lacedaimonians, chapter 1, section 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0210%3atext%3dConst.+Lac.|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>}}\n\nXenophon goes on to describe in detail the main aspects of [[Laconia]], handing to us the most comprehensive extant analysis of the institutions of Sparta.\n\n===Old Oligarch===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA short treatise on the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Pseudo-Xenophon)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' exists that was once thought to be by Xenophon, but which was probably written when Xenophon was about five years old. The author, often called in English the \"Old Oligarch\" or Pseudo-Xenophon, detests the democracy of Athens and the poorer classes, but he argues that the Periclean institutions are well designed for their deplorable purposes. Although the real Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy over democracy, none of his works so ardently decry democracy as does the Constitution of the Athenians. However, this treatise makes evident that anti-democratic sentiments were extant in Athens in the late 5th century BC and were only increased after its shortcomings were exploited and made apparent during the Peloponnesian War.\n\n==Socratic works and dialogues==\n[[File:Xenophon Agesilaus.jpg|thumb|upright|Xenophon's [[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]].]]\nXenophon\u2019s works includes a selection of Socratic dialogues; these writings are completely preserved. Except for the dialogues of [[Plato]], they are the only surviving representatives of the genre of [[Socratic dialogue]]. These works include Xenophon's ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology]], [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]], [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]],'' and ''[[Oeconomicus]]''. The ''Symposium'' outlines the character of [[Socrates]] as he and his companions discuss what attribute they take pride in. In ''Oeconomicus'', Socrates explains how to manage a household. Both the ''Apology'' and ''Memorabilia'' defend Socrates\u2019 character and teachings. The former is set during the trial of Socrates, essentially defending Socrates\u2019 loss and death, while the latter is a defence of Socrates, explaining his moral principles and that he was not a corrupter of the youth.\n\n===Relationship with Socrates===\nXenophon was a student of Socrates, and their personal relationship is evident through a conversation between the two in Xenophon\u2019s ''Anabasis''. In his ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', the Greek biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius reports how Xenophon met Socrates. \"They say that Socrates met [Xenophon] in a narrow lane, and put his stick across it and prevented him from passing by, asking him where all kinds of necessary things were sold. And when he had answered him, he asked him again where men were made good and virtuous. And as he did not know, he said, \u2018Follow me, then, and learn.\u2019 And from this time forth, Xenophon became a follower of Socrates.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Laertius |first=Diogenes |title=thegreatthinkers.org |url=http://thegreatthinkers.org/xenophon/introduction/ |website=Great Thinkers |accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Diogenes La\u00ebrtius also relates an incident \"when in the [[battle of Delium]] Xenophon had fallen from his horse\" and Socrates reputedly \"stepped in and saved his life.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Socrates}}</ref>\n\nXenophon's admiration for his teacher is clear in writings such as ''Symposium'', ''Apology'', and ''Memorabilia''.  Xenophon was away on his Persian campaign during the trial and death of Socrates. Nevertheless, much of Xenophon's Socratic writing, especially ''Apology'', concerns that very trial and the defence Socrates put forward.\n\n===Socrates: Xenophon vs. Plato===\n\nBoth Plato and Xenophon wrote an ''Apology'' concerning the death of Socrates. The two writers seem more concerned about answering questions that arose after the trial than about the actual charges. In particular, Xenophon and Plato are concerned with the failures of Socrates to defend himself. The Socrates that Xenophon portrayed was different from Plato\u2019s in multiple respects. Xenophon asserts that Socrates dealt with his prosecution in an exceedingly arrogant manner, or at least was perceived to have spoken arrogantly. Conversely, while not omitting it completely, Plato worked to temper that arrogance in his own ''Apology''. Xenophon framed Socrates\u2019 defense, which both men admit was not prepared at all, not as failure to effectively argue his side, but as striving for death even in the light of unconvincing charges. As Danzig interprets it, convincing the jury to condemn him even on unconvincing charges would be a rhetorical challenge worthy of the great persuader.<ref name=\"autogenerated281\">Danzig, Gabriel. 2003. \"Apologizing for Socrates: Plato and Xenophon on Socrates\u2019 Behavior in Court.\" Transactions of the American Philological Association. Vol. 133, No. 2, pp. 281\u2013321.</ref> Xenophon uses this interpretation as justification for Socrates\u2019 arrogant stance and conventional failure. By contrast, Plato does not go so far as to claim that Socrates actually desired death, but seems to argue that Socrates was attempting to demonstrate a higher moral standard and teach a lesson, although his defence failed by conventional standards. This places Socrates in a higher moral position than his prosecutors, a typical Platonic example of absolving \"Socrates from blame in every conceivable way.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated281\"/>\n\n===Historical reality===\nAlthough Xenophon claims to have been present at the ''Symposium'', this is impossible as he was only a young boy at the date which he proposes it occurred. And again, Xenophon was not present at the trial of Socrates, having been on campaign in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Thus he puts into the latter\u2019s mouth what he would have thought him to say. It seems that Xenophon wrote his ''Apology'' and  ''Memorabilia'' as defences of his former teacher, not to explain Socrates' relationship to the actual charges incurred.<ref name=\"autogenerated281\"/>\n\n===Modern reception===\nXenophon's standing as a political philosopher has been defended in recent times by [[Leo Strauss]], who devoted a considerable part of his philosophic analysis to the works of Xenophon, returning to the high judgment of Xenophon as a thinker expressed by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[John Milton]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Adams]].\n\nXenophon\u2019s lessons on leadership have been reconsidered for their modern-day value. Jennifer O\u2019Flannery holds that \"discussions of leadership and civic virtue should include the work of Xenophon ... on public education for public service.\"<ref name=\"administration41\">O\u2019Flannery, Jennifer. 2003. \"Xenophon\u2019s (The Education of Cyrus) and Ideal Leadership Lessons for Modern Public Administration.\" Public Administration Quarterly.

Boston and New York, Houghton Mifflin Company. p. 105.</ref> He established the precedent for many logistical operations and was among the first to use [[flanking maneuver]]s and [[feint]]s. A student of [[Socrates]], Xenophon is known for his writings and recording the history of his time (late-5th and early-4th centuries BC), in such works as  ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' and ''[[Hellenica]]'', which covered the final seven years and the aftermath of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431\u2013404 BC), thus representing a thematic continuation of [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.\n\nAs one of the Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries), Xenophon participated in [[Cyrus the Younger]]'s failed campaign to claim the Persian throne from his brother [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]]. He recounted the events in ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', his most notable history. Like [[Plato]], Xenophon is an authority on Socrates, about whom he wrote several books of dialogues (the ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'') and an ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', which recounts [[Trial of Socrates|the philosopher's trial in 399 BC]].\n\nDespite being born an Athenian citizen, Xenophon was also associated with [[Sparta]], the traditional enemy of Athens. His pro-[[oligarchy|oligarchic]] politics, military service under Spartan generals in the Persian campaign and elsewhere, and his friendship with [[Agesilaus II|King Agesilaus II]] endeared Xenophon to the Spartans. Some of his works have a pro\u2013Spartan bias, especially the royal biography ''[[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]]'' and the ''Constitution of the Spartans''.\n\nXenophon's works span several genres and are written in plain-language [[Attic Greek]], for which reason they serve as translation exercises for contemporary students of the [[Ancient Greek]] language. In the ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] observed that, as a writer, Xenophon of Athens was known as the \u201cAttic Muse\u201d, for the sweetness of his diction (2.6{{clarify|date=November 2019}}).\n\n==Life==\n===Early years===\nXenophon was born around 431 BC, near the city of Athens, to Gryllus, of the [[deme]] [[Erchia]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]]. His father was a member of a wealthy equestrian family.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/650658/Xenophon |title=Xenophon |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> The history of his youth is little attested before 401 BC, when he was convinced by his Boeotian friend Proxenus (''Anabasis'' 3.1.9) to participate in the military expedition led by Cyrus the Younger against his elder brother, King Artaxerxes II of Persia.\n\n===''Anabasis''===\n{{main|Anabasis (Xenophon)}}\n[[File:Expedition of the Ten Thousand.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Route of [[Xenophon]] and the Ten Thousand (red line) in the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The satrapy of [[Cyrus the Younger]] is delineated in green.]]\n\n====Expedition with Cyrus the Younger====\nWritten years after these events, Xenophon's book ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'' (Greek: \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, literally \"going up\")<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29na%2Fbasis \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> is his record of the entire expedition of Cyrus against the Persians and the Greek mercenaries\u2019 journey home. Xenophon writes that he had asked the veteran Socrates for advice on whether to go with Cyrus, and that Socrates referred him to the divinely inspired [[Pythia]]. Xenophon's query to the oracle, however, was not whether or not to accept Cyrus' invitation, but \"to which of the gods he must pray and do sacrifice, so that he might best accomplish his intended journey and return in safety, with good fortune\". The oracle answered his question and told him to which gods to pray and sacrifice. When Xenophon returned to Athens and told Socrates of the oracle's advice, Socrates chastised him for asking so disingenuous a question (''Anabasis'' 3.1.5\u20137).\n\nUnder the pretext of fighting [[Tissaphernes]], the Persian [[satrap]] of [[Ionia]], Cyrus assembled a massive army composed of native Persian soldiers, but also a large number of Greeks. Prior to waging war against Artaxerxes, Cyrus proposed that the enemy was the [[Pisidia]]ns, and so the Greeks were unaware that they were to battle against the larger army of King Artaxerxes II (''Anabasis'' 1.1.8\u201311). At [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] the soldiers became aware of Cyrus's plans to depose the king, and as a result, refused to continue (''Anabasis'' 1.3.1). However, [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]], a Spartan general, convinced the Greeks to continue with the expedition. The army of Cyrus met the army of Artaxerxes II in the [[Battle of Cunaxa]]. Despite effective fighting by the Greeks, Cyrus was killed in the battle (''Anabasis'' 1.8.27\u20131.9.1). Shortly thereafter, Clearchus was invited to a peace conference, where, alongside four other generals and many captains, he was betrayed and executed (''Anabasis'' 2.5.31\u201332).\n\n====Return====\n[[File:Xenophon and the ten thousand hail the sea.jpg|thumb|Xenophon leading his Ten Thousand through Persia to the Black Sea. 19th century illustration.]]\nThe [[mercenary|mercenaries]], known as the [[Ten Thousand (Greek mercenaries)|Ten Thousand]], found themselves without leadership far from the sea, deep in hostile territory near the heart of [[Mesopotamia]], with a hostile population and armies to deal with. They elected new leaders, including Xenophon himself.\n\nDodge says of Xenophon's generalship, \"Xenophon is the father of the system of retreat, the originator of all that appertains to the science of rear-guard fighting. He reduced its management to a perfect method. More originality in tactics has come from the Anabasis than from any dozen other books. Every system of war looks to this as to the fountain-head when it comes to rearward movements, as it looks to Alexander for a pattern of resistless and intelligent advance. Necessity to Xenophon was truly the mother of invention, but the centuries since have devised nothing to surpass the genius of this warrior. No general ever possessed a grander moral ascendant over his men. None ever worked for the safety of his soldiers with greater ardor or to better effect.\"<ref>Dodge, pp. 105-106</ref>  \n \nXenophon and his men initially had to deal with volleys by a minor force of harassing Persian missile cavalry. Every day, these cavalry, finding no opposition from the Ten Thousand, moved cautiously closer and closer. One night, Xenophon formed a body of archers and light cavalry. When the Persian cavalry arrived the next day, now firing within several yards, Xenophon suddenly unleashed his new cavalry in a shock charge, smashing into the stunned and confused enemy, killing many and routing the rest.<ref>Witt, p. 123</ref>  Tissaphernes pursued Xenophon with a vast force, and when the Greeks reached the wide and deep [[Great Zab]] River, it seemed they were surrounded. However, Xenophon quickly devised a plan: all goats, cows, sheep and donkeys were slaughtered and their bodies stuffed with hay, laid across the river and sewn up and covered with dirt so as not to be slippery. This created a bridge across which Xenophon led his men before the Persians could get to them. That Xenophon was able to acquire the means of feeding his force in the heart of a vast empire with a hostile population was astonishing. Dodge notes, \"On this retreat also was first shown the necessary, if cruel, means of arresting a pursuing enemy by the systematic devastation of the country traversed and the destruction of its villages to deprive him of food and shelter. And Xenophon is moreover the first who established in rear of the phalanx a reserve from which he could at will feed weak parts of his line. This was a superb first conception.\"<ref>Dodge, p. 107</ref>\n\n[[File:Xenophon Anabasis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Xenophon's ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brownson |first1=Carlson L.

The Carduchians were \"a fierce, war-loving race, who had never been conquered. Once the Great King had sent into their country an army of 120,000 men, to subdue them, but of all that great host not one had ever seen his home again.\"<ref>Witt, p. 136</ref> The Ten Thousand made their way in and were fired at by stones and arrows for several days before they reached a defile where the main Carduchian host sat. In  the Battle of the Carduchian Defile, Xenophon had 8,000 men feint at this host and marched the other 2,000 to a pass revealed by a prisoner under the cover of a rainstorm, and \"having made their way to the rear of the main pass, at daylight, under cover of the morning mist, they boldly pushed in upon the astonished Carducians. The blare of their many trumpets gave notice of their successful detour to Xenophon, as well as added to the confusion of the enemy. The main army at once joined in the attack from the valley side, and the Carducians were driven from their stronghold.\"<ref>Dodge, p. 109</ref> After heavy mountain fighting in which Xenophon showed the calm and patience needed for the situation, the Greeks made their way to the northern foothills of the mountains at the Centrites River, only to find a major Persian force blocking the route north. With the Carduchians surging toward the Greek rear, Xenophon again faced the threat of total destruction in battle. Xenophon's scouts quickly found another ford, but the Persians moved and blocked this as well. Xenophon sent a small force back toward the other ford, causing the anxious Persians to detach a major part of their force parallel. Xenophon stormed and completely overwhelmed the force at his ford, while the Greek detachment made a forced march to this bridgehead. This was among the first attacks in depth ever made, 23 years after [[Battle of Delium|Delium]] and 30 years before [[Epaminondas|Epaminondas\u2019]] more famous use of it at [[Battle of Leuctra|Leuctra]].\n\n[[File:Xenophon bust.jpg|thumb|Xenophon, [[Aphrodisias]] Museum.]]\nWinter by now arrived as the Greeks marched through Armenia \"absolutely unprovided with clothing suitable for such weather\",<ref>Witt, p. 166</ref>  inflicting more casualties than they suffered during a skillful ambush of a local satrap's force and the flanking of another force in this period. At a period when the Greeks were in desperate need of food, they decided upon attacking a wooden castle known to have had storage. The castle, however, was stationed on a hill surrounded by forest. Xenophon ordered small parties of his men to appear on the hill road, and when the defenders fired, one soldier would leap into the trees, and he \"did this so often that at last there was quite a heap of stones lying in front of him, but he himself was untouched.\" Then, \"the other men followed his example, and made it a sort of game, enjoying the sensation, pleasant alike to old and young, of courting danger for a moment, and then quickly escaping it. When the stones were almost exhausted, the soldiers raced one another over the exposed part of the road\", storming the fortress, which, with most of the garrison now neutralized, barely put up a fight.<ref>Witt, pp. 175-176</ref>\n\nSoon after, Xenophon's men reached [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] on the coast of the [[Black Sea]] (''Anabasis'' 4.8.22). Before their departure, the Greeks made an alliance with the locals and fought one last battle against the [[Colchis|Colchians]], vassals of the Persians, in mountainous country. Xenophon ordered his men to deploy the line extremely thin so as to overlap the enemy, keeping a strong reserve. The Colchians, seeing they were being outflanked, divided their army to check the Greek deployment, opening a gap in their line through which Xenophon rushed in his reserves, scoring a brilliant Greek victory.<ref>Witt, pp. 181-184</ref>\n\nThey then made their way westward back to [[Greece]] via [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar#Chrysopolis|Chrysopolis]] (''Anabasis'' 6.3.16). Once there, they helped [[Seuthes II]] make himself king of [[Thrace]], before being recruited into the army of the Spartan general [[Thimbron (fl. 400\u2013391 BC)|Thibron]]. The Spartans were at war with Tissaphernes and [[Pharnabazus II]], Persian [[satrap]]s in [[Anatolia]], probably on account of the aforementioned treacherous slaughter of their general Clearchus. Xenophon\u2019s military activity with these Spartans marks the final episodes of the ''Anabasis'' (Books 6\u20137).\n\nFilled with a plethora of originality and tactical genius, Xenophon's conduct of the retreat caused Dodge to name the Athenian knight the greatest general that preceded Alexander the Great.<ref>Dodge, Theodore Ayrault. Great Captains: A Course of Six Lectures on the Art of War. Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York: 1890. p. 7</ref>\n\n==Xenophon's politics==\nXenophon has long been associated with the opposition of democracy.<ref>Gray, ''Xenophon'', page 19 (preface): \"Xenophon has been called undemocratic in more contexts than can be mentioned.\" {{ISBN|9780199216185}}</ref> Although Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy, or at least the aristocracy, especially in light of his associations with Sparta, none of his works explicitly attack democracy, unless his account of democratic proceedings in the Anabasis be interpreted as anti-democracy when deliberations are intimidated by cries of \"pelt\" if a speaker says something others disagree with. Some scholars<ref>Farrell, Christopher A. 2012. \"Laconism and Democracy: Re-reading the Lakedaimoni\u014dn Politeia and Re-thinking Xenophon\" in Joanne Paul ed., ''Governing Diversities'', pp. 10\u201335, Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing.</ref> go so far as to say his views aligned with those of the democracy in his time. However, certain works of Xenophon, in particular the ''[[Cyropaedia]]'', seem to show his oligarchic politics. This historical-fiction serves as a forum for Xenophon to subtly display his political inclinations.\n\n===''Cyropaedia''===\n====Relations between Medes and Persians in the ''Cyropaedia''====\n[[File:Xenophon Cyropaedia.jpg|thumb|upright|Xenophon's ''[[Cyropaedia]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ashley Cooper |first1=Maurice |title=Cyrop\u00e6dia; or, The institution of Cyrus, .. |date=1803 |publisher=London. Printed by J. Swan for Vernor and Hood [etc.] |url=https://archive.org/details/cyropdiaorinstit00xeno/page/n3}}</ref>]]\nXenophon wrote the ''Cyropaedia'' to outline his political and moral philosophy. He did this by endowing a fictional version of the boyhood of [[Cyrus the Great]],  founder of the first [[Persian Empire]], with the qualities of what Xenophon considered the ideal ruler. Historians have asked whether Xenophon's portrait of Cyrus was accurate or if Xenophon imbued Cyrus with events from Xenophon's own life. The consensus is that Cyrus\u2019s career is best outlined in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]. But Steven Hirsch writes, \"Yet there are occasions when it can be confirmed from Oriental evidence that Xenophon is correct where Herodotus is wrong or lacks information. A case in point involves the ancestry of Cyrus.\"<ref>Steven W. Hirsch, \"1001 Iranian Nights: History and Fiction in Xenophon\u2019s ''Cyropaedia''\", in ''The Greek Historians: Literature and History: Papers Presented to A. E. Raubitschek''. Saratoga CA: ANMA Libr, 1985, p. 80.</ref> Herodotus contradicts Xenophon at several other points, most notably in the matter of Cyrus\u2019s relationship with the Median Kingdom. Herodotus says that Cyrus led a rebellion against his maternal grandfather, [[Astyages]] king of Media, and defeated him, thereafter (improbably) keeping Astyages in his court for the remainder of his life (''Histories'' 1.130). The Medes were thus \"reduced to subjection\" (1.130) and became \"slaves\" (1.129) to the Persians 20 years before the capture of Babylon in 539 BC.\n\nThe ''Cyropaedia'' relates instead that Astyages died and was succeeded by his son Cyaxares II, the maternal uncle of Cyrus (1.5.2). In the initial campaign against the Lydians, Babylonians and their allies, the Medians were led by Cyaxares and the Persians by Cyrus, who was crown prince of the Persians, since his father was still alive (4.5.17).  Xenophon relates that at this time the Medes were the strongest of the kingdoms that opposed the Babylonians (1.5.2). There is an echo of this statement, verifying Xenophon and contradicting Herodotus, in the Harran Stele, a document from the court of [[Nabonidus]].<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Pritchard |editor-first=James B. |title=Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament |publisher=Princeton Univ. Press |edition=3rd |date=1969 |location=Princeton |pages=562\u201363 }}</ref> In the entry for year 14 or 15 of his reign (542-540 BC), Nabonidus speaks of his enemies as the kings of Egypt, the Medes, and the Arabs. There is no mention of the Persians,\nalthough according to Herodotus and the current consensus the Medians had been made \"slaves\" of the Persians several years previously. It does not seem that Nabonidus would be completely misled about who his enemies were, or who was really in control over the Medes and Persians just one to three years before his kingdom fell to their armies.\n\nOther archaeological evidence supporting Xenophon\u2019s picture of a confederation of Medes and Persians, rather than a subjugation of the Medes by the Persians, comes from the bas-reliefs in the stairway at [[Persepolis]]. These show no distinction in official rank or status between the Persian and Median nobility. Although Olmstead followed the consensus view that Cyrus subjugated the Medes, he nevertheless wrote, \"Medes were honored equally with Persians; they were employed in high office and were chosen to lead Persian armies.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Olmsted |first=A.

The ones with rounded caps are Median.]]\nBoth Herodotus (1.123,214) and Xenophon (1.5.1,2,4, 8.5.20) present Cyrus as about 40 years old when his forces captured Babylon. In the [[Nabonidus Chronicle]], there is mention of the death of the wife of the king (name not given) within a month after the capture of Babylon.<ref>Pritchard, ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts'', p. 306b.</ref> It has been conjectured that this was Cyrus\u2019s first wife, which lends credibility to the ''Cyropaedia''\u2019s statement (8.5.19) that Cyaxares II gave his daughter in marriage to Cyrus soon (but not immediately) after the fall of the city, with the kingdom of Media as her dowry. When Cyaxares died about two years later the Median kingdom passed peaceably to Cyrus, so that this would be the true beginning of the Medo-Persian Empire under just one monarch.\n\n====Persians as centaurs====\nThe ''Cyropaedia'' as a whole lavishes a great deal of praise on the first Persian emperor, [[Cyrus the Great]], on account of his virtue and leadership quality, and it was through his greatness that the Persian Empire held together. Thus this book is normally read as a positive treatise about Cyrus. However, following the lead of [[Leo Strauss]], David Johnson suggests that there is a subtle but strong layer to the book in which Xenophon conveys criticism of not only the Persians but the Spartans and Athenians as well.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\">Johnson, D. M. 2005. \"Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon\u2019s \u2018Cyropaedia\u2019\", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177\u2013207.</ref>\n\nIn section 4.3 of the ''Cyropaedia'' Cyrus makes clear his desire to institute cavalry. He even goes so far to say that he desires that no Persian ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=kalokagaqos&la=greek#Perseus:text:1999.04.0058:entry=kaloka)gaqo/s-contents kalokagathos]'' (\"noble and good man\" literally, or simply \"noble\") ever be seen on foot but always on a horse, so much so that the Persians may actually seem to be [[centaur]]s (4.3.22\u201323). Centaurs were often thought of as creatures of ill repute,  which makes even Cyrus\u2019 own advisors wary of the label. His minister Chrysantas admires the centaurs for their dual nature, but also warns that the dual nature does not allow centaurs to fully enjoy or act as either one of their aspects in full (4.3.19\u201320).\n\nIn labelling Persians as centaurs through the mouth of Cyrus, Xenophon plays upon the popular post-Persian-war propagandistic paradigm of using mythological imagery to represent the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Greco-Persian conflict]]. Examples of this include the wedding of the [[Lapiths]], giantomachy, [[Trojan War]], and [[Amazonomachy]] on the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon frieze]]. Johnson reads even more deeply into the centaur label. He believes that the unstable dichotomy of man and horse found in a centaur is indicative of the unstable and unnatural alliance of Persian and Mede formulated by Cyrus.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> The Persian hardiness and austerity is combined with the luxuriousness of the Medes, two qualities that cannot coexist. He cites the regression of the Persians directly after the death of Cyrus as a result of this instability, a union made possible only through the impeccable character of Cyrus.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> In a further analysis of the centaur model, Cyrus is likened to a centaur such as [[Chiron]], a noble example from an ignoble race. Thus this entire paradigm seems to be a jab at the Persians and an indication of Xenophon\u2019s general distaste for the Persians.\n\n====Against empire/monarchy====\n[[File:Papiri frammentari con elleniche di senofonte, PSI X 1197, oxyrhynchos 90-150 dc ca..JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Fragments of Xenophon's ''[[Hellenica]]'', Papyrus PSI 1197, [[Laurentian Library]], Florence.]]\nThe strength of Cyrus in holding the empire together is praiseworthy according to Xenophon. However, the empire began to decline upon the death of Cyrus. By this example Xenophon sought to show that empires lacked stability and could only be maintained by a person of remarkable prowess, such as Cyrus.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> Cyrus is idealized greatly in the narrative. Xenophon displays Cyrus as a lofty, temperate man. This is not to say that he was not a good ruler, but he is depicted as surreal and not subject to the foibles of other men. By showing that only someone who is almost beyond human could conduct such an enterprise as empire, Xenophon indirectly censures imperial design. Thus he also reflects on the state of his own reality in an even more indirect fashion, using the example of the Persians to decry the attempts at empire made by Athens and Sparta.<ref>Johnson, D. M. 2005. \"Persians as Centaurs in Xenophon\u2019s \u2018Cyropaedia\u2019\", ''Transactions of the American Philological Association''. Vol 135, No. 1, pp. 177\u2013207</ref> Although partially graced with hindsight, having written the ''Cyropaedia'' after the downfall of Athens in the Peloponnesian War, this work criticizes the Greek attempts at empire and \"monarchy\", dooming them to failure.\n\n====Against democracy====\nAnother passage that Johnson cites as criticism of monarchy and empire concerns the devaluation of the ''homot\u012bmoi''. The manner in which this occurs seems also to be a subtle jab at democracy. ''Homot\u012bmoi'' were highly and thoroughly educated and thus became the core of the soldiery as heavy infantry. As the name ''homot\u012bmoi'' (\"equal\", or \"same honours\" i.e. \"peers\") suggests, their small band (1000 when Cyrus fought the [[Assyria]]ns) shared equally in the spoils of war.<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> However, in the face of overwhelming numbers in a campaign against the Assyrians, Cyrus armed the commoners with similar arms instead of their normal light ranged armament (''Cyropaedia'' 2.1.9). Argument ensued as to how the spoils would now be split, and Cyrus enforced a meritocracy. Many ''homot\u012bmoi'' found this unfair because their military training was no better than the commoners, only their education, and hand-to-hand combat was less a matter of skill than strength and bravery. As Johnson asserts, this passage decries imperial meritocracy and corruption, for the ''homot\u012bmoi'' now had to sychophantize to the emperor for positions and honours;<ref name=\"autogenerated177\"/> from this point they were referred to as ''ent\u012bmoi'', no longer of the \"same honours\" but having to be \"in\" to get the honour. On the other hand, the passage seems to be critical of democracy, or at least sympathetic to aristocrats within democracy, for the ''homot\u012bmoi'' (aristocracy/oligarchs) are devalued upon the empowerment of the commoners (''demos''). Although empire emerges in this case, this is also a sequence of events associated with democracy. Through his dual critique of empire and democracy, Xenophon subtly relates his support of oligarchy.\n\n===''Constitution of the Spartans''===\n{{main|Polity of the Lacedaemonians}}\nThe Spartans wrote nothing about themselves, or if they did it is lost. Therefore, what we know about them comes exclusively from outsiders like Xenophon. Xenophon\u2019s affinity for the Spartans is clear in the Constitution of the Spartans, as well as his penchant for oligarchy. The opening line reads:\n\n{{quote|It occurred to me one day that Sparta, though among the most thinly populated of states, was evidently the most powerful and most celebrated city in Greece; and I fell to wondering how this could have happened. But when I considered the institutions of the Spartans, I wondered no longer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Xenophon, Constitution of the Lacedaimonians, chapter 1, section 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0210%3atext%3dConst.+Lac.|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>}}\n\nXenophon goes on to describe in detail the main aspects of [[Laconia]], handing to us the most comprehensive extant analysis of the institutions of Sparta.\n\n===Old Oligarch===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA short treatise on the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Pseudo-Xenophon)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' exists that was once thought to be by Xenophon, but which was probably written when Xenophon was about five years old. The author, often called in English the \"Old Oligarch\" or Pseudo-Xenophon, detests the democracy of Athens and the poorer classes, but he argues that the Periclean institutions are well designed for their deplorable purposes. Although the real Xenophon seems to prefer oligarchy over democracy, none of his works so ardently decry democracy as does the Constitution of the Athenians. However, this treatise makes evident that anti-democratic sentiments were extant in Athens in the late 5th century BC and were only increased after its shortcomings were exploited and made apparent during the Peloponnesian War.\n\n==Socratic works and dialogues==\n[[File:Xenophon Agesilaus.jpg|thumb|upright|Xenophon's [[Agesilaus (Xenophon)|Agesilaus]].]]\nXenophon\u2019s works includes a selection of Socratic dialogues; these writings are completely preserved. Except for the dialogues of [[Plato]], they are the only surviving representatives of the genre of [[Socratic dialogue]]. These works include Xenophon's ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology]], [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]], [[Symposium (Xenophon)|Symposium]],'' and ''[[Oeconomicus]]''. The ''Symposium'' outlines the character of [[Socrates]] as he and his companions discuss what attribute they take pride in. In ''Oeconomicus'', Socrates explains how to manage a household. Both the ''Apology'' and ''Memorabilia'' defend Socrates\u2019 character and teachings. The former is set during the trial of Socrates, essentially defending Socrates\u2019 loss and death, while the latter is a defence of Socrates, explaining his moral principles and that he was not a corrupter of the youth.\n\n===Relationship with Socrates===\nXenophon was a student of Socrates, and their personal relationship is evident through a conversation between the two in Xenophon\u2019s ''Anabasis''. In his ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', the Greek biographer Diogenes La\u00ebrtius reports how Xenophon met Socrates. \"They say that Socrates met [Xenophon] in a narrow lane, and put his stick across it and prevented him from passing by, asking him where all kinds of necessary things were sold. And when he had answered him, he asked him again where men were made good and virtuous. And as he did not know, he said, \u2018Follow me, then, and learn.\u2019 And from this time forth, Xenophon became a follower of Socrates.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Laertius |first=Diogenes |title=thegreatthinkers.org |url=http://thegreatthinkers.org/xenophon/introduction/ |website=Great Thinkers |accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> Diogenes La\u00ebrtius also relates an incident \"when in the [[battle of Delium]] Xenophon had fallen from his horse\" and Socrates reputedly \"stepped in and saved his life.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Socrates}}</ref>\n\nXenophon's admiration for his teacher is clear in writings such as ''Symposium'', ''Apology'', and ''Memorabilia''.  Xenophon was away on his Persian campaign during the trial and death of Socrates. Nevertheless, much of Xenophon's Socratic writing, especially ''Apology'', concerns that very trial and the defence Socrates put forward.\n\n===Socrates: Xenophon vs. Plato===\n\nBoth Plato and Xenophon wrote an ''Apology'' concerning the death of Socrates. The two writers seem more concerned about answering questions that arose after the trial than about the actual charges. In particular, Xenophon and Plato are concerned with the failures of Socrates to defend himself. The Socrates that Xenophon portrayed was different from Plato\u2019s in multiple respects. Xenophon asserts that Socrates dealt with his prosecution in an exceedingly arrogant manner, or at least was perceived to have spoken arrogantly. Conversely, while not omitting it completely, Plato worked to temper that arrogance in his own ''Apology''. Xenophon framed Socrates\u2019 defense, which both men admit was not prepared at all, not as failure to effectively argue his side, but as striving for death even in the light of unconvincing charges. As Danzig interprets it, convincing the jury to condemn him even on unconvincing charges would be a rhetorical challenge worthy of the great persuader.<ref name=\"autogenerated281\">Danzig, Gabriel. 2003. \"Apologizing for Socrates: Plato and Xenophon on Socrates\u2019 Behavior in Court.\" Transactions of the American Philological Association. Vol. 133, No. 2, pp. 281\u2013321.</ref> Xenophon uses this interpretation as justification for Socrates\u2019 arrogant stance and conventional failure. By contrast, Plato does not go so far as to claim that Socrates actually desired death, but seems to argue that Socrates was attempting to demonstrate a higher moral standard and teach a lesson, although his defence failed by conventional standards. This places Socrates in a higher moral position than his prosecutors, a typical Platonic example of absolving \"Socrates from blame in every conceivable way.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated281\"/>\n\n===Historical reality===\nAlthough Xenophon claims to have been present at the ''Symposium'', this is impossible as he was only a young boy at the date which he proposes it occurred. And again, Xenophon was not present at the trial of Socrates, having been on campaign in [[Anatolia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. Thus he puts into the latter\u2019s mouth what he would have thought him to say. It seems that Xenophon wrote his ''Apology'' and  ''Memorabilia'' as defences of his former teacher, not to explain Socrates' relationship to the actual charges incurred.<ref name=\"autogenerated281\"/>\n\n===Modern reception===\nXenophon's standing as a political philosopher has been defended in recent times by [[Leo Strauss]], who devoted a considerable part of his philosophic analysis to the works of Xenophon, returning to the high judgment of Xenophon as a thinker expressed by [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]], [[Francis Bacon]], [[John Milton]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[John Adams]].\n\nXenophon\u2019s lessons on leadership have been reconsidered for their modern-day value. Jennifer O\u2019Flannery holds that \"discussions of leadership and civic virtue should include the work of Xenophon ... on public education for public service.\"<ref name=\"administration41\">O\u2019Flannery, Jennifer. 2003. \"Xenophon\u2019s (The Education of Cyrus) and Ideal Leadership Lessons for Modern Public Administration.\" Public Administration Quarterly. Vol. 27, No. 1/2, pp. 41\u201364.</ref> The ''Cyropaedia'', in outlining Cyrus as an ideal leader having mastered the qualities of \"education, equality, consensus, justice and service to state,\" is the work that she suggests be used as a guide or example for those striving to be leaders (see [[mirrors for princes]]). The linking of moral code and education is an especially pertinent quality subscribed to Cyrus that O\u2019Flannery believes is in line with modern perceptions of leadership.<ref name=\"administration41\"/>\n\n==List of works==\n[[File:Xenophon dictating his history, illustration from 'Hutchinson's History of the Nations', 1915.jpg|thumb|Xenophon dictating his history, illustration from 'Hutchinson's History of the Nations', 1915]]\n[[File:King's Peace 387 BC.jpg|thumb|[[Peace of Antalcidas|King's Peace]], promulgated by [[Artaxerxes II]], 387 BC, as reported by Xenophon.]]\nXenophon\u2019s entire classical corpus is extant.<ref>See for example the ''Landmark edition of Xenophon's Hellenika''.
