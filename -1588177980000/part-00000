It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''' and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2019}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 12,960 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail service in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina District, Portland, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08509E10A9331 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08719D9CBA010 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]] (I-5), or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08585BA395FF1 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with a greater Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08585BA395FF1 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to Washington's [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB085B18E9E7EFB |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''' and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2019}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 12,960 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail service in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina District, Portland, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08509E10A9331 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08719D9CBA010 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]] (I-5), or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08585BA395FF1 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with a greater Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB08585BA395FF1 |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to Washington's [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|I-205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2 |url=https://proxy.multcolib.org:2489/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AMNEWS&req_dat=0D10F2CADB4B24C0&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB085B18E9E7EFB |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-access=registration}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

It utilizes internal GPS tracking system in order to find and catch Pok\u00e9mon in real-time. The system places gyms and Pok\u00e9stops in predetermined locations (such as [[landmark]]s) throughout the world in order to get the player active and become a Pok\u00e9mon trainer in real life. The Pok\u00e9mon themselves spawn randomly, with some conditions; nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon like Lunatone only spawn at night, and Magikarp spawn near water. Gyms are used to battle and train Pok\u00e9mon against other players in the area, and nearby Pok\u00e9Stops give free items when spun (they have a 5-minute cooldown per use). It originally featured the 151 original [[Lists of Pok\u00e9mon#Generation1 .28 Red.2C Blue.2C Green.2C and Yellow.29|Generation 1 Pok\u00e9mon]].

It utilizes internal GPS tracking system in order to find and catch Pok\u00e9mon in real-time. The system places gyms and Pok\u00e9stops in predetermined locations (such as [[landmark]]s) throughout the world in order to get the player active and become a Pok\u00e9mon trainer in real life. The Pok\u00e9mon themselves spawn randomly, with some conditions; nocturnal Pok\u00e9mon like Lunatone only spawn at night, and Magikarp spawn near water. Gyms are used to battle and train Pok\u00e9mon against other players in the area, and nearby Pok\u00e9Stops give free items when spun (they have a 5-minute cooldown per use). It originally featured the 151 original [[Lists of Pok\u00e9mon#Generation1 .28 Red.2C Blue.2C Green.2C and Yellow.29|Generation 1 Pok\u00e9mon]].
