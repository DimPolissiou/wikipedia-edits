The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s as part of [[Seattle]]'s [[grunge]] movement, becoming known for Staley's distinct vocal style and tenor voice as well as the [[harmony|harmonized]] vocals between him and guitarist/vocalist [[Jerry Cantrell]].

He struggled for much of his adult life with depression and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in his death from a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose at the age of 34 on April 5, 2002.\n\nStaley was ranked at No. 27 on [[Hit Parader]]'s list of \"Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists\" in 2006, and at No. 42 on [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'s magazine list of \"The 50 Best Lead Singers of All Time\" in 2012.

The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s as part of [[Seattle]]'s [[grunge]] movement, becoming known for Staley's distinct vocal style and tenor voice as well as the [[harmony|harmonized]] vocals between him and guitarist/vocalist [[Jerry Cantrell]]. Staley was also a member of the [[glam metal]] bands [[Sleze]] and [[Alice N' Chains]]<!-- note: not Alice N' Chains is not the same band as Alice in Chains -->, and  the supergroups [[Mad Season (band)|Mad Season]] and [[Class of '99]].\n\nFrom mid-1996 onwards, Staley was out of the public spotlight, never to perform live again. He struggled for much of his adult life with depression and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in his death from a [[Speedball (drug)|speedball]] overdose at the age of 34 on April 5, 2002.\n\nStaley was ranked at No. 27 on [[Hit Parader]]'s list of \"Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists\" in 2006, and at No. 42 on [[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'s magazine list of \"The 50 Best Lead Singers of All Time\" in 2012.

Furthermore, it was Disney who first recognized the necessity for studios to maintain a separate \"story department\" with specialized [[storyboard artist]]s (that is, a new occupation distinct from [[animator]]s), as he had realized that audiences would not watch a film unless its story gave them a reason to care about the characters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Newton|author2=Krystina Madej|title=Disney Stories: Getting to Digital|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=London|isbn=9781461421016|pages=55\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Krasniewicz|first1=Louise|title=Walt Disney: A Biography|date=2010|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9780313358302|pages=60\u201364}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gabler|first1=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=2007|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679757474|pages=181\u2013189}}</ref> The second studio to switch from \"story sketches\" to storyboards was [[Walter Lantz Productions]] in early 1935;<ref>1936 documentary ''Cartoonland Mysteries''</ref> by 1936 [[Harman-Ising]] and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] also followed suit.  By 1937 or 1938, all American animation studios were using storyboards.\n\n''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) was one of the first live-action films to be completely storyboarded. [[William Cameron Menzies]], the film's [[production designer]], was hired by producer [[David O. Selznick]] to design every shot of the film.\n\nStoryboarding became popular in live-action film production during the early 1940s and grew into a standard medium for the previsualization of films. [[Pace Gallery]] curator Annette Micheloson, writing of the exhibition ''Drawing into Film: Director's Drawings'', considered the 1940s to 1990s to be the period in which \"production design was largely characterized by the adoption of the storyboard\".

It helps [[film director]]s, [[cinematographers]] and [[television commercial]] [[advertising]] clients visualize the scenes and find potential problems before they occur. Besides this, storyboards also help estimate the cost of the overall production and save time.  Often storyboards include arrows or instructions that indicate movement. For fast-paced action scenes, monochrome [[line art]] might suffice. For slower-paced dramatic films with an emphasis on lighting, color [[Impressionism|impressionist]] style art might be necessary. \n\nIn creating a [[motion picture]] with any degree of fidelity to a [[screenplay|script]], a storyboard provides a visual layout of events as they are to be seen through the camera lens. And in the case of interactive media, it is the layout and sequence in which the user or viewer sees the content or information. In the storyboarding process, most technical details involved in crafting a film or interactive media project can be efficiently described either in a picture or in additional text.\n\n====Theatre====\nA common misconception is that storyboards are not used in theatre. Directors and playwrights frequently{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} use storyboards as special tools to understand the layout of the scene. The great Russian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] developed storyboards in his detailed production plans for his [[Moscow Art Theatre]] performances (such as of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov's]] ''[[The Seagull]]'' in 1898). The German director and dramatist [[Bertolt Brecht]] developed detailed storyboards as part of his [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] method of \"[[fabel]]s.\"\n\n====Animatics====\nIn [[animation]] and [[special effects]] work, the storyboarding stage may be followed by simplified mock-ups called \"animatics\" to give a better idea of how a scene will look and feel with motion and timing. At its simplest, an animatic is a sequence of still images (usually taken from a storyboard) displayed in sync with rough [[dialogue]] (i.e., [[scratch vocal]]s) or rough soundtrack, essentially providing a simplified overview of how various visual and auditory elements will work in conjunction to one another.\n\nThis allows the [[animator]]s and [[film director|director]]s to work out any [[screenplay]], camera positioning, shot list, and timing issues that may exist with the current storyboard. The storyboard and soundtrack are amended if necessary, and a new animatic may be created and reviewed by the production staff until the storyboard is finalized. Editing at the animatic stage can help a production avoid wasting time and resources on the animation of scenes that would otherwise be edited out of the film at a later stage.  A few minutes of screen time in [[traditional animation]] usually equates to months of work for a team of traditional animators, who must painstakingly draw and paint countless frames, meaning that all that labor (and salaries already paid) will have to be written off if the final scene simply does not work in the film's final cut.  In the context of [[computer animation]], storyboarding helps minimize the construction of unnecessary scene components and models, just as it helps live-action filmmakers evaluate what portions of sets need not be constructed because they will never come into the frame.\n\nOften storyboards are animated with simple zooms and pans to simulate camera movement (using [[non-linear editing system|non-linear editing software]]). These animations can be combined with available animatics, sound effects, and dialog to create a presentation of how a film could be shot and cut together. Some feature film [[DVD]] ''special features'' include production animatics, which may have [[scratch vocal]]s or may even feature vocals from the actual cast (usually where the scene was cut after the vocal recording phase but before the animation production phase).\n\nAnimatics are also used by advertising agencies to create inexpensive test commercials.  A variation, the \"rip-o-matic\", is made from scenes of existing movies, television programs or commercials, to simulate the look and feel of the proposed commercial.  Rip, in this sense, refers to ripping-off an original work to create a new one.\n\n===Photomatic===\nA Photomatic<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.animaticmedia.com/work/Man_Woman|title=Centrum Man / Woman|website=www.animaticmedia.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201003445/http://www.animaticmedia.com/work/Man_Woman|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> (probably derived from 'animatic' or photo-animation) is a series of still [[photograph]]s edited together and presented on screen in a [[sequence]]. [[Sound effect]]s, [[voice-over]]s, and a [[soundtrack]] are added to the piece to show how a film could be shot and cut together. Increasingly used by advertisers and [[advertising agencies]] to research the effectiveness of their proposed storyboard before committing to a 'full up' [[television advertisement]].\n\nThe Photomatic is usually a research tool, similar to an [[#Animatics|animatic]], in that it represents the work to a test audience so that the commissioners of the work can gauge its effectiveness.\n\nOriginally, photographs were taken using a color negative film. A selection would be made from contact sheets and prints made. The prints would be placed on a rostrum and recorded to [[videotape]] using a standard [[video camera]]. Any moves, pans or zooms would have to be made in-camera. The captured scenes could then be edited.\n\n[[Digital photography]], web access to [[stock photography]] and [[non-linear editing]] programs have had a marked impact on this way of filmmaking also leading to the term 'digimatic'. Images can be shot and edited very quickly to allow important creative decisions to be made 'live'. Photo composite [[animations]] can build intricate scenes that would normally be beyond many test film budgets.\n\nPhotomatix was also the trademarked name of many of the booths found in public places which took photographs by coin operation. The Photomatic brand of the booths was manufactured by the [[International Mutoscope Reel Company]] of [[New York City]]. Earlier versions took only one photo per coin, and later versions of the booths took a series of photos. Many of the booths would produce a strip of four photos in exchange for a coin.\n\n===Comic books===\nSome writers have used storyboard type drawings (albeit rather sketchy) for their scripting of [[comic books]], often indicating staging of figures, backgrounds, and balloon placement with instructions to the artist as needed often scribbled in the margins and the dialogue or captions indicated. [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]] and [[Carl Barks]] (when he was writing stories for the [[The Junior Woodchucks|Junior Woodchuck]] title) are known to have used this style of scripting.<ref>{{Google books|f20xMWyka3oC|Carl Barks: Conversations|page=41|keywords=sketches+toryboard|text=}}</ref><ref>{{Google books|SOLGDAAAQBAJ|John Stanley: Giving Life to Little Lulu|page=36|keywords=storyboards|text=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[manga|Japanese comics]], the word {{nihongo|\"[[Name (manga)|name]]\"|\u30cd\u30fc\u30e0|n\u0113mu|{{IPA-ja|ne\u02d0m\u026f|pron}}}} is used for rough manga storyboards.<ref>{{Google books|t2tGT82nSrUC|How to Draw Manga: Putting Things in Perspective|page=110|keywords=neemu|text=}}</ref>\n\n===Business===\nStoryboards used for planning advertising campaigns such as [[corporate video]] production, commercials, a [[proposal (business)|proposal]] or other business presentations intended to convince or compel to action are known as presentation boards.  Presentation boards will generally be a higher quality render than shooting boards as they need to convey expression, layout, and mood.  Modern ad agencies and marketing professionals will create presentation boards either by hiring a  storyboard artist to create hand-drawn illustrated frames or often use sourced photographs to create a loose narrative of the idea they are trying to sell.\n\nSome consulting firms teach the technique to their staff to use during the development of client presentations, frequently employing the \"brown paper technique\" of taping presentation slides (in sequential versions as changes are made) to a large piece of kraft paper which can be rolled up for easy transport. The initial storyboard may be as simple as slide titles on Post-It notes, which are then replaced with draft presentation slides as they are created.\n\nStoryboards also exist in accounting in the ABC System [[activity-based costing]] (ABC) to develop a detailed process [[flowchart]] which visually shows all activities and the relationships among activities. They are used in this way to measure the cost of resources consumed, identify and eliminate non-value-added costs, determine the efficiency and effectiveness of all major activities, and identify and evaluate new activities that can improve future performance.\n\nA \"[[quality storyboard]]\" is a tool to help facilitate the introduction of a quality improvement process into an organisation.\n\n\"Design comics\" are a type of storyboard used to include a customer or other characters into a narrative. Design comics are most often used in designing websites or illustrating product-use scenarios during design. Design comics were popularized by Kevin Cheng and Jane Jao in 2006.<ref>[http://boxesandarrows.com/learning-doing-selling-2006-ia-summit-wrapup-sunday/ 2006 Information Architecture Summit wrapup], boxesandarrows.com, 19 April 2006</ref>\n\n===Architectural studios===\nOccasionally, architectural studios need a storyboard artist to visualize presentations of their projects. Usually, a project needs to be seen by a panel of judges and nowadays it\u2019s possible to create virtual models of proposed new buildings, using advanced computer software to simulate lights, settings, and materials. Clearly, this type of work takes time \u2013 and so the first stage is a draft in the form of a storyboard, to define the various sequences that will subsequently be computer-animated. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Storyboard Design Course|last=Cristiano|first=Giuseppe|publisher=Thames&Hudson|year=2008|isbn=978-0-500-28690-6|location=London UK|pages=30}}</ref>\n\n===Novels===\nStoryboards are now becoming more popular with novelists.  Because most novelists write their stories by scenes rather than chapters, storyboards are useful for plotting the story in a sequence of events and rearranging the scenes accordingly.\n\n===Interactive media===\nMore recently the term ''storyboard'' has been used in the fields of [[web development]], [[software development]], and [[instructional design]] to present and describe, in written, [[interactive]] events as well as audio and motion, particularly on [[user interface]]s and [[electronic page]]s.\n\n===Software===\nStoryboarding is used in software development as part of identifying the specifications for a particular set of software. During the specification phase, screens that the software will display are drawn, either on paper or using other specialized software, to illustrate the important steps of the user experience. The storyboard is then modified by the engineers and the client while they decide on their specific needs. The reason why storyboarding is useful during software engineering is that it helps the user understand exactly how the software will work, much better than an abstract description. It is also cheaper to make changes to a storyboard than an implemented piece of software.\n\nAn example is the Storyboards system for designing GUI [[Application software|apps]] for [[iOS]] and [[macOS]].<ref name=\"AppleXcode2018\">{{cite web |title=Xcode Overview: Designing with Storyboards |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DesigningwithStoryboards.html |website=developer.apple.com |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific research ===\nStoryboards are used in [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[Field research|fieldwork]] to [[Elicitation technique|elicit]] spoken [[language]].<ref>Strang Burton and Lisa Matthewson. \"Targeted construction storyboards in semantic fieldwork\". In: Ryan Bochnak and Lisa Matthewson, editors, ''Methodologies in Semantic Fieldwork'', 135\u2013156. Oxford University Press, 2015.</ref> An [[Informant (linguistics)|informant]] is usually presented with a simplified graphical depiction of a situation or story, and asked to describe the depicted situation, or to re-tell the depicted story. The speech is recorded for linguistic [[Analysis#Linguistics|analysis]].\n\n==Benefits==\nOne advantage of using storyboards is that it allows (in film and business) the user to experiment with changes in the storyline to evoke stronger reaction or interest. Flashbacks, for instance, are often the result of sorting storyboards out of chronological order to help build suspense and interest.\n\nAnother benefit of storyboarding is that the production can plan the movie in advance. In this step, things like the type of camera shot, angle, and blocking of characters are decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jugaadanimation.com/storyboarding-basics-infographic/|title=Storyboarding Basics - Infographic Guide for Film, TV and Animation|website=jugaadanimation.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nThe process of visual thinking and planning allows a group of people to brainstorm together, placing their ideas on storyboards and then arranging the storyboards on the wall. This fosters more ideas and generates consensus inside the group.\n\n==Creation==\n[[File:Storyboard template example.svg|thumb|right|upright|A storyboard template.]]Storyboards for films are created in a multiple-step process. They can be created by hand drawing or digitally on a computer. The main characteristics of a storyboard are:\n\n* Visualize the [[storytelling]].\n* Focus the story and the timing in several [[key frame]]s (very important in animation).\n* Define the technical parameters: description of the [[motion (physics)|motion]], the [[camera]], the [[lighting]], etc.\n\nIf drawing by hand, the first step is to create or download a storyboard template. These look much like a blank comic strip, with space for comments and dialogue. Then sketch a \"[[thumbnail]]\" storyboard. Some directors sketch thumbnails directly in the script margins.  These storyboards get their name because they are rough sketches not bigger than a thumbnail. For some motion pictures, thumbnail storyboards are sufficient.\n\nHowever, some filmmakers rely heavily on the storyboarding process. If a director or producer wishes, more detailed and elaborate storyboard images are created. These can be created by professional [[storyboard artist]]s by hand on paper or digitally by using 2D storyboarding programs. Some software applications even supply a stable of storyboard-specific images making it possible to quickly create shots that express the director's intent for the story. These boards tend to contain more detailed information than thumbnail storyboards and convey more of the mood for the scene. These are then presented to the project's cinematographer who achieves the director's vision.\n\nFinally, if needed, 3D storyboards are created (called 'technical [[previsualization]]').  The advantage of 3D storyboards is they show exactly what the film camera will see using the lenses the film camera will use. The disadvantage of 3D is the amount of time it takes to build and construct the shots. 3D storyboards can be constructed using 3D animation programs or digital puppets within 3D programs. Some programs have a collection of low-resolution 3D figures which can aid in the process. Some 3D applications allow cinematographers to create \"technical\" storyboards which are optically-correct shots and frames.\n\nWhile technical storyboards can be helpful, optically-correct storyboards may limit the director's creativity. In classic motion pictures such as [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the director created storyboards that were initially thought by cinematographers to be impossible to film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1381937/How-Alfred-Hitchcock-movie-suspense-master-crafted-screen-classics.html|title=How Alfred Hitchcock the movie suspense master crafted his screen classics|date=29 April 2011|work=Mail Online}}</ref> Such innovative and dramatic shots had \"impossible\" [[depth of field]] and angles where there was \"no room for the camera\" \u2013 at least not until creative solutions were found to achieve the ground-breaking shots that the director had envisioned.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Storyboards}}\n\n* [[Filmmaking]]\n* [[Graphic organizer]]\n* [[Pre-production]]\n* [[Screenwriting]]\n* [[Script breakdown]]\n* [[List of film topics|List of film-related topics]]\n\n==References==\n<ref>Movie Storyboards: The Art of Visualizing Screenplays,by Fionnuala Halligan, Chronicle Books (2013)</ref>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Filmmaking paper trail}}\n\n[[Category:Filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Film production]]\n[[Category:Film and video terminology]]\n[[Category:Cinematic techniques]]\n[[Category:Animation techniques]]\n[[Category:Infographics]]\n[[Category:Home video supplements]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Comics terminology]]\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1933]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{Filmmaking sidebar}}\n\nA '''storyboard''' is a graphic organizer that consists of [[illustration]]s or [[image]]s displayed in sequence for the purpose of [[Previsualization|pre-visualizing]] a [[film|motion picture]], [[animation]], [[motion graphic]] or [[interactive media]] sequence.

Furthermore, it was Disney who first recognized the necessity for studios to maintain a separate \"story department\" with specialized [[storyboard artist]]s (that is, a new occupation distinct from [[animator]]s), as he had realized that audiences would not watch a film unless its story gave them a reason to care about the characters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Newton|author2=Krystina Madej|title=Disney Stories: Getting to Digital|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|location=London|isbn=9781461421016|pages=55\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Krasniewicz|first1=Louise|title=Walt Disney: A Biography|date=2010|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|isbn=9780313358302|pages=60\u201364}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Gabler|first1=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|date=2007|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=9780679757474|pages=181\u2013189}}</ref> The second studio to switch from \"story sketches\" to storyboards was [[Walter Lantz Productions]] in early 1935;<ref>1936 documentary ''Cartoonland Mysteries''</ref> by 1936 [[Harman-Ising]] and [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] also followed suit.  By 1937 or 1938, all American animation studios were using storyboards.\n\n''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939) was one of the first live-action films to be completely storyboarded. [[William Cameron Menzies]], the film's [[production designer]], was hired by producer [[David O.

Clearly, this type of work takes time \u2013 and so the first stage is a draft in the form of a storyboard, to define the various sequences that will subsequently be computer-animated. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Storyboard Design Course|last=Cristiano|first=Giuseppe|publisher=Thames&Hudson|year=2008|isbn=978-0-500-28690-6|location=London UK|pages=30}}</ref>\n\n===Novels===\nStoryboards are now becoming more popular with novelists.  Because most novelists write their stories by scenes rather than chapters, storyboards are useful for plotting the story in a sequence of events and rearranging the scenes accordingly.\n\n===Interactive media===\nMore recently the term ''storyboard'' has been used in the fields of [[web development]], [[software development]], and [[instructional design]] to present and describe, in written, [[interactive]] events as well as audio and motion, particularly on [[user interface]]s and [[electronic page]]s.\n\n===Software===\nStoryboarding is used in software development as part of identifying the specifications for a particular set of software. During the specification phase, screens that the software will display are drawn, either on paper or using other specialized software, to illustrate the important steps of the user experience. The storyboard is then modified by the engineers and the client while they decide on their specific needs. The reason why storyboarding is useful during software engineering is that it helps the user understand exactly how the software will work, much better than an abstract description. It is also cheaper to make changes to a storyboard than an implemented piece of software.\n\nAn example is the Storyboards system for designing GUI [[Application software|apps]] for [[iOS]] and [[macOS]].<ref name=\"AppleXcode2018\">{{cite web |title=Xcode Overview: Designing with Storyboards |url=https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DesigningwithStoryboards.html |website=developer.apple.com |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Scientific research ===\nStoryboards are used in [[Linguistics|linguistic]] [[Field research|fieldwork]] to [[Elicitation technique|elicit]] spoken [[language]].<ref>Strang Burton and Lisa Matthewson. \"Targeted construction storyboards in semantic fieldwork\". In: Ryan Bochnak and Lisa Matthewson, editors, ''Methodologies in Semantic Fieldwork'', 135\u2013156. Oxford University Press, 2015.</ref> An [[Informant (linguistics)|informant]] is usually presented with a simplified graphical depiction of a situation or story, and asked to describe the depicted situation, or to re-tell the depicted story. The speech is recorded for linguistic [[Analysis#Linguistics|analysis]].\n\n==Benefits==\nOne advantage of using storyboards is that it allows (in film and business) the user to experiment with changes in the storyline to evoke stronger reaction or interest. Flashbacks, for instance, are often the result of sorting storyboards out of chronological order to help build suspense and interest.\n\nAnother benefit of storyboarding is that the production can plan the movie in advance. In this step, things like the type of camera shot, angle, and blocking of characters are decided.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jugaadanimation.com/storyboarding-basics-infographic/|title=Storyboarding Basics - Infographic Guide for Film, TV and Animation|website=jugaadanimation.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nThe process of visual thinking and planning allows a group of people to brainstorm together, placing their ideas on storyboards and then arranging the storyboards on the wall. This fosters more ideas and generates consensus inside the group.\n\n==Creation==\n[[File:Storyboard template example.svg|thumb|right|upright|A storyboard template.]]Storyboards for films are created in a multiple-step process. They can be created by hand drawing or digitally on a computer. The main characteristics of a storyboard are:\n\n* Visualize the [[storytelling]].\n* Focus the story and the timing in several [[key frame]]s (very important in animation).\n* Define the technical parameters: description of the [[motion (physics)|motion]], the [[camera]], the [[lighting]], etc.\n\nIf drawing by hand, the first step is to create or download a storyboard template. These look much like a blank comic strip, with space for comments and dialogue. Then sketch a \"[[thumbnail]]\" storyboard. Some directors sketch thumbnails directly in the script margins.  These storyboards get their name because they are rough sketches not bigger than a thumbnail. For some motion pictures, thumbnail storyboards are sufficient.\n\nHowever, some filmmakers rely heavily on the storyboarding process. If a director or producer wishes, more detailed and elaborate storyboard images are created. These can be created by professional [[storyboard artist]]s by hand on paper or digitally by using 2D storyboarding programs. Some software applications even supply a stable of storyboard-specific images making it possible to quickly create shots that express the director's intent for the story. These boards tend to contain more detailed information than thumbnail storyboards and convey more of the mood for the scene. These are then presented to the project's cinematographer who achieves the director's vision.\n\nFinally, if needed, 3D storyboards are created (called 'technical [[previsualization]]').  The advantage of 3D storyboards is they show exactly what the film camera will see using the lenses the film camera will use. The disadvantage of 3D is the amount of time it takes to build and construct the shots. 3D storyboards can be constructed using 3D animation programs or digital puppets within 3D programs. Some programs have a collection of low-resolution 3D figures which can aid in the process. Some 3D applications allow cinematographers to create \"technical\" storyboards which are optically-correct shots and frames.\n\nWhile technical storyboards can be helpful, optically-correct storyboards may limit the director's creativity. In classic motion pictures such as [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' and [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the director created storyboards that were initially thought by cinematographers to be impossible to film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1381937/How-Alfred-Hitchcock-movie-suspense-master-crafted-screen-classics.html|title=How Alfred Hitchcock the movie suspense master crafted his screen classics|date=29 April 2011|work=Mail Online}}</ref> Such innovative and dramatic shots had \"impossible\" [[depth of field]] and angles where there was \"no room for the camera\" \u2013 at least not until creative solutions were found to achieve the ground-breaking shots that the director had envisioned.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Storyboards}}\n\n* [[Filmmaking]]\n* [[Graphic organizer]]\n* [[Pre-production]]\n* [[Screenwriting]]\n* [[Script breakdown]]\n* [[List of film topics|List of film-related topics]]\n\n==References==\n<ref>Movie Storyboards: The Art of Visualizing Screenplays,by Fionnuala Halligan, Chronicle Books (2013)</ref>\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Filmmaking paper trail}}\n\n[[Category:Filmmaking]]\n[[Category:Film production]]\n[[Category:Film and video terminology]]\n[[Category:Cinematic techniques]]\n[[Category:Animation techniques]]\n[[Category:Infographics]]\n[[Category:Home video supplements]]\n[[Category:American inventions]]\n[[Category:Comics terminology]]\n[[Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1933]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios]]\n", "name_user": "136.228.173.151", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOrigins)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard"}

He studied [[Sharia]] and the [[Quran]]. He also learned [[archery]] and horse-riding amongst other things under the supervision of his father, as well as tribal lineages, and how to conduct peace agreements, and the art of wars, politics, diplomacy, and administration in the traditional Arabian ways. He accompanied his father on his many expeditions and, participated in several campaigns during the unification of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. In addition, his father would entrust him from time to time with war-related or political, administrative and diplomatic missions. When King Abdulaziz appointed him as an heir to his throne in 1933, his advice to his son was that he should always be devoted to the service of the cause of the Almighty, aspire towards raising aloft the voice of [[Islam]], strive hard to look after the concerns and affairs of his subjects, and be truthful in word and deed. He also advised him to incline towards and respect Muslim scholars, and keep their company and listen to their advice. The young Saud then pledged to his father that he would loyally abide by his words.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/upbringing-education-1902-1915/213 Upbringing & Education 1902-1915] - The King Saud Foundation Website</ref>\n\nSaud's first political mission was at the age of thirteen, leading a delegation to Qatar. The first battle he fought was at Jirrab in 1915, followed by one at Yatab in the same year, then Trubah in 1919.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/the-battle-of-yatab-in-1918/222] - Yatab Battle - The Warrior</ref> In 1925, he stopped the Almahmal crisis in [[Makkah]]. He fought to stop the [[Ikhwan]] Revolt at Al Sebella in 1929.<ref>[http://kingsaud.org/history/the-warrior The Warrior] - The King Saud Foundation Website</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1933, he was appointed [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Crown Prince]]   by his father.<ref name=geor>{{cite book |author=George Kheirallah |title=Arabia Reborn |date=1952 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |page=254 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/682471/arabia-reborn |accessdate=14 March 2015}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref> The following year, Ibn Saud sent two military expeditions; one of them was led by Crown Prince Saud, who regained Najran and advanced secretly through the rugged mountains in the northwest part of Yemen.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/the-war-with-yemen/1336 The War with Yemen] - The King Saud Foundation Website</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the war with [[Yemen]], Ibn Saud decided to encourage Saud to travel abroad. Accompanied by his father's adviser, Fuad Hamzah and Physician Dr. Medhat Sheikh el-Ard and some others, he visited: [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]] and Europe where he represented his father at the [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] in 1937. Saud struck a warm friendship with the young King [[Ghazi of Iraq]] I, and earned plaudits from the Amir and later King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] & Transjordan, who said to him: \"in his character, he represented the choicest and purest of the traits and attributes of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]\".\n\nWhen a crisis erupted between the neighboring [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf States]] of [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]], Saud also visited the former during December 1937 in order to help sort out their differences. This was followed by other visits to the until the eve of the [[Second World War]].\n\nAfter the war, when the establishment of a Jewish state in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] appeared to be imminent, and leaders of the various Arab States met at [[Inshas]] in [[Egypt]] during 1946 in order to review the situation under the Chairmanship of King [[Farouk of Egypt]], Saud was again selected by his father to represent him and his country, and participated in the adoption of the famous resolution that declared that: \"The Palestinian cause is the cause of all Arabs and not merely the Palestinians\". In 1947, Saud visited the United States and met with President [[Harry S. Truman]], and also met with leaders in Britain, France, and Italy, in order to acquaint the policymakers with his father's views and the unacceptability of the infringement of the rights of the Palestinians.\n\nFollowing Saud's visits, he concentrated on the first areas to be deemed in sore need of modernization and reform in view of increasing revenues and expenditures, these were the governance and handling the country's finances. After seeking advice and expert help from a number of friendly countries, primarily the USA, the [[Saudi riyal]] was linked to the [[United States Dollar]] and apart from structural, regulatory and procedural reforms within a revamped Ministry of Finance; a Central Bank under the name of the \"[[Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency]]\" (\"SAMA\") was established during 1952.\n\nIn keeping with universal practice, a proper annual state budget had first been issued during 1948 and following the establishment of the above central banking body, \"SAMA\", the third Saudi National Budget for the year 1952 complied with internationally observed standards. During this period, technical co-operation, primarily in the guise of the arrival of 35 experts during 1952 and aimed at generating planned economic growth within the Kingdom also received a major boost.\n\nApart from financial and administrative reforms, the report presented to Ibn Saud by Amir Saud, had commended the implementation of a whole range of vital infrastructural projects relating to the improvement of facilities for the Pilgrims, so important to the Kingdom from a religious and economic point of view, water supply, roads, broadcasting service, health, municipal affairs, port improvements, customs reorganization and higher education.\n\nPlans for the paved road between [[Jeddah]] and [[Mecca]] had been announced by Saud during the [[Hajj]] of 1947, and the project for bringing water from the nearby Wadi Fatimah to [[Jeddah]] was also inaugurated by him shortly during November 1947. The Hajj of 1369 AH / 1950 AD witnessed the establishment of the Makkah college that was later to be expanded and renamed [[Umm al-Qura University]].\n\nMany of these reforms, along with the complete reorganisation of the system of public administration, through the establishment or restructuring of new or existing ministries and departments, and conceived and recognised as the \"Crown Prince's Reforms\", issued from his Office by a Decree under his seal on 19 October 1952, were destined to be developed, built upon and some even implemented after the demise of Ibn Saud on 9 November 1953 and during Saud's reign as King. The traditional Consultative Council in Makkah, the \"[[Majlis-ash-Shura]]\" or [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia]] was expanded on 17 November 1952.\n\nEarlier, on 19 October 1953, Ibn Saud had also appointed Crown Prince Saud as [[Prime Minister]] for the first Saudi Cabinet. Before that, he appointed him as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Internal Security Units on 25 August 1953. During this period, the [[Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia]], including the Air Force, were modernized on a large scale with American assistance. The Saudi Arabian Airlines fleet was also expanded by the purchase of four new 'Sky Masters' to primarily facilitate the transport of Pilgrims from their homes to the sites of pilgrimage and back, and also within the Kingdom. On 10 June 1953, Saud with the approval of his father also laid the foundation stone for the expansion and refurbishment of the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] in [[Medina]]. Earlier on, following a visit, he had recommended to Ibn Saud the need for the adoption of this step, which the latter had sanctioned.\n\n==Reign==\nSaud succeeded his father King Abdulaziz ibn Saud as King on 9 November 1953 upon the latter's death.<ref name=cralls62/><ref>{{cite web|last=van Eijk|first=Esther|title=Sharia and national law in Saudi Arabia|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/221087#page=140|publisher=Leiden University|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> King Saud ascended the throne in a political climate very different from the time when his father Ibn Saud  established his Kingdom.\n\n===National policy===\nKing Saud had announced to the new Council of Ministers in his very first speech as King,<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/subarticle/new-ministries/1118] King Saud Website - History - The King</ref> that, while his father's reign was noted for military conquests, he intended his reign to be \"a war on poverty, ignorance, and disease with the equitable application of the dictates of the holy '[[Shariah]]' laws to all without exception, and the creation of a strong army\".\n \nIn order to cope adequately with the responsibilities of this challenge, and facilitate realistically the implementation of his programme he initially doubled the number of ministries to ten by adding the portfolios of Education, Agriculture, Health, Commerce and industry, plus two Directorates: Labour and Broadcasting and the Bureau of Public Inspection\" in 1955, to the existing ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Interior, Defence, and Communications.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/infrastructure/268] King Saud Website - The King - Infrastructure</ref> In 1953, the decision had already been taken to move the ministries, then located in [[Jeddah]], to [[Riyadh]], the country's official capital. This had called for the construction of suitable new buildings and the provision of adequate housing for employees. This was an ignition point for Riyadh's modernization and development. Saud's next brother and heir, Prince Faisal, was appointed Prime Minister while retaining his former portfolio of Foreign Minister.  A five years plan was started, as mentioned in King Saud's first cabinet speech in 1954.\n\nIn 1957, King Saud also founded 'King Saud University' in [[Riyadh]].\n\n===Foreign relations===\n[[File:1936 HRH Prince Saud being received by Snouck Hurgronje (right) at Leiden University 0.jpg|300px|thumb|Prince Saud being received by [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje|Snouck Hurgronje]] (right) at Leiden University in 1936]]\n[[File:NizamSaud.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] with '''[[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]'''(wearing white Turban) - the 7th [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (during his visit to the then [[Hyderabad State|Kingdom Hyderabad]])]]\n\nKing Saud played a role of utmost importance on the regional, Arab, Islamic and international political stages.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/the-politician] - King Saud Website - The Politician</ref> He started his worldwide tours after finishing touring of his country's regions. He visited Arab and friendly countries for strategic and political purposes. He began his tour in 1954 in [[Egypt]], followed by [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Yemen]] and [[Pakistan]].\nHe announced that his sole purpose was to \"unify Muslims all over the world\" so they would be like one strong body. King Saud believed in a non-alignment policy between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which he discussed thoroughly with Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] during an official visit to [[India]]. He also strove to keep the region free from coalitions and blocs that only served foreign interests and thus he refused to join the [[Baghdad Pact]].\nDespite pressure exerted from the West, he approved upon meeting President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] in [[Cairo]] in March 1956 of making a joint statement regarding their understanding of security and defense matters, that coincided with other agreements in the financial, economical and development area.\n\nFor example, in November 1955, he granted a 16 million dollars loan to [[Syria]] for five years. He agreed to exchange products and exempt agricultural products from import-export license and custom duties. With the continuous Israeli assault on [[Jordan]] in 1955, King Saud invited military leaders of [[Egypt]], Syria, [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] to [[Riyadh]] in order to discuss procedures to counter the aggression. He agreed to cover all expenses of reinforcing Jordan's National Guard and armed forces. He also supported the [[Algerian War|Algerian revolution]] against France, diplomatically and financially. King Saud made a statement inviting people to donate money for the revolution; the donations amounted to $1,200,000. The government donated one million dollars of that amount in 1956, and the rest of the donations were granted yearly. King Saud kept granting donations to Algeria and kept defending it until it established its independence in 1962.\nImam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] of [[Yemen]] joined the Arab endeavors to unify their ranks when he signed the joint defense agreement with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. This event took place after the Imam's meeting with King Saud, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] on 21 April 1956, following the [[Jeddah]] Pact between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nMaintaining his support to the Arab countries after [[Suez Crisis|the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company]] on 26 July 1956, although the Egyptian Government did not consult him as it did with Syria in taking that decision contrary to his expectations as a military ally. He succeeds in strengthening his relation with King [[Faisal II of Iraq]] after a meeting held in [[Dammam]] on 20 September 1956. It was followed that same month and in the same place by a meeting with President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], during which he confirmed his total support for the Egyptian stand in this crisis. When Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt on 29 October 1956 as a result of the nationalization of the canal, King Saud declared a general mobilization and ordered the opening of enlistment offices.\nHe offered total assistance to the Egyptian government, personally supervising operations and welcoming Egyptian combat planes into his country for their protection. Among the first to enlist were Prince [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia]], Prince [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], Prince [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]], Prince [[Fahad bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] along with many other princes.\nAs a means of exerting pressure on the British and French governments, he used a weapon never used before, when he blocked oil exports, banning all British and French tankers and other tankers carrying Saudi oil to these two countries. He also broke off relations with Britain and France.\n\nKing Saud had used this economic weapon for the first time although he was aware of the possible repercussions of such a procedure on the national economy. He sustained his support after the war so as to remove the aftermath of the aggression. He offered generous contributions, including 2 million Saudi riyals to the Egyptian [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent]] to help victims of Port Said.\n\nKing Saud was still keen on keeping the region free of political and defense blocs that only support a superpower against another. Despite his solid relations with the American system, on which he relied in several areas because of the oil discovery and production, he seriously thought of canceling the American access for using Dhahran airport as a means of exerting pressure on the United States of America.\n\nDespite traditionally intimate ties of his country with the United States of America, and the ingrained alienation of communism and Islamic beliefs, he refused to join the American sponsored [[Baghdad Pact]] of 1955, (later on the Central Treaty Organisation \u2013 CENTO), \u2013 aimed at opposing the expansion of Communist influence in the region, despite the involvement of the fellow Arab State of Iraq in it, along with [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. [[Jordan]], which also was keen to join the Pact and [[Syria]] as well, had been discouraged from doing so with the aid of political and financial pressure.\n\nPresident of the United States [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] invited King Saud to undertake an official visit to the U.S. in 1957 since he believed that King Saud played a crucial role in implementing his doctrine of deterring and fighting communism in the Middle East and the Islamic countries. Once King Saud received the invitation he convened with Presidents [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] in [[Cairo]] in January 1957. The three leaders agreed to try to convince Eisenhower to pressure the Israeli government to evacuate occupied [[Sharm El Sheikh]] that overlooks the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and to withdraw to the borders of the previous truce on all frontiers.\n\nHe maintained his support to the countries at war with [[Israel]], and signed a ten-year agreement with the Egyptian and Syrian presidents and with King [[Hussein of Jordan]] to ease Jordan's financial burdens as a result of this conflict. The annual Egyptian and Saudi financial assistance added up to five million Egyptian pounds from each of the two countries.\nHe also discussed with the American President his dispute with Britain over the [[Al Buraymi Oasis]], an oil zone between the frontiers of Saudi Arabia, [[Oman]] and [[Abu Dhabi]] which was under British protection. The issue of the Al Buraymi oasis was one of the issues that had been raised since the reign of his father King Abdulaziz and was still pending. After several clashes, the case went to international arbitration. When he accepted the American president's invitation to the [[United States]] he received a good welcome, but the Mayor of New York, [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], refused to welcome the King because of his national and Islamic politics.<ref>J. Joseph Huthmacher, ''Senator Robert F. Wagner and the rise of urban liberalism'' (1968) pp 14-15</ref>\n\nKing Saud delivered an important speech during the banquet held by [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]], the Swedish UN Secretary-General in which he addressed the different aspects of the Arab complaints, in accordance with the UN charter and its powers. He invited all countries to value the charter and implement it in full; he also addressed the outcomes and repercussions of the [[Cold War]]. During his negotiations with the American president in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on 2 February 1957, the American President explained the principles and objectives of his [[doctrine]], known as the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], and the effective role that he expected of him as a powerful friend of the United States of America and as an eminent Arab and Muslim leader in fighting the communist movement invading the Middle East and the Islamic countries.\n\nWithin this scheme, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] offered a 25 million [[dollar]] loan to the Saudi Government on 24 January 1957. In return, King Saud explained that he had refused [[Soviet Union]] military aid to fight [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and that Britain's policy was what urged the Arabs to seek the [[Soviet Union]]'s help. He also stressed that non-aligned countries were benefiting from Soviet aid more than the American allied countries were benefiting from American aid. He considered that this aid should double if the American President wished to succeed in his endeavors. King Saud asked [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to exert pressure on [[Israel]] to withdraw from the occupied territories of Palestine and settle the Palestinian cause, and to convince [[France]] to reach a settlement regarding the independence of [[Algeria]]. On the other hand, he promised to inform the Arabs of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] and its purposes; and to inquire about the Arab reaction on the official and officious levels before making any commitments. King Saud explained to the American President that a large bulk of his country's budget was allocated to development projects and to the five-year plan and that he needed military aid before being able to play any role expected from him in fighting [[communism]]. The American government agreed to give him a 250 million dollar loan and all kinds of land, sea and air weaponry, and to train the Saudi army on how to use them.\n\nIn return, the American government was to be granted facilities to use [[Dhahran]] airport for five years, after which it would be returned with all its equipment to the Saudi Government in 1962.\n \nBefore briefing his Arab peers about the results of this visit and the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], King Saud visited [[Spain]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Libya]] and informed them of these results. In February 1957 he met the leaders of [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]] in [[Cairo]] and informed them of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s objectives. Under the influence of Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], King Saud, wanting to support a unanimous Arab stand, decided to back up the Egyptian and Syrian Presidents in their decision not contribute in the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]].\n\nWhen the Republic of Iraq decided to annex [[Kuwait]] in 1961 under [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], King Saud protested in international forums, declaring \"any action against [[Kuwait]] is an action against [[Saudi Arabia]]\".\n\n===Struggle with Faisal===\nA fierce struggle between Ibn Saud's most senior sons, Saud and [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]], erupted immediately after Ibn Saud's death. The increase in oil revenues did not solve the financial problem associated with Saudi Arab debt, estimated to have been $US200 million in 1953. In fact, this debt more than doubled by 1958, when it reached $US450 million. The [[Saudi Riyal]] lost half of its official value against the United States Dollar. Both [[ARAMCO]] and international banks declined Saudi's demand for credit. Saud suspended the few government projects he had initiated but continued his spending on luxurious palaces.<ref name=alrasheed02>Alrasheed M. (2002) A History of Saudi Arabia Cambridge University Press; pp. 108\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Saud was forced to delegate most of his executive powers to Faisal. Saud and Faisal fought an internal battle over the definition of political responsibilities and the division of government functions. Saud was often associated among other things with the plundering of oil revenues, luxurious palaces, and conspiracy inside and outside of Saudi Arabia while Faisal was associated with sobriety, piety, puritanism, thriftiness, and modernization.\n\nThe battle between the two brothers was fought over the role to be assigned to the Council of Ministers. Saud abolished the office of Prime Minister by royal decree, thus enforcing his position as King and ''de facto'' prime minister. Saud thought of himself as both King and prime minister whereas Faisal envisioned more powers being in his own hand as Crown Prince and deputy prime minister.<ref name=alrasheed02/>\n\n===Forced abdication===\nKing Saud's family members worried about Saud's profligacy and his inability to meet the challenge of Nasser's Egypt. Corruption and backwardness weakened the regime. [[Radio Cairo]]'s anti-Saudi broadcasting was finding a receptive audience.<ref>Quandt W.(1981) Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, The Brooking Institutions, p. 90</ref>\n\nKing Saud and Prince Faisal continued their power struggle until 1962 when Prince Faisal formed a cabinet in the absence of the King, who had gone abroad for medical treatment. Prince Faisal allied with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Prince Fahd]] and [[Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud|Prince Sultan]]. Prince Faisal's new government excluded the sons of Saud. He promised a ten-point reform that included the drafting of the basic law, the abolition of slavery and the establishment of a judicial council.\n\nUpon his return, King Saud rejected Prince Faisal's new arrangement and threatened to mobilize the Royal Guard against his brother. In response, Prince Faisal demanded King Saud make him regent and turn over all royal powers to him. In this, he had the crucial backing of the [[ulema]] (elite Islamic scholars), including a ''[[fatw\u0101|fatwa]]'' (edict) issued by the grand [[mufti]] of Saudi Arabia, a relative of Prince Faisal on his mother's side, calling on King Saud to accede to his brother's demands.<ref name=Wynbrandt>Wynbrandt, James, ''A Brief History of Saudi Arabia'', New York: Facts on File, Inc., 2004, p.{{nbsp}}225</ref>\n\nKing Saud refused, prompting Faisal to order the National Guard to surround Saud's palace. In March 1964 Saud finally relented and named Faisal regent with full executive powers, effectively reducing himself to a figurehead. In November, the ulema, cabinet and senior members of the ruling family forced Saud to abdicate altogether, and Faisal became king in his own right.<ref>Vassiliev, Alexei, ''The History of Saudi Arabia'', London, UK: Al Saqi Books, 1998, p.{{nbsp}}366-7</ref><ref name=\"EoO\">''King Faisal'', Encyclopedia of the Orient, http://lexicorient.com/e.o/faisal.htm, Retrieved 27 March 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Faysal Faisal] at Encyclopedia Britannica</ref>\n \nKing Saud was forced into exile in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and then on to other European cities. In 1966, Saud was invited by [[Nasser]] to live in [[Egypt]]; another report claims that King Saud went to Egypt under refuge granted by Nasser and stayed there from 1965 to 1967. King Saud was also allowed to broadcast on Radio Cairo. Some of his sons, such as Prince Khalid, [[Badr bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Badr]], Prince Sultan and Prince Mansur, joined him and supported his attempt to regain the throne. However, after the June 1967 [[Six-Day War|Arab-Israel War]], he lost the support of Egypt and settled in [[Greece]] until his death in 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/successioninsaud00kech|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/successioninsaud00kech/page/9 9]|quote=succession in saudi arabia.|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Mashhoor bin Saud.jpg|125px|thumbnail|King Saud with his son [[Mashhoor bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Mashhoor]]]]\n[[File:JFKWHP-ST-39-2-62.jpg|125px|thumb|Daughter Dalal, between her father and  [[John F.

He studied [[Sharia]] and the [[Quran]]. He also learned [[archery]] and horse-riding amongst other things under the supervision of his father, as well as tribal lineages, and how to conduct peace agreements, and the art of wars, politics, diplomacy, and administration in the traditional Arabian ways. He accompanied his father on his many expeditions and, participated in several campaigns during the unification of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. In addition, his father would entrust him from time to time with war-related or political, administrative and diplomatic missions. When King Abdulaziz appointed him as an heir to his throne in 1933, his advice to his son was that he should always be devoted to the service of the cause of the Almighty, aspire towards raising aloft the voice of [[Islam]], strive hard to look after the concerns and affairs of his subjects, and be truthful in word and deed. He also advised him to incline towards and respect Muslim scholars, and keep their company and listen to their advice. The young Saud then pledged to his father that he would loyally abide by his words.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/upbringing-education-1902-1915/213 Upbringing & Education 1902-1915] - The King Saud Foundation Website</ref>\n\nSaud's first political mission was at the age of thirteen, leading a delegation to Qatar. The first battle he fought was at Jirrab in 1915, followed by one at Yatab in the same year, then Trubah in 1919.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/the-battle-of-yatab-in-1918/222] - Yatab Battle - The Warrior</ref> In 1925, he stopped the Almahmal crisis in [[Makkah]]. He fought to stop the [[Ikhwan]] Revolt at Al Sebella in 1929.<ref>[http://kingsaud.org/history/the-warrior The Warrior] - The King Saud Foundation Website</ref>\n\nOn 11 May 1933, he was appointed [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Crown Prince]]   by his father.<ref name=geor>{{cite book |author=George Kheirallah |title=Arabia Reborn |date=1952 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |page=254 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/682471/arabia-reborn |accessdate=14 March 2015}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}</ref> The following year, Ibn Saud sent two military expeditions; one of them was led by Crown Prince Saud, who regained Najran and advanced secretly through the rugged mountains in the northwest part of Yemen.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/the-war-with-yemen/1336 The War with Yemen] - The King Saud Foundation Website</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the war with [[Yemen]], Ibn Saud decided to encourage Saud to travel abroad. Accompanied by his father's adviser, Fuad Hamzah and Physician Dr. Medhat Sheikh el-Ard and some others, he visited: [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]], [[Egypt]] and Europe where he represented his father at the [[Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth]] in 1937. Saud struck a warm friendship with the young King [[Ghazi of Iraq]] I, and earned plaudits from the Amir and later King [[Abdullah I of Jordan]] & Transjordan, who said to him: \"in his character, he represented the choicest and purest of the traits and attributes of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]\".\n\nWhen a crisis erupted between the neighboring [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf States]] of [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]], Saud also visited the former during December 1937 in order to help sort out their differences. This was followed by other visits to the until the eve of the [[Second World War]].\n\nAfter the war, when the establishment of a Jewish state in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] appeared to be imminent, and leaders of the various Arab States met at [[Inshas]] in [[Egypt]] during 1946 in order to review the situation under the Chairmanship of King [[Farouk of Egypt]], Saud was again selected by his father to represent him and his country, and participated in the adoption of the famous resolution that declared that: \"The Palestinian cause is the cause of all Arabs and not merely the Palestinians\". In 1947, Saud visited the United States and met with President [[Harry S. Truman]], and also met with leaders in Britain, France, and Italy, in order to acquaint the policymakers with his father's views and the unacceptability of the infringement of the rights of the Palestinians.\n\nFollowing Saud's visits, he concentrated on the first areas to be deemed in sore need of modernization and reform in view of increasing revenues and expenditures, these were the governance and handling the country's finances. After seeking advice and expert help from a number of friendly countries, primarily the USA, the [[Saudi riyal]] was linked to the [[United States Dollar]] and apart from structural, regulatory and procedural reforms within a revamped Ministry of Finance; a Central Bank under the name of the \"[[Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency]]\" (\"SAMA\") was established during 1952.\n\nIn keeping with universal practice, a proper annual state budget had first been issued during 1948 and following the establishment of the above central banking body, \"SAMA\", the third Saudi National Budget for the year 1952 complied with internationally observed standards. During this period, technical co-operation, primarily in the guise of the arrival of 35 experts during 1952 and aimed at generating planned economic growth within the Kingdom also received a major boost.\n\nApart from financial and administrative reforms, the report presented to Ibn Saud by Amir Saud, had commended the implementation of a whole range of vital infrastructural projects relating to the improvement of facilities for the Pilgrims, so important to the Kingdom from a religious and economic point of view, water supply, roads, broadcasting service, health, municipal affairs, port improvements, customs reorganization and higher education.\n\nPlans for the paved road between [[Jeddah]] and [[Mecca]] had been announced by Saud during the [[Hajj]] of 1947, and the project for bringing water from the nearby Wadi Fatimah to [[Jeddah]] was also inaugurated by him shortly during November 1947. The Hajj of 1369 AH / 1950 AD witnessed the establishment of the Makkah college that was later to be expanded and renamed [[Umm al-Qura University]].\n\nMany of these reforms, along with the complete reorganisation of the system of public administration, through the establishment or restructuring of new or existing ministries and departments, and conceived and recognised as the \"Crown Prince's Reforms\", issued from his Office by a Decree under his seal on 19 October 1952, were destined to be developed, built upon and some even implemented after the demise of Ibn Saud on 9 November 1953 and during Saud's reign as King. The traditional Consultative Council in Makkah, the \"[[Majlis-ash-Shura]]\" or [[Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia]] was expanded on 17 November 1952.\n\nEarlier, on 19 October 1953, Ibn Saud had also appointed Crown Prince Saud as [[Prime Minister]] for the first Saudi Cabinet. Before that, he appointed him as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and Internal Security Units on 25 August 1953. During this period, the [[Armed Forces of Saudi Arabia]], including the Air Force, were modernized on a large scale with American assistance. The Saudi Arabian Airlines fleet was also expanded by the purchase of four new 'Sky Masters' to primarily facilitate the transport of Pilgrims from their homes to the sites of pilgrimage and back, and also within the Kingdom. On 10 June 1953, Saud with the approval of his father also laid the foundation stone for the expansion and refurbishment of the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] in [[Medina]]. Earlier on, following a visit, he had recommended to Ibn Saud the need for the adoption of this step, which the latter had sanctioned.\n\n==Reign==\nSaud succeeded his father King Abdulaziz ibn Saud as King on 9 November 1953 upon the latter's death.<ref name=cralls62/><ref>{{cite web|last=van Eijk|first=Esther|title=Sharia and national law in Saudi Arabia|url=http://dare.uva.nl/document/221087#page=140|publisher=Leiden University|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> King Saud ascended the throne in a political climate very different from the time when his father Ibn Saud  established his Kingdom.\n\n===National policy===\nKing Saud had announced to the new Council of Ministers in his very first speech as King,<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/subarticle/new-ministries/1118] King Saud Website - History - The King</ref> that, while his father's reign was noted for military conquests, he intended his reign to be \"a war on poverty, ignorance, and disease with the equitable application of the dictates of the holy '[[Shariah]]' laws to all without exception, and the creation of a strong army\".\n \nIn order to cope adequately with the responsibilities of this challenge, and facilitate realistically the implementation of his programme he initially doubled the number of ministries to ten by adding the portfolios of Education, Agriculture, Health, Commerce and industry, plus two Directorates: Labour and Broadcasting and the Bureau of Public Inspection\" in 1955, to the existing ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Interior, Defence, and Communications.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/article/infrastructure/268] King Saud Website - The King - Infrastructure</ref> In 1953, the decision had already been taken to move the ministries, then located in [[Jeddah]], to [[Riyadh]], the country's official capital. This had called for the construction of suitable new buildings and the provision of adequate housing for employees. This was an ignition point for Riyadh's modernization and development. Saud's next brother and heir, Prince Faisal, was appointed Prime Minister while retaining his former portfolio of Foreign Minister.  A five years plan was started, as mentioned in King Saud's first cabinet speech in 1954.\n\nIn 1957, King Saud also founded 'King Saud University' in [[Riyadh]].\n\n===Foreign relations===\n[[File:1936 HRH Prince Saud being received by Snouck Hurgronje (right) at Leiden University 0.jpg|300px|thumb|Prince Saud being received by [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje|Snouck Hurgronje]] (right) at Leiden University in 1936]]\n[[File:NizamSaud.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Saud of Saudi Arabia|King Saud]] with '''[[Mir Osman Ali Khan]]'''(wearing white Turban) - the 7th [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (during his visit to the then [[Hyderabad State|Kingdom Hyderabad]])]]\n\nKing Saud played a role of utmost importance on the regional, Arab, Islamic and international political stages.<ref>[http://www.kingsaud.org/history/the-politician] - King Saud Website - The Politician</ref> He started his worldwide tours after finishing touring of his country's regions. He visited Arab and friendly countries for strategic and political purposes. He began his tour in 1954 in [[Egypt]], followed by [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Jordan]], [[Yemen]] and [[Pakistan]].\nHe announced that his sole purpose was to \"unify Muslims all over the world\" so they would be like one strong body. King Saud believed in a non-alignment policy between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which he discussed thoroughly with Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] during an official visit to [[India]]. He also strove to keep the region free from coalitions and blocs that only served foreign interests and thus he refused to join the [[Baghdad Pact]].\nDespite pressure exerted from the West, he approved upon meeting President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] in [[Cairo]] in March 1956 of making a joint statement regarding their understanding of security and defense matters, that coincided with other agreements in the financial, economical and development area.\n\nFor example, in November 1955, he granted a 16 million dollars loan to [[Syria]] for five years. He agreed to exchange products and exempt agricultural products from import-export license and custom duties. With the continuous Israeli assault on [[Jordan]] in 1955, King Saud invited military leaders of [[Egypt]], Syria, [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]] to [[Riyadh]] in order to discuss procedures to counter the aggression. He agreed to cover all expenses of reinforcing Jordan's National Guard and armed forces. He also supported the [[Algerian War|Algerian revolution]] against France, diplomatically and financially. King Saud made a statement inviting people to donate money for the revolution; the donations amounted to $1,200,000. The government donated one million dollars of that amount in 1956, and the rest of the donations were granted yearly. King Saud kept granting donations to Algeria and kept defending it until it established its independence in 1962.\nImam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] of [[Yemen]] joined the Arab endeavors to unify their ranks when he signed the joint defense agreement with Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. This event took place after the Imam's meeting with King Saud, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] on 21 April 1956, following the [[Jeddah]] Pact between Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\n\nMaintaining his support to the Arab countries after [[Suez Crisis|the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company]] on 26 July 1956, although the Egyptian Government did not consult him as it did with Syria in taking that decision contrary to his expectations as a military ally. He succeeds in strengthening his relation with King [[Faisal II of Iraq]] after a meeting held in [[Dammam]] on 20 September 1956. It was followed that same month and in the same place by a meeting with President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], during which he confirmed his total support for the Egyptian stand in this crisis. When Britain, France, and Israel invaded Egypt on 29 October 1956 as a result of the nationalization of the canal, King Saud declared a general mobilization and ordered the opening of enlistment offices.\nHe offered total assistance to the Egyptian government, personally supervising operations and welcoming Egyptian combat planes into his country for their protection. Among the first to enlist were Prince [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia]], Prince [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], Prince [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]], Prince [[Fahad bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]] along with many other princes.\nAs a means of exerting pressure on the British and French governments, he used a weapon never used before, when he blocked oil exports, banning all British and French tankers and other tankers carrying Saudi oil to these two countries. He also broke off relations with Britain and France.\n\nKing Saud had used this economic weapon for the first time although he was aware of the possible repercussions of such a procedure on the national economy. He sustained his support after the war so as to remove the aftermath of the aggression. He offered generous contributions, including 2 million Saudi riyals to the Egyptian [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescent]] to help victims of Port Said.\n\nKing Saud was still keen on keeping the region free of political and defense blocs that only support a superpower against another. Despite his solid relations with the American system, on which he relied in several areas because of the oil discovery and production, he seriously thought of canceling the American access for using Dhahran airport as a means of exerting pressure on the United States of America.\n\nDespite traditionally intimate ties of his country with the United States of America, and the ingrained alienation of communism and Islamic beliefs, he refused to join the American sponsored [[Baghdad Pact]] of 1955, (later on the Central Treaty Organisation \u2013 CENTO), \u2013 aimed at opposing the expansion of Communist influence in the region, despite the involvement of the fellow Arab State of Iraq in it, along with [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. [[Jordan]], which also was keen to join the Pact and [[Syria]] as well, had been discouraged from doing so with the aid of political and financial pressure.\n\nPresident of the United States [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] invited King Saud to undertake an official visit to the U.S. in 1957 since he believed that King Saud played a crucial role in implementing his doctrine of deterring and fighting communism in the Middle East and the Islamic countries. Once King Saud received the invitation he convened with Presidents [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] in [[Cairo]] in January 1957. The three leaders agreed to try to convince Eisenhower to pressure the Israeli government to evacuate occupied [[Sharm El Sheikh]] that overlooks the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and to withdraw to the borders of the previous truce on all frontiers.\n\nHe maintained his support to the countries at war with [[Israel]], and signed a ten-year agreement with the Egyptian and Syrian presidents and with King [[Hussein of Jordan]] to ease Jordan's financial burdens as a result of this conflict. The annual Egyptian and Saudi financial assistance added up to five million Egyptian pounds from each of the two countries.\nHe also discussed with the American President his dispute with Britain over the [[Al Buraymi Oasis]], an oil zone between the frontiers of Saudi Arabia, [[Oman]] and [[Abu Dhabi]] which was under British protection. The issue of the Al Buraymi oasis was one of the issues that had been raised since the reign of his father King Abdulaziz and was still pending. After several clashes, the case went to international arbitration. When he accepted the American president's invitation to the [[United States]] he received a good welcome, but the Mayor of New York, [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], refused to welcome the King because of his national and Islamic politics.<ref>J. Joseph Huthmacher, ''Senator Robert F. Wagner and the rise of urban liberalism'' (1968) pp 14-15</ref>\n\nKing Saud delivered an important speech during the banquet held by [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]], the Swedish UN Secretary-General in which he addressed the different aspects of the Arab complaints, in accordance with the UN charter and its powers. He invited all countries to value the charter and implement it in full; he also addressed the outcomes and repercussions of the [[Cold War]]. During his negotiations with the American president in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on 2 February 1957, the American President explained the principles and objectives of his [[doctrine]], known as the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], and the effective role that he expected of him as a powerful friend of the United States of America and as an eminent Arab and Muslim leader in fighting the communist movement invading the Middle East and the Islamic countries.\n\nWithin this scheme, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] offered a 25 million [[dollar]] loan to the Saudi Government on 24 January 1957. In return, King Saud explained that he had refused [[Soviet Union]] military aid to fight [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and that Britain's policy was what urged the Arabs to seek the [[Soviet Union]]'s help. He also stressed that non-aligned countries were benefiting from Soviet aid more than the American allied countries were benefiting from American aid. He considered that this aid should double if the American President wished to succeed in his endeavors. King Saud asked [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to exert pressure on [[Israel]] to withdraw from the occupied territories of Palestine and settle the Palestinian cause, and to convince [[France]] to reach a settlement regarding the independence of [[Algeria]]. On the other hand, he promised to inform the Arabs of the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]] and its purposes; and to inquire about the Arab reaction on the official and officious levels before making any commitments. King Saud explained to the American President that a large bulk of his country's budget was allocated to development projects and to the five-year plan and that he needed military aid before being able to play any role expected from him in fighting [[communism]]. The American government agreed to give him a 250 million dollar loan and all kinds of land, sea and air weaponry, and to train the Saudi army on how to use them.\n\nIn return, the American government was to be granted facilities to use [[Dhahran]] airport for five years, after which it would be returned with all its equipment to the Saudi Government in 1962.\n \nBefore briefing his Arab peers about the results of this visit and the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]], King Saud visited [[Spain]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Libya]] and informed them of these results. In February 1957 he met the leaders of [[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]] in [[Cairo]] and informed them of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s objectives. Under the influence of Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and the Syrian President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], King Saud, wanting to support a unanimous Arab stand, decided to back up the Egyptian and Syrian Presidents in their decision not contribute in the [[Eisenhower Doctrine]].\n\nWhen the Republic of Iraq decided to annex [[Kuwait]] in 1961 under [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], King Saud protested in international forums, declaring \"any action against [[Kuwait]] is an action against [[Saudi Arabia]]\".\n\n===Struggle with Faisal===\nA fierce struggle between Ibn Saud's most senior sons, Saud and [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]], erupted immediately after Ibn Saud's death. The increase in oil revenues did not solve the financial problem associated with Saudi Arab debt, estimated to have been $US200 million in 1953. In fact, this debt more than doubled by 1958, when it reached $US450 million. The [[Saudi Riyal]] lost half of its official value against the United States Dollar. Both [[ARAMCO]] and international banks declined Saudi's demand for credit. Saud suspended the few government projects he had initiated but continued his spending on luxurious palaces.<ref name=alrasheed02>Alrasheed M. (2002) A History of Saudi Arabia Cambridge University Press; pp. 108\u20139</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Saud was forced to delegate most of his executive powers to Faisal. Saud and Faisal fought an internal battle over the definition of political responsibilities and the division of government functions. Saud was often associated among other things with the plundering of oil revenues, luxurious palaces, and conspiracy inside and outside of Saudi Arabia while Faisal was associated with sobriety, piety, puritanism, thriftiness, and modernization.\n\nThe battle between the two brothers was fought over the role to be assigned to the Council of Ministers. Saud abolished the office of Prime Minister by royal decree, thus enforcing his position as King and ''de facto'' prime minister. Saud thought of himself as both King and prime minister whereas Faisal envisioned more powers being in his own hand as Crown Prince and deputy prime minister.<ref name=alrasheed02/>\n\n===Forced abdication===\nKing Saud's family members worried about Saud's profligacy and his inability to meet the challenge of Nasser's Egypt. Corruption and backwardness weakened the regime. [[Radio Cairo]]'s anti-Saudi broadcasting was finding a receptive audience.<ref>Quandt W.(1981) Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, The Brooking Institutions, p. 90</ref>\n\nKing Saud and Prince Faisal continued their power struggle until 1962 when Prince Faisal formed a cabinet in the absence of the King, who had gone abroad for medical treatment. Prince Faisal allied with [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|Prince Fahd]] and [[Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud|Prince Sultan]]. Prince Faisal's new government excluded the sons of Saud. He promised a ten-point reform that included the drafting of the basic law, the abolition of slavery and the establishment of a judicial council.\n\nUpon his return, King Saud rejected Prince Faisal's new arrangement and threatened to mobilize the Royal Guard against his brother. In response, Prince Faisal demanded King Saud make him regent and turn over all royal powers to him. In this, he had the crucial backing of the [[ulema]] (elite Islamic scholars), including a ''[[fatw\u0101|fatwa]]'' (edict) issued by the grand [[mufti]] of Saudi Arabia, a relative of Prince Faisal on his mother's side, calling on King Saud to accede to his brother's demands.<ref name=Wynbrandt>Wynbrandt, James, ''A Brief History of Saudi Arabia'', New York: Facts on File, Inc., 2004, p.{{nbsp}}225</ref>\n\nKing Saud refused, prompting Faisal to order the National Guard to surround Saud's palace. In March 1964 Saud finally relented and named Faisal regent with full executive powers, effectively reducing himself to a figurehead. In November, the ulema, cabinet and senior members of the ruling family forced Saud to abdicate altogether, and Faisal became king in his own right.<ref>Vassiliev, Alexei, ''The History of Saudi Arabia'', London, UK: Al Saqi Books, 1998, p.{{nbsp}}366-7</ref><ref name=\"EoO\">''King Faisal'', Encyclopedia of the Orient, http://lexicorient.com/e.o/faisal.htm, Retrieved 27 March 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Faysal Faisal] at Encyclopedia Britannica</ref>\n \nKing Saud was forced into exile in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], and then on to other European cities. In 1966, Saud was invited by [[Nasser]] to live in [[Egypt]]; another report claims that King Saud went to Egypt under refuge granted by Nasser and stayed there from 1965 to 1967. King Saud was also allowed to broadcast on Radio Cairo. Some of his sons, such as Prince Khalid, [[Badr bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Prince Badr]], Prince Sultan and Prince Mansur, joined him and supported his attempt to regain the throne. However, after the June 1967 [[Six-Day War|Arab-Israel War]], he lost the support of Egypt and settled in [[Greece]] until his death in 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kechichian|first=Joseph A.|title=Succession in Saudi Arabia|year=2001|publisher=Palgrave|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/successioninsaud00kech|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/successioninsaud00kech/page/9 9]|quote=succession in saudi arabia.|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Mashhoor bin Saud.jpg|125px|thumbnail|King Saud with his son [[Mashhoor bin Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud|Mashhoor]]]]\n[[File:JFKWHP-ST-39-2-62.jpg|125px|thumb|Daughter Dalal, between her father and  [[John F.

They had won the title the previous season. This meant they qualified for the first time in their history for the [[European Cup]].\n\n==Summary==\n\nForest opened the defence of their title with six draws in their first seven league matches. On 28 November the 1-0 win at [[Bolton Wanderers|Bolton]] set an undefeated record of 42 consecutive league games. The record stood for over two decades. [[Garry Birtles]] broke into the first team and ended up being the club's top scorer as they ended up as league runners-up, retained the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Along the way they knocked out holders [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and came from behind to oust West German champions [[F.C. Koln|Cologne]]. [[Trevor Francis]] became the first \u00a31,000,000 player when he signed for the Reds from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and immediately proved his worth by scoring the only goal of the European Cup final against [[Malm\u00f6 FF|Malm\u00f6]] in Munich. 26 year old [[Colin Barrett]] suffered a serious leg injury 10 days after scoring in the win against Liverpool. He only played seven further competitive games for Forest and 12 in his career.\n\n==Players==\n\n===Squad Stats===\n\nThe statistics for the following players are for their time during 1978-79 season playing for Nottingham Forest.

They had won the title the previous season. This meant they qualified for the first time in their history for the [[European Cup]].\n\n==Summary==\n\nForest opened the defence of their title with six draws in their first seven league matches. On 28 November the 1-0 win at [[Bolton Wanderers|Bolton]] set an undefeated record of 42 consecutive league games. The record stood for over two decades. [[Garry Birtles]] broke into the first team and ended up being the club's top scorer as they ended up as league runners-up, retained the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and won the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].

{"title_page": "List of foreign TT Pro League goalscorers", "text_new": "{{use Trinidadian English|date=August 2019}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{short description|wikimedia list article}}\n\nThis is a '''list of foreign goalscorers''' in the '''TT Pro League''' that began league play in 1999. The [[TT Pro League]] has been [[List of foreign TT Pro League players|represented by 28 FIFA affiliated nations in total]]. At the conclusion of the [[2015\u201316 TT Pro League|2015\u201316]] season, 21 different foreign FIFA affiliated nations have been represented in the Pro League score list. The following players must meet both of the following two criteria:\n# Have scored at least one [[TT Pro League]] goal. Players who were signed by Pro League clubs, but only scored in lower league, cup and/or international matches, or did not score in any competitive games at all, are not included.\n# Are considered foreign, i.e., outside [[Trinidad and Tobago]], if he is not eligible to play for the Trinidad and Tobago [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|national team]].\n\nMore specifically,\n* If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used. These include Trinidad and Tobago players with dual citizenship.\n* If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Trinidad and Tobago parents or moved to Trinidad and Tobago at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation.\n\nClubs listed are those for which the player has scored at least one Pro League goal. Players that have scored more than one Pro League goal have the number of goals that the player scored in the Pro League listed in parentheses.\n\n'''In bold:''' Players who have scored at least one Pro League goal in the current season ([[2015\u201316 TT Pro League|2015\u201316]]), and the clubs they've scored at least Pro League goal for. They include players who have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of a Pro League club who have not scored at least one Pro League goal in the current season.\n\n:''Details correct as of end of 2015\u201316 season. Next update will remove all players that have scored at least one Pro League goal from withdrawn teams and that have left their clubs from '''Bold''' status, and add newly admitted teams' players that scored at least one Pro League goal. This will be undertaken on the first day of the 2016\u201317 season in September 2016.''\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE UNTIL PLAYER SCORES AT LEAST ONE TT PRO LEAGUE GOAL DURING THE CURRENT SEASON as this causes problems in updating at the end of each season when updated in full. Place the player's name in bold and current team also in bold. Update the number of Pro League goals in parentheses as well.

began league play in 1999. The [[TT Pro League]] has been [[List of foreign TT Pro League players|represented by 28 FIFA affiliated nations in total]]. At the conclusion of the [[2015\u201316 TT Pro League|2015\u201316]] season, 21 different foreign FIFA affiliated nations have been represented in the Pro League score list. The following players must meet both of the following two criteria:\n# Have scored at least one [[TT Pro League]] goal. Players who were signed by Pro League clubs, but only scored in lower league, cup and/or international matches, or did not score in any competitive games at all, are not included.\n# Are considered foreign, i.e., outside [[Trinidad and Tobago]], if he is not eligible to play for the Trinidad and Tobago [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|national team]].\n\nMore specifically,\n* If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used. These include Trinidad and Tobago players with dual citizenship.\n* If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Trinidad and Tobago parents or moved to Trinidad and Tobago at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation.\n\nClubs listed are those for which the player has scored at least one Pro League goal. Players that have scored more than one Pro League goal have the number of goals that the player scored in the Pro League listed in parentheses.\n\n'''In bold:''' Players who have scored at least one Pro League goal in the current season ([[2015\u201316 TT Pro League|2015\u201316]]), and the clubs they've scored at least Pro League goal for. They include players who have subsequently left the club, but do not include current players of a Pro League club who have not scored at least one Pro League goal in the current season.\n\n:''Details correct as of end of 2015\u201316 season. Next update will remove all players that have scored at least one Pro League goal from withdrawn teams and that have left their clubs from '''Bold''' status, and add newly admitted teams' players that scored at least one Pro League goal. This will be undertaken on the first day of the 2016\u201317 season in September 2016.''\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT UPDATE UNTIL PLAYER SCORES AT LEAST ONE TT PRO LEAGUE GOAL DURING THE CURRENT SEASON as this causes problems in updating at the end of each season when updated in full. Place the player's name in bold and current team also in bold. Update the number of Pro League goals in parentheses as well.
