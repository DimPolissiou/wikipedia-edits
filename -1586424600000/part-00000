It was released as the third and final single from the album on April 16, 2001, by [[Maverick Records]]. Madonna and [[Guy Sigsworth]] wrote and produced the song with [[David Torn]] as co-writer, and [[Spike Stent|Mark \"Spike\" Stent]] as a co-producer. \"What It Feels Like For a Girl\" is a mid-tempo [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[synth-pop]] song, with filtered bass licks, tidal keys and pads as part of its instrumentation. Lyrically, it conveys society's [[double standard]] toward women, addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority. To emphasize the message, the song opens with a spoken word sample by actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] from the 1993 British film ''[[The Cement Garden (film)|The Cement Garden]]''. A Spanish version of the track, \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\", was translated by Alberto Ferreras and included in the Latin American edition of ''Music''.\n\nThe song received acclaim from most music critics, who declared it as a highlight from the album, while also remarking it as one of the most mature musical ventures of Madonna's career. Commercially, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" reached the top-ten of the record charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Romania, Spain, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number-one on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Madonna's then-husband [[Guy Ritchie]] and premiered on March 22, 2001. It features the singer as a reckless woman on a crime spree. The video was criticized for its depiction of violence and abuse, which caused [[MTV]] to ban it before 9:00 pm. The single was also released on [[DVD single|DVD]] and became the highest weekly sales for a DVD release in the United States. Madonna performed the track on the promotional concerts for ''Music''  in November 2000 and on her 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]], where a remixed version was used as a video interlude and also performed in Spanish. The song was covered by [[List of Glee characters|the actors]] of television series [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']], during the episode \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\", and was included in the [[Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna|accompanying EP]].\n\n==Background and development==\n[[File:Guy Sigsworth.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Guy Sigsworth]] (pictured in 2007), one of the main producers of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\".|alt=Guy Sigsworth holding a white tea-cup in his right hand and smiling down.]]\nAfter the critical and commercial success of her seventh studio album, ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998), Madonna had intended to embark on a concert tour in September 1999, but the tour was cancelled due to the delay of her film ''[[The Next Best Thing]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/512811/film-delay-blamed-for-madonna-tour-cancellation/|title=Film Delay Blamed For Madonna Tour Cancellation|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=March 15, 1999|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052013/http://www.mtv.com/news/512811/film-delay-blamed-for-madonna-tour-cancellation/|archivedate=December 22, 2017}}</ref> She released one-off singles like \"[[Beautiful Stranger]]\" (1999) and a cover of [[Don McLean]]'s \"[[American Pie (song)#Madonna version|American Pie]]\" (2000).<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Madonna&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Grammy Award Winners \u2013 Madonna|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111041645/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Madonna&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|archivedate=January 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|date=February 12, 2000|title=Spotlight: Madonna \"American Pie\"|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22|volume=112|issue=7|page=22|issn=0006-2510|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/madonna/2653|title=NME Track Reviews \u2013 American Pie|work=[[NME]]|date=February 26, 2000|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092920/http://www.nme.com/reviews/madonna/2653|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>  The singer also became pregnant with her son Rocco, from her relationship with director [[Guy Ritchie]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoffman|first1=Bill|title=Pregnancy is '2nd' nature for Madonna|url=https://nypost.com/2000/03/21/pregnancy-is-2nd-nature-for-madonna/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=November 2, 2018|date=March 21, 2000}}</ref>  Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]''.<ref name=\"obr1\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=338}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2000, it was announced that French musician [[Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef]] was creating a melding of dance and pop songs with a disco feel for the album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Madonna Taps French Musician Mirwais To Co-Produce Upcoming Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/821128/madonna-taps-french-musician-mirwais-to-co-produce-upcoming-album/|accessdate=July 12, 2014|publisher=MTV News|date=April 18, 2000|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715033528/http://www.mtv.com/news/821128/madonna-taps-french-musician-mirwais-to-co-produce-upcoming-album/|archivedate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Later, it was also announced that she enlisted [[Guy Sigsworth]] to work with her on the album.<ref name=\"billaugust\">{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=Barry|date=August 5, 2000|title=Madonna Offers Upbeat 'Music' on Maverick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|issn=0006-2510|accessdate=May 14, 2012|issue=32|volume=112|page=98}}</ref> The singer had followed Sigsworth's work, admired his love of understated technology in music, and contacted him for adding an [[ambient music|ambient]] feel to her record.

I don't think that we're better than men, but I believe there's an extra accommodating chromosome\", she told ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''{{'}}s [[Ingrid Sischy]].<ref name=Interview/> Madonna reflected on how her generation of women had been encouraged to be independent, be educated and take over any opportunity life bestowed upon them. But she had realized that being a smart and accomplished woman can come across as threat to men, thereby making them a casualty. Madonna questioned, \"Why didn't somebody tell me?

They pointed out the scene in which Madonna winks at three men at a traffic light just before crashing their car, as they felt that on this particular shot she was \"turning the tables of violence back on the men for whom such behavior is considered ''normal'' and putting them on the receiving end of violence, a position usually reserved for women\".<ref name=\"santiago\"/> They noticed that unlike previous Madonna videos which were banned for religious themes or sexuality, MTV found violence as an offence. Even using the remix in the clip changed the song's feminine and bittersweet nature to something faster and harder, adjectives usually reserved for boys.

It was released as the third and final single from the album on April 16, 2001, by [[Maverick Records]]. Madonna and [[Guy Sigsworth]] wrote and produced the song with [[David Torn]] as co-writer, and [[Spike Stent|Mark \"Spike\" Stent]] as a co-producer. \"What It Feels Like For a Girl\" is a mid-tempo [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[synth-pop]] song, with filtered bass licks, tidal keys and pads as part of its instrumentation. Lyrically, it conveys society's [[double standard]] toward women, addressing hurtful myths about female inferiority. To emphasize the message, the song opens with a spoken word sample by actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]] from the 1993 British film ''[[The Cement Garden (film)|The Cement Garden]]''. A Spanish version of the track, \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\", was translated by Alberto Ferreras and included in the Latin American edition of ''Music''.\n\nThe song received acclaim from most music critics, who declared it as a highlight from the album, while also remarking it as one of the most mature musical ventures of Madonna's career. Commercially, \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" reached the top-ten of the record charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Romania, Spain, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number-one on the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart.\n\nAn accompanying music video for the song was directed by Madonna's then-husband [[Guy Ritchie]] and premiered on March 22, 2001. It features the singer as a reckless woman on a crime spree. The video was criticized for its depiction of violence and abuse, which caused [[MTV]] to ban it before 9:00 pm. The single was also released on [[DVD single|DVD]] and became the highest weekly sales for a DVD release in the United States. Madonna performed the track on the promotional concerts for ''Music''  in November 2000 and on her 2001 [[Drowned World Tour]], where a remixed version was used as a video interlude and also performed in Spanish. The song was covered by [[List of Glee characters|the actors]] of television series [[Glee (TV series)|''Glee'']], during the episode \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\", and was included in the [[Glee: The Music, The Power of Madonna|accompanying EP]].\n\n==Background and development==\n[[File:Guy Sigsworth.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Guy Sigsworth]] (pictured in 2007), one of the main producers of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\".|alt=Guy Sigsworth holding a white tea-cup in his right hand and smiling down.]]\nAfter the critical and commercial success of her seventh studio album, ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998), Madonna had intended to embark on a concert tour in September 1999, but the tour was cancelled due to the delay of her film ''[[The Next Best Thing]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/512811/film-delay-blamed-for-madonna-tour-cancellation/|title=Film Delay Blamed For Madonna Tour Cancellation|last=Kaufman|first=Gil|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=March 15, 1999|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052013/http://www.mtv.com/news/512811/film-delay-blamed-for-madonna-tour-cancellation/|archivedate=December 22, 2017}}</ref> She released one-off singles like \"[[Beautiful Stranger]]\" (1999) and a cover of [[Don McLean]]'s \"[[American Pie (song)#Madonna version|American Pie]]\" (2000).<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Madonna&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|title=Grammy Award Winners \u2013 Madonna|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111041645/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&winner=Madonna&year=0&genreID=0&hp=1|archivedate=January 11, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Chuck|date=February 12, 2000|title=Spotlight: Madonna \"American Pie\"|journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Q0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22|volume=112|issue=7|page=22|issn=0006-2510|accessdate=December 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/madonna/2653|title=NME Track Reviews \u2013 American Pie|work=[[NME]]|date=February 26, 2000|accessdate=December 31, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092920/http://www.nme.com/reviews/madonna/2653|archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>  The singer also became pregnant with her son Rocco, from her relationship with director [[Guy Ritchie]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hoffman|first1=Bill|title=Pregnancy is '2nd' nature for Madonna|url=https://nypost.com/2000/03/21/pregnancy-is-2nd-nature-for-madonna/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=November 2, 2018|date=March 21, 2000}}</ref>  Wanting to distract herself from the media frenzy, Madonna concentrated on the development of her eighth studio album, ''[[Music (Madonna album)|Music]]''.<ref name=\"obr1\">{{harvnb|O'Brien|2008|p=338}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2000, it was announced that French musician [[Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef]] was creating a melding of dance and pop songs with a disco feel for the album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Madonna Taps French Musician Mirwais To Co-Produce Upcoming Album|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/821128/madonna-taps-french-musician-mirwais-to-co-produce-upcoming-album/|accessdate=July 12, 2014|publisher=MTV News|date=April 18, 2000|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715033528/http://www.mtv.com/news/821128/madonna-taps-french-musician-mirwais-to-co-produce-upcoming-album/|archivedate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Later, it was also announced that she enlisted [[Guy Sigsworth]] to work with her on the album.<ref name=\"billaugust\">{{cite journal|last=Walter|first=Barry|date=August 5, 2000|title=Madonna Offers Upbeat 'Music' on Maverick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|issn=0006-2510|accessdate=May 14, 2012|issue=32|volume=112|page=98}}</ref> The singer had followed Sigsworth's work, admired his love of understated technology in music, and contacted him for adding an [[ambient music|ambient]] feel to her record.

I don't think that we're better than men, but I believe there's an extra accommodating chromosome\", she told ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]''{{'}}s [[Ingrid Sischy]].<ref name=Interview/> Madonna reflected on how her generation of women had been encouraged to be independent, be educated and take over any opportunity life bestowed upon them. But she had realized that being a smart and accomplished woman can come across as threat to men, thereby making them a casualty. Madonna questioned, \"Why didn't somebody tell me?

They pointed out the scene in which Madonna winks at three men at a traffic light just before crashing their car, as they felt that on this particular shot she was \"turning the tables of violence back on the men for whom such behavior is considered ''normal'' and putting them on the receiving end of violence, a position usually reserved for women\".<ref name=\"santiago\"/> They noticed that unlike previous Madonna videos which were banned for religious themes or sexuality, MTV found violence as an offence. Even using the remix in the clip changed the song's feminine and bittersweet nature to something faster and harder, adjectives usually reserved for boys. The authors concluded that as always, Madonna inverted the traditional roles and characterization of male and female in the clip.<ref name=\"santiago\">{{harvnb|Fouz-Hern\u00e1ndez|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=31\u201333}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances and cover version==\n[[File:LoQueSionteLaMujerDionisio (cropped2).jpg|thumb|Madonna performing \"Lo Que Siente la Mujer\", the Spanish version of \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\",  during the [[Drowned World Tour]] (2001).|alt=Madonna in a black dress atop a sloping structure, with her dancers below.]]\n\"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" was performed on the promotional concerts for ''Music'' in November 2000 at New York City's [[Roseland Ballroom]] and at London's [[Brixton Academy]].<ref name=\"rose\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37|title=Madonna Celebrates 'Music's' Global Success At Roseland|last=Paoletta|first=Michael|date=November 18, 2000|accessdate=December 30, 2017|work=Billboard|issn=0006-2510|page=37|volume=112|issue=47}}</ref><ref name=\"nyc\">{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=Rob|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431543/madonna-shatters-record-mostviewed-webcast-producer.jhtml|title=Madonna Shatters Record For Most-Viewed Webcast, Producer Says|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=November 29, 2000|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}</ref> On New York, Madonna dedicated the song to singer Britney Spears, while wearing a tank top with Spears' name printed on it.<ref name=\"rose\"/><ref name=\"nyc\"/> For the London performance, she wore a different top imprinted with the names of son Rocco and daughter Lourdes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/dec/03/features.review37|title=Madonna gets them in|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda|date=December 3, 2000|accessdate=April 21, 2013|work=The Guardian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222225856/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/dec/03/features.review37|archivedate=February 22, 2014}}</ref> Around 3,000&nbsp;fans attended the concert in London, which was [[streaming media|streamed]] over the internet.
