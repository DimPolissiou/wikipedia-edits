According to \"''Houhanshu'' (the ''Book of the Later Han'', penned by a Chinese historian during the fifth century and considered an authoritative record of the Han history between 25 and 220), about 10, or at least five or six, diplomatic groups were dispatched annually by the Han court to Central Asia during this period to buy horses.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe horses have since captured the popular imagination of China, leading to horse carvings, breeding grounds in [[Gansu]], and up to 430,000 such horses in the cavalry during even the [[Tang dynasty]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Xiongnu ===\nFor decades prior the Han followed a policy of ''[[heqin]]'' (\u548c\u4eb2) sending tribute and princesses to marry the Xiongnu ''shanyu'' to maintain peace.

The Dayuan are also described as manufacturers and great lovers of wine.{{sfn|Watson|1993|pp=244\u201345}}\n\nDayuan was among one of the furthest western states to send envoys to the Han court. However unlike the other envoys, the ones from Dayuan did not conform to the proper Han rituals and behaved with great arrogance and self-assurance, believing they were too far away to be in any danger of invasion. Dayuan was also situated near the Xiongnu at this point, who were held in great respect for they had caused the [[Yuezhi]] much suffering. An envoy from the Xiongnu bearing the credentials of the [[Chanyu]] was provided with food and escort. In comparison, a Han envoy received no mounts he did not buy himself and no food unless he handed out silks and other goods. Han envoys also had a reputation for wealth in the west, thus they were charged exorbitant fees wherever they went, causing the Han no small amount of grief.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=244}} However the historian [[Sima Qian]] provides a different account:\n\n{{quotation|The envoys were all sons of poor families who handled the government gifts and goods that were entrusted to them as though they were private property and looked for opportunities to buy goods at a cheap price in the foreign countries and make a profit on their return to China. The men of the foreign lands soon became disgusted when they found that each of the Han envoys told some different story and, considering that the Han armies were too far away to worry about, refused to supply the envoys with food and provisions, making things very difficult for them. The Han envoys were soon reduced to a state of destitution and distress and, their tempers mounting, fell to quarrelling and even attacking each other.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=242}}|''[[Shiji]]''}}\n\nAmong the goods western envoys brought with them were the \"heavenly horses\", which the emperor took a liking to. He sent a trade mission with 1,000 pieces of gold and a golden horse to purchase these horses from Dayuan. Dayuan had at this point already been trading with the Han for quite some time and benefited greatly from it. Not only were they overflowing with eastern goods, they also learned from Han soldiers how to cast metal into coins and weapons. Thus they had no great reason to accept the Han trade offer, reasoning:\n\n{{quotation|The Han is far away from us and on several occasions has lost men in the salt-water wastes between our country and China. Yet if the Han parties go farther north, they will be harassed by the Xiongnu, while if they try to go south they will suffer from lack of water and fodder. Moreover, there are many places along the route where there are no cities whatsoever and they are apt to run out of provisions. The Han embassies that have come to us are made up of only a few hundred men, and yet they are always short of food and over half the men die on the journey. Under such circumstances how could the Han possibly send a large army against us? What have we to worry about? Furthermore, the horses of Ershi are one of the most valuable treasures of the state!{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=246}}|[[Dayuan]], ''[[Shiji]]''}}\n\nThe Han envoys cursed the men of Dayuan and smashed the golden horse they had brought. Enraged by this act of contempt, the nobles of Dayuan ordered Yucheng (modern [[Uzgen]]), which lay on their eastern borders, to attack and kill the envoys and seize their goods. Upon receiving word of the trade mission's demise, Emperor Wu decided to dispatch a punitive expedition against Dayuan. [[Li Guangli]], brother of Emperor Wu's favorite concubine, [[Lady Li]], was appointed Ershi General and sent against Dayuan with 6,000 cavalry and 20,000 young men drawn from the undesirables among the border kingdoms.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=246}}\n\n==First expedition (104 BC)==\nIn the autumn of 104 BC, Li Guangli set out with an army of 6,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. While crossing the [[Tarim Basin]] and the [[Taklamakan Desert]] (of modern [[Xinjiang]]), Li's army was forced to attack the nearby oasis states because they refused to provide them with supplies. Sometimes they were unable to overcome the oasis states. If the siege lasted for more than a few days, the army moved on without any supplies. Due to these numerous petty conflicts, the army became exhausted and was reduced to starvation after their supplies ran out. By the time they neared Dayuan, Li had already lost too much manpower to continue the campaign. After suffering a defeat at Yucheng, Li concluded that their current strength would not be sufficient to take the Dayuan capital, Ershi ([[Khujand]]), and therefore returned to [[Dunhuang]].{{sfn|Peers|1995|p=8}}\n\n==Second expedition (102 BC)==\nThe court officials wanted to disband Li's expeditionary army and concentrate their resources toward fighting the Xiongnu. Emperor Wu refused out of fear that failure to subdue Dayuan would result in a loss of prestige with the western states. He responded by giving Li a much larger army as well as supply animals. In the autumn of 102 BC, Li set out with an army of 60,000 recruits from the prison population and 30,000 horses along with a large number of supply animals including 100,000 oxen and 20,000 donkeys and camels. This time the expedition had no problem dealing with the oasis states.{{sfn|Peers|1995|p=8}}{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=164}}\n\nMost of them simply surrendered without a fight upon seeing the overwhelming display of power. The only state that put up any resistance was [[Luntai]], for which Li had its populace massacred. Despite meeting no major setbacks and bypassing Yucheng entirely, Li still lost half his army by the time they reached Dayuan.{{sfn|Peers|1995|p=8}} Upon arriving at Ershi, Li immediately laid siege to it. A force of [[Wusun]] cavalry 2,000 strong was also present at the request of Emperor Wu, but they refused to take part in the siege out of fear of offending either parties. Dayuan's forces sallied out in an attempt to break the siege, but they were easily defeated by Han crossbowmen. Han engineers set to work on the river passing through Ershi and diverted it, leaving the city with no source of water as they had no wells. After a 40-day siege, the Han broke through the outer wall and captured the enemy general, Jianmi. The nobles of Ershi withdrew to the inner walls and decided to offer terms of surrender. First they killed their king, Wugua, and sent his head to Li. Then they offered Li all the horses he wanted as well as supplies in return for the army's withdrawal, but if he did not accept, they would kill all their horses. Li agreed to the terms, taking some 3,000 horses as well as provisions. Before departing, Li enthroned as king one of the nobles called Meicai (\u6627\u8521), since he had previously shown kindness to the Han envoys.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\nAs Li set out for Dunhuang, he realized that the local areas along the way would not be able to adequately supply the army. The army separated into several groups, some taking the northern route while others the southern route. One of these groups, comprising only 1,000 or so men under the command of [[Wang Shensheng]] and [[Hu Chongguo]], tried to take Yucheng. After several days under siege, the inhabitants of Yucheng sallied out with 3,000 men and defeated the besieging army. A few of the Han soldiers managed to escape and alert Li of the defeat. Thereupon, Li dispatched [[Shangguan Jie]] to attack Yucheng. Seeing the great host sent against him, the king of Yucheng decided to flee to [[Kangju]], causing Yucheng to surrender shortly thereafter. When Kangju received news of Dayuan's defeat, they handed the king of Yucheng over to Shangguan, who had him executed.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\nThe army met no further opposition on the way back to [[Yumen Pass]]. Having heard of Dayuan's defeat, the rulers of the oasis states sent their kin along with the army back to the Han capital, where they presented tribute to Emperor Wu. They remained at the Han court as hostages. Despite the overall success of the second expedition, having adequate supplies and losing only a small portion of the army in battle, the entire campaign was marred by corruption and self interest. Li's soldiers, being taken from the prison population and undesirable class, were given very little care by their generals and officers, who instead abused them by withholding rations, causing desertion. As a result, Li returned with just 10,000 men and 1,000 horses fit for military service. Even so, Emperor Wu still considered these to be acceptable losses in the victory over Dayuan, and made no attempts to punish those who were responsible. Those who had survived were given handsome rewards. Li Guangli was enfeoffed as Marquis of [[Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Haixi]]. [[Zhao Di]], who secured the capture of the king of Yucheng, became Marquis of [[Xinzhi]]. Shangguan Jie became privy treasurer.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nMore than a year later, the nobles of Dayuan banded together and killed King Meicai, who they considered responsible for the entire affair with the Han in the first place. Wugua's brother, Chanfeng, became the new king. Not wishing to upset the Han, Chanfeng sent his son as hostage to the Han court. In response, the Han dispatched envoys with gifts for the new ruler and made peace with Dayuan.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=252}}\n\nTen years later, Li Guangli was defeated by the Xiongnu and defected to their side. He married the [[Chanyu]]'s daughter but was eventually executed over a conflict with another Han defector more favored by the Chanyu.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lin Jianming (\u6797\u5251\u9e23) |title=\u79e6\u6f22\u53f2 |trans-title=History of Qin and Han |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqfrEY8UW1UC&pg=PA557 |year=1992 |publisher=Wunan Publishing |isbn=978-957-11-0574-1 |pages=557\u2013578}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{citation|last=Peers|first=C.

One of these groups, comprising only 1,000 or so men under the command of [[Wang Shensheng]] and [[Hu Chongguo]], tried to take Yucheng. After several days under siege, the inhabitants of Yucheng sallied out with 3,000 men and defeated the besieging army. A few of the Han soldiers managed to escape and alert Li of the defeat. Thereupon, Li dispatched [[Shangguan Jie]] to attack Yucheng. Seeing the great host sent against him, the king of Yucheng decided to flee to [[Kangju]], causing Yucheng to surrender shortly thereafter. When Kangju received news of Dayuan's defeat, they handed the king of Yucheng over to Shangguan, who had him executed.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\nThe army met no further opposition on the way back to [[Yumen Pass]]. Having heard of Dayuan's defeat, the rulers of the oasis states sent their kin along with the army back to the Han capital, where they presented tribute to Emperor Wu. They remained at the Han court as hostages. Despite the overall success of the second expedition, having adequate supplies and losing only a small portion of the army in battle, the entire campaign was marred by corruption and self interest. Li's soldiers, being taken from the prison population and undesirable class, were given very little care by their generals and officers, who instead abused them by withholding rations, causing desertion. As a result, Li returned with just 10,000 men and 1,000 horses fit for military service. Even so, Emperor Wu still considered these to be acceptable losses in the victory over Dayuan, and made no attempts to punish those who were responsible. Those who had survived were given handsome rewards. Li Guangli was enfeoffed as Marquis of [[Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Haixi]]. [[Zhao Di]], who secured the capture of the king of Yucheng, became Marquis of [[Xinzhi]]. Shangguan Jie became privy treasurer.{{sfn|Whiting|2002|p=165}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nMore than a year later, the nobles of Dayuan banded together and killed King Meicai, who they considered responsible for the entire affair with the Han in the first place. Wugua's brother, Chanfeng, became the new king. Not wishing to upset the Han, Chanfeng sent his son as hostage to the Han court. In response, the Han dispatched envoys with gifts for the new ruler and made peace with Dayuan.{{sfn|Watson|1993|p=252}}\n\nTen years later, Li Guangli was defeated by the Xiongnu and defected to their side. He married the [[Chanyu]]'s daughter but was eventually executed over a conflict with another Han defector more favored by the Chanyu.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lin Jianming (\u6797\u5251\u9e23) |title=\u79e6\u6f22\u53f2 |trans-title=History of Qin and Han |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqfrEY8UW1UC&pg=PA557 |year=1992 |publisher=Wunan Publishing |isbn=978-957-11-0574-1 |pages=557\u2013578}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n*{{citation|last=Peers|first=C.

Here he worked on [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], bringing a new approach to physical chemistry. With [[Arthur Milne]], a comrade during the war, he wrote a seminal work on stellar spectra, temperatures, and pressures. In 1925 he was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"frs\"/> He became research supervisor to [[Paul Dirac]] and, in 1926, worked with him on the statistical mechanics of [[white dwarf]] stars. In 1928 he published (with [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Lothar Nordheim]]) a seminal paper that explained the physical phenomenon now known as [[field electron emission]], and helped to establish the validity of modern electron band theory. In 1931, he was the first to formulate and label the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]].<ref name=Cengel>Y. Cengel, M. Boles, ''Thermodynamics - An Engineering Approach'' 5th ed.</ref> In 1932 he was elected to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].\n\nIn 1939, when [[World War II]] began, he resumed his work with the Ordnance Board, despite poor health, and was chosen for scientific liaison with Canada and the United States. He knew America well, having visiting professorships at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. For this liaison work he was knighted in 1942 (see [[MAUD Committee]]).

Here he worked on [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], bringing a new approach to physical chemistry. With [[Arthur Milne]], a comrade during the war, he wrote a seminal work on stellar spectra, temperatures, and pressures. In 1925 he was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]].<ref name=\"frs\"/> He became research supervisor to [[Paul Dirac]] and, in 1926, worked with him on the statistical mechanics of [[white dwarf]] stars. In 1928 he published (with [[Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim|Lothar Nordheim]]) a seminal paper that explained the physical phenomenon now known as [[field electron emission]], and helped to establish the validity of modern electron band theory. In 1931, he was the first to formulate and label the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]].<ref name=Cengel>Y. Cengel, M. Boles, ''Thermodynamics - An Engineering Approach'' 5th ed.</ref> In 1932 he was elected to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].\n\nIn 1939, when [[World War II]] began, he resumed his work with the Ordnance Board, despite poor health, and was chosen for scientific liaison with Canada and the United States. He knew America well, having visiting professorships at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]]. For this liaison work he was knighted in 1942 (see [[MAUD Committee]]). He returned to Britain later in the war and worked for the Ordnance Board and the Admiralty up until a few weeks before his death in 1944.\n\nFifteen Fellows of the Royal Society and three Nobel Laureates (Chandrasekhar, Dirac, and Mott) were supervised by Fowler between 1922 and 1939.

Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more [[lipophilic]] molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]]. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer\u2013Overton correlation than chloral had.

In 1875, [[Claude Bernard]] tried to determine if chloral hydrate exerted its action through a metabolic conversion to [[chloroform]]. This was not only the first attempt to determine whether different drugs were converted to the same [[metabolite]] in the body but also the first to measure the concentration of a particular pharmaceutical in the blood. The results were inconclusive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alston|first=Theodore A.|date=July 2016|title=Noteworthy Chemistry of Chloroform|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=3|pages=85\u201388|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2016.04.008|pmid=27480474|issn=2352-4529}}</ref> In 1899 and 1901 [[Hans Horst Meyer]] and [[Ernest Overton]] respectively made the major discovery that the [[Theories of general anaesthetic action|general anaesthetic action]] of a drug was strongly correlated to its [[lipid]] [[solubility]]. However, chloral hydrate was quite polar but nonetheless a potent hypnotic. Overton was unable to explain this mystery. Thus, chloral hydrate remained one of the major and persistent exceptions to this breakthrough discovery in pharmacology. This anomaly was eventually resolved in 1948, when Claude Bernard's experiment was repeated. While chloral hydrate was converted to a different metabolite than chloroform, it was found that was converted into the more [[lipophilic]] molecule [[2,2,2-Trichloroethanol]]. This metabolite fit much better with the Meyer\u2013Overton correlation than chloral had. Prior to this, it had not been demonstrated that general anesthetics could undergo chemical changes to exert their action in the body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krasowski|first=Matthew D.|title=Contradicting a Unitary Theory of General Anesthetic Action: a History of Three Compounds from 1901 to 2001|journal=Bulletin of Anesthesia History|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=1\u201324|doi=10.1016/s1522-8649(03)50031-2|pmid=17494361|pmc=2701367|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nFinally, chloral hydrate was also the first hypnotic to be used [[intravenous injection|intravenously]] as a general anesthetic. In 1871, [[Pierre-Cyprien Or\u00e9]] began experiments on animals, followed by humans. While a state of general anesthesia could be achieved, the technique never caught on because its administration was more complex and less safe than the oral administration of chloral hydrate, and less safe for intravenous use than later general anesthetics were found to be.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Matthew|last2=Jagdish|first2=S.|date=January 2016|title=A History of Intravenous Anesthesia in War (1656\u20131988)|url=http://www.anesthesiahistoryjournal.org/article/S2352-4529(15)00084-5/fulltext|journal=Journal of Anesthesia History|language=English|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13\u201321|doi=10.1016/j.janh.2015.10.007|pmid=26898141|issn=2352-4529}}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\nChloral hydrate was used as one of the earliest synthetic drugs to treat [[insomnia]] until 1912, when [[phenobarbital]] replaced it and made its use unnecessary.\n\nIn 1897, [[Bram Stoker]]'s [[epistolary novel]] ''[[Dracula]]'', one of its characters, Doctor [[John Seward]], recorded his use and his [[molecular formula]] in his [[phonograph]]ic [[diary]]:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot but think of Lucy, and how different things might have been.
