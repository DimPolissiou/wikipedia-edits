Other than that there is little [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] difference between slugs and snails. There are however important differences in habitats and behavior.\n\nA shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible, so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space, retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail. Slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs, logs or wooden boards lying on the ground. In such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation. Those are often suitable places for laying their eggs.\n\nSlugs as a group are far from [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]; scientifically speaking \"slug\" is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance. The reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods. The various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species; such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another.\n\n==Human relevance==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Snail-wiki-120-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|''Cornu aspersum'' \u2013 garden snail]]\nLand snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household [[pet]]s.\n\n===In agriculture===\nThere are a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated [[garlic]] or [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]] solutions. [[Copper]] metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. A layer of a dry, finely ground, and scratchy substance such as [[diatomaceous earth]] can also deter snails.<ref>Sanders, April. [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/egg-shells-stop-snails-eating-plants-87576.html \"Do Egg Shells Help Stop Snails From Eating Plants?\"] Home Guides | [[SF Gate]]. Accessed 01 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe [[decollate snail]] (''Rumina decollata'') will capture and eat garden snails, and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a [[biological pest control]] agent. However, this is not without problems, as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region.\n\n===As food===\n{{Main article|Heliciculture}}\n\n[[File:Cooked snails.JPG|thumb|right|[[Escargot|French cooked snails]]]]\nIn [[French cuisine]], edible snails are served for instance in ''[[Escargot]] \u00e0 la [[Burgundy|Bourguignonne]]''. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as [[heliciculture]]. For purposes of cultivation, the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. [[Coppiced]] wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, the snails come out of [[Land_snail#Hibernation_and_estivation|hibernation]] and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. The snails are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy and tender. \n\nAs well as being relished as gourmet food, several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of [[Protein_(nutrient)|protein]] to many people in poor communities around the world. Many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in [[banana plantations]]. In some countries, [[Giant African land snail|giant African land snails]] are produced commercially for food.\n\nLand snails, freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in many  countries. In certain parts of the world, snails are fried as for example, in [[Indonesia]], they are fried as [[satay]], a dish known as ''[[sate kakul]]''. The eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way [[caviar]] is eaten.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder. Before they are used for those dishes, however, they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells. The two species most commonly used for food in the country are ''[[Helix lucorum]]'' and ''[[Helix pomatia]]''.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Famine food====\nSnails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as [[famine food]] in historical times.

Other than that there is little [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] difference between slugs and snails. There are however important differences in habitats and behavior.\n\nA shell-less animal is much more maneuverable and compressible, so even quite large land slugs can take advantage of habitats or retreats with very little space, retreats that would be inaccessible to a similar-sized snail. Slugs squeeze themselves into confined spaces such as under loose bark on trees or under stone slabs, logs or wooden boards lying on the ground. In such retreats they are in less danger from either predators or desiccation. Those are often suitable places for laying their eggs.\n\nSlugs as a group are far from [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]; scientifically speaking \"slug\" is a term of convenience with little taxonomic significance. The reduction or loss of the shell has evolved many times independently within several very different lineages of gastropods. The various taxa of land and sea gastropods with slug morphology occur within numerous higher taxonomic groups of shelled species; such independent slug taxa are not in general closely related to one another.\n\n==Human relevance==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Snail-wiki-120-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|''Cornu aspersum'' \u2013 garden snail]]\nLand snails are known as an agricultural and garden pest but some species are an edible delicacy and occasionally household [[pet]]s.\n\n===In agriculture===\nThere are a variety of snail-control measures that gardeners and farmers use in an attempt to reduce damage to valuable plants. Traditional pesticides are still used, as are many less toxic control options such as concentrated [[garlic]] or [[Artemisia (plant)|wormwood]] solutions. [[Copper]] metal is also a snail repellent, and thus a copper band around the trunk of a tree will prevent snails from climbing up and reaching the foliage and fruit. A layer of a dry, finely ground, and scratchy substance such as [[diatomaceous earth]] can also deter snails.<ref>Sanders, April. [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/egg-shells-stop-snails-eating-plants-87576.html \"Do Egg Shells Help Stop Snails From Eating Plants?\"] Home Guides | [[SF Gate]]. Accessed 01 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe [[decollate snail]] (''Rumina decollata'') will capture and eat garden snails, and because of this it has sometimes been introduced as a [[biological pest control]] agent. However, this is not without problems, as the decollate snail is just as likely to attack and devour other gastropods that may represent a valuable part of the native fauna of the region.\n\n===As food===\n{{Main article|Heliciculture}}\n\n[[File:Cooked snails.JPG|thumb|right|[[Escargot|French cooked snails]]]]\nIn [[French cuisine]], edible snails are served for instance in ''[[Escargot]] \u00e0 la [[Burgundy|Bourguignonne]]''. The practice of rearing snails for food is known as [[heliciculture]]. For purposes of cultivation, the snails are kept in a dark place in a wired cage with dry straw or dry wood. [[Coppiced]] wine-grape vines are often used for this purpose. During the rainy period, the snails come out of [[Land_snail#Hibernation_and_estivation|hibernation]] and release most of their mucus onto the dry wood/straw. The snails are then prepared for cooking. Their texture when cooked is slightly chewy and tender. \n\nAs well as being relished as gourmet food, several species of land snails provide an easily harvested source of [[Protein_(nutrient)|protein]] to many people in poor communities around the world. Many land snails are valuable because they can feed on a wide range of agricultural wastes, such as shed leaves in [[banana plantations]]. In some countries, [[Giant African land snail|giant African land snails]] are produced commercially for food.\n\nLand snails, freshwater snails and sea snails are all eaten in many  countries. In certain parts of the world, snails are fried as for example, in [[Indonesia]], they are fried as [[satay]], a dish known as ''[[sate kakul]]''. The eggs of certain snail species are eaten in a fashion similar to the way [[caviar]] is eaten.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], snails are traditionally cooked in an oven with rice or fried in a pan with vegetable oil and red paprika powder. Before they are used for those dishes, however, they are thoroughly boiled in hot water (for up to 90 minutes) and manually extracted from their shells. The two species most commonly used for food in the country are ''[[Helix lucorum]]'' and ''[[Helix pomatia]]''.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n====Famine food====\nSnails and slug species that are not normally eaten in certain areas have occasionally been used as [[famine food]] in historical times. A history of Scotland written in the 1800s recounts a description of various snails and their use as food items in times of plague.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chambers |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802) |year=1858|title=Domestic annals of Scotland, from the reformation to the revolution |publisher=[[Chambers Harrap|W. & R.

Great-grandparents, Gottlob and Mary (Summ) Mast and Fredrick and Catherine (Claus) Mezger from Wurttemberg Germany set up farming operations in Zamora. Gottlob and Mary settled in Hungry Hollow in 1868. When the grain came up high on Gottlob's leg while riding his horse, he knew this was where he wanted to bring his family.<ref>Mast family</ref>\n\nFarmers Grain Elevator was established in 1937 by Thomas Mezger. His great-grandparents Fredrick and Catherine (Claus) Mezger, originally from Wurttemberg Germany, moved in 1870 to a 160-acre homestead approximately 3 miles southwest of Black's Station.  Originally serving as a scale house, Farmers Grain Elevator eventually became a storage facility and grain purchasing center for local growers. As customer demands grew, Farmers Grain Elevator saw the need to provide quality transportation services for the grower\u2019s harvested crop and in 1971 established Mezger Trucking, Inc. For over 70 years, Farmers Grain Elevator has specialized in the carriage and distribution to market of wheat, corn, barley, safflower and various other agricultural products. Since its inception Farmers Grain Elevator has remained a family business. It is currently co-owned and operated by Dan and Mark Mezger.<ref>farmersgrainelevator.com</ref>\n\nAlex and Marlene Long own Zamora Mini-mart on Highway 99 at the Interstate 5 Zamora exit which includes a gas station and small store. For most visitors to Zamora, this is the only place they visit.\n\nThe Bariani Olive Oil Co. built a processing plant west of Zamora, and of this the ''Sacramento Business Journal'' reported on October 2, 2004:[http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/10/25/tidbits1.html] The {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel in Yolo County is big enough for 18,000 olive trees and a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building.\n\n==History==\nThe first known inhabitants were Native Americans of the Patwin (or Southern Wintun) tribe. Using bows and arrows, spears or snares, Patwins stalked the abundant turtles, deer, tule elk, antelope and the occasional bear, mountain lion or wild cat that came down from the foothills and Coast Range. Using bow and arrow or nets they hunted ducks, geese and swans as they came into the tule marshlands during migrations.\nSpanish explorers explored the area in the early 1800s and, as a result, thousands of Patwins died from ill-treatment or previously unknown diseases. Patwins were also rounded up and taken as slaves to build Mission churches and work the mission ranches.\nBetween 1829 and 1846, hunters and fur trappers from Santa Fe, New Mexico and from Hudson's Bay Company in Fort Vancouver sometimes traded with Patwin resulting in heavy losses of life for the trappers and hunters and for Patwin.\nThe 1849 California gold rush miners brought more violence and disease.\n\nThe first wave of European settlers included: in 1852 John and Michael Bemmerly, Elias Harley, Edmund Burger; in 1853 Elias Harley and Martin Rahm, they ran out previous settlers who were there 3 years earlier they went by Ramirez and Zamora; in 1854 Silas Barnes and Henry Gaddis; in the late 1850s David Hershey, Theodore Weyand, Cary LeDue, Fred Schlieman and John Wolfrom; in the 1860s James J Black, Ephraim Crites, Gustave Anderson, John Huber, Thomas W Long, James Root, John Walker. Many gained their property through 1862 Homestead act which promised 160-acre tract of public land to the head of a family after the land had been cleared, improved and occupied for 5 years.\nSome of the Zamora Districtwas once part of Rancho de Hardy-Rio de Jesus Maria Rancho, granted to Thomas Hardy by Governor Micheltorena on October 23, 1843. In 1870, Circuit Court decided in favor of \"Landowner's League upon the Hardy Grant\", an organization of local landholders.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\nMany towns sprang up in Yolo County between 1868 and 1888, including Zamora [https://web.archive.org/web/20060818063447/http://www.yolo.net/ychm/historyc.html], which was previously known as Black's. Black's was on the railroad and was the pioneer home of J. J. Black, who located there in 1865.In 1875, the Northern Railway Company began extending the railroad from Woodland to Red Bluff. When it reached Black's farm he donated a strip of land 100 feet wide by 3150 feet long acres for depot and grounds and the station was the result. Rights of way were sold for $10 to the railroad company by Silas Barnes, Henry Hoffman, Jacob Cunningham, Albion T. Robinson, Henry M. Cassilis and H.O. Dresser. .<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\nFour blocks were laid out with 16 lots of 30x120 feet per block. On September 18, 1875, C. H. Smart purchased 3 lots from Mr Black for $200 and became the first resident thereof, constructing for his use a dwelling house and a blacksmith shop at the corner of First and Main Streets. William Dorgan purchased 3 lots on March 9. 1876. Gustav Anderson bought 4 lots on April 15, 1876. Robert Huston and his brother Edward bought one lot and established the first store in 1876. The plan for the town of Black's Station (10.8 acres) was filed in 1877.<ref name=\"cagenweb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cagenweb.com/yolo/yolplnm4.htm#Z|title=Yolo County Place Names of the Past and Present( S thru Z )|first=Peggy B. and Patrick|last=Perazzo|website=www.cagenweb.com|access-date=2006-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815134711/http://www.cagenweb.com/yolo/yolplnm4.htm#Z|archive-date=2006-08-15|url-status=live}}</ref>  A. C. Turner started the first hotel, and Thomas and Hunt erected the first grain warehouse. Among other builders were D. N. Hershey, Ed Huston, George Glascock and John Wolff. Black's Station from the first was an important shipping station, the great farms in the vicinity sending in their harvests to this point for transportation to market. The coming of the Yolo County Consolidated Water Company's system in 1903 to Black's added much to the importance of the place and stimulated business. The new packing plant was finished that year, making the station a fruit center.<ref>{{History of Yolo County|58}}</ref>  In 1906 the name was changed to Zamora. According to a 1920 Yolo County map, Zamora was in the Black's District.<ref name=\"cagenweb.com\"/>\n\nA post office opened in Prairie in 1857, changed its name to Black's Station in 1876, and to Zamora in 1915.<ref name=CGN /> Prairie Post office was opened on March 19, 1857 at Weyand's Corner where a rural hotel, general store and stage stop were run at the ranch of Theodore Weyand, located at County Road 97 and County Road 13. Mr. Weyand was the first postmaster. Mail was delivered by stagecoach from Sacramento. Mr John Wolfrom served 8 years as postmaster when the post office was at his home just north of Weyand's which also served as rural hotel, general store and stage stop. Prairie Post Office altewrnated between Weyand's and Wolfrom's, serving the area until establishment of Black's Station Post Office in 1876.\nRobert M Huston was appointed postmaster December 4, 1876; Edward S Howard in 1882; William B. Black in 1888; Mason C. Gorton in 1898; Silas P. Cutler in 1903. The post office was located in the residence or business establishment of the postmaster until it was moved to a new hotel. On March 8, 1915, it became Zamora Post Office. Charles E Thomas was appointed postmaster in 1922. The hotel burned and Zamora Post office moved to the IOOF building where Carey L Croll became postmistress in 1924. It mioved to the home of Minnie Croll in 1932 when she was appointed Postmistress. In 1957, Zamora Post Office returned to the IOOF building with Ruth Anderson as postmistress. in 1969, the post office moved to a new IOOF building. Janice Croll became postmistress in 1978.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\n==Zamora soils==\n\nThe town lends its name to a type of soil which is classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as \"a member of the fine-silty, mixed, thermic family of Mollic Haploxeralfs. Typically, Zamora soils have grayish brown, slightly acid loam A horizons; brown silty clay loam, neutral Bt horizons; and yellowish brown C horizons.\" They are found \"Along the west side of the Sacramento Valley in central California and other parts of California\" and are \"used for growing orchards, row, field, and truck crops. Native vegetation is annual grasses and [[forb]]s and widely spaced oaks.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517202358/http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/Z/ZAMORA.html]\n\nNative plants included Valley Oaks whose ground acorns provided flour for the Patwin, wild oats, sunflower, clover, manzanita, blackberries, wild grapes.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\nHistorically, grain crops were the only source of crop. Farmers in Zamora have had to cope with unpredictable years of drought and years of heavy rains. In the 1930s, the development of turbine pumps resulted in the ability of farmers to pump enough water for irrigation. This resulted in the ability for more diversified crops, including row crops, orchards, grapes, alfalfa and others.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{gnis|1660224}}\n\n{{Yolo County, California}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in California]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Yolo County, California]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in the Sacramento metropolitan area]]\n", "text_old": "{{coord|38|47|48|N|121|52|55|W|display=title}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!--See the Table at Infobox Settlement for all fields and descriptions of usage-->\n<!-- Basic info  ---------------->\n|name          = Zamora\n|other_name             =\n|native_name            =  \n|nickname               = \n|settlement_type        =[[Unincorporated area|Unincorporated community]]\n|image_skyline          = \n|imagesize              = \n|image_caption          = \n|pushpin_map            =California#USA\n|pushpin_label_position =bottom\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location in California\n|pushpin_image=California Locator Map with US.PNG\n<!-- Location ------------------>\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       =[[United States]]\n|subdivision_type1      = State\n|subdivision_name1      = [[California]]\n|subdivision_type2      =County\n|subdivision_name2      = [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]]\n|subdivision_type3      =\n|subdivision_name3      = \n|<!-- Politics ----------------->\n|established_title      =  <!-- Settled -->\n|established_date       = \n|coordinates            = {{coord|38|47|48|N|121|52|55|W|region:US-CA|display=inline}}\n|elevation_footnotes    =  <ref>{{gnis|1660224}}</ref>\n|elevation_m            =16\n|elevation_ft           =52\n|footnotes              = \n}}'''Zamora''' (formerly, '''Black's''', '''Blacks''', '''Black's Station''', '''Blacks Station''',<ref>All {{gnis|1660224}}</ref> and '''Prairie'''<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|580}}</ref>) is an unincorporated community in rural [[Yolo County]], [[California]], [[United States|U.S.]], on [[Interstate 5]] due west of [[Knights Landing, California|Knights Landing]].

Great-grandparents, Gottlob and Mary (Summ) Mast and Fredrick and Catherine (Claus) Mezger from Wurttemberg Germany set up farming operations in Zamora. Gottlob and Mary settled in Hungry Hollow in 1868. When the grain came up high on Gottlob's leg while riding his horse, he knew this was where he wanted to bring his family.<ref>Mast family</ref>\n\nFarmers Grain Elevator was established in 1937 by Thomas Mezger. His great-grandparents Fredrick and Catherine (Claus) Mezger, originally from Wurttemberg Germany, moved in 1870 to a 160-acre homestead approximately 3 miles southwest of Black's Station.  Originally serving as a scale house, Farmers Grain Elevator eventually became a storage facility and grain purchasing center for local growers. As customer demands grew, Farmers Grain Elevator saw the need to provide quality transportation services for the grower\u2019s harvested crop and in 1971 established Mezger Trucking, Inc. For over 70 years, Farmers Grain Elevator has specialized in the carriage and distribution to market of wheat, corn, barley, safflower and various other agricultural products. Since its inception Farmers Grain Elevator has remained a family business. It is currently co-owned and operated by Dan and Mark Mezger.<ref>farmersgrainelevator.com</ref>\n\nAlex and Marlene Long own Zamora Mini-mart on Highway 99 at the Interstate 5 Zamora exit which includes a gas station and small store. For most visitors to Zamora, this is the only place they visit.\n\nThe Bariani Olive Oil Co. built a processing plant west of Zamora, and of this the ''Sacramento Business Journal'' reported on October 2, 2004:[http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/10/25/tidbits1.html] The {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel in Yolo County is big enough for 18,000 olive trees and a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building.\n\n==History==\nThe first known inhabitants were Native Americans of the Patwin (or Southern Wintun) tribe. Using bows and arrows, spears or snares, Patwins stalked the abundant turtles, deer, tule elk, antelope and the occasional bear, mountain lion or wild cat that came down from the foothills and Coast Range. Using bow and arrow or nets they hunted ducks, geese and swans as they came into the tule marshlands during migrations.\nSpanish explorers explored the area in the early 1800s and, as a result, thousands of Patwins died from ill-treatment or previously unknown diseases. Patwins were also rounded up and taken as slaves to build Mission churches and work the mission ranches.\nBetween 1829 and 1846, hunters and fur trappers from Santa Fe, New Mexico and from Hudson's Bay Company in Fort Vancouver sometimes traded with Patwin resulting in heavy losses of life for the trappers and hunters and for Patwin.\nThe 1849 California gold rush miners brought more violence and disease.\n\nThe first wave of European settlers included: in 1852 John and Michael Bemmerly, Elias Harley, Edmund Burger; in 1853 Elias Harley and Martin Rahm, they ran out previous settlers who were there 3 years earlier they went by Ramirez and Zamora; in 1854 Silas Barnes and Henry Gaddis; in the late 1850s David Hershey, Theodore Weyand, Cary LeDue, Fred Schlieman and John Wolfrom; in the 1860s James J Black, Ephraim Crites, Gustave Anderson, John Huber, Thomas W Long, James Root, John Walker. Many gained their property through 1862 Homestead act which promised 160-acre tract of public land to the head of a family after the land had been cleared, improved and occupied for 5 years.\nSome of the Zamora Districtwas once part of Rancho de Hardy-Rio de Jesus Maria Rancho, granted to Thomas Hardy by Governor Micheltorena on October 23, 1843. In 1870, Circuit Court decided in favor of \"Landowner's League upon the Hardy Grant\", an organization of local landholders.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\nMany towns sprang up in Yolo County between 1868 and 1888, including Zamora [https://web.archive.org/web/20060818063447/http://www.yolo.net/ychm/historyc.html], which was previously known as Black's. Black's was on the railroad and was the pioneer home of J. J. Black, who located there in 1865.In 1875, the Northern Railway Company began extending the railroad from Woodland to Red Bluff. When it reached Black's farm he donated a strip of land 100 feet wide by 3150 feet long acres for depot and grounds and the station was the result. Rights of way were sold for $10 to the railroad company by Silas Barnes, Henry Hoffman, Jacob Cunningham, Albion T. Robinson, Henry M. Cassilis and H.O. Dresser. .<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\nFour blocks were laid out with 16 lots of 30x120 feet per block. On September 18, 1875, C. H. Smart purchased 3 lots from Mr Black for $200 and became the first resident thereof, constructing for his use a dwelling house and a blacksmith shop at the corner of First and Main Streets. William Dorgan purchased 3 lots on March 9. 1876. Gustav Anderson bought 4 lots on April 15, 1876. Robert Huston and his brother Edward bought one lot and established the first store in 1876. The plan for the town of Black's Station (10.8 acres) was filed in 1877.<ref name=\"cagenweb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cagenweb.com/yolo/yolplnm4.htm#Z|title=Yolo County Place Names of the Past and Present( S thru Z )|first=Peggy B. and Patrick|last=Perazzo|website=www.cagenweb.com|access-date=2006-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060815134711/http://www.cagenweb.com/yolo/yolplnm4.htm#Z|archive-date=2006-08-15|url-status=live}}</ref>  A. C. Turner started the first hotel, and Thomas and Hunt erected the first grain warehouse. Among other builders were D. N. Hershey, Ed Huston, George Glascock and John Wolff. Black's Station from the first was an important shipping station, the great farms in the vicinity sending in their harvests to this point for transportation to market. The coming of the Yolo County Consolidated Water Company's system in 1903 to Black's added much to the importance of the place and stimulated business. The new packing plant was finished that year, making the station a fruit center.<ref>{{History of Yolo County|58}}</ref>  In 1906 the name was changed to Zamora. According to a 1920 Yolo County map, Zamora was in the Black's District.<ref name=\"cagenweb.com\"/>\n\nA post office opened in Prairie in 1857, changed its name to Black's Station in 1876, and to Zamora in 1915.<ref name=CGN /> Prairie Post office was opened on March 19, 1857 at Weyand's Corner where a rural hotel, general store and stage stop were run at the ranch of Theodore Weyand, located at County Road 97 and County Road 13. Mr. Weyand was the first postmaster. Mail was delivered by stagecoach from Sacramento. Mr John Wolfrom served 8 years as postmaster when the post office was at his home just north of Weyand's which also served as rural hotel, general store and stage stop. Prairie Post Office altewrnated between Weyand's and Wolfrom's, serving the area until establishment of Black's Station Post Office in 1876.\nRobert M Huston was appointed postmaster December 4, 1876; Edward S Howard in 1882; William B. Black in 1888; Mason C. Gorton in 1898; Silas P. Cutler in 1903. The post office was located in the residence or business establishment of the postmaster until it was moved to a new hotel. On March 8, 1915, it became Zamora Post Office. Charles E Thomas was appointed postmaster in 1922. The hotel burned and Zamora Post office moved to the IOOF building where Carey L Croll became postmistress in 1924. It mioved to the home of Minnie Croll in 1932 when she was appointed Postmistress. In 1957, Zamora Post Office returned to the IOOF building with Ruth Anderson as postmistress. in 1969, the post office moved to a new IOOF building. Janice Croll became postmistress in 1978.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\n==Zamora soils==\n\nThe town lends its name to a type of soil which is classified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as \"a member of the fine-silty, mixed, thermic family of Mollic Haploxeralfs. Typically, Zamora soils have grayish brown, slightly acid loam A horizons; brown silty clay loam, neutral Bt horizons; and yellowish brown C horizons.\" They are found \"Along the west side of the Sacramento Valley in central California and other parts of California\" and are \"used for growing orchards, row, field, and truck crops. Native vegetation is annual grasses and [[forb]]s and widely spaced oaks.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20060517202358/http://www2.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/osd/dat/Z/ZAMORA.html]\n\nNative plants included Valley Oaks whose ground acorns provided flour for the Patwin, wild oats, sunflower, clover, manzanita, blackberries, wild grapes.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\nHistorically, grain crops were the only source of crop. Farmers in Zamora have had to cope with unpredictable years of drought and years of heavy rains. In the 1930s, the development of turbine pumps resulted in the ability of farmers to pump enough water for irrigation. This resulted in the ability for more diversified crops, including row crops, orchards, grapes, alfalfa and others.<ref name=\"Hermle 1994 208\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{gnis|1660224}}\n\n{{Yolo County, California}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in California]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Yolo County, California]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in the Sacramento metropolitan area]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamora,_California"}

It has been described as a defining event in the history of the [[Whitsunday Islands]], and was the most damaging storm in the mainland town of [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]]'s history at the time. Forming over the far eastern [[Coral Sea]] in early January, the weather disturbance that would become Ada remained weak and disorganised for nearly two weeks as it slowly moved in a clockwise loop. Accelerating toward the southwest, the system was named Ada on 15 January. All observations of the fledgling cyclone were made remotely with [[weather satellite]] imagery until it passed over an [[automated weather station]] on 16 January. The extremely compact cyclone, with a [[Beaufort scale|gale]] radius of just {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on|round=5}}, intensified into a [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Category 3 severe tropical cyclone]] just before striking the Whitsunday Islands at 14:00 [[UTC]] on 17 January. At 18:30 UTC, Ada's [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the coast at [[Shute Harbour]]. The cyclone made little inland progress before stalling northwest of [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and dissipating on 19 January.\n\nAda devastated several resort islands in the Whitsundays, in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins. The biggest resort, located on [[Daydream Island]], was obliterated, with similar destruction seen on [[South Molle Island|South Molle]], [[Hayman Island|Hayman]], and [[Long Island (Whitsunday Islands)|Long]] islands; since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed, hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue. Based on the severity of the damage, wind gusts were later estimated at {{cvt|220|km/h}} . As Ada moved ashore, most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near the storm's [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] point, including [[Cannonvale]], [[Airlie Beach]], and Shute Harbour. Extreme rainfall totals as high as {{cvt|1250|mm|in}} caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]] and Mackay. The floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days. Offshore, seven people were missing and presumed dead after their [[fishing trawler]] encountered the cyclone. Ada killed a total of 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused [[A$]]12&nbsp;million in damage. The cyclone revealed inadequacies in the warning broadcast system, and served as the impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness programs that have been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones. In January 2020, on the 50th anniversary of the disaster, a memorial to the storm victims was erected along the shoreline at Airlie Beach. \n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Ada 1970 track.png|alt=Image of the northern Oceania region showing the track of the cyclone as a series of connected dots, which begins in the far eastern Coral Sea, completes a clockwise loop, and ends just beyond the coast of northeastern Australia.}}\nCyclone Ada was first noted by [[weather satellite]] imagery as a disorganised area of disturbed weather over the eastern [[Coral Sea]] on 5 January.

[[Flood warning]]s were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like the [[Pioneer River|Pioneer]] and [[Connors River|Connors]]. The bureau's post-storm assessment of the disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made at all, and public awareness was generally inadequate. In a misguided attempt to quell panic, one radio station appended the BoM's warning with an unapproved message that there was no cause for alarm because of the cyclone's small size.

It has been described as a defining event in the history of the [[Whitsunday Islands]], and was the most damaging storm in the mainland town of [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]]'s history at the time. Forming over the far eastern [[Coral Sea]] in early January, the weather disturbance that would become Ada remained weak and disorganised for nearly two weeks as it slowly moved in a clockwise loop. Accelerating toward the southwest, the system was named Ada on 15 January. All observations of the fledgling cyclone were made remotely with [[weather satellite]] imagery until it passed over an [[automated weather station]] on 16 January. The extremely compact cyclone, with a [[Beaufort scale|gale]] radius of just {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on|round=5}}, intensified into a [[Tropical cyclone scales#Australia and Fiji|Category 3 severe tropical cyclone]] just before striking the Whitsunday Islands at 14:00 [[UTC]] on 17 January. At 18:30 UTC, Ada's [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] crossed the coast at [[Shute Harbour]]. The cyclone made little inland progress before stalling northwest of [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and dissipating on 19 January.\n\nAda devastated several resort islands in the Whitsundays, in some cases destroying virtually all facilities and guest cabins. The biggest resort, located on [[Daydream Island]], was obliterated, with similar destruction seen on [[South Molle Island|South Molle]], [[Hayman Island|Hayman]], and [[Long Island (Whitsunday Islands)|Long]] islands; since most boats docked on these islands were destroyed, hundreds of tourists in these resorts became stranded and required emergency rescue. Based on the severity of the damage, wind gusts were later estimated at {{cvt|220|km/h}} . As Ada moved ashore, most homes were damaged or destroyed in communities near the storm's [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] point, including [[Cannonvale]], [[Airlie Beach]], and Shute Harbour. Extreme rainfall totals as high as {{cvt|1250|mm|in}} caused massive river flooding in coastal waterways between [[Bowen, Queensland|Bowen]] and Mackay. The floodwaters washed out roads and left some locations isolated for days. Offshore, seven people were missing and presumed dead after their [[fishing trawler]] encountered the cyclone. Ada killed a total of 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused [[A$]]12&nbsp;million in damage. The cyclone revealed inadequacies in the warning broadcast system, and served as the impetus for enhanced cyclone awareness programs that have been credited with saving lives in subsequent cyclones.

[[Flood warning]]s were issued for watersheds of susceptible rivers like the [[Pioneer River|Pioneer]] and [[Connors River|Connors]]. The bureau's post-storm assessment of the disaster revealed that local broadcasts of advisories were sometimes delayed by several hours or not made at all, and public awareness was generally inadequate. In a misguided attempt to quell panic, one radio station appended the BoM's warning with an unapproved message that there was no cause for alarm because of the cyclone's small size. Due to the unusual nature of the storm, including its delayed arrival in some areas, many residents criticised or disregarded forecasts. Additionally, many tourists in the region were unfamiliar with the dangers of tropical cyclones.<ref name=\"bom\"/> Findings from studies of the public response to Ada were used as the basis for upgraded warning systems and the introduction of more cyclone education campaigns; these initiatives were credited with saving lives and property in later storms such as [[Cyclone Althea]] in December 1971.<ref name=\"bomalthea\">{{cite web|author=Bureau of Meteorology|title=Report by Director of Meteorology on Cyclone Althea|date=July 1972|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|accessdate=29 April 2017|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/althea.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66MZZJrhB?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/pdf/althea.pdf|archive-date=22 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Daydream Island after Cyclone Ada.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view of the destruction on Daydream Island|alt=Black and white aerial photograph of a small island with unroofed buildings, trees stripped of their leaves and branches, and debris scattered over the ground and beach.]]\nOffshore, the {{convert|16.7|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[concrete ship|concrete]] [[fishing trawler]] ''Whakatane'' went missing while en route from Mackay to [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]].

Dalyngrigge returned to England in 1377 having accumulated much wealth and power.<ref>{{harvnb|Thackray|2004|pp=9, 11}}</ref> Upon his return to Sussex, he married Elizabeth, the heiress of the Wardedieu or Wardeux family, who had held the manor of [[Bodiam]] since before 1330. Through his new wife, Sir Edward acquired a moated manor house, which lay just to the north of Bodiam church. It is also possible that Dalyngrigge and his new wife resided in this manor house until his new castle was completed, although he also held another house at his estate at Bolebrook, near [[Hartfield, Sussex]].\n\n==Knighthood==\nBetween 1379 and 1388, Dalyngrigge was [[Knight of the Shire]] of Sussex in ten parliaments and subsequently one of the most influential gentry of the county at that time. In 1380 he was made a member of the Commission considering the state of the realm and the possessions, expenses and revenues of the royal household. Also in that year, he was appointed to survey [[Winchelsea]] and to consider how the town should be fortified against attacks from the French. His concern over the defence of the coast was evident in 1384-5, when he was called to be a member of a Commission to fortify the cinque port, [[Rye, East Sussex]].\n\nIn 1384 the King's uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], [[Duke of Lancaster]], took out a lawsuit against Dalyngrigge to try to restrain him from interference with the Duke's recently acquired Sussex estates. Resentment of the powerful Duke of Lancaster and his estates was felt by many of the Sussex gentry, and Dalyngrigge was essentially representing their grievances. Dalyngrigge's behaviour in court, where he appeared in his own defence, was violent and unruly and gives a good indication of his personality; twice during the proceedings, he threw down the gauntlet in court. His action seems to imply that he saw the case more as a matter of honour than of legality. His concern was fundamentally that his local standing was threatened by John of Gaunt's acquisition and authority over neighbouring estates. John of Gaunt won his lawsuit and Dalyngrigge suffered an almost \u00a31000 fine for contempt and was ordered to be kept in 'safe and secure custody' of the sheriff until paid. Sir Edward's patron, the 11th [[Earl of Arundel]], was able to intercede for him with the King after the Duke had departed England on 9 July 1386 when he sailed his army to Brest and on to Corunna and so Dalyngrigge was returned to the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] soon after without ever paying the fine.\n\nEngland had been at war with France on-and-off since the 1330s when King Edward III laid claim to the French throne. Due to a number of attacks by the French on towns on the southern English coast, there was a good reason for building a well-defended castle close to the south coast. At the time, the [[River Rother (Eastern)|River Rother]] was still navigable as far as Bodiam and the French could easily have sailed an invading or raiding force there. Consequently, King Richard II issued a royal licence to Dalyngrigge in October 1385 to [[crenelation|crenellate]] his manor house at Bodiam. The licence, in Latin, stated:\n{{quote|...that he may strengthen with a wall of stone and lime, and crenellate and may construct and make into a Castle his manor house of Bodyham, near the sea, in the county of Sussex, for the defence of the adjacent country, and the resistance of our enemies.}}\nIn addition to the [[licence to crenellate]], Sir Edward was granted a royal licence to divert a stream from \"Dalyngreggesbay\", upstream in [[Salehurst]], to Bodiam to power a [[watermill]]. The mill was situated to the south of the site for Sir Edward's new castle between the castle and the River Rother, fed by a large mill-pond.\n\nIn 1386-7, Sir Edward was appointed Captain of Brest, and due to his having to spend his time in France is unlikely to have been present to oversee the first stages of his new castle.\n\nBy 1390 the threat of war with France had receded. Sir Edward was appointed to several commissions, such as to conclude a truce with France, to make conditions with the [[Philip the Bold|Count of Flanders]] and with the people of [[Ghent]], [[Bruges]] and [[Ypres]], and to survey the castles and fortresses of [[Calais]] and [[Picardy]]. In 1390 he was one of the nine knights who attached their seal to a letter sent to the Pope deploring the excesses of the Church.{{fact|date=November 2015}} Sir Edward's status in the country was further reflected in 1392 when he was appointed as [[Lord Mayor of London|Warden of London]] by King Richard II when civic liberties were suspended from May to September of that year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henry Yevele c.1320\u20131400|author=John Hooper Harvey|page=46|author-link=John Hooper Harvey}}</ref>\n\nBy the time his castle at Bodiam was completed in about 1390, Dalyngrigge did not have long to enjoy it, as he died some time between July 1393 and August 1394.<ref>Spencer, Dan (2014), [http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/collegeofhumanities/history/exhistoria/volume6/Edward_Dallingridge_Builder_of_Bodiam_Castle.pdf \"Edward Dallinbridge: Builder of Bodiam Castle\"], p. 11</ref> \n\nHe was succeeded by his son, Sir John Dalyngrigge, who was married to Alice, daughter and heir of Sir John Beauchamp of [[Powick]], and relict of Sir Thomas Butler of Sudeley, Gloucestershire.<ref>L.S.

In 1390 he was one of the nine knights who attached their seal to a letter sent to the Pope deploring the excesses of the Church.{{fact|date=November 2015}} Sir Edward's status in the country was further reflected in 1392 when he was appointed as [[Lord Mayor of London|Warden of London]] by King Richard II when civic liberties were suspended from May to September of that year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henry Yevele c.1320\u20131400|author=John Hooper Harvey|page=46|author-link=John Hooper Harvey}}</ref>\n\nBy the time his castle at Bodiam was completed in about 1390, Dalyngrigge did not have long to enjoy it, as he died some time between July 1393 and August 1394.<ref>Spencer, Dan (2014), [http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/collegeofhumanities/history/exhistoria/volume6/Edward_Dallingridge_Builder_of_Bodiam_Castle.pdf \"Edward Dallinbridge: Builder of Bodiam Castle\"], p. 11</ref> \n\nHe was succeeded by his son, Sir John Dalyngrigge, who was married to Alice, daughter and heir of Sir John Beauchamp of [[Powick]], and relict of Sir Thomas Butler of Sudeley, Gloucestershire.<ref>L.S.

It was built by [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]]-based Talon International Development Inc., which is owned by Canadian businessmen Val Levitan and [[Alex Shnaider]]. The hotel portion of the building is owned by InnVest Hotels LP, which acquired it in 2017.<ref name=InnVest/>\n\nThe building is located in Toronto's [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]], at 325 [[Bay Street]], on the southeast corner of Bay and Adelaide streets. Including the [[spire]], it is the [[List of tallest buildings in Canada|second-tallest building in Canada]], the [[List of tallest buildings in Toronto|tallest mixed-use building in Toronto]] and the [[List of tallest structures in Canada|fourth-tallest structure in Toronto]], as of 2020.\n\nAfter it opened in 2012 as the '''Trump International Hotel and Tower Toronto''', the hotel was controversial for its affiliation with [[Donald Trump]], who was a real estate developer at the time, later the [[President of the United States]]. In 2017, this affiliation led to calls from the public for the hotel to drop its Trump branding following the president's [[Executive Order 13769]], which restricted people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the United States.\n\n[[The Trump Organization]], a company owned by the [[Trump family]], previously held the management contract for the hotel and was a minority shareholder in the project. The management contract was bought out by JCF Capital in June 2017, and the hotel portion of the building was then purchased by InnVest Hotels LP, a subsidiary of Bluesky Hotels and Resorts.<ref name=InnVest>{{cite web |title=InnVest Hotels acquires former Trump Tower in Toronto |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/06/29/innvest-hotels-acquires-former-trump-tower-in-toronto.html |website=The Toronto Star |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> The hotel management shifted to [[Marriott International]], which operated it on an unbranded basis as '''The Adelaide Hotel Toronto''' during renovations.<ref name=Nast>{{cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/canada/toronto/trump-international-hotel---tower-toronto |title=The Adelaide Hotel Toronto \u2013 Hotel Review |work=Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller |accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> After the renovations were completed, the hotel became part of Marriott's [[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts]] on 28 November 2018, adopting its present name.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Regis Hotels and Resorts Marks Canadian Debut at The Best Address in Toronto |url=https://news.marriott.com/2018/11/st-regis-hotels-and-resorts-marks-canadian-debut-at-the-best-address-in-toronto/ |website=news.marriott.com |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n[[File:Trump Toronto entrance at night.JPG|left|thumb|Main entrance on Adelaide Street]]\n[[File:Trump Tower viewed from exec office Toronto-Dominion Building during 2011 Doors Open Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|The building under construction in May 2011.]]\nThe tower has 65 storeys, 57 occupiable floors, is {{convert|276.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref name=\"skyscraper\">{{cite web| title=Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto| url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6167| publisher=SkyscraperPage.com| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> and is clad with a steel, glass, and stone facade.

As a result, the planned heights of both projects were revised several times in an attempt to outdo each other, and Stinson's skyscraper would have been 17 metres taller in its last design. However, the Sapphire Tower failed to gain approval of city council, in part because it would have cast a shadow over [[Toronto City Hall]]'s [[Nathan Phillips Square]], and its development company filed for bankruptcy in 2007. At that time, the Trump Tower's design was also scaled back and the height was reduced because of the real estate market slowdown.<ref name=\"wong\">{{cite news| title=Condo king files for bankruptcy protection| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/03/09/condo_king_files_for_bankruptcy_protection.html| last=Wong| first=Tony| work=[[Toronto Star]]| date=March 9, 2007| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe building was built on a previously vacant lot, used only for parking, between [[Scotia Plaza]] and [[The National Club]].

The official groundbreaking was on October 12, 2007. The hotel portion of the tower was planned to be completed in late 2011. The tower was projected to be completed in early 2012. The building topped out in early September 2011, and the spire was raised on September 24, 2011.

It was built by [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]]-based Talon International Development Inc., which is owned by Canadian businessmen Val Levitan and [[Alex Shnaider]]. The hotel portion of the building is owned by InnVest Hotels LP, which acquired it in 2017.<ref name=InnVest/>\n\nThe building is located in Toronto's [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]], at 325 [[Bay Street]], on the southeast corner of Bay and Adelaide streets. It is the third tallest skyscraper in Canada (including spire), the tallest mixed-use building in the city and the fourth tallest structure in the city.\n\nAfter it opened in 2012 as the '''Trump International Hotel and Tower Toronto''', the hotel was controversial for its affiliation with [[Donald Trump]], who was a real estate developer at the time, later the [[President of the United States]]. In 2017, this affiliation led to calls from the public for the hotel to drop its Trump branding following the president's [[Executive Order 13769]], which restricted people from a number of predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the United States.\n\n[[The Trump Organization]], a company owned by the [[Trump family]], previously held the management contract for the hotel and was a minority shareholder in the project. The management contract was bought out by JCF Capital in June 2017, and the hotel portion of the building was then purchased by InnVest Hotels LP, a subsidiary of Bluesky Hotels and Resorts.<ref name=InnVest>{{cite web |title=InnVest Hotels acquires former Trump Tower in Toronto |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/06/29/innvest-hotels-acquires-former-trump-tower-in-toronto.html |website=The Toronto Star |accessdate=October 18, 2017}}</ref> The hotel management shifted to [[Marriott International]], which operated it on an unbranded basis as '''The Adelaide Hotel Toronto''' during renovations.<ref name=Nast>{{cite web |url=https://www.cntraveler.com/hotels/canada/toronto/trump-international-hotel---tower-toronto |title=The Adelaide Hotel Toronto \u2013 Hotel Review |work=Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveller |accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> After the renovations were completed, the hotel became part of Marriott's [[St. Regis Hotels & Resorts]] on 28 November 2018, adopting its present name.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Regis Hotels and Resorts Marks Canadian Debut at The Best Address in Toronto |url=https://news.marriott.com/2018/11/st-regis-hotels-and-resorts-marks-canadian-debut-at-the-best-address-in-toronto/ |website=news.marriott.com |accessdate=November 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\n[[File:Trump Toronto entrance at night.JPG|left|thumb|Main entrance on Adelaide Street]]\n[[File:Trump Tower viewed from exec office Toronto-Dominion Building during 2011 Doors Open Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|The building under construction in May 2011.]]\nThe tower has 65 storeys, 57 occupiable floors, is {{convert|276.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref name=\"skyscraper\">{{cite web| title=Trump International Hotel & Tower Toronto| url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=6167| publisher=SkyscraperPage.com| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref> and is clad with a steel, glass, and stone facade.

As a result, the planned heights of both projects were revised several times in an attempt to outdo each other, and Stinson's skyscraper would have been 17 metres taller in its last design. However, the Sapphire Tower failed to gain approval of city council, in part because it would have cast a shadow over [[Toronto City Hall]]'s [[Nathan Phillips Square]], and its development company filed for bankruptcy in 2007. At that time, the Trump Tower's design was also scaled back and the height was reduced because of the real estate market slowdown.<ref name=\"wong\">{{cite news| title=Condo king files for bankruptcy protection| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/03/09/condo_king_files_for_bankruptcy_protection.html| last=Wong| first=Tony| work=[[Toronto Star]]| date=March 9, 2007| accessdate=August 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nThe building was built on a previously vacant lot, used only for parking, between [[Scotia Plaza]] and [[The National Club]]. Lewis Builds Corporation, a construction and development manager in [[downtown Toronto]], was the construction manager for this project.\n\nOn March 23, 2007, Talon International Development Incorporated of [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]] announced that it had reached an agreement with international bank [[Raiffeisen Zentralbank|Raiffeisen Zentralbank \u00d6sterreich AG]] (RZB) to arrange C$310 million in construction financing for its Trump International Hotel & Tower development.\n\nConstruction began with the removal of the sales centre in September 2007. The official groundbreaking was on October 12, 2007. The hotel portion of the tower was planned to be completed in late 2011. The tower was projected to be completed in early 2012. The building topped out in early September 2011, and the spire was raised on September 24, 2011.
