Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s party ate sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. This allowed the party to carry less food, thus lightening the load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:\n<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u2013 and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen|access-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120454/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|archive-date=2009-09-26|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers. Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition [[hypervitaminosis A]] because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do. Mertz suffered a quick deterioration. He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent. On 7 January 1913, Mertz died. Mawson continued alone, eventually making it back to camp alive.<ref name=\"Mawson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6137/6137-h/6137-h.htm#2HCH0013|title=The Home of the Blizzard|first=Douglas|last=Mawson}}</ref>\n\n===Asia/Pacific===\n==== Armenia ====\nArmenia has no animal welfare laws, including any prohibition on killing dogs for consumption.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n==== Azerbaijan ====\nAzerbaijan laws do not explicitly prohibit killing dogs for consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.azpromo.az:80/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516181155/http://www.azpromo.az:80/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 May 2017|title=Wayback Machine|date=16 May 2017|access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Afghanistan ====\nAfghanistan has no animal welfare laws.<ref name=\":02\" /> As an Islamic nation, consumption of dog meat is strictly prohibited.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.khaama.com/sellers-of-dog-meat-jailed-for-13-years-in-herat-province-8950/|title=Sellers of dog meat jailed for 13 years in Herat province|date=15 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2015|publisher=[[Khaama Press]]}}</ref>\n\n==== Cambodia ====\nAnimal welfare NGO [[Four Paws]] estimates that 2-3 million dogs are slaughtered annually for their meat in Cambodia.

This is thought to ensure good health by balancing one's \"[[qi]]\", the believed vital energy of the body.

Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]]'s party ate sled dogs during his expedition to the South Pole. This allowed the party to carry less food, thus lightening the load.<ref name=southpole /> When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals he also notes:\n<blockquote>there is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog. One can reduce one's pack little by little, slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them. In this way they get fresh meat. Our dogs lived on dog's flesh and [[pemmican]] the whole way, and this enabled them to do splendid work. And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet; it tasted to us as good as the best beef. The dogs do not object at all; as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade's carcass it comes from. All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim \u2013 and if it had been a really hard day, these also disappeared.<ref name=southpole >{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|title=The South Pole|first=Roald|last=Amundsen|access-date=2009-10-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926120454/http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext03/tsp1210h.htm#intro|archive-date=2009-09-26|url-status=dead}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Douglas Mawson]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] were part of the [[Far Eastern Party]], a three-man sledging team with [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis|Lieutenant B.E.S. Ninnis]], to survey King George V Land, Antarctica. On 14 December 1912 Ninnis fell through a snow-covered crevasse along with most of the party's rations, and was never seen again. Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one and a half weeks' food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs. Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their {{convert|315|mi|km|adj=on}} return journey. Their meat was tough, stringy and without a vestige of fat. Each animal yielded very little, and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs, which ate the meat, skin and bones until nothing remained. The men also ate the dog's brains and livers.

Dog meat is also believed to increase the body temperature, so people sweat more to keep one cool during the summer (the way of dealing with heat is called ''Heal heat with heat'' (\uc774\uc5f4\uce58\uc5f4, \u4ee5\u71b1\u6cbb\u71b1, ''i-yeol-chi-yeol''). A 19th-century version of ''gaejang-guk'' explains the preparation of the dish by boiling dog meat with vegetables such as [[scallion|green onions]] and [[chili powder|chili pepper powder]].

In [[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms']] and [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s versions of the tale, she is named after her red [[hood (headgear)|hooded]] [[cape]]/[[cloak]] that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.\n\nA [[Big Bad Wolf]] wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.\n\n[[File:GustaveDore She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s engraving of the scene: \"She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.\n\n<br />]]\n\nWhen the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, \"What a deep voice you have!\" (\"The better to greet you with\", responds the wolf), \"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\" (\"The better to see you with\", responds the wolf), \"And what big hands you have!\" (\"The better to embrace you with\", responds the wolf), and lastly, \"What a big mouth you have\" (\"The better to eat you with!\", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows:\n\n''A [[lumberjack|woodcutter]] in the French version, but a [[Hunting|hunter]] in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. In Grimm's version, the wolf leaves the house and tries to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to fall in and drown. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spurgeon|first=Maureen|title=Red Riding Hood|year=1990|publisher=Brown Watson|location=England|isbn=0709706928}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"Little Red Riding Hood\" illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref name = \"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref>]]\n\nThe tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the [[enchanted forest|forest]], conventional [[Antithesis|antitheses]] that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tunturisusi.com/littleredridinghood/english.htm|title=Little Red Riding Hood|website=www.tunturisusi.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in Grimms' version).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe most iconic scene from the story is included in the [[fairytale forest]] in the Dutch theme park '[[Efteling]]'. The [[big bad wolf]], dressed as a grandmother, is lying in bed. He has dressed up so that he can lure Little Red Riding Hood into the house. Red Riding Hood, in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] 'Roodkapje' is also a famous figure in the Dutch/Flemish cartoon '[[Sprookjesboom]]'.\nAn old Dutch children's song is also dedicated to Little Red Riding Hood, called 'Little Red Riding Hood where are you going?'\n\n==History==\n===Relationship to other tales===\n\nThe story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered as a sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|page= 94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally \"Fire\") and a man with some name meaning \"wolf\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =94\u201395|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman poet [[Horace]] alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of [[Lamia]], an [[ogre]]ss in classical mythology.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =96\u201397|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'' from the ''[[Elder Edda]]''; the giant [[\u00derymr]] had stolen [[Mj\u00f6lnir]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, and demanded [[Freyja]] as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, [[Loki]] explains them as Freyja's not having slept, eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.<ref>{{cite book|authors=[[Iona and Peter Opie|Opie, Iona & Peter]]|title=The Classic Fairy Tales|pages=[https://archive.org/details/classicfairytale00opie_0/page/93 93\u20134]|isbn=0-19-211559-6|url=https://archive.org/details/classicfairytale00opie_0/page/93}}</ref> A parallel to another Norse myth, the chase and eventual murder of the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun goddess]] by the wolf [[Sk\u00f6ll]], has also been drawn.<ref>Dundes, Alan & McGlathery, James M.

Goodman, ''Berber Culture on the World Stage: From Village to Video'', Indiana University Press, 2005: 62.</ref>\n|}\n\nThe theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its [[stomach|belly]] is also reflected in the Russian tale ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'' and another Grimm tale ''[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]'', but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, ''[[Book of Jonah|Jonah and the Whale]]''. The theme also appears in the story of the life of [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a [[dragon]], and in the epic \"The Red Path\" by [[Jim C. Hines]].\n\nA Taiwanese story from the 16th century, known as Grandaunt Tiger bears several striking similarities. When the girl's mother goes out, the tigress comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tigress attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tigress attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tigress gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tigress that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tigress comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lontzen |first1=Dr Guntzen |title=The Earliest Version of the Chinese Red Riding Hood |jstor=41390379}}</ref>\n\n===Earliest versions===\n[[File:Walter Crane26.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The better to see you with\": woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]\n\nThe origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by [[France|French]] peasants in the 10th century<ref name=\"Jacques Berlioz 2007 p63\"/> and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster [[Egbert of Li\u00e8ge]].<ref>J.M. Ziolkowski, \"A fairy tale from before fairy tales: Egbert of Liege's \u2018De puella a lupellis seruata\u2019 and the medieval background of \u2018Little Red Riding Hood\u2019\", ''Speculum'' 67 (1992): 549\u2013575.</ref> In [[Italy]], Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including ''La finta nonna'' (The False Grandmother), written among others by [[Italo Calvino]] in the ''[[Italian Folktales]]'' collection.<ref>Jack Zipes, In Hungarian folklore, the story is known as \"Piroska\" (Little Red), and is still told in mostly the original version described above. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 744, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> It has also been called \"The Story of Grandmother\". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. \"Grandaunt Tiger\").<ref>Alan Dundes, ''little ducking''</ref>\n\nThese early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an [[ogre]], [[vampire]],<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 466-492). Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> or a 'bzou' ([[werewolf]]), making these tales relevant to the werewolf trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of [[Peter Stumpp]]).<ref>Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', pp 92-106, {{ISBN|0-465-04126-4}}</ref> The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90835-3|edition=2nd|page=4}}</ref> In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=1985|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72927-7|url=https://archive.org/details/greatcatmassacr000darn}}</ref> In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her \"grandmother\" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 522-534). Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D.

It was included in the collection ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9|Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose]]'' (''Histoires et contes du temps pass\u00e9, avec des moralit\u00e9s. Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye''), in 1697, by [[Charles Perrault]]. As the title implies, this version<ref>Charles Perrault, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]\"</ref> is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 17, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood.jpg|thumb|left|French images, like this 19th-century painting, show the much shorter red [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] being worn]]\n\nThe story had as its subject an \"attractive, well-bred young lady\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.\n\nCharles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault02.html |title=Little Red Riding Hood Charles Perrault |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 September 2003 |website=Pitt.Edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=12 January 2016|quote=And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.}}</ref> so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:\n\n{{quote|From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is [[Rake (stock character)|one kind]] with an amenable disposition \u2013 neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!}}\n\nThis, the presumed original version of the tale was written for the late seventeenth-century French court of [[King Louis XIV]]. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.\n\n===The Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]\n\nIn the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to [[Jacob Grimm]] and his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791\u20131860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788\u20131856).

The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on a bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.\n\nIn the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, [[deconstruction]] and [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critical theory]].

They protected the forest together until the hunter was killed during a wolf attack.

During the fights, a small dog named Harry watches the action from the sidelines and reacts to her taking damage in battle. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled \"Beautiful Hunting\" that inflicts extra damage on opponents. The character may be based on the James Thurber or Roald Dahl versions of the story, where Red pulls a gun from her basket and shoots the wolf, and the idea behind her character was to show that at their worst, humans are scarier than any imaginary monster.\n* In the free-to-play mobile game ''Minimon: Adventure of Minions'' (2016), Luna is a wolflike minion and agent of a secret society with humanlike physical characteristics who wears a red hood when awakened, which references both the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood.\n\n===Musi\n", "text_old": "{{short description|European fairy tale}}\n{{about|the folk tale}}\n{{redirect|Little Red Cap|the poem by Carol Ann Duffy|Little Red Cap (poem)}}\n{{Infobox folk tale\n|image = Little Red Riding Hood - J.

In Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.\n\nA [[Big Bad Wolf]] wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.\n\n[[File:GustaveDore She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Dor\u00e9]]'s engraving of the scene: \"She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.\n\n<br />]]\n\nWhen the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, \"What a deep voice you have!\" (\"The better to greet you with\", responds the wolf), \"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\" (\"The better to see you with\", responds the wolf), \"And what big hands you have!\" (\"The better to embrace you with\", responds the wolf), and lastly, \"What a big mouth you have\" (\"The better to eat you with!\", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows:\n\nA [[lumberjack|woodcutter]] in the French version, but a [[Hunting|hunter]] in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. In Grimm's version, the wolf leaves the house and tries to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to fall in and drown. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Spurgeon|first=Maureen|title=Red Riding Hood|year=1990|publisher=Brown Watson|location=England|isbn=0709706928}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Arthur Rackham Little Red Riding Hood+.jpg|thumb|upright|left|\"Little Red Riding Hood\" illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]].<ref name = \"Txxxviff\">{{Harvnb|Tatar|2004|pp=xxxviii}}</ref>]]\n\nThe tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the [[enchanted forest|forest]], conventional [[Antithesis|antitheses]] that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tunturisusi.com/littleredridinghood/english.htm|title=Little Red Riding Hood|website=www.tunturisusi.com|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref> It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in Grimms' version).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nThe most iconic scene from the story is included in the [[fairytale forest]] in the Dutch theme park '[[Efteling]]'. The [[big bad wolf]], dressed as a grandmother, is lying in bed. He has dressed up so that he can lure Little Red Riding Hood into the house. Red Riding Hood, in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] 'Roodkapje' is also a famous figure in the Dutch/Flemish cartoon '[[Sprookjesboom]]'.\nAn old Dutch children's song is also dedicated to Little Red Riding Hood, called 'Little Red Riding Hood where are you going?'\n\n==History==\n===Relationship to other tales===\n\nThe story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered as a sacrifice.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|page= 94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally \"Fire\") and a man with some name meaning \"wolf\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =94\u201395|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman poet [[Horace]] alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of [[Lamia]], an [[ogre]]ss in classical mythology.<ref>{{cite book |title= Fairytale in the Ancient World |last= Anderson|first= Graham|year= 2000|publisher= Routledge|isbn= 978-0-415-23702-4|pages =96\u201397|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B2DAAlUrbBIC&pg=PA27&dq=Fairytale+in+the+ancient+world|accessdate=9 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse ''[[\u00derymskvi\u00f0a]]'' from the ''[[Elder Edda]]''; the giant [[\u00derymr]] had stolen [[Mj\u00f6lnir]], [[Thor]]'s hammer, and demanded [[Freyja]] as his bride for its return.

When the girl's mother goes out, the tigress comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tigress attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tigress attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tigress gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tigress that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tigress comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lontzen |first1=Dr Guntzen |title=The Earliest Version of the Chinese Red Riding Hood |jstor=41390379}}</ref>\n\n===Earliest versions===\n[[File:Walter Crane26.jpg|thumb|upright|\"The better to see you with\": woodcut by [[Walter Crane]]]]\n\nThe origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by [[France|French]] peasants in the 10th century<ref name=\"Jacques Berlioz 2007 p63\"/> and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster [[Egbert of Li\u00e8ge]].<ref>J.M.

''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 744, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> It has also been called \"The Story of Grandmother\". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. \"Grandaunt Tiger\").<ref>Alan Dundes, ''little ducking''</ref>\n\nThese early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an [[ogre]], [[vampire]],<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 466-492). Greenwood Publishing Group.</ref> or a 'bzou' ([[werewolf]]), making these tales relevant to the werewolf trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of [[Peter Stumpp]]).<ref>Catherine Orenstein, ''Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale'', pp 92-106, {{ISBN|0-465-04126-4}}</ref> The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zipes|first=Jack|title=The Trials and Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood|year=1993|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-90835-3|edition=2nd|page=4}}</ref> In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book|last=Darnton|first=Robert|title=The Great Cat Massacre and Other Episodes in French Cultural History|year=1985|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-394-72927-7|url=https://archive.org/details/greatcatmassacr000darn}}</ref> In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her \"grandmother\" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.<ref>Beckett, S.

She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.<ref>Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D.

It was included in the collection ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9|Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose]]'' (''Histoires et contes du temps pass\u00e9, avec des moralit\u00e9s. Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'Oye''), in 1697, by [[Charles Perrault]]. As the title implies, this version<ref>Charles Perrault, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html Le Petit Chaperon Rouge]\"</ref> is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.<ref>Maria Tatar, p 17, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood.jpg|thumb|left|French images, like this 19th-century painting, show the much shorter red [[chaperon (headgear)|chaperon]] being worn]]\n\nThe story had as its subject an \"attractive, well-bred young lady\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.\n\nCharles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/perrault02.html |title=Little Red Riding Hood Charles Perrault |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 September 2003 |website=Pitt.Edu |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |access-date=12 January 2016|quote=And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up.}}</ref> so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:\n\n{{quote|From this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is [[Rake (stock character)|one kind]] with an amenable disposition \u2013 neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!}}\n\nThis, the presumed original version of the tale was written for the late seventeenth-century French court of [[King Louis XIV]]. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.\n\n===The Brothers Grimm===\n[[File:Grimm.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by [[Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann]]]]\n\nIn the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to [[Jacob Grimm]] and his younger brother [[Wilhelm Grimm]], known as the [[Brothers Grimm]], the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791\u20131860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788\u20131856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as ''Rotk\u00e4ppchen'' was included in the first edition of their collection ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen]]'' (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0333.html#grimm Little Red Cap]\"</ref>\n\nThe earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie'' on German Folklore\", p 966, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale \"[[The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids]]\", which appears to be the source.<ref>Harry Velten, \"The Influences of Charles Perrault's ''Contes de ma M\u00e8re L'oie'' on German Folklore\", p 967, Jack Zipes, ed. ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}</ref> The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.<ref>Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 149 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.<ref>Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \"[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm026.html Little Red Cap]\"</ref> It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.\n\n===After the Grimms===\n[[File:Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf (1858).jpg|thumb|left| An engraving from the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''.]]\n\nNumerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale.\n\n[[Andrew Lang]] included a variant called \"The True History of Little Goldenhood\"<ref>Andrew Lang, \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/ridinghood/stories/golden.html The True History of Little Goldenhood]\", ''The Red Fairy Book'' (1890)</ref> in ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]'' (1890).

See [http://data.bnf.fr/12364021/charles_marelle/ BNF note online].</ref> in ''Contes of Charles Marelles''. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.\n\n[[James Nelson Barker|James N. Barker]] wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the ''Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor''. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on a bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.\n\nIn the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, [[deconstruction]] and [[feminist literary criticism|feminist critical theory]]. (See [[#Modern uses and adaptations|\"Modern uses and adaptations\" below]].) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by [[Alan Dundes]] and [[Jack Zipes]].\n\n==Interpretations==\n[[File:Dore ridinghood.jpg|thumb|upright|A depiction by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]], 1883.]]\n\nBesides the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.<ref>Jane Yolen, ''Touch Magic'' p 25, {{ISBN|0-87483-591-7}}</ref> Some are listed below.\n\n===Natural cycles===\n[[folklore studies|Folklorists]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]], such as [[P.

A hunter killed the wolf before it could kill her. He took her in as his own out of pity. The Red Riding Hood of this story convinced the hunter to teach her how to fight. They protected the forest together until the hunter was killed during a wolf attack. The Red Riding Hood continued on protecting the forest and took in other orphaned girls and taught them to fight too. They take up wearing a red riding hood and cape to honor their teacher. Even after the death of the original Red Riding Hood the girls continue doing what she did in life.\n* In the [[fighting game]] ''[[Darkstalkers 3]]'' (1997), the character [[Baby Bonnie Hood]] (known in the Japanese release as Bulleta) is a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, complete with a childish look, red hood and picnic basket. But instead of food, her basket is full of guns and grenades. Her personality is somewhat psychotic, guerrilla-crazy. During the fights, a small dog named Harry watches the action from the sidelines and reacts to her taking damage in battle. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled \"Beautiful Hunting\" that inflicts extra damage on opponents. The character may be based on the James Thurber or Roald Dahl versions of the story, where Red pulls a gun from her basket and shoots the wolf, and the idea behind her character was to show that at their worst, humans are scarier than any imaginary monster.\n* In the free-to-play mobile game ''Minimon: Adventure of Minions'' (2016), Luna is a wolflike minion and agent of a secret society with humanlike physical characteristics who wears a red hood when awakened, which references both the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood.\n\n===Musicals===\n* Little Red Riding Hood is one of the central characters in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987) by [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[James Lapine]]. In the song, \"I Know Things Now\", she speaks of how the wolf made her feel \"excited, well, excited ''and'' scared\", in a reference to the sexual undertones of their relationship. Red Riding Hood's cape is also one of the musical's four quest items that are emblematic of fairy tales.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Sondheim, Steven  |author2=Lapine, James |date=1987|title=Into the Woods}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Children's literature|France|Italy}}\n* [[Freeway (1996 film)|''Freeway'' (1996 film)]]\n* [[Hard Candy (film)|''Hard Candy'' (film)]]\n* [[Ladle Rat Rotten Hut]]\n* [[Little Red Cap (poem)|\"Little Red Cap\" (poem)]]\n* [[The Path (video game)|''The Path'' (video game)]], a psychological horror art game\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource|Little Red Riding Hood}}\n{{commons category}}\n* [https://www.studenthandouts.com/texts/fairy-tales/little-red-riding-hood-ebook-worksheets.html Free printable \"Little Red Riding-hood\" eBook and worksheets for grades K-3.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150212191217/http://www.endicott-studio.com/articleslist/the-path-of-needles-and-pinsby-terri-windling.html Terri Windling's 'The Path of Needles or Pins: Little Red Riding Hood'] \u2013 a thorough article on the history of Little Red Riding Hood.\n* [http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/u6134166 The Little Red Riding Hood Collection] at the [[Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library]] at the [[University of Virginia]] contains hundreds of editions of the story, as well as ephemera, artifacts, and original artworks\n* Read [http://fairytalez.com/little-red-riding-hood/ Little Red Riding Hood] by Charles Perrault (sad ending), or [http://fairytalez.com/little-red-cap-little-red-riding-hood-grimms-version/ Little Red Cap] by Brothers Grimm (happy ending)\n* Singlish fairytale [https://singapulah.com/products/the-red-riding-hood-lah The Riding Riding Hood Lah!] by Singaporean artist Casey Chen\n* [http://www.fairytalechannel.com/2008/11/grimms-fairy-tale-no-26-little-red.html A Translation of Grimm's Fairy Tale ''Little Red Cap'']\n{{Brothers Grimm}}\n{{Little Red Riding Hood}}\n{{Charles Perrault}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1697 short stories]]\n[[Category:1812 short stories]]\n[[Category:Grimms' Fairy Tales|Grimms' Fairy Tales]]\n[[Category:Works by Charles Perrault]]\n[[Category:Literature featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Wolves in folklore, religion and mythology]]\n[[Category:Fictional French people]]\n[[Category:Child characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Child characters in fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Child characters in film]]\n[[Category:Child characters in musical theatre]]\n[[Category:Female characters in fairy tales]]\n[[Category:European folklore characters]]\n[[Category:European fairy tales]]\n[[Category:French fairy tales]]\n[[Category:German fairy tales]]\n[[Category:Little Red Riding Hood| ]]\n[[Category:Once Upon a Time (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Cross-dressing in literature]]\n[[Category:Big Bad Wolf]]\n", "name_user": "86.140.203.86", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood"}

Thousands of Mistral Major engines were produced, used on a wide variety of aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\n\nIn 1921 Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne purchased a license for the highly successful [[Bristol Jupiter]] engine and produced it until about 1930, alongside the smaller [[Bristol Titan]]. Starting in 1926, however, they used the basic design of the Titan to produce a family of new engines, the so-called \"K series\". These started with the 5K ''Titan'', followed by the 7K ''Titan Major'' and 9K ''Mistral''. By 1930, 6,000 of these engines had been delivered.\n\nHowever, the aircraft industry at that time was rapidly evolving and producing much larger aircraft that demanded larger engines to power them. Gnome-Rh\u00f4ne responded by developing the 7K into a two-row version that became the 14K ''Mistral Major''. The first test examples were running in 1929.\n\nAs the Jupiter had set the pattern for one-row radials in the 1920s, the Mistral Major became a canonical design for twin-row radials of the 1930s.

Among them, a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest, [[shortness of breath]] (caused by the hernia's effect on the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]), [[heart palpitations]] (due to irritation of the [[vagus nerve]]), and swallowed food \"balling up\" and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach.  In addition, hiatal hernias often result in [[heartburn]] but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.<ref name=\"BMJ2014\"/>\n\nIn most cases however, a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms. The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of [[acid reflux]], it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.\n\nIn newborns, the presence of [[Bochdalek hernia]] can be recognised<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang SW, Lee HC, Yeung CY, Chan WT, Hsu CH, Kao HA, Hung HY, Chang JH, Sheu JC, Wang NL |title=A twenty-year review of early and late-presenting congenital Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia: are they different clinical spectra? |journal=Pediatr Neonatol |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201330 |year=2010 |pmid=20225535 |doi=10.1016/S1875-9572(10)60006-X }}</ref> from symptoms such as difficulty breathing<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23810174 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.04.076 | volume=96 | issue=4 | title=Diaphragmatic hernia after esophagectomy in 440 patients with long-term follow-up |vauthors=Ganeshan DM, Correa AM, Bhosale P, Vaporciyan AA, Rice D, Mehran RJ, Walsh GL, Iyer R, Roth JA, Swisher SG, Hofstetter WL| journal=Ann Thorac Surg | pages=1138\u201345| year=2013 }}</ref> fast respiration, increased heart rate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A |last=Alam |first2=B.N. |last2=Chander |title=Adult bochdalek hernia |journal=MJAFI |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=284\u20136 |date=July 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0377-1237(05)80177-7 |pmid=27407781 |url=|pmc=4925637 }}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nThere are several reasons why you get a weakened diaphragm, a hiatus hernia. The muscle weakness may be congenital or due to acquired injury or accident (radiation, disease affecting musclesor surgery). As we get older, our muscles are thinning and this leads to weakened skeletal muscles, the muscles we have in, for example, arms, legs and diaphragm. \nObesity and pregnancy cause increased abdominal pressure and can lead to increased problems. It can also be hereditary.\n\n\n* Increased pressure within the [[abdomen]] caused by:\n** Heavy lifting or bending over\n** Frequent or hard [[coughing]]\n** Hard sneezing\n** [[Vomiting|Violent vomiting]]\n** Straining during [[defecation]] (i.e., the [[Valsalva maneuver]])\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis of a hiatal hernia is typically made through an [[upper GI series]], [[gastroscopy|endoscopy]] or [[high resolution manometry]].\n<gallery>\nFile:HiatusHernia10.JPG|A large hiatal hernia on [[chest radiography|chest X-ray]] marked by open arrows in contrast to the heart borders marked by closed arrows\nFile:Hiatus hernia with air-fluid level.jpg|This hiatal hernia is mainly identified by an air-fluid level (labeled with arrows).\nFile:Hiatus-hernia.jpg|[[gastroscopy|Upper GI endoscopy]] depicting hiatal hernia\nFile:Hiatus hernia on CT scan.jpg|A hiatal hernia as seen on CT\nFile:HiatusHerniaMark.png|A large hiatal hernia as seen on CT imaging\nFile:HiatusHerniaCorMark.png|A large hiatal hernia as seen on CT imaging\nFile:UOTW 39 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|As seen on ultrasound<ref name=UOTW39>{{cite web|title=UOTW #39 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-39/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=25 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509123328/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-39/|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 39 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|As seen on ultrasound<ref name=UOTW39/>\n</gallery>\n\n=== Classification ===\n[[Image:Hiatus hernia.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of different types of hiatus hernia.

The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. '''(D)'''\n\n'''Type III:''' Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.\n\n'''Type IV:''' Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.\n\nThe end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn the great majority of cases, sufferers experience no life-altering discomfort, and no treatment is required. If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals.<ref name=BMJ2014/> If the condition has been brought on by stress, [[stress management|stress reduction techniques]] may be prescribed, or if overweight, [[weight loss]] may be indicated.  Antisecretory drugs like [[proton pump inhibitors]] and [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.  Medications that reduce the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) pressure should be avoided.\n\nHowever, in some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause [[esophageal stricture]] or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the [[esophagus]] or is causing [[Barrett's esophagus]], [[surgery]] is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\">{{cite journal | pmc = 1422604 | pmid=12368678 | doi=10.1097/00000658-200210000-00012 | volume=236 | issue=4 | title=Paraesophageal hernias: operation or observation? |vauthors=Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW| journal=Ann Surg | pages=492\u2013500 | year=2002 }}</ref> Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include [[gas bloat syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\"/>  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.\n\nOne surgical procedure used is called [[Nissen fundoplication]].

Among them, a person with a hiatal hernia can experience dull pains in the chest, [[shortness of breath]] (caused by the hernia's effect on the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]), [[heart palpitations]] (due to irritation of the [[vagus nerve]]), and swallowed food \"balling up\" and causing discomfort in the lower esophagus until it passes on to the stomach.  In addition, hiatal hernias often result in [[heartburn]] but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.<ref name=\"BMJ2014\"/>\n\nIn most cases however, a hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms. The pain and discomfort that a patient experiences is due to the reflux of gastric acid, air, or bile. While there are several causes of [[acid reflux]], it occurs more frequently in the presence of hiatal hernia.\n\nIn newborns, the presence of [[Bochdalek hernia]] can be recognised<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chang SW, Lee HC, Yeung CY, Chan WT, Hsu CH, Kao HA, Hung HY, Chang JH, Sheu JC, Wang NL |title=A twenty-year review of early and late-presenting congenital Bochdalek diaphragmatic hernia: are they different clinical spectra? |journal=Pediatr Neonatol |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201330 |year=2010 |pmid=20225535 |doi=10.1016/S1875-9572(10)60006-X }}</ref> from symptoms such as difficulty breathing<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 23810174 | doi=10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.04.076 | volume=96 | issue=4 | title=Diaphragmatic hernia after esophagectomy in 440 patients with long-term follow-up |vauthors=Ganeshan DM, Correa AM, Bhosale P, Vaporciyan AA, Rice D, Mehran RJ, Walsh GL, Iyer R, Roth JA, Swisher SG, Hofstetter WL| journal=Ann Thorac Surg | pages=1138\u201345| year=2013 }}</ref> fast respiration, increased heart rate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A |last=Alam |first2=B.N. |last2=Chander |title=Adult bochdalek hernia |journal=MJAFI |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=284\u20136 |date=July 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0377-1237(05)80177-7 |pmid=27407781 |url=|pmc=4925637 }}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nThe following are potential causes of a hiatal hernia.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hiatal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20373379 |title = Hiatal hernia - Symptoms and causes}}</ref>\n\n* Increased pressure within the [[abdomen]] caused by:\n** Heavy lifting or bending over\n** Frequent or hard [[coughing]]\n** Hard sneezing\n** [[Vomiting|Violent vomiting]]\n** Straining during [[defecation]] (i.e., the [[Valsalva maneuver]])\n\n[[Obesity]] and age-related changes to the diaphragm are also general risk factors.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThe diagnosis of a hiatal hernia is typically made through an [[upper GI series]], [[gastroscopy|endoscopy]] or [[high resolution manometry]].\n<gallery>\nFile:HiatusHernia10.JPG|A large hiatal hernia on [[chest radiography|chest X-ray]] marked by open arrows in contrast to the heart borders marked by closed arrows\nFile:Hiatus hernia with air-fluid level.jpg|This hiatal hernia is mainly identified by an air-fluid level (labeled with arrows).\nFile:Hiatus-hernia.jpg|[[gastroscopy|Upper GI endoscopy]] depicting hiatal hernia\nFile:Hiatus hernia on CT scan.jpg|A hiatal hernia as seen on CT\nFile:HiatusHerniaMark.png|A large hiatal hernia as seen on CT imaging\nFile:HiatusHerniaCorMark.png|A large hiatal hernia as seen on CT imaging\nFile:UOTW 39 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|As seen on ultrasound<ref name=UOTW39>{{cite web|title=UOTW #39 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-39/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=25 February 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509123328/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-39/|archivedate=9 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nFile:UOTW 39 - Ultrasound of the Week 2.webm|As seen on ultrasound<ref name=UOTW39/>\n</gallery>\n\n=== Classification ===\n[[Image:Hiatus hernia.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of different types of hiatus hernia.

The gastric fundus then serves as the leading point of herniation. Although type II hernias are associated with reflux disease, their primary clinical significance lies in the potential for mechanical complications. '''(D)'''\n\n'''Type III:''' Type III hernias have elements of both types I and II hernias. With progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal ligament stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm, thereby adding a sliding element to the type II hernia.\n\n'''Type IV:''' Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal ligament, allowing other organs, such as colon, spleen, pancreas and small intestine to enter the hernia sac.\n\nThe end stage of type I and type II hernias occurs when the whole stomach migrates up into the chest by rotating 180\u00b0 around its longitudinal axis, with the cardia and pylorus as fixed points. In this situation the abnormality is usually referred to as an intrathoracic stomach.\n\n== Treatment ==\nIn the great majority of cases, sufferers experience no life-altering discomfort, and no treatment is required. If there is pain or discomfort, 3 or 4 sips of room temperature water will usually relieve the pain. Symptomatic patients should elevate the head of their beds and avoid lying down directly after meals.<ref name=BMJ2014/> If the condition has been brought on by stress, [[stress management|stress reduction techniques]] may be prescribed, or if overweight, [[weight loss]] may be indicated.  Antisecretory drugs like [[proton pump inhibitors]] and [[histamine H2 receptor|H<sub>2</sub> receptor]] blockers can be used to reduce acid secretion.  Medications that reduce the [[lower esophageal sphincter]] (LES) pressure should be avoided.\n\nHowever, in some unusual instances, as when the hiatal hernia is unusually large, or is of the paraesophageal type, it may cause [[esophageal stricture]] or severe discomfort. About 5% of hiatal hernias are paraesophageal. If symptoms from such a hernia are severe for example if chronic acid reflux threatens to severely injure the [[esophagus]] or is causing [[Barrett's esophagus]], [[surgery]] is sometimes recommended. However surgery has its own risks including death and disability, so that even for large or paraesophageal hernias, watchful waiting may on balance be safer and cause fewer problems than surgery.<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\">{{cite journal | pmc = 1422604 | pmid=12368678 | doi=10.1097/00000658-200210000-00012 | volume=236 | issue=4 | title=Paraesophageal hernias: operation or observation? |vauthors=Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW| journal=Ann Surg | pages=492\u2013500 | year=2002 }}</ref> Complications from surgical procedures to correct a hiatal hernia may include [[gas bloat syndrome]], [[dysphagia]] (trouble swallowing), [[Gastric dumping syndrome|dumping syndrome]], excessive scarring, and rarely, [[achalasia]].<ref name=\"Stylopoulos N, Gazelle GS, Rattner DW 492\u2013500\"/>  Surgical procedures sometimes fail over time, requiring a second surgery to make repairs.\n\nOne surgical procedure used is called [[Nissen fundoplication]].

He is the lead singer and lyricist of the band [[Travis (band)|Travis]], having written nearly all of the songs on their first six studio albums, with the 7th and 8th being more of a co-written work. He is based in [[Berlin]]. Healy released his debut solo album titled ''[[Wreckorder]]'' in October 2010, which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass.\n\n==Early life==\nAlthough born in [[Stafford]], [[England]], Healy grew up in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] \u2013 his parents' hometown. His mother had moved back to Scotland after divorcing her husband. Healy has said that both his mother and his grandmother were major influences on him as a child. Healy attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]] in Glasgow.\n\nAs a young child at primary school, he was awarded a book of [[Robert Burns]] poems and a certificate \"For Outstanding Singing Abilities\" after singing the old Scottish song \"Westering Home\" while dressed in a kilt. However, Healy showed no further interest in singing until his teens. His obsession with songwriting began to take shape when he got his first guitar in 1986 at the age of 13, having seen [[Roy Orbison]] perform his hit [[Pretty Woman (song)|Pretty Woman]] on ''[[The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross]]''. First songs played on the guitar were old rock'n'roll numbers like \"[[Johnny B. Goode]]\" and \"[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]\" by [[Eddie Cochran]]. His first complete song was written about the headmaster of his school, Peter Mullen, entitled \"Mr. Mullen Blues\", with a sample lyric: ''\"...and there was Pete Mullen, with his pie and beans. It was then I smelled it, it filled the room. Then some wee bugger lit a match and the whole place went Ka-BOOM...Where's your tie boy? Pick up that can. Get in line girl, do you understand...Cause his name is big Pete Mullen...And he's a man\"''. He performed it at the school talent show but failed to move the judges. He then played in several school bands.\n\n==Travis==\n{{Main|Travis (band)}}\n[[File:Travis 2007 II.jpg|thumb|right|Healy Performing With Travis.]]\nIn 1991,  [[Neil Primrose (musician)|Neil Primrose]], the drummer of Glasgow band Glass Onion, asked Healy if he would like to audition for the band; their previous singer, Catherine Maxwell, had just left the band. Healy joined the band on the same day he enrolled at the [[Glasgow School of Art]]. This band soon changed their name to [[Travis (band)|Travis]], named after the main character in the [[Wim Wenders]] movie ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]''.\n\nTravis' first single, \"[[All I Want to Do Is Rock]]\", was written by Healy while on a visit to [[Millport, Cumbrae|Millport]] on Great [[Cumbrae]], a small island in the [[Firth of Clyde]]. Going there with the sole intention of composing the best song he had ever written, Healy surprised even himself when the track was born. In spite of Healy's success as a songwriter since, he is without formal musical training. As the band has risen to prominence, Healy has continued to be [[Travis (band)|Travis]]' main songwriter, as well as the band's main spokesman and most recognisable member.\n\nTravis has twice been awarded British album of the year at the annual [[BRIT Awards]], and is credited as having paved the way for British bands such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Keane (band)|Keane]]. Travis have released eight studio albums, beginning with ''[[Good Feeling (Travis album)|Good Feeling]]'' in 1997.\n\n==Other musical activities==\nAlthough Healy predominantly plays guitar, he has also been known to write and perform with piano.\n\nIn 2010 Healy released the solo album ''[[Wreckorder]]'', which featured [[Paul McCartney]] on bass and [[Neko Case]].\n\nHe appeared on the BBC's last night of the proms celebrations in Scotland on 10 September 2011 in the Caird Hall in Dundee.\n\nHe co-wrote the song \"Here With Me\" from [[The Killers]]' 2012 album ''[[Battle Born (album)|Battle Born]]''.\n\n==Influences==\nIn interviews, Healy has talked of being influenced by songwriters such as [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Graham Nash]] (of [[The Hollies]] and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] fame). Healy has since played with both McCartney and Nash.\n\n==Praise==\nHealy's songwriting has been praised by [[Paul McCartney]], [[Elton John]] and [[Noel Gallagher]]. In 2005, [[Coldplay]] frontman [[Chris Martin]] called himself \"a poor man's Fran Healy\".\n\n==Activism==\nHealy is a part of the movement [[Make Poverty History]] and has, alongside his band, played at the [[Live 8]] concerts in both London and [[Edinburgh]]. He  participated in [[Band Aid 20]]'s re-recording of [[Do They Know It's Christmas?]], with Healy and friend [[Nigel Godrich]] also playing roles in its organization.\n\nHe has so far made two trips to [[Sudan]] with the [[Save the Children]] Organization, for which he has just launched the biggest ever global campaign<ref>[http://www.cafonline.org/default.aspx?page=15189&WT.mc_id=399 \"Fran Healy launches Save the Children\u2019s biggest ever global campaign\"], ''[[Charities Aid Foundation]]'', 2008-02-20.

Their first child, a son named Clay Kryst, was born in March 2006. After living in London for twelve years, the family moved to [[Berlin]] in February 2008, but still own a flat in London. Healy also has an apartment in [[SoHo]], New York City.\n\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s, Healy made the haircut \"[[hoxton fin]]\" famous.<ref>[http://www.he-ey.org/poll.html Travis \u2013 Melody Maker, 12 January 2000] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212180316/http://www.he-ey.org/poll.html |date=12 December 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2008, it was announced that Healy would curate a new talent compilation for [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts]].<ref>[http://jonathandeamer.com/2008/01/26/travis-lipa-compilation/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522201845/http://jonathandeamer.com/2008/01/26/travis-lipa-compilation/ |date=22 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, as a way to thank Paul McCartney for playing on his album, Healy and Nora Kryst both became [[vegetarian]], and agreed to raise their son that way as well; McCartney is a long time advocate of vegetarianism.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/05/travis-fran-healy-paul-mccartney |first=Sean |last=Michaels |title=Travis' Fran Healy goes vegetarian for Paul McCartney |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=5 January 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nHealy is a keen runner, having been a member of the Glasgow athletics club Bellahouston Harriers in his youth, and took part in the Berlin Relay Marathon in 2012.<ref>\"Fran Healy: The Man Who Ran\", ''Scottish Running Guide'', Spring 2013, p.16</ref>\n\nAt the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Healy was reported to be a supporter of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Matthews  | first = Jenny | title = Who's backing whom at the election? | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 21 April 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4464557.stm | accessdate = 2015-09-02}}</ref> In a 2013 interview, speaking of an earlier interview in which he appeared to criticise [[Alex Salmond]], he said \"I certainly came across as pro-Labour but the truth is I'm not pro-anyone.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Smith | first = Aidan | title = Inteview: Fran Healy on the new album from Travis | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | date = 17 August 2013 | url = http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/inteview-fran-healy-on-the-new-album-from-travis-1-3050981 | accessdate = 2015-09-02}}</ref>\n\n== Equipment ==\n* [[Fender Telecaster|1956 Fender Telecaster Sunburst]]\n* [[Fender Telecaster|1958 Fender Telecaster Butterscotsch]]\n* [[Fender Telecaster|1964 Fender Telecaster Black]]\n* [[Fender Telecaster|1970 Fender Telecaster Natural White]]\n* [[Fender Mustang|Fender Mustang Candy Apple Red]]\n* [[Fender Mustang|Fender Mustang Olympic White]]\n* [[Fender Thinline Telecaster|Fender Thinline Telecaster Mahogany & Sunburst]]\n* [[CF Martin & Company|Martin 12 String Acoustic]]\n* [[CF Martin & Company|Martin D-18 Acoustic]]\n* [[Vox AC30]]\n* [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall Amplifiers]]\n\n==Discography==\n{{further|Travis discography}} \n'''Studio albums'''\n*''[[Wreckorder]]'' (2010)\n\n'''Featured singles'''\n\n* \"[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]\" (2004) \u2013 as part of Band Aid 20\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100725182110/http://www.franhealy.com/ Official Fran Healy site]\n*[http://www.travisonline.com Official Travis site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723205754/http://www.metronomemusic.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=690&Itemid=96 February 2011 \u2013 M\u00e9tronome / An interview with Fran Healy (Spanish)]\n\n{{Travis}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Healy, Fran}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:British people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:British male karateka]]\n[[Category:Anti\u2013Iraq War activists]]\n[[Category:Anti-poverty advocates]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art]]\n[[Category:British expatriates in Germany]]\n[[Category:People from Stafford]]\n[[Category:British activists]]\n[[Category:British guitarists]]\n[[Category:Male guitarists]]\n[[Category:British male singers]]\n[[Category:British pop singers]]\n[[Category:British rock singers]]\n[[Category:British singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:British songwriters]]\n[[Category:Travis (band) members]]\n[[Category:Ivor Novello Award winners]]\n[[Category:British pop pianists]]\n[[Category:People educated at Holyrood Secondary School]]\n[[Category:Liberal Democrats (UK) people]]\n[[Category:British male pianists]]\n[[Category:People from SoHo, Manhattan]]\n[[Category:BNQT members]]\n", "name_user": "Eyc9a", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eActivism:grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Healy_(musician)"}

The Port received $1 million from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] to build the airport and $100,000 from the City of Tacoma. The first scheduled airline flights were [[Northwest Airlines|Northwest]] and [[Trans-Canada Air Lines|Trans-Canada]] in 1947; [[Western Airlines|Western]] and [[United Airlines|United]] moved from Boeing Field in the next couple of years, and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] moved in 1952\u201353, but [[West Coast Airlines|West Coast]] and successors Air West and [[Hughes Airwest]] stayed at Boeing Field until 1971.\n\nIn June 1951 four runways were at 45-degree angles, between {{convert|5000|and|6100|ft|m}} long; the northeast\u2013southwest and northwest\u2013southeast runways intersected just west of the north\u2013south runway that eventually became today's runway 34R. Runway 34 was lengthened to 7500&nbsp;ft in 1951, to 8500&nbsp;ft by 1958, and to 11900&nbsp;ft by 1962. The extension required the construction of an automobile tunnel for South 188th Street, which opened in July 1961.<ref>{{cite news |date=July 6, 1961 |title=Opening Set For Subway At Sea-Tac |page=12 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> Runway 34L replaced runway 2 around 1970.\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 216 departures a week on United, 80 Northwest, 35 Western, 21 Trans-Canada, 20 Pan Am, 20 [[Pacific Northern Airlines|Pacific Northern]] and 10 [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]].

The Port and the government of [[King County, Washington|King County]] adopted the Sea\u2013Tac Communities Plan in 1976 to address problems and guide future development. The Port spent more than $100 million over the next decade to buy homes and school buildings in the vicinity, and [[Soundproofing|soundproof]] others nearby. In the mid-1980s, the airport participated in the airport noise-compatibility program initiated by Congress in 1979. Airport-noise [[contour line|contours]] were developed, real estate was purchased and some homes were retrofitted to achieve [[noise mitigation]].<ref>C.

Deregulation resulted in new service to Seattle, including from [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]], then the fourth-largest U.S. airline, as well as Delta, National, and American.\n\n[[Image:SeaTacTerminalN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]] and [[United Airlines|United]] planes at the North Satellite Terminal in 2008]]\n\nAfter the death of U.S. Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Martin \"Scoop\" Jackson]] in 1983, the [[Seattle Port Commission]] voted to change the name of the airport to Henry M. Jackson International Airport. Citizens of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] interpreted the change as an insult to their community\u2014the second time in the airport's history that the port authorities had attempted to remove \"Tacoma\" from the name. The $100,000 that Tacoma had provided for the airport's construction during [[World War II]] had come with an explicit promise that the city would be included in the airport's name. An additional complicating factor was the existence of another Jackson International Airport (now [[Jackson\u2013Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport]]) in Jackson, Mississippi, whose management threatened legal action to preserve its exclusive use of the name. The controversy was resolved after polls of Seattle and Tacoma area residents indicated their preference for the original name by margins as much as 5:1. Helen Jackson, the widow of the late Senator Henry M. Jackson, expressed her desire that their family remain neutral in the debate. With a 3\u20132 vote of the Port of Seattle Commission, the name was reverted to Sea\u2013Tac in early 1984.<ref>{{cite news|title=Airport Is Reinstated|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/05/us/airport-name-is-reinstated.html|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 5, 1984|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913111612/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/05/us/airport-name-is-reinstated.html|archive-date=September 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:View from SEA Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Sea\u2013Tac Airport in September 2007 as runway 16R/34L was under construction (opened November 2008)]]\nIn the late 1980s the Port of Seattle and a council representing local county governments considered the future of air traffic in the region and predicted that airport could reach capacity by 2000. The planning committee concluded in 1992 that the best solution was to add a third runway to the airport and construct a supplemental two-runway airport in one of the neighboring counties. Members of the community opposed a third runway, as did the [[Highline School District]] and the cities of [[Des Moines, Washington|Des Moines]], [[Burien, Washington|Burien]], [[Federal Way, Washington|Federal Way]], [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]], and [[Normandy Park, Washington|Normandy Park]], but a 1994 study concluded there were no feasible sites for an additional airport. The Port of Seattle approved a plan for the new runway in 1996, prompting a lawsuit from opponents. The Port secured the necessary permits by agreeing to noise reduction programs and environmental protections. Runway opponents appealed these permits, but dropped their challenges in 2004.\n\nThe airport's Central Terminal building was renovated and expanded in 2003 in a project designed by [[Curtis W. Fentress]], of [[Fentress Architects]].\n\nThe third runway opened on November 20, 2008, with a construction cost of $1.1 billion. Parallel to the existing two, the new runway is 2500&nbsp;ft west of runway 34R, allowing landings on both in times of low visibility. The older runways are 800&nbsp;ft apart, too close to allow use of both in low visibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2008204574_thirdrunway26m.html|title=Sea\u2013Tac's third runway set to open after years of delay|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=October 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215619/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2008204574_thirdrunway26m.html|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Increased Delta Air Lines presence===\nIn 2014 [[Delta Air Lines]] announced plans to expand Seattle into a transpacific hub. Since then, Delta has added numerous international flights and dozens of domestic flights to feed those services.

The underground system moves passengers quickly within the four concourses of the central terminal and out to the two satellite terminals.\n\nAll international arrivals (except flights from cities with [[United States border preclearance|customs preclearance]]) are handled at the South Satellite Terminal, regardless of their departure terminal.\n\nIn 2019 the Port of Seattle announced plans to allow a limited number of daily non-passengers to enter the post-security zone.<ref>{{cite

The Port received $1 million from the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] to build the airport and $100,000 from the City of Tacoma. The first scheduled airline flights were [[Northwest Airlines|Northwest]] and [[Trans-Canada Air Lines|Trans-Canada]] in 1947; [[Western Airlines|Western]] and [[United Airlines|United]] moved from Boeing Field in the next couple of years, and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] moved in 1952\u201353, but [[West Coast Airlines|West Coast]] and successors Air West and [[Hughes Airwest]] stayed at Boeing Field until 1971.\n\nIn June 1951 four runways were at 45-degree angles, between {{convert|5000|and|6100|ft|m}} long; the northeast\u2013southwest and northwest\u2013southeast runways intersected just west of the north\u2013south runway that eventually became today's runway 34R. Runway 34 was lengthened to 7500&nbsp;ft in 1951, to 8500&nbsp;ft by 1958, and to 11900&nbsp;ft by 1962. The extension required the construction of an automobile tunnel for South 188th Street, which opened in July 1961.<ref>{{cite news |date=July 6, 1961 |title=Opening Set For Subway At Sea-Tac |page=12 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref> Runway 34L replaced runway 2 around 1970.\n\nThe April 1957 OAG shows 216 departures a week on United, 80 Northwest, 35 Western, 21 Trans-Canada, 20 Pan Am, 20 [[Pacific Northern Airlines|Pacific Northern]] and 10 [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]]. The first jet flights were Pan Am [[Boeing 707]]s to Honolulu via [[Portland International Airport|Portland (OR)]] in late 1959 (Pan Am's timetable for September 27 shows a weekly jet). In 1966 [[Scandinavian Airlines]] began the airport's first non-stop flight to mainland Europe (Pan Am nonstops to London began around 1961).

The Port and the government of [[King County, Washington|King County]] adopted the Sea\u2013Tac Communities Plan in 1976 to address problems and guide future development. The Port spent more than $100 million over the next decade to buy homes and school buildings in the vicinity, and [[Soundproofing|soundproof]] others nearby. In the mid-1980s, the airport participated in the airport noise-compatibility program initiated by Congress in 1979. Airport-noise [[contour line|contours]] were developed, real estate was purchased and some homes were retrofitted to achieve [[noise mitigation]].<ref>C.

Deregulation resulted in new service to Seattle, including from [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]], then the fourth-largest U.S. airline, as well as Delta, National, and American.\n\n[[Image:SeaTacTerminalN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]] and [[United Airlines|United]] planes at the North Satellite Terminal in 2008]]\n\nAfter the death of U.S. Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Martin \"Scoop\" Jackson]] in 1983, the [[Seattle Port Commission]] voted to change the name of the airport to Henry M. Jackson International Airport. Citizens of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] interpreted the change as an insult to their community\u2014the second time in the airport's history that the port authorities had attempted to remove \"Tacoma\" from the name. The $100,000 that Tacoma had provided for the airport's construction during [[World War II]] had come with an explicit promise that the city would be included in the airport's name. An additional complicating factor was the existence of another Jackson International Airport (now [[Jackson\u2013Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport]]) in Jackson, Mississippi, whose management threatened legal action to preserve its exclusive use of the name. The controversy was resolved after polls of Seattle and Tacoma area residents indicated their preference for the original name by margins as much as 5:1. Helen Jackson, the widow of the late Senator Henry M. Jackson, expressed her desire that their family remain neutral in the debate. With a 3\u20132 vote of the Port of Seattle Commission, the name was reverted to Sea\u2013Tac in early 1984.<ref>{{cite news|title=Airport Is Reinstated|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/05/us/airport-name-is-reinstated.html|agency=Associated Press|authorlink=Associated Press|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 5, 1984|access-date=February 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913111612/http://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/05/us/airport-name-is-reinstated.html|archive-date=September 13, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:View from SEA Tower.jpg|thumb|left|Sea\u2013Tac Airport in September 2007 as runway 16R/34L was under construction (opened November 2008)]]\nIn the late 1980s the Port of Seattle and a council representing local county governments considered the future of air traffic in the region and predicted that airport could reach capacity by 2000. The planning committee concluded in 1992 that the best solution was to add a third runway to the airport and construct a supplemental two-runway airport in one of the neighboring counties. Members of the community opposed a third runway, as did the [[Highline School District]] and the cities of [[Des Moines, Washington|Des Moines]], [[Burien, Washington|Burien]], [[Federal Way, Washington|Federal Way]], [[Tukwila, Washington|Tukwila]], and [[Normandy Park, Washington|Normandy Park]], but a 1994 study concluded there were no feasible sites for an additional airport. The Port of Seattle approved a plan for the new runway in 1996, prompting a lawsuit from opponents. The Port secured the necessary permits by agreeing to noise reduction programs and environmental protections. Runway opponents appealed these permits, but dropped their challenges in 2004.\n\nThe airport's Central Terminal building was renovated and expanded in 2003 in a project designed by [[Curtis W. Fentress]], of [[Fentress Architects]].\n\nThe third runway opened on November 20, 2008, with a construction cost of $1.1 billion. Parallel to the existing two, the new runway is 2500&nbsp;ft west of runway 34R, allowing landings on both in times of low visibility. The older runways are 800&nbsp;ft apart, too close to allow use of both in low visibility.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2008204574_thirdrunway26m.html|title=Sea\u2013Tac's third runway set to open after years of delay|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=October 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215619/http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2008204574_thirdrunway26m.html|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Increased Delta Air Lines presence===\nIn 2014 [[Delta Air Lines]] announced plans to expand Seattle into a transpacific hub. Since then, Delta has added numerous international flights and dozens of domestic flights to feed those services. Delta's increased presence in Seattle has been seen by some industry analysts as a response to [[United Airlines]]' transpacific hub at [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]], as well as Delta's disenchantment with its former Tokyo\u2013Narita hub.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/delta-alaska-airlines-go-to-war-over-seattle-1404076082|title=Delta, Alaska Airlines Go to War Over Seattle|last1=Carey|first1=Susan|date=June 29, 2014|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=November 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022094244/http://online.wsj.com/articles/delta-alaska-airlines-go-to-war-over-seattle-1404076082|archive-date=October 22, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDelta's expansion at Seattle\u2013Tacoma has created some controversy.

In the middle, where concourses converge, there is the \"central terminal\", an area with no passenger boarding gates, but several restaurants and retail stores. The central terminal is also the site of the airport's five [[Transportation Security Administration]] security checkpoints; one is open 24/7, three are opened based on airline schedules (one is reserved for members of the TSA PreCheck program), and one is reserved for cruise passengers and is open seasonally. Once through security, passengers have access to all gates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Security at Sea\u2013Tac|url=https://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Traveler-Updates/Pages/Security.aspx |work=Port of Seattle |accessdate=November 16, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015224317/http://www.portseattle.org/Sea-Tac/Traveler-Updates/Pages/Security.aspx |archive-date=October 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe two satellite terminal buildings, named the north and south satellite, are connected to the four concourses in the main terminal by a three-line automated people mover system called the [[Satellite Transit System]]. The underground system moves passengers quickly within the four concourses of the central terminal and out to the two satellite terminals.\n\nAll international arrivals (except flights from cities with [[United States border preclearance|customs preclearance]]) are handled at the South Satellite Terminal, regardless of their departure terminal.\n\nIn 2019 the Port of Seattle announced plans to allow a limited number of daily non-passengers to enter the post-security zone.<ref>{{cite

Four of the 37 passengers were seriously injured, but there were no fatalities.<ref>{{cite news|title=18 Injured in Seattle Plane Crash|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/16/us/18-injured-in-seattle-plane-crash.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 16, 1988|accessdate=March 2, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108131325/http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/16/us/18-injured-in-seattle-plane-crash.html|archive-date=November 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR89-02.pdf|title=Aircraft Accident Report\u2014Horizon Air, Inc., deHavilland DHC-8, Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport, Seattle, Washington, April 15, 1988|work=National Transportation Safety Board|date=March 6, 1989|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018161816/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR89-02.pdf|archivedate=October 18, 2011}}</ref>\n*[[2018 Horizon Air Q400 incident|August 10, 2018]]: An empty [[Horizon Air]] [[Bombardier Q400]] was stolen and ultimately crashed on [[Ketron Island, Washington|Ketron Island]].<ref>{{cite news |date=August 10, 2018 |title=Turboprop stolen from Sea-Tac has crashed on Ketron Island in Pierce County |url=https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article216505205.html#storylink=latest_side |work=The News Tribune |accessdate=August 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811100133/https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article216505205.html#storylink=latest_side |archive-date=August 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!--==Notes==\n{{notelist}}-->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Seattle-Tacoma International Airport}}\n{{wikivoyage|Seattle-Tacoma International Airport}}\n* {{Official website|https://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac}} at Port of Seattle website\n* [http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/aviation/AllStateAirports/Seattle_SeattleTacomaIntl.htm Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport] at [[WSDOT]] Aviation\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050204105203/http://www.historylink.org/results.cfm?keyword=st03 HistoryLink.org Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History] \u2013 Detailed articles on the history of the airport\n* {{FAA-diagram|00582}}\n* {{FAA-procedures|SEA}}\n* {{US-airport|SEA}}\n** OpenNav [http://www.opennav.com/airport/KSEA airspace and charts for KSEA]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140714192323/http://airport-car.rentals/usa/seattle/sea/ Seattle\u2013Tacoma Airport Car Rentals]\n\n<!--Navigation boxes-->\n{{Portal bar|Aviation|United States}}\n{{Airports in Washington}}\n{{Major US Airports}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seattle-Tacoma International Airport}}\n[[Category:Airports in King County, Washington]]\n[[Category:Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport|*]]\n[[Category:Seattle metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Economy of Seattle]]\n[[Category:Economy of Tacoma, Washington]]\n[[Category:Airports established in 1944]]\n[[Category:1944 establishments in Washington (state)]]\n[[Category:SeaTac, Washington|Airport]]\n[[Category:Port of Seattle]]\n", "name_user": "SounderBruce", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:updating website", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%E2%80%93Tacoma_International_Airport"}
