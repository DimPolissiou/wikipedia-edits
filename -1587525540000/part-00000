{"title_page": "Revolt of Lyon against the National Convention", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n{{Campaignbox French Revolutionary Wars Royalist Revolts}}\nThe '''revolt of Lyon against the National Convention''' was a counter-revolutionary movement in the city of [[Lyon]] during the time of the [[French Revolution]]. It was a revolt of moderates against the more radical [[National Convention]], the third government during the French Revolution. It broke out in June 1793 and was put down in December of the same year, after government forces had besieged the city.\n\n==The city confronts economic crisis==\nIn 1789 [[Lyon]] was the only city in France other than Paris with a population above 100,000. The city was a regional focus for banking, commerce and manufacturing. In terms of employment its leading industry was [[Silk|silk weaving]], which directly supported a third of the population. The silk industry in 1789 was in crisis, reflecting the wider economic crisis afflicting France at that time. The city was visited by the keen eyed English documentary writer [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] in December of that year: he estimated that 20,000 people were living from charity and starving.<ref name=\"Suratteau689\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 689.</ref>\n\n[[Octroi|Tax]] riots broke out in June 1789 and again in July 1790. Citizens hoped that the [[Estates-General of 1789]] would cancel the taxation privileges of the city's merchant oligarchs whereby the burden of taxation fell on those least able to pay, by means of the [[octroi]], a tax on basic necessities. City elections returned a local government that retained the octroi, triggering a new riot in the city. Continuing mutual intransigence over the taxation issue led to fresh riots accompanied by the ransacking of several of the houses belonging to Lyon's richest citizens along with a continuation of the taxation on necessities.<ref name=\"Suratteau689\"/>\n\nThese social conflicts bound together the interests of the [[ancien regime|old]] royalist elite under the leadership of [[:fr:Jacques Imbert-Colom\u00e8s|Jacques Imbert-Colom\u00e8s]] with those of the revolutionary patriots surrounding the local industrialist turned politician [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Plati\u00e8re|Jean-Marie Roland]]. Lower down the social scale, small-scale employers were opposed to taxation that increased living costs of employees whose salaries could therefore not be further cut, and the affected employees thereby felt closer affinity with their bosses and with the manufacturing interest in the city than with the desperate plight of the large numbers of unemployed.<ref name=\"Suratteau689\"/>\n\n==Political opposition 1790\u20131793==\n[[Image:Louis Fran\u00e7ois Perrin de Pr\u00e9cy.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Perrin de Pr\u00e9cy]], Leader of the Lyon insurgents, painted by [[Jean-Joseph Dassy]].]]\n\nDuring September 1790 the city's [[sans-culottes|working class activists]] established 32 revolutionary societies to which they gave the name \"Peoples' associations of friends of the [revolutionary] constitution\" ''(\u00abSoci\u00e9t\u00e9s populaires des Amis de la Constitution\u00bb)''. These were established in opposition to more bourgeois revolutionary societies such as \"The association of friends of the revolution\" ''(\u00abSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis de la R\u00e9volution\u00bb)'', membership of which was restricted to \"active citizens\", and the \"Friends of the constitution\" ''(\u00abAmis de la Constitution\u00bb)'', which was affiliated to the network of [[Jacobin Club]]s springing up around France in the wake of the [[French Revolution|revolution]]. A central committee, which quickly became known as the \"Central Club\" ''(\u00abClub central\u00bb)'', provided a meeting point for delegates from the city's many sectional revolutionary societies. The \"Central Club\" was initially controlled by the [[Girondist|Rolandin faction]], but quickly came under the direction of the more dynamic elements around [[Joseph Chalier]].<ref>Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 689-690.</ref>\n\nAt this time each department was governed under a local version of the national [[French Directory|directoral]] structure, and the departmental directory of [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], which since 1790 had been the department centred on Lyon, was dominated by constitutional royalists. The Rolandin [[:fr:Louis Vitet|Louis Vitet]] became mayor of Lyon in 1790. The \"Central Club\", headed up by Chalier, was strongly opposed to the approach taken by the local regime.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 690.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1792, the troop of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9|revolutionary volunteers]] passed through on their way from [[Marseilles]] to Paris, which radicalised the mood in Lyon. While the local manufacturer [[Jean-Marie Roland de La Plati\u00e8re|Roland]] was in Paris, serving as the nation's [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]], eight officers and four priests were killed.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/>\n\nIn November 1792, the girondin [[:fr:Antoine Nivi\u00e8re-Chol|Nivi\u00e8re-Chol]] was elected mayor of Lyon in place of Vitet who had been elected to sit in the [[Convention nationale|National Convention in Paris]]. Confronted by economic stagnation, he persuaded the assembly to agree an interest free loan of three million francs to be divided between the citizens in proportion to their wealth. This enraged the bourgeoisie but gained approval from royalists.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/>\n\nMatters came to a head in February 1793 when Chalier's \"Central Club\" called for the creation of a [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. The mayor was not in favour of this idea and set about mobilising troops. which provoked a popular insurrection.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/> As more time went on the hostility between the upper and lower classes only increased. [[Joseph Chalier]] started to become known as a fanatic and having too radical of policies towards the upper class in the city of [[Lyons]]. Most famously he was known for saying that towards any that opposed that he was \"prepared to exterminate all that goes by the name of aristocrat, moderate, royalist.\"<ref name=\"BaronThugut\">Baron Thugut and Austria's Response to the French Revolution\u201cFRUSTRATIONS, 1795\u201d. 1987. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zvdhx.12. FRUSTRATIONS, 1795]. In Baron Thugut and Austria's Response to the French Revolution, 170\u2013200. Princeton University Press.</ref> The combination of Joseph Chalier's extreme radicalism and the confused environment of Lyons contributed towards the general Jacobin population losing control over city affairs. \n\nTo try to defuse the crisis, Mayor Nivi\u00e8re-Chol now resigned and was re-elected. Meanwhile, allies and opponents of Chalier argued in the various \"Peoples' Associations\" which were now finding themselves opposing the \"Central Club\". Mayor Nivi\u00e8re-Chol resigned again, and was replaced by the moderate [[:fr:Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert|Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert]] who was elected in a contest against an ally of Chalier's named [[:fr:Antoine-Marie Bertrand|Antoine-Marie Bertrand]]. As news came through of the treason (in [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] eyes) of [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez|Dumouriez]], Gilibert's position became unsustainable and he was succeeded as mayor on 9 March 1793 by Bertrand: this ushered in a period of 80 days during which the city hall operated under the control of Chalier's faction.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/>\n\nA series of radical enactments followed, starting on 14 March 1793 with the establishment of a municipal bakery. Taxation was imposed on food (which disappeared from the shops) and a volunteer force was recruited. A seven-man Lyon Committee of Public Safety (taking its name and inspiration from the [[Committee of Public Safety|national institution of that name]] established under [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] a few weeks earlier in Paris) was set up on 8 April 1793. Urging further progress down the revolutionary path, on 4 May the \"Central Club\" proposed the [[guillotine]] become a permanent fixture, together with the \"Popular Associations\" and called again for the creation of a [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. They also called for a [[:fr:Comit\u00e9 de surveillance r\u00e9volutionnaire|Committee of Revolutionary Surveillance]] and of an \"Arm\u00e9e R\u00e9volutionnaire\" (Revolutionary Army) to replace the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] which had itself been established only in 1789 as a force for stability. A few days later, on 14 May 1793, the city council duly voted to create a [[Sans-culottes]] army and a 6&nbsp;million franc fund, to be created from taxing the rich, to pay for it all.<ref>Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 690-691.</ref>\n\nThey also voted for a joint meeting, every day, for representatives from the department, the district and the commune. This last measure triggered a counter-offensive. During the days that followed a growing proportion, and ultimately a majority, of delegates at these meetings opposed the municipal law of 14 May. Meanwhile, in Paris, the [[Girondist]] deputy [[:fr:Charles Antoine Chasset|Chasset]] persuaded the [[National Convention|revolutionary government]] to annul the laws originating with locally based extraordinary \"tribunals\". Events in Lyon, France's second city, were of particular concern to the national government which now sent four of its own members to Lyon, these being the deputies [[:fr:Antoine Louis Albitte|Albitte]], [[Edmond Louis Alexis Dubois-Cranc\u00e9|Dubois-Cranc\u00e9]], [[:fr:Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Gauthier des Orci\u00e8res|Gauthier]] and Nioche. Their doubts thus endorsed, virtually the entire Lyon tribunal voted down the law of 14 May 1793.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 691.</ref>\n\n==Chalier's fall==\nOn 29 May, a meeting at the Arsenal building of the various sectional delegates decided to replace the radical municipal government, which in military terms was only lightly defended. Gauthier and Nioche, two of the high-level representatives from the [[National Convention|national government]], arrived and were placed under guard. During the night Chalier's partisans were arrested and a moderate named B\u00e9nami was nominated as provisional president. The following day a man named Coindre became mayor and Judge Amp\u00e8re (better remembered by posterity as the father of the [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re|electricity pioneer, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]]) received instructions to launch the trial of [[Marie Joseph Chalier|Joseph Chalier]] and his friends.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, events in the capital were moving fast, and the violent events of [[Days of 31 May and 2 June 1793|31 May \u2013 2 June 1793]] saw the [[girondist]]s ejected from the national government, under pressure from Paris-based extremists. The newly extremist national government saw the events in Lyon as part of a more widespread Girondist revolt threatening the authority of central government: Such concerns proved well justified a couple of weeks later, as during June 1793, the municipal leaders in Lyon were linking up both with neighbouring departments and with other \"insurgent cities\" in the French south, [[Marseille]], [[N\u00eemes]] and [[Bordeaux]]. Lyon now insisted on a meeting among the potentially separatist municipalities and departments to be convened at [[Bourges]], as a form of alternative to the National Convention meeting in Paris. The municipality also had command of an army of approximately 10,000 which, though largely popular in its composition, was commanded by royalists led by the [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Perrin de Pr\u00e9cy|Count of Pr\u00e9cy]], with an aristocratic group of officers including [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri, comte de Virieu|Virieu]], Pantigny, Nolhac, Villeneuve, La Roche d'Angly and de Melon.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nThe [[National Convention]] sent [[Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet|Robert Lindet]] to negotiate with the leaders in Lyon, but he found the local representatives in the Arsenal Building in an uncompromising mood: intransigence was stiffened by the presence at Lyon of [[:fr:Jean Bonaventure Birotteau|Jean Bonaventure Birotteau]], one of the girondist deputies whom the government had so recently expelled from their own National Convention. On 30 June 1793, 207 delegates representing nearby cantons, the department and the urban districts appointed a \"Popular Republican Commission for the Public Safety of [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire]]\", which published an \"Address from the authorities duly constituted at Lyon to the armies, the citizens and all the departments in the republic\". The National Convention, its orders having been ignored by the leaders in Lyon, now promulgated a series of decrees on 12 and 14 July 1793. They declared Birotteau an outlaw, dismissed the Lyon leaders, confiscating their assets; and they ordered the [[French Revolutionary Army|Revolutionary]] [[Army of the Alps]] to re-establish in Lyon the Laws of the Republic.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nIt was in this context of exacerbated conflict that [[Marie Joseph Chalier|Chalier]] found himself condemned to death on 16 July 1793. He was guillotined the next day, followed on 31 July 1793 by Ryard, the man who had commanded the commune troops on 31 May 1793. A partisan of Chatelier's called Higgins killed himself in prison, and another of the local [[The Mountain|montagnard]] leaders was cut down in the street. At the same time within the city leadership moderate republicans were being progressively replaced by royalists.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\n==Siege of Lyon==\n{{Main|Siege of Lyon}}\n[[File:Siege of Lyon (1793).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Si\u00e8ge de Lyon]]\nThe [[Army of the Alps]], under the command of [[Fran\u00e7ois Christophe de Kellermann|Kellermann]], was engaged in a campaign in [[Savoy]] against the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] when it received the assignment to head west in order to re-establish central government authority in [[Lyon]], and was able to turn its attention to its new mission only a month later, on 10 August 1793. Two days after that, on 12 August 1793, [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire|the rebellious department]] was split into two, creating on the western side of [[Rhone|the river]] the department of [[Loire]] with its capital at [[Feurs]] and, on the eastern side, the department of [[Rh\u00f4ne (department)|Rh\u00f4ne]]. Just over a week later, on 21 August, the [[National Convention|Paris government]] sent to Lyon a high level team that included [[Georges Couthon]], a leading member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and a close colleague of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] himself. The next day the [[Army of the Alps|revolutionary army]] began its bombardment. During September Lyon was encircled, and on 29 September 1793, on the south-western side of the city, the fort at [[Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon|Sainte-Foy]] was destroyed.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nOn 3 October 1793, Couthon called upon the Lyonnais to surrender, and a truce was observed until 7 October. The various representatives leading the city held a succession of group discussions, and on 8 October they sent a team to negotiate with the government representatives, albeit in the face of the opposition of Pr\u00e9cy. At the same time two more of the defenders' forts fell, at [[:fr:Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e (Lyon)|Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e]] and [[Saint-Just (Lyon)|Saint-Just]].<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nThe next day, at dawn, Pr\u00e9cy escaped via a district in the north-west of Lyon called [[Vaise]], and went into hiding, turning up shortly afterwards in [[Switzerland]]. The city's civil authorities surrendered to the central government representatives at midday.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nOn 11 October, the government delegates decided on the destruction of the city walls. On 12 October [[Bertrand Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac|Bar\u00e8re]], a leading member of the government, put a decree through the convention that Lyon was to lose its name, and would instead be known as Ville-Affranchie ''(Liberated City)'' and would be destroyed. All the properties occupied by rich people would be demolished, leaving just the houses of the poor and the homes of duped or banished patriots, buildings specially dedicated to industry and monuments dedicated to humanity and public instruction. On the ruins of Lyon would be erected a commemorative column which would testify to posterity the crimes committed and the punishment received by the city's royalists, with the inscription \"Lyon made war on liberty: Lyon is no more!\" In the event, of 600 houses scheduled for demolition, only about fifty were actually destroyed.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\n==Retribution==\nMoving quickly, on 9 October, the government representatives had created both a \"Military Commission\", charged with judging people who had taken up arms, and a \"Commission of Peoples' Justice\" which was to judge the other \"rebels\". Three days later the [[National Convention]] itself decided to create a five-member \"Extraordinary Commission\" which they tasked with imposing \"immediate military punishment\" on the \"criminal counter-revolutionaries of Lyon\".<ref name=\"Suratteau693\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'' .....[charg\u00e9e de] \u00ab punir militairement et sans d\u00e9lai les criminels contre-r\u00e9volutionnaires de [[Lyon]], 2005, p. 693.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Joseph Fouche.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Joseph Fouch\u00e9]]\n\nThe \"Military Commission\" began work on 11 October and ordered the shooting of 106 people who had served the rebels' military leader, Pr\u00e9cy. The \"Commission of Peoples' Justice\" got off to a slower start, beginning its work only on 21 October: it ordered the guillotining of 79 people including three of the moderates who had replaced Chalier back at the end of May, B\u00e9nami, Coindre and Judge Amp\u00e8re. Both of these commissions disappeared on 9 December, by which time the centrally mandated \"Extraordinary Commission\" had taken over the application of retributive justice in Lyon.\n\nThe \"Extraordinary Commission\" sat between 30 November 1793 and 6 April 1794. It was presided over by [[:fr:Pierre-Mathieu Parein du Mesnil|General Parein]], and decided early on to substitute collective shootings for the individual firing squad killings and guillotinings which had been imposed by the earlier commissions. On 4 December 1793, 60 of the condemned were killed using three canons loaded with [[grape shot]], and a further 208 or 209 were killed in the same way the next day. The killings ordered by the Commission took place on open ground in the [[Les Brotteaux]] quarter, near to the granary at [[La Part-Dieu]]. This method of killing was abandoned on 17 December 1793.<ref name=\"Suratteau693\"/>\n\nThese massacres have been blamed both on Commission Chairman Parein and on the government representatives [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]] whom the Convention had appointed the previous month when they recalled Coulthon to Paris. The victims of the commission were a diverse and in many cases distinguished group, including a former president of [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire|the department]] called Debrost, a former member of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Revolutionary Constituent Assembly]] called Merle, the architect Morand, the executioner who had executed [[Marie Joseph Chalier|Chalier]], the Canon Roland, the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] Head Surgeon [[Pierre Bouchet]],<ref name=\"Rougier1839\">{{cite book|author=Louis-Auguste Rougier|title=Eloge historique de Claude-Antoine Bouchet, ancien chirurgien-major de l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon: lu \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine de Lyon, le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1839, par...

This variety makes an objective quantification of the executions difficult. At its final sitting on 6 April 1794<ref>The date is sometimes shown according to the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], as 17 [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]]</ref> the \"Extraordinary Commission\" itself reported that it had ordered the execution of 1,684 and the detention of a further 162: 1,682 were reported as having been acquitted.<ref>Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 693-694.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe aftermath of the revolt was highlighted by three major results: the decimated silk trade, the lower wages of the people of [[Lyon]], and the rift that was perpetuated between the people of Lyon and the [[National Convention]].\n\nThe most noticeable effect was primarily the decimation of the [[silk trade]]. Prior to the revolt, it had been mainly an artisanal industry with Lyon being one of the largest pre-Industrial Revolution centers of production in France. Although Lyon continued to lead France in industry after the unsuccessful attempt to quell federalist sentiments, the silk trade was certainly affected, and local artisans needed to rebuild. This disruption had lasting effects on the silk industry in the city that continued for years before normal business was again established.\n\nAnother result of the revolt of Lyon was the dramatic decrease in wages after the suppression of the revolt and the introduction of larger-scale industry into the process of silk production.<ref name=\"Sewell 156-161\">William Sewell. ''Work and revolution in France: The language of labor from the Old Regime to 1848'', 1980, p.156-161.</ref> The decrease of specialization of labor in the silk industry greatly lowered the wage rates themselves. With the process of industrialization that occurred, anyone could become a master silk weaver. In some circles, the decrease in wages was seen as a public injustice.1 As silk production in Lyon was being rebuilt, the emphasis was placed more and more on centralized industrial production and less on the traditional artisan system.<ref name=\"Sewell 156-161\"/>\n\nFinally, as well as disrupting the silk trade, the revolt caused a lasting rift between the people of Lyon and the radical government of Paris.<ref>Thomas Chantal and David F. Bell. ''Terror in Lyon, 1998''.</ref> A sense of resentment and outrage against Paris was especially prevalent in Lyon due to the extreme actions taken during this suppression. While Lyon did not organize another revolt, a general sense of distrust against Paris continued to permeate the population of Lyon, especially among the families of those who had been executed.<ref name=\"Palmer 153-176\">Robert Palmer. \"Chapter VII Doom at Lyons.\" ''Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution'', 2005, p. 153-176.</ref> This anti-Parisian, federalist sentiment which had existed before the revolt, and its subsequent violent suppression, persisted in the city, as many in Lyon continued to see Paris as too radically revolutionary. There is evidence that few citizens of Lyon moved away in the aftermath, likely due to the fact that most of the architecture of Lyon did remain intact, contrary to the rhetoric of the leaders of the suppression, which suggested that it should be completely destroyed.<ref name=\"Cobb 52\">Richard Cobb. ''Reactions to the French Revolution'', 1972. p. 52.</ref> Those who did move tended to migrate further south, towards Marseille and away from Paris, in an attempt to further distance themselves from Paris.<ref name=\"Cobb 52\"/>\n\nAlthough revolutionary intervention was meant as a way to increase fervor for the new republic and its politics, it only succeeded in creating a more strongly polarized environment through the violent suppression of the revolt. It did not do well in quelling counterrevolutionary thought, rather prompting these thoughts and giving direction to their complaints against the republic. If anything, the violence soured relations. By December 1794, some 2,000 people had been executed in Lyon.<ref name=\"Palmer 153-176\"/> Politically speaking, a commission of citizens from Lyon travelled to Paris to petition the National Convention, asking to be reconciled with the Republic. [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Jean-Marie Collot]] also returned to Paris to block Lyon's petition, and when the Convention turned it over to the [[Committee of Public Safety]], Collot and the other committee members did not act on it.<ref name=\"Palmer 153-176\"/>\n\n== Commemoration ==\nA list of the victims of Parein's commission is kept in a Carthusian Chapel of Penitence erected on the site of the mass shootings. It was compiled using the commission's own records.\n\nThe bones of the 209 Lyonnais shot dead on 3 December 1793 at [[Les Brotteaux|Brotteuax]] have been conserved in the crypt of the Chapel of Brotteaux in [[6th arrondissement of Lyon|the sixth arrondissement]], in the north-eastern part of central Lyon since the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon restoration]].{{NoteTag|At the end of the nineteenth century the chapel was destroyed and rebuilt twenty meters along the road.}}\n\nIn 1989, France celebrated the [[:fr:Bicentenaire de la R\u00e9volution|two hundredth anniversary]] of the [[French revolution]], and two organisations named Lyon 89 and Lyon 93<ref>L'Association Lyon 93 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e par l'ing\u00e9nieur Jacques Tournier en 190 ans apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements.

It was a revolt of moderates against the more radical [[National Convention]], the third government during the French Revolution. It broke out in June 1793 and was put down in December of the same year, after government forces had besieged the city.\n\n==The city confronts economic crisis==\nIn 1789 [[Lyon]] was the only city in France other than Paris with a population above 100,000. The city was a regional focus for banking, commerce and manufacturing. In terms of employment its leading industry was [[Silk|silk weaving]], which directly supported a third of the population. The silk industry in 1789 was in crisis, reflecting the wider economic crisis afflicting France at that time. The city was visited by the keen eyed English documentary writer [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] in December of that year: he estimated that 20,000 people were living from charity and starving.<ref name=\"Suratteau689\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 689.</ref>\n\n[[Octroi|Tax]] riots broke out in June 1789 and again in July 1790. Citizens hoped that the [[Estates-General of 1789]] would cancel the taxation privileges of the city's merchant oligarchs whereby the burden of taxation fell on those least able to pay, by means of the [[octroi]], a tax on basic necessities. City elections returned a local government that retained the octroi, triggering a new riot in the city. Continuing mutual intransigence over the taxation issue led to fresh riots accompanied by the ransacking of several of the houses belonging to Lyon's richest citizens along with a continuation of the taxation on necessities.<ref name=\"Suratteau689\"/>\n\nThese social conflicts bound together the interests of the [[ancien regime|old]] royalist elite under the leadership of [[:fr:Jacques Imbert-Colom\u00e8s|Jacques Imbert-Colom\u00e8s]] with those of the revolutionary patriots surrounding the local industrialist turned politician [[Jean-Marie Roland, vicomte de la Plati\u00e8re|Jean-Marie Roland]]. Lower down the social scale, small-scale employers were opposed to taxation that increased living costs of employees whose salaries could therefore not be further cut, and the affected employees thereby felt closer affinity with their bosses and with the manufacturing interest in the city than with the desperate plight of the large numbers of unemployed.<ref name=\"Suratteau689\"/>\n\n==Political opposition 1790\u20131793==\n[[Image:Louis Fran\u00e7ois Perrin de Pr\u00e9cy.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Perrin de Pr\u00e9cy]], Leader of the Lyon insurgents, painted by [[Jean-Joseph Dassy]].]]\n\nDuring September 1790 the city's [[sans-culottes|working class activists]] established 32 revolutionary societies to which they gave the name \"Peoples' associations of friends of the [revolutionary] constitution\" ''(\u00abSoci\u00e9t\u00e9s populaires des Amis de la Constitution\u00bb)''. These were established in opposition to more bourgeois revolutionary societies such as \"The association of friends of the revolution\" ''(\u00abSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis de la R\u00e9volution\u00bb)'', membership of which was restricted to \"active citizens\", and the \"Friends of the constitution\" ''(\u00abAmis de la Constitution\u00bb)'', which was affiliated to the network of [[Jacobin Club]]s springing up around France in the wake of the [[French Revolution|revolution]]. A central committee, which quickly became known as the \"Central Club\" ''(\u00abClub central\u00bb)'', provided a meeting point for delegates from the city's many sectional revolutionary societies. The \"Central Club\" was initially controlled by the [[Girondist|Rolandin faction]], but quickly came under the direction of the more dynamic elements around [[Joseph Chalier]].<ref>Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 689-690.</ref>\n\nAt this time each department was governed under a local version of the national [[French Directory|directoral]] structure, and the departmental directory of [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], which since 1790 had been the department centred on Lyon, was dominated by constitutional royalists. The Rolandin [[:fr:Louis Vitet|Louis Vitet]] became mayor of Lyon in 1790. The \"Central Club\", headed up by Chalier, was strongly opposed to the approach taken by the local regime.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 690.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1792, the troop of [[F\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9|revolutionary volunteers]] passed through on their way from [[Marseilles]] to Paris, which radicalised the mood in Lyon. While the local manufacturer [[Jean-Marie Roland de La Plati\u00e8re|Roland]] was in Paris, serving as the nation's [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Interior Minister]], eight officers and four priests were killed.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/>\n\nIn November 1792, the girondin [[:fr:Antoine Nivi\u00e8re-Chol|Nivi\u00e8re-Chol]] was elected mayor of Lyon in place of Vitet who had been elected to sit in the [[Convention nationale|National Convention in Paris]]. Confronted by economic stagnation, he persuaded the assembly to agree an interest free loan of three million francs to be divided between the citizens in proportion to their wealth. This enraged the bourgeoisie but gained approval from royalists.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/>\n\nMatters came to a head in February 1793 when Chalier's \"Central Club\" called for the creation of a [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. The mayor was not in favour of this idea and set about mobilising troops. which provoked a popular insurrection.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/> As more time went on the hostility between the upper and lower classes only increased. [[Joseph Chalier]] started to become known as a fanatic and having too radical of policies towards the upper class in the city of [[Lyons]]. Most famously he was known for saying that towards any that opposed that he was \"prepared to exterminate all that goes by the name of aristocrat, moderate, royalist.\"<ref name=\"BaronThugut\">Baron Thugut and Austria's Response to the French Revolution\u201cFRUSTRATIONS, 1795\u201d. 1987.

Princeton University Press.</ref> The combination of Joseph Chalier's extreme radicalism and the confused environment of Lyons contributed towards the general Jacobin population losing control over city affairs. \n\nTo try to defuse the crisis, Mayor Nivi\u00e8re-Chol now resigned and was re-elected. Meanwhile, allies and opponents of Chalier argued in the various \"Peoples' Associations\" which were now finding themselves opposing the \"Central Club\". Mayor Nivi\u00e8re-Chol resigned again, and was replaced by the moderate [[:fr:Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert|Jean-Emmanuel Gilibert]] who was elected in a contest against an ally of Chalier's named [[:fr:Antoine-Marie Bertrand|Antoine-Marie Bertrand]]. As news came through of the treason (in [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] eyes) of [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Dumouriez|Dumouriez]], Gilibert's position became unsustainable and he was succeeded as mayor on 9 March 1793 by Bertrand: this ushered in a period of 80 days during which the city hall operated under the control of Chalier's faction.<ref name=\"Suratteau690\"/>\n\nA series of radical enactments followed, starting on 14 March 1793 with the establishment of a municipal bakery. Taxation was imposed on food (which disappeared from the shops) and a volunteer force was recruited. A seven-man Lyon Committee of Public Safety (taking its name and inspiration from the [[Committee of Public Safety|national institution of that name]] established under [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] a few weeks earlier in Paris) was set up on 8 April 1793. Urging further progress down the revolutionary path, on 4 May the \"Central Club\" proposed the [[guillotine]] become a permanent fixture, together with the \"Popular Associations\" and called again for the creation of a [[Revolutionary Tribunal]]. They also called for a [[:fr:Comit\u00e9 de surveillance r\u00e9volutionnaire|Committee of Revolutionary Surveillance]] and of an \"Arm\u00e9e R\u00e9volutionnaire\" (Revolutionary Army) to replace the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] which had itself been established only in 1789 as a force for stability. A few days later, on 14 May 1793, the city council duly voted to create a [[Sans-culottes]] army and a 6&nbsp;million franc fund, to be created from taxing the rich, to pay for it all.<ref>Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 690-691.</ref>\n\nThey also voted for a joint meeting, every day, for representatives from the department, the district and the commune. This last measure triggered a counter-offensive. During the days that followed a growing proportion, and ultimately a majority, of delegates at these meetings opposed the municipal law of 14 May. Meanwhile, in Paris, the [[Girondist]] deputy [[:fr:Charles Antoine Chasset|Chasset]] persuaded the [[National Convention|revolutionary government]] to annul the laws originating with locally based extraordinary \"tribunals\". Events in Lyon, France's second city, were of particular concern to the national government which now sent four of its own members to Lyon, these being the deputies [[:fr:Antoine Louis Albitte|Albitte]], [[Edmond Louis Alexis Dubois-Cranc\u00e9|Dubois-Cranc\u00e9]], [[:fr:Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois Gauthier des Orci\u00e8res|Gauthier]] and Nioche. Their doubts thus endorsed, virtually the entire Lyon tribunal voted down the law of 14 May 1793.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 691.</ref>\n\n==Chalier's fall==\nOn 29 May, a meeting at the Arsenal building of the various sectional delegates decided to replace the radical municipal government, which in military terms was only lightly defended. Gauthier and Nioche, two of the high-level representatives from the [[National Convention|national government]], arrived and were placed under guard. During the night Chalier's partisans were arrested and a moderate named B\u00e9nami was nominated as provisional president. The following day a man named Coindre became mayor and Judge Amp\u00e8re (better remembered by posterity as the father of the [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re|electricity pioneer, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re]]) received instructions to launch the trial of [[Marie Joseph Chalier|Joseph Chalier]] and his friends.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, events in the capital were moving fast, and the violent events of [[Days of 31 May and 2 June 1793|31 May \u2013 2 June 1793]] saw the [[girondist]]s ejected from the national government, under pressure from Paris-based extremists. The newly extremist national government saw the events in Lyon as part of a more widespread Girondist revolt threatening the authority of central government: Such concerns proved well justified a couple of weeks later, as during June 1793, the municipal leaders in Lyon were linking up both with neighbouring departments and with other \"insurgent cities\" in the French south, [[Marseille]], [[N\u00eemes]] and [[Bordeaux]]. Lyon now insisted on a meeting among the potentially separatist municipalities and departments to be convened at [[Bourges]], as a form of alternative to the National Convention meeting in Paris. The municipality also had command of an army of approximately 10,000 which, though largely popular in its composition, was commanded by royalists led by the [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Perrin de Pr\u00e9cy|Count of Pr\u00e9cy]], with an aristocratic group of officers including [[Stanislas Marie Adelaide, comte de Clermont-Tonnerre]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Henri, comte de Virieu|Virieu]], Pantigny, Nolhac, Villeneuve, La Roche d'Angly and de Melon.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nThe [[National Convention]] sent [[Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet|Robert Lindet]] to negotiate with the leaders in Lyon, but he found the local representatives in the Arsenal Building in an uncompromising mood: intransigence was stiffened by the presence at Lyon of [[:fr:Jean Bonaventure Birotteau|Jean Bonaventure Birotteau]], one of the girondist deputies whom the government had so recently expelled from their own National Convention. On 30 June 1793, 207 delegates representing nearby cantons, the department and the urban districts appointed a \"Popular Republican Commission for the Public Safety of [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire]]\", which published an \"Address from the authorities duly constituted at Lyon to the armies, the citizens and all the departments in the republic\". The National Convention, its orders having been ignored by the leaders in Lyon, now promulgated a series of decrees on 12 and 14 July 1793. They declared Birotteau an outlaw, dismissed the Lyon leaders, confiscating their assets; and they ordered the [[French Revolutionary Army|Revolutionary]] [[Army of the Alps]] to re-establish in Lyon the Laws of the Republic.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nIt was in this context of exacerbated conflict that [[Marie Joseph Chalier|Chalier]] found himself condemned to death on 16 July 1793. He was guillotined the next day, followed on 31 July 1793 by Ryard, the man who had commanded the commune troops on 31 May 1793. A partisan of Chatelier's called Higgins killed himself in prison, and another of the local [[The Mountain|montagnard]] leaders was cut down in the street. At the same time within the city leadership moderate republicans were being progressively replaced by royalists.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\n==Siege of Lyon==\n{{Main|Siege of Lyon}}\n[[File:Siege of Lyon (1793).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Si\u00e8ge de Lyon]]\nThe [[Army of the Alps]], under the command of [[Fran\u00e7ois Christophe de Kellermann|Kellermann]], was engaged in a campaign in [[Savoy]] against the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] when it received the assignment to head west in order to re-establish central government authority in [[Lyon]], and was able to turn its attention to its new mission only a month later, on 10 August 1793. Two days after that, on 12 August 1793, [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire|the rebellious department]] was split into two, creating on the western side of [[Rhone|the river]] the department of [[Loire]] with its capital at [[Feurs]] and, on the eastern side, the department of [[Rh\u00f4ne (department)|Rh\u00f4ne]]. Just over a week later, on 21 August, the [[National Convention|Paris government]] sent to Lyon a high level team that included [[Georges Couthon]], a leading member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] and a close colleague of [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] himself. The next day the [[Army of the Alps|revolutionary army]] began its bombardment. During September Lyon was encircled, and on 29 September 1793, on the south-western side of the city, the fort at [[Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon|Sainte-Foy]] was destroyed.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nOn 3 October 1793, Couthon called upon the Lyonnais to surrender, and a truce was observed until 7 October. The various representatives leading the city held a succession of group discussions, and on 8 October they sent a team to negotiate with the government representatives, albeit in the face of the opposition of Pr\u00e9cy. At the same time two more of the defenders' forts fell, at [[:fr:Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e (Lyon)|Saint-Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e]] and [[Saint-Just (Lyon)|Saint-Just]].<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nThe next day, at dawn, Pr\u00e9cy escaped via a district in the north-west of Lyon called [[Vaise]], and went into hiding, turning up shortly afterwards in [[Switzerland]]. The city's civil authorities surrendered to the central government representatives at midday.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\nOn 11 October, the government delegates decided on the destruction of the city walls. On 12 October [[Bertrand Bar\u00e8re de Vieuzac|Bar\u00e8re]], a leading member of the government, put a decree through the convention that Lyon was to lose its name, and would instead be known as Ville-Affranchie ''(Liberated City)'' and would be destroyed. All the properties occupied by rich people would be demolished, leaving just the houses of the poor and the homes of duped or banished patriots, buildings specially dedicated to industry and monuments dedicated to humanity and public instruction. On the ruins of Lyon would be erected a commemorative column which would testify to posterity the crimes committed and the punishment received by the city's royalists, with the inscription \"Lyon made war on liberty: Lyon is no more!\" In the event, of 600 houses scheduled for demolition, only about fifty were actually destroyed.<ref name=\"Suratteau691\"/>\n\n==Retribution==\nMoving quickly, on 9 October, the government representatives had created both a \"Military Commission\", charged with judging people who had taken up arms, and a \"Commission of Peoples' Justice\" which was to judge the other \"rebels\". Three days later the [[National Convention]] itself decided to create a five-member \"Extraordinary Commission\" which they tasked with imposing \"immediate military punishment\" on the \"criminal counter-revolutionaries of Lyon\".<ref name=\"Suratteau693\">Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'' .....[charg\u00e9e de] \u00ab punir militairement et sans d\u00e9lai les criminels contre-r\u00e9volutionnaires de [[Lyon]], 2005, p. 693.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Joseph Fouche.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Joseph Fouch\u00e9]]\n\nThe \"Military Commission\" began work on 11 October and ordered the shooting of 106 people who had served the rebels' military leader, Pr\u00e9cy. The \"Commission of Peoples' Justice\" got off to a slower start, beginning its work only on 21 October: it ordered the guillotining of 79 people including three of the moderates who had replaced Chalier back at the end of May, B\u00e9nami, Coindre and Judge Amp\u00e8re. Both of these commissions disappeared on 9 December, by which time the centrally mandated \"Extraordinary Commission\" had taken over the application of retributive justice in Lyon.\n\nThe \"Extraordinary Commission\" sat between 30 November 1793 and 6 April 1794. It was presided over by [[:fr:Pierre-Mathieu Parein du Mesnil|General Parein]], and decided early on to substitute collective shootings for the individual firing squad killings and guillotinings which had been imposed by the earlier commissions. On 4 December 1793, 60 of the condemned were killed using three canons loaded with [[grape shot]], and a further 208 or 209 were killed in the same way the next day. The killings ordered by the Commission took place on open ground in the [[Les Brotteaux]] quarter, near to the granary at [[La Part-Dieu]]. This method of killing was abandoned on 17 December 1793.<ref name=\"Suratteau693\"/>\n\nThese massacres have been blamed both on Commission Chairman Parein and on the government representatives [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]] and [[Joseph Fouch\u00e9]] whom the Convention had appointed the previous month when they recalled Coulthon to Paris. The victims of the commission were a diverse and in many cases distinguished group, including a former president of [[Rh\u00f4ne-et-Loire|the department]] called Debrost, a former member of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Revolutionary Constituent Assembly]] called Merle, the architect Morand, the executioner who had executed [[Marie Joseph Chalier|Chalier]], the Canon Roland, the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon|H\u00f4tel-Dieu]] Head Surgeon [[Pierre Bouchet]],<ref name=\"Rougier1839\">{{cite book|author=Louis-Auguste Rougier|title=Eloge historique de Claude-Antoine Bouchet, ancien chirurgien-major de l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Lyon: lu \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine de Lyon, le 30 d\u00e9cembre 1839, par...

At its final sitting on 6 April 1794<ref>The date is sometimes shown according to the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], as 17 [[Germinal (French Republican Calendar)|Germinal]]</ref> the \"Extraordinary Commission\" itself reported that it had ordered the execution of 1,684 and the detention of a further 162: 1,682 were reported as having been acquitted.<ref>Jean-Ren\u00e9 Suratteau, \u00ab Lyon \u00bb, in [[Albert Soboul]], ''Dictionnaire historique de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 2005, p. 693-694.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe aftermath of the revolt was highlighted by three major results: the decimated silk trade, the lower wages of the people of [[Lyon]], and the rift that was perpetuated between the people of Lyon and the [[National Convention]].\n\nThe most noticeable effect was primarily the decimation of the [[silk trade]]. Prior to the revolt, it had been mainly an artisanal industry with Lyon being one of the largest pre-Industrial Revolution centers of production in France. Although Lyon continued to lead France in industry after the unsuccessful attempt to quell federalist sentiments, the silk trade was certainly affected, and local artisans needed to rebuild. This disruption had lasting effects on the silk industry in the city that continued for years before normal business was again established.\n\nAnother result of the revolt of Lyon was the dramatic decrease in wages after the suppression of the revolt and the introduction of larger-scale industry into the process of silk production.<ref name=\"Sewell 156-161\">William Sewell. ''Work and revolution in France: The language of labor from the Old Regime to 1848'', 1980, p.156-161.</ref> The decrease of specialization of labor in the silk industry greatly lowered the wage rates themselves. With the process of industrialization that occurred, anyone could become a master silk weaver. In some circles, the decrease in wages was seen as a public injustice.1 As silk production in Lyon was being rebuilt, the emphasis was placed more and more on centralized industrial production and less on the traditional artisan system.<ref name=\"Sewell 156-161\"/>\n\nFinally, as well as disrupting the silk trade, the revolt caused a lasting rift between the people of Lyon and the radical government of Paris.<ref>Thomas Chantal and David F. Bell. ''Terror in Lyon, 1998''.</ref> A sense of resentment and outrage against Paris was especially prevalent in Lyon due to the extreme actions taken during this suppression. While Lyon did not organize another revolt, a general sense of distrust against Paris continued to permeate the population of Lyon, especially among the families of those who had been executed.<ref name=\"Palmer 153-176\">Robert Palmer. \"Chapter VII Doom at Lyons.\" ''Twelve Who Ruled: The Year of the Terror in the French Revolution'', 2005, p. 153-176.</ref> This anti-Parisian, federalist sentiment which had existed before the revolt, and its subsequent violent suppression, persisted in the city, as many in Lyon continued to see Paris as too radically revolutionary. There is evidence that few citizens of Lyon moved away in the aftermath, likely due to the fact that most of the architecture of Lyon did remain intact, contrary to the rhetoric of the leaders of the suppression, which suggested that it should be completely destroyed.<ref name=\"Cobb 52\">Richard Cobb. ''Reactions to the French Revolution'', 1972. p. 52.</ref> Those who did move tended to migrate further south, towards Marseille and away from Paris, in an attempt to further distance themselves from Paris.<ref name=\"Cobb 52\"/>\n\nAlthough revolutionary intervention was meant as a way to increase fervor for the new republic and its politics, it only succeeded in creating a more strongly polarized environment through the violent suppression of the revolt. It did not do well in quelling counterrevolutionary thought, rather prompting these thoughts and giving direction to their complaints against the republic. If anything, the violence soured relations. By December 1794, some 2,000 people had been executed in Lyon.<ref name=\"Palmer 153-176\"/> Politically speaking, a commission of citizens from Lyon travelled to Paris to petition the National Convention, asking to be reconciled with the Republic. [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois|Jean-Marie Collot]] also returned to Paris to block Lyon's petition, and when the Convention turned it over to the [[Committee of Public Safety]], Collot and the other committee members did not act on it.<ref name=\"Palmer 153-176\"/>\n\n== Commemoration ==\nA list of the victims of Parein's commission is kept in a Carthusian Chapel of Penitence erected on the site of the mass shootings. It was compiled using the commission's own records.\n\nThe bones of the 209 Lyonnais shot dead on 3 December 1793 at [[Les Brotteaux|Brotteuax]] have been conserved in the crypt of the Chapel of Brotteaux in [[6th arrondissement of Lyon|the sixth arrondissement]], in the north-eastern part of central Lyon since the [[Bourbon Restoration|Bourbon restoration]].{{NoteTag|At the end of the nineteenth century the chapel was destroyed and rebuilt twenty meters along the road.}}\n\nIn 1989, France celebrated the [[:fr:Bicentenaire de la R\u00e9volution|two hundredth anniversary]] of the [[French revolution]], and two organisations named Lyon 89 and Lyon 93<ref>L'Association Lyon 93 a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e par l'ing\u00e9nieur Jacques Tournier en 190 ans apr\u00e8s les \u00e9v\u00e9nements.

In most jurisdictions, a cyclist is considered a driver/operator of a vehicle afforded the same rights as the driver of a motor vehicle; however, in some jurisdictions cyclists are further restricted by laws such as \"ride as far right [or left] as practicable.\" From a cyclist's point of view, \"practicable\" includes safety, and safety is noted in many of these laws through exceptions; however, many law enforcement, judges, motoring public and even cyclists stop reading at \"as far right.\" Most motor travel lanes adjacent to a bike lane are only {{convert|10|-|11|ft}} wide, so if a cyclist has to use that lane to avoid hazards in the bike lane, it is too narrow to safely share with passing traffic and he/she should ride in a \"lane-control\" method as is allowed by most of these ordinances.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/utah/ut-code/utah_code_41-6a-1105 |title=Utah Code 41-6a-1105.

During his teenage years he worked briefly as a [[Male prostitution|rent-boy]]. He then spent 30 years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style. His one-man stage show was a long-running hit both in Britain and America and he also appeared in films and on TV. Crisp defied convention by criticising both [[gay liberation]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n'''Denis Charles Pratt''' was born in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], South London, on [[Christmas Day]] 1908, the fourth child of solicitor Spencer Charles Pratt (1871\u20131931) and former [[governess]] Frances Marion Pratt (n\u00e9e Phillips; 1873\u20131960).<ref>1911 Census for England and Wales, The National Archives (findmypast.co.uk): RG number: RG14; Piece: 2929; Reference: RG14PN2929, RG78PN101; Registration District: Epsom; Sub District: Carshalton; Enumeration District: 7; Parish: Carshalton; Address: Wolverton, Egmont Road, Sutton; County: Surrey.</ref> His elder siblings were Katherine (1901\u20131976), Gerald (1902\u20131983) and Lewis (1907\u20131968). He changed his name to '''Quentin Crisp''' in his twenties after leaving home and expressed a feminine appearance to a degree that shocked contemporary Londoners and provoked [[Homophobia|homophobic]] attacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy his own account, Crisp was \u2018effeminate\u2019 in his demeanour from an early age resulting in him being teased while at [[Kingswood House School]]<ref name=\"qandp\">{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=Andrew |title=Quentin and Philip |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-78051-0 |pages=}}</ref> in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], from which he won a scholarship to [[Denstone College]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]], in 1922. After leaving school in 1926, Crisp studied journalism at [[King's College London]], but failed to graduate in 1928, going on to take art classes at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].\n\nAround this time, Crisp began visiting the caf\u00e9s of [[Soho]] \u2013 his favourite being The Black Cat in [[Old Compton Street]] \u2013 meeting other young gay men and [[Male prostitution|rent-boys]], and experimenting with make-up and [[transvestism|women's clothes]]. For six months he worked as a prostitute;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/211644.stm \"Crisp: The naked civil servant\"], BBC News, November twenty-first, 1999</ref> in a 1999 interview,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} he said he was looking for love, but found only degradation.\n\nCrisp left home to move to the [[central London|centre of London]] at the end of 1930, and after dwelling in a succession of flats, found a [[Bedsit|bed-sitting]] room in Denbigh Street, [[Pimlico]], where he \"held court with London's brightest and roughest characters.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His \u2018outlandish\u2019 appearance \u2013 he wore bright make-up, dyed his long hair crimson, painted his fingernails and wore sandals to display his painted toe-nails \u2013 brought admiration and curiosity from some quarters, but generally attracted hostility and violence from strangers passing him in the streets.\n\n===Middle years===\nCrisp attempted to join the [[British army]] at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but was rejected and declared exempt by the medical board on the grounds that he was \"suffering from sexual perversion\". She remained in London during [[The Blitz|the 1941 Blitz]], stocked up on cosmetics, purchased five pounds of [[henna]] and paraded through the black-out, picking up [[GI (term)|G.I.s]], whose kindness and open-mindedness inspired her love of all things American.\n\nIn 1940, she moved into a first-floor flat at 129 Beaufort Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a bed-sitting room that she occupied until she emigrated to the United States in 1981. In the intervening years she never attempted any housework, writing famously in her memoir ''The Naked Civil Servant'': \"After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.\"<ref>Crisp, Quentin. ''The Naked Civil Servant''. Penguin Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nCrisp left her job as an [[technical drawing|engineer's tracer]] in 1942 to become a model in [[life class]]es in London and the [[Home Counties]]. She continued posing for artists for the next 30 years.\n\nCrisp had published three short books by the time she came to write ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' at the urging of her agent, [[Donald Carroll]]. Crisp wanted to call it ''I Reign in Hell'', a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven\"), but Carroll insisted on ''The Naked Civil Servant'', an insistence that later gave him pause when he offered the manuscript to [[Tom Maschler]] of Jonathan Cape on the same day that [[Desmond Morris]] delivered ''[[The Naked Ape]]''. The book was published in 1968 to generally good reviews. Subsequently, Crisp was approached by the documentary-maker [[Denis Mitchell (filmmaker)|Denis Mitchell]] to be the subject of a short film in which she was expected to talk about her life, voice her opinions and sit around in her flat filing her nails.\n\n===Fame===\n[[File:QuentinCrisp(Q&A)RossBennettLewisPHOTO.png|thumb|right|Quentin Crisp during a Q&A session for her book and the film ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'']]\nIn 1975, the television version of ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' was broadcast on British and US television, making both actor [[John Hurt]] and Crisp herself into stars. This success launched Crisp in a new direction: that of performer and tutor. She devised a one-person show and began touring the country with it. The first half of the show was an entertaining monologue loosely based on her memoirs, while the second half was a question-and-answer session with Crisp picking the audience's written questions at random and answering them in an amusing manner.\n\nWhen her autobiography was reprinted in 1975, following the success of the television version of ''The Naked Civil Servant'', ''[[Gay News]]'' commented that the book should have been published posthumously (Crisp said that this was their polite way of telling him to drop dead). Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said she had met Crisp in 1974, and alleged that she was not sympathetic to the [[Gay Liberation]] movement of the time. Tatchell said Crisp asked him: \"What do you want liberation from? What is there to be proud of? I don't believe in rights for homosexuals.\"<ref name=\"Tatchell\">Peter Tatchell [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-tatchell-quentin-crisp-was-no-gay-hero-1852122.html \"Quentin Crisp was no gay hero\"], ''The Independent'' 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nBy now, Crisp was a theatre-filling [[raconteur]]: her one-person show sold out the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London in 1978. She then took the show to New York. Her first stay in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] coincided with a fire, a robbery, and the death of [[Nancy Spungen]]. Crisp decided to move to New York permanently and set about making arrangements. In 1981, she arrived with few possessions and found a small apartment on East 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n[[File:Quentin Crisp's Signature.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The title page of Crisp's 1981 book, How to Become a Virgin. Ms. Crisp's handwritten dedication for a fan appears beneath the title, and reads: \"To Graham from Quentin Crisp\". The dedication is written in a large, round hand with a circle dotting each I. |Quentin Crisp's handwriting and signature, from a dedication on the title page of ''How To Become A Virgin'' (1981)]]\n\nAs she had done in London, Crisp allowed her telephone number to be listed in the [[telephone directory]] and saw it as her duty to converse with anyone who called her. For the first twenty or so years of owning her own telephone, she habitually answered calls with the phrase: \"Yes, Lord?\" (\"Just in case,\" she once said.) Later on, she changed it to \"Oh yes?\", in a querulous tone of voice. Her openness to strangers extended to accepting dinner invitations from almost anyone. Whilst she expected the host would pay for dinner, Crisp did her best to \"sing for his supper\" by regaling her host with wonderful stories and yarns, much as she did in her theatrical performances. Dinner with her was said to be one of the best shows in New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nShe continued to perform her one-person show, published books on the importance of contemporary manners as a means of social inclusiveness (as opposed to etiquette, which she claimed is socially exclusive), and supported herself by accepting social invitations, and writing film reviews and columns for UK and US magazines and newspapers. She said that provided one could exist on peanuts and champagne, one could quite easily live by going to every [[cocktail party]], [[premiere]] and first night to which one was invited.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Crisp 1982.jpg|thumb |alt=In this sepia-toned photograph, a straight-faced Quentin Crisp gestures from an ornate, high-backed chair. A large, red handkerchief flops from her jacket pocket. |Quentin Crisp in a performance of her one-person show, ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'', in [[Birmingham]], 1982]]\nCrisp also acted on television and in films. She made her debut as a film actor in the [[Royal College of Art]]'s low-budget production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1976). Crisp played [[Polonius]] in the 65-minute adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, supported by [[Helen Mirren]], who doubled as [[Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]. She subsequently appeared in the 1985 film ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'', which brought her into contact with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who played the lead role of Baron [[Frankenstein]]. Crisp also appeared on the television show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' in the 1987 episode \"First Light\", and as the narrator of director [[Richard Kwietniowski]]'s short film ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol (film)|Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1988), based on the [[The Ballad of Reading Gaol|poem]] by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Four years later, she was cast in a lead role, and got top billing, in the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[Topsy and Bunker: The Cat Killers]]'', playing the door-man of a flea-bag hotel in a run-down neighbourhood, quite like the one she dwelled in. According to director [[Thomas Massengale]], Crisp was a delight to work with.\n\nThe 1990s would prove to be her most prolific decade as an actor, as more and more directors offered her roles. In 1992, she was persuaded by [[Sally Potter]] to play [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''. Although she found the role taxing, she won acclaim for a dignified and touching performance. Crisp next had an uncredited cameo in the 1993 AIDS drama ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]].'' Crisp accepted some other small bit parts and cameos, such as a pageant judge in 1995's ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. Crisp's last role was in an independent film, ''American Mod'' (1999), while her last full-feature film was ''HomoHeights'' (also released as ''Happy Heights'', 1996). He was chosen by [[Channel 4]] to deliver the first ''[[Alternative Christmas message|Alternative Christmas Speech]]'', a counterpoint to the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Christmas speech]], in 1993.\n\n===Last years===\nCrisp remained fiercely independent and unpredictable into old age. She caused controversy and confusion in the gay community by jokingly calling AIDS \"a fad\", and homosexuality \"a terrible disease\".<ref name=\"Tatchell\" /> She was continually in demand from journalists requiring a sound-bite, and throughout the 1990s her commentary was sought on any number of topics.\n\nCrisp was a stern critic of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and her attempts to gain public sympathy following her divorce from [[Prince Charles]]. She stated: \"I always thought Diana was such trash and got what she deserved. She was Lady Diana before she was Princess Diana so she knew the racket. She knew that royal marriages have nothing to do with love. You marry a man and you stand beside him on public occasions and you wave and for that you never have a financial worry until the day you die.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Fountain |first=Tim |authorlink= |title=Resident Alien: Quentin Crisp Explains It All |year=1999 |publisher=Nick Hern Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1 85459 657 8 |page=20}}</ref> Following [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in 1997]], she commented that it was perhaps the princess's \"fast and shallow\" lifestyle that led to her demise: \"She could have been Queen of England \u2013 and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behaviour! Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.\"<ref>''Atlanta Southern Voice'', 1 July 1999</ref>\n\nIn 1995, she was among the many people interviewed for ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', a historical documentary addressing how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In her third volume of memoirs, ''Resident Alien'', published in the same year, Crisp stated that she was close to the end of her life, though she continued to make public appearances, and in June of that year she was one of the guest entertainers at the second [[Pride Scotia#1996|Pride Scotland]] festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1997, Crisp was crowned king of the [[Beaux-Arts Ball]] run by the Beaux Arts Society. She presided alongside Queen Audrey Kargere, Prince George Bettinger and Princess Annette Hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192849/http://beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |archivedate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, she celebrated her ninetieth birthday performing the opening night of his one-man show, ''An Evening with Quentin Crisp'', at The Intar Theatre on Forty-Second Street in New York City (produced by [[John Glines]] of [[The Glines]] organisation).\n\nAt the age of ninety, Crisp came to the realisation that she was a [[trans woman]] rather than a gay man. In ''The Last Word'', published posthumously, Crisp said, \"The only thing in my life I have wanted and didn't get was to be a woman. It will be my life's biggest regret. If the operation had been available and cheap when I was young, say when I was twenty-five or twenty-six, I would have jumped at the chance. My life would have been much simpler as a result\".<ref name=pink>Crisp, Quentin. The Last Word. MB Books LLC, 2018 https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/21/quentin-crisp-reflects-on-trans-identity-in-exclusive-final-autobiography/</ref>\n\n===Death===\nCrisp died of a heart attack in November 1999, nearly one month before his 91st birthday, in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] in [[Manchester]], on the eve of a nationwide revival of his one-man show. A humorous pact he had made with [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] to live to be a century old, with a decade off for good behaviour, proved [[prophecy|prophetic]]. He was cremated with a minimum of ceremony as he had requested, and his ashes were flown back to Phillip Ward in New York.\n\nHe bequeathed his rights in three specific books to his respective collaborators Phillip Ward (for Crisp's final book ''The Last Word'' (and the book ''And One More Thing'') \u2013 formerly titled ''Dusty Answers''), Guy Kettelhack (for ''The Wit and Wisdom of Quentin Crisp'') and John Hofsess (for ''Manners from Heaven''). He then bequeathed all future UK-only income (but not the [[copyright]]s, which belong to Stedman Mays, Mary Tahan and Phillip Ward, and are managed by Ward) from his remaining literary estate (including ''The Naked Civil Servant'') to the two men he considered to have had the greatest influence on his career: Richard Gollner, his long-time agent, and Donald Carroll, a former agent he has worked with.\n\n===Posthumous works===\nIn the two years before his death (1997\u20131999), Crisp had been compiling a work that was to initially be titled ''The Dusty Answers'' with Phillip Ward. Crisp and Ward developed material for this book through many hours of recorded interviews, which was necessary because Crisp had lost the use of his left hand and was unable to use a typewriter or computer. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished for eighteen years after Crisp's death, because Ward found it emotionally difficult to transcribe Crisp's words. A chance meeting with Laurence Watts, who interviewed Ward for ''[[Pink News]]'', led to a partnership that would see them co-edit Crisp's remaining work. \n \nOn 21 November 2017, MB Books published ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'' by Crisp, edited by Ward and Watts. Whereas ''The Naked Civil Servant'' made Crisp famous and ''How To Become A Virgin'' detailed that fame, and his move to and life in New York, ''The Last Word'' was written as a goodbye to the world, with Crisp knowing the end was near. In it he recounts several previously untold stories from his life, walks the reader through his journey from obscurity, and reflects on his philosophy. He also describes the realisation that he was a trans woman and not a gay man.<ref name=pink/>\n \nFinally, on 1 January 2019, MB Books published ''And One More Thing'' by Crisp, a companion book to ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'', again edited by Ward and Watts. This book contains material that the editors believed did not fit into ''The Last Word''. In ''And One More Thing'', Crisp primarily shares his views on other people, their lives and their opinions, from [[Flapper|flapper girls]] to [[Monica Lewinsky]], and from the [[British Royal Family]] to [[Walt Disney]]. Also included is the script for Quentin's Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 1993, the script of his one-man show ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'' and his collected poetry.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Ella Guru, Quentin Crisp.jpg|thumb |alt=This colorful portrait focuses on Crisp's face (under his trademark [[fedora]]), but the viewer can still glimpse a stylish shirt collar.

He had jokingly remarked \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.\" In late 1986, Sting visited Crisp in his apartment and was told over dinner \u2013 and the next three days \u2013 what life had been like for a homosexual man in the largely homophobic Great Britain of the 1920s to the 1960s. Sting was both shocked and fascinated and decided to write the song. It includes the lines:\n\n:It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\n:Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\nSting says, \"Well, it's partly about me and partly about Quentin. Again, I was looking for a metaphor. Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.crisperanto.org/recordings/sting.html MR. STING ON ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK], THE QUENTIN CRISP ARCHIVES: ''Crisperanto.org''. Retrieved on 4 February 2014.</ref>\n\nCrisp was the subject of a photographic portrait by [[Herb Ritts]] and was also chronicled in [[Andy Warhol]]'s diaries.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', singer [[Boy George]] discusses how he had felt an affinity towards Crisp during his childhood, as they faced similar problems as young homosexual people living in homophobic surroundings.\n\nCrisp was the subject of the play ''Resident Alien'', by Tim Fountain, which starred his friend [[Bette Bourne]] in 1999. The play opened at the [[Bush Theatre]] in London and transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 2001 where it won two [[Obie Awards|Obies]] (for performance and design). It went on to win a Herald Angel (Best actor) at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] in 2002; subsequent productions have been seen across the US and Australia. A film of the same name was released by [[David Whitten|Greycat Films]] in 1990.\n\nThe song \"The Ballad of Jack Eric Williams (and Other Three-Named Composers)\" from [[William Finn]]'s song-cycle [[Elegies (musical)|''Elegies'']] refers to Crisp, whilst the 1981 [[Synth-pop|synthpop]] song \"No G.D.M\" by German [[Electropop|electro]] band [[Gina X Performance]] is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2009, a television sequel to ''The Naked Civil Servant'' was broadcast. Entitled ''[[An Englishman in New York (film)|An Englishman in New York]]'', the production documented Crisp's later years in Manhattan. Thirty-four years after his first award-winning performance as Crisp, [[John Hurt]] returned to play him again. Other co-stars included [[Denis O'Hare]] as Phillip Steele (an amalgam character based on Crisp's friends Phillip Ward and Tom Steele), [[Jonathan Tucker]] as artist [[Patrick Angus]], [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Connie Clausen]]. The production was filmed in New York in August 2008 and completed in London in October 2008. The film was directed by British director [[Richard Laxton]], written by Brian Fillis, produced by Amanda Jenks and made its premiere at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] (the Berlin International Film Festival) in early February 2009, before being shown on television later that year.\n\nThat same year, Crisp's great-nephew, academic and film-maker Adrian Goycoolea, premiered a short documentary, ''Uncle Denis?'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisperanto.org/news/UncleDenis.html|title=CRISPERANTO.ORG: The Quentin Crisp Archives ... All Things Quentin Crisp!  -  UNCLE DENIS? - a film by Adrian Goycoolea|website=www.crisperanto.org}}</ref> at the 23rd [[London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival]]. The film uses interviews with family and previously unseen home movie footage. In collaboration with Crisperanto (The Quentin Crisp Archives) curator Philip Ward, Goycoolea also created an installation entitled 'Personal Effects' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|title=MIX NYC - The 23rd NY Queer Experimental Film Festival|website=www.mixnyc.org|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174744/http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the 2010 [[MIX NYC]], [[New York City]], which recreated Crisp's New York apartment using his personal effects and included home video footage.\n\nIn 2013, with curator Ward, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in Manhattan staged a three-month retrospective on Crisp, entitled ''Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp''. The retrospective consisted of free screenings of interviews, one man shows, documentaries and other recorded media.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp |url=http://madmuseum.org/series/ladies-and-gentlemen-mr-quentin-crisp |website=Museum of Arts and Design |publisher=Museum of Arts and Design |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Mark Farrelly's solo performance ''Quentin Crisp: Naked Hope'' debuted at the Edinburgh Festival, before transferring to the [[The Other Palace|St. James's Theatre]] in London and subsequently touring.

During his teenage years he worked briefly as a [[Male prostitution|rent-boy]]. He then spent 30 years as a professional model for life-classes in art colleges. The interviews he gave about his unusual life attracted increasing public curiosity and he was soon sought after for his highly individual views on social manners and the cultivating of style. His one-man stage show was a long-running hit both in Britain and America and he also appeared in films and on TV. Crisp defied convention by criticising both [[gay liberation]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early life ===\n'''Denis Charles Pratt''' was born in [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], South London, on [[Christmas Day]] 1908, the fourth child of solicitor Spencer Charles Pratt (1871\u20131931) and former [[governess]] Frances Marion Pratt (n\u00e9e Phillips; 1873\u20131960).<ref>1911 Census for England and Wales, The National Archives (findmypast.co.uk): RG number: RG14; Piece: 2929; Reference: RG14PN2929, RG78PN101; Registration District: Epsom; Sub District: Carshalton; Enumeration District: 7; Parish: Carshalton; Address: Wolverton, Egmont Road, Sutton; County: Surrey.</ref> His elder siblings were Katherine (1901\u20131976), Gerald (1902\u20131983) and Lewis (1907\u20131968). He changed his name to '''Quentin Crisp''' in his twenties after leaving home and expressed a feminine appearance to a degree that shocked contemporary Londoners and provoked [[Homophobia|homophobic]] attacks.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nBy his own account, Crisp was \u2018effeminate\u2019 in his demeanour from an early age resulting in him being teased while at [[Kingswood House School]]<ref name=\"qandp\">{{cite book |last=Barrow |first=Andrew |title=Quentin and Philip |date=8 November 2002 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-333-78051-0 |pages=}}</ref> in [[Epsom]], [[Surrey]], from which he won a scholarship to [[Denstone College]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Staffordshire]], in 1922. After leaving school in 1926, Crisp studied journalism at [[King's College London]], but failed to graduate in 1928, going on to take art classes at the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]].\n\nAround this time, Crisp began visiting the caf\u00e9s of [[Soho]] \u2013 his favourite being The Black Cat in [[Old Compton Street]] \u2013 meeting other young gay men and [[Male prostitution|rent-boys]], and experimenting with make-up and [[transvestism|women's clothes]]. For six months he worked as a prostitute;<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/211644.stm \"Crisp: The naked civil servant\"], BBC News, November twenty-first, 1999</ref> in a 1999 interview,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} he said he was looking for love, but found only degradation.\n\nCrisp left home to move to the [[central London|centre of London]] at the end of 1930, and after dwelling in a succession of flats, found a [[Bedsit|bed-sitting]] room in Denbigh Street, [[Pimlico]], where he \"held court with London's brightest and roughest characters.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} His \u2018outlandish\u2019 appearance \u2013 he wore bright make-up, dyed his long hair crimson, painted his fingernails and wore sandals to display his painted toe-nails \u2013 brought admiration and curiosity from some quarters, but generally attracted hostility and violence from strangers passing him in the streets.\n\n===Middle years===\nCrisp attempted to join the [[British army]] at the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], but was rejected and declared exempt by the medical board on the grounds that he was \"suffering from sexual perversion\". He remained in London during [[The Blitz|the 1941 Blitz]], stocked up on cosmetics, purchased five pounds of [[henna]] and paraded through the black-out, picking up [[GI (term)|G.I.s]], whose kindness and open-mindedness inspired his love of all things American.\n\nIn 1940, he moved into a first-floor flat at 129 Beaufort Street, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]], a bed-sitting room that he occupied until he emigrated to the United States in 1981. In the intervening years he never attempted any housework, writing famously in his memoir ''The Naked Civil Servant'': \"After the first four years the dirt doesn't get any worse.\"<ref>Crisp, Quentin. ''The Naked Civil Servant''. Penguin Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref>\n\nCrisp left his job as an [[technical drawing|engineer's tracer]] in 1942 to become a model in [[life class]]es in London and the [[Home Counties]]. He continued posing for artists for the next 30 years.\n\nCrisp had published three short books by the time he came to write ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (book)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' at the urging of his agent, [[Donald Carroll]]. Crisp wanted to call it ''I Reign in Hell'', a reference to ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (\"Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven\"), but Carroll insisted on ''The Naked Civil Servant'', an insistence that later gave him pause when he offered the manuscript to [[Tom Maschler]] of Jonathan Cape on the same day that [[Desmond Morris]] delivered ''[[The Naked Ape]]''. The book was published in 1968 to generally good reviews. Subsequently, Crisp was approached by the documentary-maker [[Denis Mitchell (filmmaker)|Denis Mitchell]] to be the subject of a short film in which he was expected to talk about his life, voice his opinions and sit around in his flat filing his nails.\n\n===Fame===\n[[File:QuentinCrisp(Q&A)RossBennettLewisPHOTO.png|thumb|right|Quentin Crisp during a Q&A session for his book and the film ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'']]\nIn 1975, the television version of ''[[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]]'' was broadcast on British and US television, making both actor [[John Hurt]] and Crisp himself into stars. This success launched Crisp in a new direction: that of performer and tutor. He devised a one-man show and began touring the country with it. The first half of the show was an entertaining monologue loosely based on his memoirs, while the second half was a question-and-answer session with Crisp picking the audience's written questions at random and answering them in an amusing manner.\n\nWhen his autobiography was reprinted in 1975, following the success of the television version of ''The Naked Civil Servant'', ''[[Gay News]]'' commented that the book should have been published posthumously (Crisp said that this was their polite way of telling him to drop dead). Gay rights campaigner [[Peter Tatchell]] said he had met Crisp in 1974, and alleged that he was not sympathetic to the [[Gay Liberation]] movement of the time. Tatchell said Crisp asked him: \"What do you want liberation from? What is there to be proud of? I don't believe in rights for homosexuals.\"<ref name=\"Tatchell\">Peter Tatchell [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/peter-tatchell-quentin-crisp-was-no-gay-hero-1852122.html \"Quentin Crisp was no gay hero\"], ''The Independent'' 29 December 2009</ref>\n\nBy now, Crisp was a theatre-filling [[raconteur]]: his one-man show sold out the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in London in 1978. He then took the show to New York. His first stay in the [[Hotel Chelsea]] coincided with a fire, a robbery, and the death of [[Nancy Spungen]]. Crisp decided to move to New York permanently and set about making arrangements. In 1981, he arrived with few possessions and found a small apartment on East 3rd Street in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].\n[[File:Quentin Crisp's Signature.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The title page of Crisp's 1981 book, How to Become a Virgin. Mr. Crisp's handwritten dedication for a fan appears beneath the title, and reads: \"To Graham from Quentin Crisp\". The dedication is written in a large, round hand with a circle dotting each I. |Quentin Crisp's handwriting and signature, from a dedication on the title page of ''How To Become A Virgin'' (1981)]]\n\nAs he had done in London, Crisp allowed his telephone number to be listed in the [[telephone directory]] and saw it as his duty to converse with anyone who called him. For the first twenty or so years of owning his own telephone, he habitually answered calls with the phrase: \"Yes, Lord?\" (\"Just in case,\" he once said.) Later on, he changed it to \"Oh yes?\", in a querulous tone of voice. His openness to strangers extended to accepting dinner invitations from almost anyone. Whilst he expected the host would pay for dinner, Crisp did his best to \"sing for his supper\" by regaling his host with wonderful stories and yarns, much as he did in his theatrical performances. Dinner with him was said to be one of the best shows in New York.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nHe continued to perform his one-man show, published books on the importance of contemporary manners as a means of social inclusiveness (as opposed to etiquette, which he claimed is socially exclusive), and supported himself by accepting social invitations, and writing film reviews and columns for UK and US magazines and newspapers. He said that provided one could exist on peanuts and champagne, one could quite easily live by going to every [[cocktail party]], [[premiere]] and first night to which one was invited.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Crisp 1982.jpg|thumb |alt=In this sepia-toned photograph, a straight-faced Quentin Crisp gestures from an ornate, high-backed chair. A large, red handkerchief flops from his jacket pocket. |Quentin Crisp in a performance of his one-person show, ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'', in [[Birmingham]], 1982]]\nCrisp also acted on television and in films. He made his debut as a film actor in the [[Royal College of Art]]'s low-budget production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1976). Crisp played [[Polonius]] in the 65-minute adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, supported by [[Helen Mirren]], who doubled as [[Ophelia]] and [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Gertrude]]. He subsequently appeared in the 1985 film ''[[The Bride (1985 film)|The Bride]]'', which brought him into contact with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], who played the lead role of Baron [[Frankenstein]]. Crisp also appeared on the television show ''[[The Equalizer]]'' in the 1987 episode \"First Light\", and as the narrator of director [[Richard Kwietniowski]]'s short film ''[[Ballad of Reading Gaol (film)|Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1988), based on the [[The Ballad of Reading Gaol|poem]] by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Four years later, he was cast in a lead role, and got top billing, in the low-budget [[independent film]] ''[[Topsy and Bunker: The Cat Killers]]'', playing the door-man of a flea-bag hotel in a run-down neighbourhood, quite like the one he dwelled in. According to director [[Thomas Massengale]], Crisp was a delight to work with.\n\nThe 1990s would prove to be his most prolific decade as an actor, as more and more directors offered him roles. In 1992, he was persuaded by [[Sally Potter]] to play [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the film ''[[Orlando (film)|Orlando]]''. Although he found the role taxing, he won acclaim for a dignified and touching performance. Crisp next had an uncredited cameo in the 1993 AIDS drama ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]].'' Crisp accepted some other small bit parts and cameos, such as a pageant judge in 1995's ''[[To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar]]''. Crisp's last role was in an independent film, ''American Mod'' (1999), while his last full-feature film was ''HomoHeights'' (also released as ''Happy Heights'', 1996). He was chosen by [[Channel 4]] to deliver the first ''[[Alternative Christmas message|Alternative Christmas Speech]]'', a counterpoint to the [[Royal Christmas Message|Queen's Christmas speech]], in 1993.\n\n===Last years===\nCrisp remained fiercely independent and unpredictable into old age. He caused controversy and confusion in the gay community by jokingly calling AIDS \"a fad\", and homosexuality \"a terrible disease\".<ref name=\"Tatchell\" /> He was continually in demand from journalists requiring a sound-bite, and throughout the 1990s his commentary was sought on any number of topics.\n\nCrisp was a stern critic of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and her attempts to gain public sympathy following her divorce from [[Prince Charles]]. He stated: \"I always thought Diana was such trash and got what she deserved. She was Lady Diana before she was Princess Diana so she knew the racket. She knew that royal marriages have nothing to do with love. You marry a man and you stand beside him on public occasions and you wave and for that you never have a financial worry until the day you die.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Fountain |first=Tim |authorlink= |title=Resident Alien: Quentin Crisp Explains It All |year=1999 |publisher=Nick Hern Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1 85459 657 8 |page=20}}</ref> Following [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in 1997]], he commented that it was perhaps her \"fast and shallow\" lifestyle that led to her demise: \"She could have been Queen of England \u2013 and she was swanning about Paris with Arabs. What disgraceful behaviour! Going about saying she wanted to be the queen of hearts. The vulgarity of it is so overpowering.\"<ref>''Atlanta Southern Voice'', 1 July 1999</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he was among the many people interviewed for ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', a historical documentary addressing how Hollywood films have depicted homosexuality. In his third volume of memoirs, ''Resident Alien'', published in the same year, Crisp stated that he was close to the end of his life, though he continued to make public appearances, and in June of that year he was one of the guest entertainers at the second [[Pride Scotia#1996|Pride Scotland]] festival in Glasgow.\n\nIn 1997, Crisp was crowned king of the [[Beaux-Arts Ball]] run by the Beaux Arts Society. He presided alongside Queen Audrey Kargere, Prince George Bettinger and Princess Annette Hunt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192849/http://beauxartssociety.org/19356.html |archivedate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1998, he celebrated his ninetieth birthday performing the opening night of his one-man show, ''An Evening with Quentin Crisp'', at The Intar Theatre on Forty-Second Street in New York City (produced by [[John Glines]] of [[The Glines]] organisation).\n\nAt the age of ninety, Crisp came to the realisation that he was a [[trans woman]] rather than a gay man. In ''The Last Word'', published posthumously, Crisp said, \"The only thing in my life I have wanted and didn't get was to be a woman. It will be my life's biggest regret. If the operation had been available and cheap when I was young, say when I was twenty-five or twenty-six, I would have jumped at the chance. My life would have been much simpler as a result\".<ref name=pink>Crisp, Quentin. The Last Word. MB Books LLC, 2018 https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/11/21/quentin-crisp-reflects-on-trans-identity-in-exclusive-final-autobiography/</ref>\n\n===Death===\nCrisp died of a heart attack in November 1999, nearly one month before his 91st birthday, in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] in [[Manchester]], on the eve of a nationwide revival of his one-man show. A humorous pact he had made with [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]] to live to be a century old, with a decade off for good behaviour, proved [[prophecy|prophetic]]. He was cremated with a minimum of ceremony as he had requested, and his ashes were flown back to Phillip Ward in New York.\n\nHe bequeathed his rights in three specific books to his respective collaborators Phillip Ward (for Crisp's final book ''The Last Word'' (and the book ''And One More Thing'') \u2013 formerly titled ''Dusty Answers''), Guy Kettelhack (for ''The Wit and Wisdom of Quentin Crisp'') and John Hofsess (for ''Manners from Heaven''). He then bequeathed all future UK-only income (but not the [[copyright]]s, which belong to Stedman Mays, Mary Tahan and Phillip Ward, and are managed by Ward) from his remaining literary estate (including ''The Naked Civil Servant'') to the two men he considered to have had the greatest influence on his career: Richard Gollner, his long-time agent, and Donald Carroll, a former agent he has worked with.\n\n===Posthumous works===\nIn the two years before his death (1997\u20131999), Crisp had been compiling a work that was to initially be titled ''The Dusty Answers'' with Phillip Ward. Crisp and Ward developed material for this book through many hours of recorded interviews, which was necessary because Crisp had lost the use of his left hand and was unable to use a typewriter or computer. The resulting manuscript remained unpublished for eighteen years after Crisp's death, because Ward found it emotionally difficult to transcribe Crisp's words. A chance meeting with Laurence Watts, who interviewed Ward for ''[[Pink News]]'', led to a partnership that would see them co-edit Crisp's remaining work. \n \nOn 21 November 2017, MB Books published ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'' by Crisp, edited by Ward and Watts. Whereas ''The Naked Civil Servant'' made Crisp famous and ''How To Become A Virgin'' detailed that fame, and his move to and life in New York, ''The Last Word'' was written as a goodbye to the world, with Crisp knowing the end was near. In it he recounts several previously untold stories from his life, walks the reader through his journey from obscurity, and reflects on his philosophy. He also describes the realisation that he was a trans woman and not a gay man.<ref name=pink/>\n \nFinally, on 1 January 2019, MB Books published ''And One More Thing'' by Crisp, a companion book to ''The Last Word: An Autobiography'', again edited by Ward and Watts. This book contains material that the editors believed did not fit into ''The Last Word''. In ''And One More Thing'', Crisp primarily shares his views on other people, their lives and their opinions, from [[Flapper|flapper girls]] to [[Monica Lewinsky]], and from the [[British Royal Family]] to [[Walt Disney]]. Also included is the script for Quentin's Alternative Christmas Message, broadcast on Britain's Channel 4 in 1993, the script of his one-man show ''An Evening With Quentin Crisp'' and his collected poetry.\n\n==Influence and legacy==\n[[File:Ella Guru, Quentin Crisp.jpg|thumb |alt=This colorful portrait focuses on Crisp's face (under his trademark [[fedora]]), but the viewer can still glimpse a stylish shirt collar.

He had jokingly remarked \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.\" In late 1986, Sting visited Crisp in his apartment and was told over dinner \u2013 and the next three days \u2013 what life had been like for a homosexual man in the largely homophobic Great Britain of the 1920s to the 1960s. Sting was both shocked and fascinated and decided to write the song. It includes the lines:\n\n:It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile,\n:Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\nSting says, \"Well, it's partly about me and partly about Quentin. Again, I was looking for a metaphor. Quentin is a hero of mine, someone I know very well. He is gay and he was gay at a time in history when it was dangerous to be so. He had people beating up on him on a daily basis, largely with the consent of the public.\"<ref>[http://www.crisperanto.org/recordings/sting.html MR. STING ON ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK], THE QUENTIN CRISP ARCHIVES: ''Crisperanto.org''. Retrieved on 4 February 2014.</ref>\n\nCrisp was the subject of a photographic portrait by [[Herb Ritts]] and was also chronicled in [[Andy Warhol]]'s diaries.\n\nIn his 1995 autobiography ''[[Take It Like a Man (autobiography)|Take It Like a Man]]'', singer [[Boy George]] discusses how he had felt an affinity towards Crisp during his childhood, as they faced similar problems as young homosexual people living in homophobic surroundings.\n\nCrisp was the subject of the play ''Resident Alien'', by Tim Fountain, which starred his friend [[Bette Bourne]] in 1999. The play opened at the [[Bush Theatre]] in London and transferred to the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in 2001 where it won two [[Obie Awards|Obies]] (for performance and design). It went on to win a Herald Angel (Best actor) at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Edinburgh Festival]] in 2002; subsequent productions have been seen across the US and Australia. A film of the same name was released by [[David Whitten|Greycat Films]] in 1990.\n\nThe song \"The Ballad of Jack Eric Williams (and Other Three-Named Composers)\" from [[William Finn]]'s song-cycle [[Elegies (musical)|''Elegies'']] refers to Crisp, whilst the 1981 [[Synth-pop|synthpop]] song \"No G.D.M\" by German [[Electropop|electro]] band [[Gina X Performance]] is dedicated to him.\n\nIn 2009, a television sequel to ''The Naked Civil Servant'' was broadcast. Entitled ''[[An Englishman in New York (film)|An Englishman in New York]]'', the production documented Crisp's later years in Manhattan. Thirty-four years after his first award-winning performance as Crisp, [[John Hurt]] returned to play him again. Other co-stars included [[Denis O'Hare]] as Phillip Steele (an amalgam character based on Crisp's friends Phillip Ward and Tom Steele), [[Jonathan Tucker]] as artist [[Patrick Angus]], [[Cynthia Nixon]] as [[Penny Arcade (performer)|Penny Arcade]], and [[Swoosie Kurtz]] as [[Connie Clausen]]. The production was filmed in New York in August 2008 and completed in London in October 2008. The film was directed by British director [[Richard Laxton]], written by Brian Fillis, produced by Amanda Jenks and made its premiere at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlinale]] (the Berlin International Film Festival) in early February 2009, before being shown on television later that year.\n\nThat same year, Crisp's great-nephew, academic and film-maker Adrian Goycoolea, premiered a short documentary, ''Uncle Denis?'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crisperanto.org/news/UncleDenis.html|title=CRISPERANTO.ORG: The Quentin Crisp Archives ...

The film uses interviews with family and previously unseen home movie footage. In collaboration with Crisperanto (The Quentin Crisp Archives) curator Philip Ward, Goycoolea also created an installation entitled 'Personal Effects' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|title=MIX NYC - The 23rd NY Queer Experimental Film Festival|website=www.mixnyc.org|access-date=9 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174744/http://www.mixnyc.org/23/installations.php|archive-date=14 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> at the 2010 [[MIX NYC]], [[New York City]], which recreated Crisp's New York apartment using his personal effects and included home video footage.\n\nIn 2013, with curator Ward, the [[Museum of Arts and Design]] in Manhattan staged a three-month retrospective on Crisp, entitled ''Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Quentin Crisp''.
