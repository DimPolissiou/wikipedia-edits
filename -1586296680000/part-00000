Although the season officially began on June&nbsp;15, the first storm did not form until August&nbsp;26. Hurricane Alma brushed the [[Outer Banks]] before becoming extratropical southeast of [[New England]], destroying hundreds of boats and producing beneficial rainfall. In late August, Tropical Storm Becky developed unusually far east in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the easternmost storm on record to recurve to the northeast. Celia followed in the September, forming east of the Lesser Antilles and executing a loop near Bermuda before dissipating. [[Hurricane Daisy (1962)|Hurricane Daisy]] was the costliest of the season, leaving about $1.1&nbsp;million in damage in New England (1962&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). The storm dropped the highest rainfall total on record in Maine, and its precipitation caused 22&nbsp;traffic fatalities. The final hurricane &ndash; Ella &ndash; was also the strongest, remaining offshore of the eastern United States but causing two deaths.\n\nIn addition to the five named storms, there were three non-developing tropical depressions. The first struck Texas in August, causing street flooding and killing three. The second of three formed off the west coast of Florida and flooded widespread areas after [[return period|1 in 100 year]] rainfall. The floods affected 5,000&nbsp;houses and caused millions in damage. The third of three non-developing storms moved across the Caribbean before striking [[Nicaragua]] in October. The season officially ended on November&nbsp;15.\n\n==Season activity==\nThe hurricane season officially began on June&nbsp;15, 1962. The [[National Hurricane Center]] began operations with no new equipment, and the warning agency instead opted to improve with the existing equipment. The agency had access to a system of radars that extended from [[Brownsville, Texas]], to [[Eastport, Maine]], which was set up in 1961. Although satellite imagery technology was available, the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=United Press International|date=1962-06-13|title=Hurricane Season Upon Us|newspaper=The Windsor Star|accessdate=2011-10-07|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j04_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=xFAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3288,833281&dq=hurricane+season&hl=en}}</ref> The season officially ended on November&nbsp;15.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=1962-11-13|title=Nature's Fury|author=Staff writer|accessdate=2011-10-10|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bkdQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-lYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1663,1702861&dq=alma+daisy+hurricane&hl=en}}</ref>\n\nDuring the season, three hurricanes developed from five [[tropical cyclone naming|named storms]].<ref name=\"mwr\"/> This was below the average of 10&nbsp;storms per season,<ref name=\"ap63\"/> and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939.

A frontal low developed a day later off the coast of South Carolina. The low moved northward and northward, gradually acquiring tropical characteristics. The [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis]] committee assessed that the system transitioned into a tropical storm by late on June&nbsp;30, while moving over the [[Outer Banks]] of North Carolina. The storm at the time was co-located with an upper-level low, suggesting characteristics of a [[subtropical cyclone]]. Based on reports from ships and land stations, the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h). On July&nbsp;1, an approaching cold front steered the storm away from the coast. The storm gradually weakened and transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone late on July&nbsp;2. Turning to the north, the storm moved across [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and curved to the west and southwest, striking New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The storm turned back to the northeast, remaining offshore Nova Scotia until it was absorbed by an approaching extratropical storm on July&nbsp;6.<ref name=\"meta\">https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/metadata-1961-1965.pdf</ref>\n\nWhile in its formative stages, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in coastal portions of North Carolina, causing locally heavy crop damage.

For about 30&nbsp;hours, the system affected the [[Cape Verde]] islands with rainfall, during which it moved slowly to the west and west-northwest. Late on August&nbsp;28, it was estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm. The next day, satellite imagery observed a well-developed tropical cyclone in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. In addition, a ship reported winds of force&nbsp;9 on the [[Beaufort scale]], suggesting winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h). On that basis, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|Weather Bureau]] initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Becky, despite the agency only issuing advisories for storms west of 35\u00b0 [[Longitude|W]]. Around that time, the storm moved over an area of anomalously warm [[sea surface temperature|water temperatures]], which allowed for its intensification.

This was due to its presence beneath an upper-level trough, although the system began intensifying as the trough dissipated. On October&nbsp;2, after turning to the northwest between two high pressure areas, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. Developing an [[anticyclone]] aloft, the storm continued to gradually intensify, reaching hurricane strength on October&nbsp;3. Two days later, Daisy turned to the north-northeast and attained peak winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h). While passing west of Bermuda, the hurricane weakened slightly, although it re-intensified to its peak strength late on October&nbsp;6.

On October&nbsp;14, a tropical depression developed and moved northward. A day after forming, it intensified into Tropical Storm Ella as it began a track to the northwest, located east of a weakening upper-level trough. On October&nbsp;17, Ella strengthened further into a hurricane as an anticyclone was gradually developing. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the east-northeast on October&nbsp;19, and later that day Ella attained its peak intensity of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h); that made it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened over cooler waters while accelerating to the northeast, and its eye grew to an unusually large diameter of 100&nbsp;mi (160&nbsp;km). Ella became extratropical on October&nbsp;22 over the northern Atlantic as it interacted with an approaching cold front.

A day later, an extratropical storm producing hurricane-force winds developed about 200&nbsp;mi (320&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The storm remained nearly stationary for several days near the coast, drifting westward and later to the south. On November&nbsp;27, the storm's wind structure became more symmetric, with an inner core developing inside the larger extratropical low. Based on ship reports near the center, the system transitioned into a hurricane early on November&nbsp;28; due to its interaction with the extratropical storm, the system was potentially a [[subtropical cyclone]], although the lack of satellite imagery prevented such a classification. By later on November&nbsp;28, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, affected by wind shear. By that point, the storm had turned to the east, followed by a turn to the northwest and later west-southwest on the next day. Late on November&nbsp;30, satellite imagery indicated an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. A day later, the storm re-intensified into a hurricane, reaching its peak intensity of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h). On December&nbsp;2, the hurricane turned back to the southwest as it made its closest approach to the Outer Banks. Stronger wind shear caused the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm again on December&nbsp;3, as an approaching cold front steered the storm northeastward. Two days later, the storm transitioned back into an extratropical storm to the east of the Outer Banks, briefly regaining hurricane intensity on December&nbsp;5. A day later, a larger extratropical storm over the northeastern United States absorbed the former hurricane.<ref name=\"meta\"/>\n\nFor several days, the storm meandered off the southeast coast of the United States, producing high tides and beach erosion from Florida to Virginia; many of these areas were affected by [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962|a severe nor'easter in March 1962]]. The storm's interaction with a ridge to its northeast produced a strong [[pressure gradient]], resulting in gale-force winds across the Virginia and North Carolina coast. In Virginia, a dredge involved in the construction of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]] broke loose and rain aground. During the storm's formative stages, it produced wind gusts of 89&nbsp;mph (142&nbsp;km/h) on [[Oak Island (North Carolina)|Oak Island]], North Carolina. High waves washed away dunes, wrecked coastal houses, and sank several boats, including a ferry. The storm washed out a temporary bridge and deepened a temporary inlet on Hatteras Island north of Buxton, both the aftermath of the March 1962 storm. As a tropical cyclone, the hurricane produced tropical storm force winds along the North Carolina coast.

[[Hurricane Daisy (1962)|Hurricane Daisy]] was the costliest of the season, leaving about $1.1&nbsp;million in damage in New England (1962&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). The storm dropped the highest rainfall total on record in Maine, and its precipitation caused 22&nbsp;traffic fatalities. The final hurricane &ndash; Ella &ndash; was also the strongest, remaining offshore of the eastern United States but causing two deaths.\n\nIn addition to the five named storms, there were three non-developing tropical depressions. The first struck Texas in August, causing street flooding and killing three. The second of three formed off the west coast of Florida and flooded widespread areas after [[return period|1 in 100 year]] rainfall. The floods affected 5,000&nbsp;houses and caused millions in damage. The third of three non-developing storms moved across the Caribbean before striking [[Nicaragua]] in October. The season officially ended on November&nbsp;15.\n\n==Season activity==\nThe hurricane season officially began on June&nbsp;15, 1962. The [[National Hurricane Center]] began operations with no new equipment, and the warning agency instead opted to improve with the existing equipment. The agency had access to a system of radars that extended from [[Brownsville, Texas]], to [[Eastport, Maine]], which was set up in 1961. Although satellite imagery technology was available, the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff writer|agency=United Press International|date=1962-06-13|title=Hurricane Season Upon Us|newspaper=The Windsor Star|accessdate=2011-10-07|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=j04_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=xFAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3288,833281&dq=hurricane+season&hl=en}}</ref> The season officially ended on November&nbsp;15.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=1962-11-13|title=Nature's Fury|author=Staff writer|accessdate=2011-10-10|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bkdQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-lYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1663,1702861&dq=alma+daisy+hurricane&hl=en}}</ref>\n\nDuring the season, three hurricanes developed from five [[tropical cyclone naming|named storms]].<ref name=\"mwr\"/> This was below the average of 10&nbsp;storms per season,<ref name=\"ap63\"/> and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939.

On October&nbsp;14, a tropical depression developed and moved northward. A day after forming, it intensified into Tropical Storm Ella as it began a track to the northwest, located east of a weakening upper-level trough. On October&nbsp;17, Ella strengthened further into a hurricane as an anticyclone was gradually developing. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to the east-northeast on October&nbsp;19, and later that day Ella attained its peak intensity of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h); that made it the strongest hurricane of the season. It gradually weakened over cooler waters while accelerating to the northeast, and its eye grew to an unusually large diameter of 100&nbsp;mi (160&nbsp;km). Ella became extratropical on October&nbsp;22 over the northern Atlantic as it interacted with an approaching cold front. Shortly thereafter its remnants moved over [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] before dissipating on October&nbsp;23.<ref name=\"mwr\"/>{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}\n\nElla is historically notable for its role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].  The storm greatly complicated naval operations relating to the 'quarantine' blockade of Cuba and badly damaged several Soviet nuclear-armed submarines en route to the island, contributing to the escalation of the [[Soviet submarine B-59|B-59 Incident]].<ref name=\"risingtide\">{{cite book|author=Gary E.

A day later, an extratropical storm producing hurricane-force winds developed about 200&nbsp;mi (320&nbsp;km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The storm remained nearly stationary for several days near the coast, drifting westward and later to the south. On November&nbsp;27, the storm's wind structure became more symmetric, with an inner core developing inside the larger extratropical low. Based on ship reports near the center, the system transitioned into a hurricane early on November&nbsp;28; due to its interaction with the extratropical storm, the system was potentially a [[subtropical cyclone]], although the lack of satellite imagery prevented such a classification. By later on November&nbsp;28, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm, affected by wind shear. By that point, the storm had turned to the east, followed by a turn to the northwest and later west-southwest on the next day. Late on November&nbsp;30, satellite imagery indicated an eye-like feature in the center of the storm. A day later, the storm re-intensified into a hurricane, reaching its peak intensity of 90&nbsp;mph (150&nbsp;km/h). On December&nbsp;2, the hurricane turned back to the southwest as it made its closest approach to the Outer Banks. Stronger wind shear caused the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm again on December&nbsp;3, as an approaching cold front steered the storm northeastward. Two days later, the storm transitioned back into an extratropical storm to the east of the Outer Banks, briefly regaining hurricane intensity on December&nbsp;5. A day later, a larger extratropical storm over the northeastern United States absorbed the former hurricane.<ref name=\"meta\"/>\n\nFor several days, the storm meandered off the southeast coast of the United States, producing high tides and beach erosion from Florida to Virginia; many of these areas were affected by [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962|a severe nor'easter in March 1962]]. The storm's interaction with a ridge to its northeast produced a strong [[pressure gradient]], resulting in gale-force winds across the Virginia and North Carolina coast. In Virginia, a dredge involved in the construction of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel]] broke loose and rain aground. During the storm's formative stages, it produced wind gusts of 89&nbsp;mph (142&nbsp;km/h) on [[Oak Island (North Carolina)|Oak Island]], North Carolina. High waves washed away dunes, wrecked coastal houses, and sank several boats, including a ferry. The storm washed out a temporary bridge and deepened a temporary inlet on Hatteras Island north of Buxton, both the aftermath of the March 1962 storm. As a tropical cyclone, the hurricane produced tropical storm force winds along the North Carolina coast. Rainfall associated with the storm was generally light, except for portions of the Outer Banks and in Georgia.<ref name=\"meta\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other systems===\n[[File:Sat196210041348zTD.png|thumb|right|Satellite picture of the Caribbean tropical depression over Central America from October 4, 1962, at 1348z]]\nOn April&nbsp;28, a trough existed north of Puerto Rico, spawning a tropical depression on April&nbsp;30.

It moved through the islands without intensifying beyond winds of 30&nbsp;mph (40&nbsp;km/h). The depression later crossed the entirety of the Caribbean Sea.

From there he went to the [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]], with the assistance of a grant from the City of Birmingham. Following his graduation in 1967 he appeared on stage in [[Canterbury]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nHis first television appearance was as the lead in a [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion]] play entitled ''Half Hour Story: Flowers at my Feet'' in 1968. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===''Dad's Army''===\nIn 1968, aged 22, Lavender was cast as Private Pike, the youngest member and \u201cstupid boy\u201d of the platoon in the BBC sitcom ''[[Dad's Army]]''. This made him a household name and gave him the great advantage of working alongside a number of experienced actors during his formative years, helping him to hone his acting skills.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He appeared in the entire run of the series, and in [[Dad's Army (1971 film)|the spinoff film]] released in 1971. He appeared in 1974 in one episode of ''[[Man About the House]]'' (While The Cat's Away) as Mark.<ref>{{cite book|author=McCaighey, Mark|title=The Dad's Army Movie Dossier: The Making of Jimmy Perry and David Croft's Classic Film |year=2015|ISBN=9781785381430}}</ref> in the [[BBC Radio]] sitcom ''[[It Sticks Out Half a Mile]]''. The sitcom was a radio sequel to ''Dad's Army'', but ran for only one series. Lavender has continued to be associated with ''Dad's Army'', and still takes part in occasional fan conventions and cast reunions. He made a variety of appearances during 2008 in connection with the 40th anniversary of the series. These included a reunion with surviving cast members in July, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|title=Dad's Army star slams current TV |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499169.stm|work=bbc.co.uk|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> and an appearance on BBC1's ''[[Jonathan Ross]] Salutes Dad's Army'' in August.\n\nLavender also recorded a special introduction for the 'lost' colour episode of ''Dad's Army'' entitled \"[[Room at the Bottom]]\" which was broadcast on 13 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title='Lost' Dad's Army show back on TV|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7780889.stm|work=bbc.co.uk|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> In 2014 Lavender appeared at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in a show with Steven Mcnicoll entitled ''Don't tell him, Pike!'', where Lavender talked about his time on ''Dad's Army'' and the subsequent effect it had on his career.\n\nHe makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Brigadier Pritchard in the 2016 ''[[Dad's Army (2016 film)|Dad's Army]]'' film, providing a link with the original series.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11246784/Pictured-Ian-Lavender-plays-cameo-role-in-new-Dads-Army-film.html|title=Pictured: Ian Lavender plays cameo role in new Dad's Army film|website=The Telegraph|date=21 November 2014|access-date=8 May 2016|last1=Furness|first1=Hannah}}</ref>\n\n===After ''Dad's Army''===\nAfter ''Dad's Army'', Lavender returned to the theatre, including a role in a production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' starring [[Dustin Hoffman]]. Between 1971 and 1973 Lavender joined ''Dad's Army'' colleague [[Arthur Lowe]] on the BBC radio comedy ''[[Parsley Sidings]]''. From 1982 to 1983, he was in the BBC radio comedy series, a spin-off from ''Dad's Army'' called ''It Sticks Out Half a Mile.''  Lavender also appeared in films and television series, one of which (''Mr Big'', 1977) featured him starring alongside [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] and [[Prunella Scales]]. During the 1970s he appeared as a supporting actor in a number of British 'low farce' films, including one ''[[Carry On films|Carry On]]'' film - ''[[Carry On Behind]]'' (1975).\n\nHe was reunited with producer [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] for the television series ''[[Come Back Mrs. Noah]]'' (1977\u201378, co-written by Croft with [[Jeremy Lloyd]]), though it was unsuccessful. A revival of ''[[The Glums]]'' (1978\u201379), at first as part of a [[Bruce Forsyth]] variety series, proved rather more satisfactory, being adapted from scripts for the 1950s radio series ''[[Take It From Here]]'' that were written by [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]].\n\nLavender then appeared in several other TV comedy shows during the 1980s, including two episodes of ''[[Yes Minister]]'', as Richard Cartwright, and a lead role in the short-lived ''The Hello Goodbye Man'' (1984), as the inept salesman Denis Ailing. He also appeared on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s television [[game show]] ''[[Cluedo (television)|Cluedo]]'' (1990), based on the [[Cluedo|board game]]. During the 1990s Lavender continued to appear occasionally in television comedy roles including a bit-part as a burglar alarm salesman in the BBC sitcom ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''. He made an appearance in ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' as two different parallel universe versions of the time-travelling lead character's son Michael. He also provided the lead voice of BBC children's animation ''PC Pinkerton'' in 1988.\n\nIn 2001 Lavender joined the BBC [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', playing the role of [[Derek Harkinson]], a gay friend of [[Pauline Fowler]]. He continued in ''EastEnders'' for four years, with storylines mainly involving the Fowler family, before leaving the serial in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eastenders-Character-Derek Harkinson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_derek_h.shtml|work=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> On 4 November 2016, it was announced that Lavender would make a brief return to the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/entries/b99367b7-1a64-4a8d-860e-b4b3145883a1|title=Ian Lavender to return as Derek Harkinson|date=2016-11-03|website=EastEnders News & Spoilers|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nLavender then toured with ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' musical, playing the Narrator. He also played the part of a patient in the 5 May 2007 episode of ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' on BBC. In late 2007, he toured in the comedy play ''[[Donkey's Years]]''. In May 2008, Lavender appeared in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Comedy Map of Britain]]''. He also appeared on BBC One's ''[[The One Show]]'' on Thursday 31 July 2008.\n\nOver Christmas 2008, Lavender appeared in ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]'' on BBC One. As presenter [[John Humphrys]] asked his name, fellow contestant [[Rick Wakeman]] shouted 'Don't tell him, Pike!', a reference to [[Captain Mainwaring]]'s most famous line from ''Dad's Army''. At the start of 2009, Lavender appeared as a guest character in an episode of the [[CBBC]] sitcom, ''[[The Legend of Dick and Dom]]''. Lavender starred in the film, ''[[31 North 62 East]]'' (released September 2009), an independent [[psychological thriller]] starring [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Marina Sirtis]], [[Heather Peace]] and [[Craig Fairbrass]].<ref>{{cite news|title=31 North 62 East - Cast|url=http://www.31north62east.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=6|publisher=31north62east.com|year=2008|accessdate=2009-01-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112025117/http://www.31north62east.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=6|archivedate=12 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLavender appeared as Monsignor Howard in the [[West End theatre]] production of ''[[Sister Act the Musical]]''.

He is known for his role as [[Private Pike]] in the BBC comedy series ''[[Dad's Army]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nArthur Ian Lavender was born in [[Birmingham]], [[England]].<ref>GRO Register of Births: MAR 1946 6d 813 BIRMINGHAM - Arthur I. Lavender, mmn = Johnson</ref> He attended Bournville Boys Technical School (later [[Bournville School|Bournville Grammar-Technical School for Boys]]) where he appeared in many school dramatic productions. From there he went to the [[Bristol Old Vic Theatre School]], with the assistance of a grant from the City of Birmingham. Following his graduation in 1967 he appeared on stage in [[Canterbury]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nHis first television appearance was as the lead in a [[Associated-Rediffusion|Rediffusion]] play entitled ''Half Hour Story: Flowers at my Feet'' in 1968. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n===''Dad's Army''===\nIn 1968, aged 22, Lavender was cast as Private Pike, the youngest member and \u201cstupid boy\u201d of the platoon in the BBC sitcom ''[[Dad's Army]]''. This made him a household name and gave him the great advantage of working alongside a number of experienced actors during his formative years, helping him to hone his acting skills.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} He appeared in the entire run of the series, and in [[Dad's Army (1971 film)|the spinoff film]] released in 1971. He appeared in 1974 in one episode of ''[[Man About the House]]'' (While The Cat's Away) as Mark.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 1983, he revived the role of Private Pike in the [[BBC Radio]] sitcom ''[[It Sticks Out Half a Mile]]''. The sitcom was a radio sequel to ''Dad's Army'', but ran for only one series. Lavender has continued to be associated with ''Dad's Army'', and still takes part in occasional fan conventions and cast reunions. He made a variety of appearances during 2008 in connection with the 40th anniversary of the series. These included a reunion with surviving cast members in July, 2008,<ref>{{cite news|title=Dad's Army star slams current TV |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7499169.stm|work=bbc.co.uk|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> and an appearance on BBC1's ''[[Jonathan Ross]] Salutes Dad's Army'' in August.\n\nLavender also recorded a special introduction for the 'lost' colour episode of ''Dad's Army'' entitled \"[[Room at the Bottom]]\" which was broadcast on 13 December 2008.<ref>{{cite news|title='Lost' Dad's Army show back on TV|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/7780889.stm|work=bbc.co.uk|date=12 July 2008|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> In 2014 Lavender appeared at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in a show with Steven Mcnicoll entitled ''Don't tell him, Pike!'', where Lavender talked about his time on ''Dad's Army'' and the subsequent effect it had on his career.\n\nHe makes a [[cameo appearance]] as Brigadier Pritchard in the 2016 ''[[Dad's Army (2016 film)|Dad's Army]]'' film, providing a link with the original series.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11246784/Pictured-Ian-Lavender-plays-cameo-role-in-new-Dads-Army-film.html|title=Pictured: Ian Lavender plays cameo role in new Dad's Army film|website=The Telegraph|date=21 November 2014|access-date=8 May 2016|last1=Furness|first1=Hannah}}</ref>\n\n===After ''Dad's Army''===\nAfter ''Dad's Army'', Lavender returned to the theatre, including a role in a production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' starring [[Dustin Hoffman]]. Between 1971 and 1973 Lavender joined ''Dad's Army'' colleague [[Arthur Lowe]] on the BBC radio comedy ''[[Parsley Sidings]]''. From 1982 to 1983, he was in the BBC radio comedy series, a spin-off from ''Dad's Army'' called ''It Sticks Out Half a Mile.''  Lavender also appeared in films and television series, one of which (''Mr Big'', 1977) featured him starring alongside [[Peter Jones (actor)|Peter Jones]] and [[Prunella Scales]]. During the 1970s he appeared as a supporting actor in a number of British 'low farce' films, including one ''[[Carry On films|Carry On]]'' film - ''[[Carry On Behind]]'' (1975).\n\nHe was reunited with producer [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] for the television series ''[[Come Back Mrs. Noah]]'' (1977\u201378, co-written by Croft with [[Jeremy Lloyd]]), though it was unsuccessful. A revival of ''[[The Glums]]'' (1978\u201379), at first as part of a [[Bruce Forsyth]] variety series, proved rather more satisfactory, being adapted from scripts for the 1950s radio series ''[[Take It From Here]]'' that were written by [[Frank Muir]] and [[Denis Norden]].\n\nLavender then appeared in several other TV comedy shows during the 1980s, including two episodes of ''[[Yes Minister]]'', as Richard Cartwright, and a lead role in the short-lived ''The Hello Goodbye Man'' (1984), as the inept salesman Denis Ailing. He also appeared on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s television [[game show]] ''[[Cluedo (television)|Cluedo]]'' (1990), based on the [[Cluedo|board game]]. During the 1990s Lavender continued to appear occasionally in television comedy roles including a bit-part as a burglar alarm salesman in the BBC sitcom ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''. He made an appearance in ''[[Goodnight Sweetheart (TV series)|Goodnight Sweetheart]]'' as two different parallel universe versions of the time-travelling lead character's son Michael. He also provided the lead voice of BBC children's animation ''PC Pinkerton'' in 1988.\n\nIn 2001 Lavender joined the BBC [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', playing the role of [[Derek Harkinson]], a gay friend of [[Pauline Fowler]]. He continued in ''EastEnders'' for four years, with storylines mainly involving the Fowler family, before leaving the serial in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eastenders-Character-Derek Harkinson|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/characters_cast/characters/character_derek_h.shtml|work=[[bbc.co.uk]]|accessdate=2008-12-15}}</ref> On 4 November 2016, it was announced that Lavender would make a brief return to the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/eastenders/entries/b99367b7-1a64-4a8d-860e-b4b3145883a1|title=Ian Lavender to return as Derek Harkinson|date=2016-11-03|website=EastEnders News & Spoilers|access-date=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nLavender then toured with ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' musical, playing the Narrator. He also played the part of a patient in the 5 May 2007 episode of ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' on BBC. In late 2007, he toured in the comedy play ''[[Donkey's Years]]''. In May 2008, Lavender appeared in the [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[Comedy Map of Britain]]''. He also appeared on BBC One's ''[[The One Show]]'' on Thursday 31 July 2008.\n\nOver Christmas 2008, Lavender appeared in ''[[Celebrity Mastermind]]'' on BBC One. As presenter [[John Humphrys]] asked his name, fellow contestant [[Rick Wakeman]] shouted 'Don't tell him, Pike!', a reference to [[Captain Mainwaring]]'s most famous line from ''Dad's Army''. At the start of 2009, Lavender appeared as a guest character in an episode of the [[CBBC]] sitcom, ''[[The Legend of Dick and Dom]]''. Lavender starred in the film, ''[[31 North 62 East]]'' (released September 2009), an independent [[psychological thriller]] starring [[John Rhys-Davies]], [[Marina Sirtis]], [[Heather Peace]] and [[Craig Fairbrass]].<ref>{{cite news|title=31 North 62 East - Cast|url=http://www.31north62east.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=6|publisher=31north62east.com|year=2008|accessdate=2009-01-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112025117/http://www.31north62east.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=6|archivedate=12 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nLavender appeared as Monsignor Howard in the [[West End theatre]] production of ''[[Sister Act the Musical]]''.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L.

In addition, they retained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials.

The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\n=== 1960s ===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf.

The squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012.\n\n== Squadron History ==\n\n=== 1950s ===\nFleet Air Reconnaissance in the European Theater had been conducted since the start of the Cold War by detachments within patrol squadrons (VP) flying modified PB4Y-2 Privateers from [[Naval Air Station Port Lyautey|NAS Port Lyautey]] and conducting missions in the Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and North Seas. Shortly after the start of the Korean War in 1950, a dedicated unit, Naval Air Activities (NAA), Port Lyautey Patrol Unit (NPU) was established with three PB4Y-2 aircraft and personnel transferred from VP-26. As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost several aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

That month, the squadron was transferred to NS Rota, Spain.\n\nShortly after the change of homeport, on 19 January 1960, the squadron lost one of its P4M-1Qs and all sixteen aircrew when it crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there. Shortly thereafter, the P4M-1Q aircraft started being replaced by the [EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. \n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs and A3D-2Qs. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nOn 22 May, 1962, a WV-2Q (BUNO 131390)<ref name=\"DeanBoys\">{{Cite web|title = Crash of a Lockheed WV-2Q Super Constellation in Markt Schwaben: 26 Killed|url =https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-lockheed-wv-2q-super-constellation-markt-schwaben-26-killed|website = www.baaa-acro.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> staged at [[Lucius D. Clay Kaserne|Wiesbaden Air Base]], took off from [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] on a training flight. Inflight, the rear cargo door opened while at 18,000 feet. The flight crew declared an emergency and diverted to [[Munich-Riem Airport]]. To observers on the ground, WV-2Q seemed explode with the tail separating from the main fuselage over [[Markt Schwaben]], 17 km south of Munich Airport. The main fuselage and tail section crashed several hundred yards apart in fields southwest of the town. The aircraft was totally destroyed killing all twenty-two Navy and four Army aircrew. Debris and documents were scattered on an area over 65 km2.<ref name=\"StaHypo\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in the Continental United States (CONUS), VQ-2 deployed an EA3B and an EC-121M to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba.\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. EA-3Bs in the Mediterranean still operated from land despite the increasing demand to man detachments onboard Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown into the theater to support Seventh Fleet. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam, VQ-2 EA-3Bs infrequently joined them operating as VQ-2 DET BRAVO. From both locations VQ-2 Whales provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\nThe squadron suffered three fatal Whale losses between 1966 and 1968:\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> disappeared inbound to a recovery on the USS Independence in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew were lost at sea.\n# On 28 May 1966, an EA-3B Skywarrior (BUNO 142257) of DET ALFA, ran into a typhoon enroute Vietnam. Four of the aircrew bailed out as the three in the cockpit managed to recover the aircraft. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E. Daum, crashed on takeoff from Rota on a flight to a conference in [[Naples, Italy]]. The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived. Two squadron junior officers on their way in to the command were the first people to the crash site.<ref name=\"AvSafety\">{{Cite web|title =Accident Douglas EA-3B Skywarrior 142670, 04 Jun 1968|url =https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/158670|website = aviation-safety.net|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of the USS Liberty during the Six Day War in 1967, reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. As the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n=== 1970s ===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nOn 26 February 1970, an EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />.

The A3D-1Q was replaced by the A3D-2Q and was subsequently re-designated the EA-3B Skywarrior.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nOn 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s and the availability of parts.\n\nIncreasing terrorism related to strife in the Middle East and the increasing Libyan radicalization after the 1969 coup led to a continued high operational tempo. Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n=== 1980s ===\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 2000s ===\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.
