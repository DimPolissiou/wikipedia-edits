blur|blurring]] and multiplication of their parts.<ref name=\"lubbock\"/>\n\nChronophotographic studies of animals in motion, created by scientist [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]] beginning in the 1880s, led to the introduction in painting of techniques to show motion, such as blurring, multiplication, and superimposition of body parts\u2014perhaps in an effort to imitate these mechanical images.<ref

In later, more abstract works created during [[World War I]], Balla used planes of color to suggest movement.<ref name=\"brittanica\"/>\n\nThe decomposition of movement into moments in time which

Most of the members of the party during its founding belonged to the former [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]], which was led by chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], also a member of the Christian Social Party before the [[Anschluss]]. While still sometimes honored by \u00d6VP members for resisting [[Adolf Hitler]], the regime built by Dollfuss was authoritarian in nature and has been dubbed as [[Austrofascism]]. In its present form, the \u00d6VP was established immediately after the restoration of Austria's independence in 1945 and it has been represented in both the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] ever since. In terms of Federal Assembly seats, the \u00d6VP has consistently been the strongest or second-strongest party and as such it has led or at least been a partner in most Austria's federal cabinets.\n\n=== Federal Government ===\n{{update section|date=October 2017}}\nIn November 1945, the \u00d6VP won a [[landslide victory]] in Austria's [[1945 Austrian legislative election|first postwar election]], winning almost half the popular vote and an absolute majority in the legislature. However, memories of the hyper-partisanship that had plagued the First Republic prompted the \u00d6VP to maintain the [[grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) that had governed the country since the restoration of independence in early 1945. The \u00d6VP remained the senior partner in this coalition until 1966 and governed alone from 1966 to 1970. It reentered the government in 1986, but has never been completely out of power since the restoration of Austrian independence in 1945 due to a longstanding tradition that all major interest groups were to be consulted on policy.\n\nAfter the [[1999 Austrian legislative election|1999 legislative election]], several months of negotiations ended in early 2000 when the \u00d6VP formed a [[coalition government]] with the right-wing populist [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6) led by [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]. The FP\u00d6 had won just a few hundred more votes than the \u00d6VP, but was considered far too controversial to lead a government. The \u00d6VP's [[Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel]] became [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]]\u2014the first \u00d6VP Chancellor of Austria since 1970. This caused widespread outrage in Europe and the [[European Union]] imposed informal diplomatic sanctions on Austria, the first time that it imposed sanctions on a member state. Bilateral relations were frozen (including contacts and meetings at an inter-governmental level) and Austrian candidates would not be supported for posts in European Union international offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/feb2000/haid-f22.shtml|title=The European Union's sanctions against Austria|publisher=WSWS|date=22 February 2000|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> Austria threatened to veto all applications by countries for European Union membership until the sanctions were lifted.<ref>{{cite news|author=Donald G. McNeill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/04/world/a-threat-by-austria-on-sanctions.html|title=A Threat By Austria on Sanctions|work=The New York Times|date=4 July 2000|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> A few months later, these sanctions were dropped as a result of a fact-finding mission by three former European prime ministers, the so-called \"three wise men\". The [[2002 Austrian legislative election|2002 legislative election]] resulted in a landslide victory (42.27% of the vote) for the \u00d6VP under Sch\u00fcssel. Haider's FP\u00d6 was reduced to 10.16% of the vote.\n\nAfter the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) split from the FP\u00d6 in 2005, the BZ\u00d6 replaced the FP\u00d6 in the government coalition, which lasted until 2007. Austria for the first time had a government containing of a party that was founded during the parliamentary term.\n\nIn the [[2006 Austrian legislative election|2006 legislative election]], the \u00d6VP were defeated and after much negotiations agreed to become junior partner in a grand coalition with the SP\u00d6, with new party chairman [[Wilhelm Molterer]] as [[Finance Minister of Austria|Finance Minister]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] under SP\u00d6 leader [[Alfred Gusenbauer]], who became Chancellor. The next [[2008 Austrian legislative election|legislative election in 2008]] saw the \u00d6VP lose 15 seats with an 8.35% decrease in its share of the vote.\n\nThe \u00d6VP won the largest share of the vote (30.0%) in the [[2009 European Parliament election in Austria|2009 European elections]] with 846,709, votes but their number of seats remained the same.\n\n=== States ===\nAt the [[states of Austria|state level]], the \u00d6VP has long dominated the rural states of [[Lower Austria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Styria]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Vorarlberg]]. It is less popular in the [[city state]] of Vienna and in the rural, but less strongly Catholic states of [[Burgenland]] and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. In 2004, it lost its [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] in the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], where they kept its result in seats (14) in 2009 and in 2005 in [[Styria]] for the first time.\n\n=== Chairpersons since 1945 ===\nThe chart below shows a timeline of \u00d6VP chairpersons and the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellors of Austria]]. The left black bar shows all the chairpersons (''Bundesparteiobleute'', abbreviated as CP) of the \u00d6VP party and the right bar shows the corresponding make-up of the Austrian government at that time. The red ([[Social Democratic Party of Austria|SP\u00d6]]) and black (\u00d6VP) colours correspond to which party led the federal government (''Bundesregierung'', abbreviated as Govern).

An unofficial successor to the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was founded immediately following the reestablishment of the [[Allied-occupied Austria|Republic of Austria]] in 1945 and since then has been one of the two largest Austrian political parties with the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6). In federal governance, the \u00d6VP has spent most of the postwar era in a [[grand coalition]] with the SP\u00d6. However, the \u00d6VP won the [[2017 Austrian legislative election|2017 election]], having the greatest number of seats and formed a coalition with the [[right-wing populist]] [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6). Its chairman [[Sebastian Kurz]] is the youngest [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] in Austrian history and currently the world's youngest leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/austria-election-exit-poll-result-sebastian-kurz-ovp-latest-projection-freedom-far-right-a8001811.html|title=Austria election results: Far-right set to enter government as conservatives top poll|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 October 2017|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> <ref>https://gulfnews.com/photos/news/head-of-a-state-at-33---meet-the-youngest-serving-leaders-in-the-world-1.1577971904870</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\nThe \u00d6VP is conservative. For most of its existence, it has explicitly defined itself as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[anti-socialist]], with the ideals of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], as defined by the [[encyclical]] ''[[Quadragesimo anno]],'' and decentralization.\n\nFor the first election after World War II, the \u00d6VP presented itself as the Austrian Party (German: ''die \u00f6sterreichische Partei''), was anti-[[Marxism|Marxist]] and regarded itself as the Party of the Center (German: ''Partei der Mitte''). The \u00d6VP consistently held power\u2014either alone or in so-called [[Grand coalition|Black-Red coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6)\u2014until 1970, when the SP\u00d6 formed a minority government with the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6). The \u00d6VP's economic policies during the era generally upheld a [[social market economy]].\n\nThe party's campaign for the [[2017 Austrian legislative election|2017 general election]] under the young chairman [[Sebastian Kurz]] was dominated by a rightward shift in policy, which included a promised crackdown on illegal immigration and a fight against 'political Islam',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/make-austria-great-again-the-rapid-rise-of-sebastian-kurz/a-40313720|title=Make Austria Great Again \u2014 the rapid rise of Sebastian Kurz|work=Deutsche Welle|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref> making it more similar to the program of the FP\u00d6, the party that Kurz chose as his coalition partner after the \u00d6VP won the election.\n\n== History ==\nThe \u00d6VP is the successor of the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]], a staunchly conservative movement founded in 1893 by [[Karl Lueger]], mayor of [[Vienna]] and highly controversial [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]. Most of the members of the party during its founding belonged to the former [[Fatherland Front (Austria)|Fatherland Front]], which was led by chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], also a member of the Christian Social Party before the [[Anschluss]]. While still sometimes honored by \u00d6VP members for resisting [[Adolf Hitler]], the regime built by Dollfuss was authoritarian in nature and has been dubbed as [[Austrofascism]]. In its present form, the \u00d6VP was established immediately after the restoration of Austria's independence in 1945 and it has been represented in both the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] ever since. In terms of Federal Assembly seats, the \u00d6VP has consistently been the strongest or second-strongest party and as such it has led or at least been a partner in most Austria's federal cabinets.\n\n=== Federal Government ===\n{{update section|date=October 2017}}\nIn November 1945, the \u00d6VP won a [[landslide victory]] in Austria's [[1945 Austrian legislative election|first postwar election]], winning almost half the popular vote and an absolute majority in the legislature. However, memories of the hyper-partisanship that had plagued the First Republic prompted the \u00d6VP to maintain the [[grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SP\u00d6) that had governed the country since the restoration of independence in early 1945. The \u00d6VP remained the senior partner in this coalition until 1966 and governed alone from 1966 to 1970. It reentered the government in 1986, but has never been completely out of power since the restoration of Austrian independence in 1945 due to a longstanding tradition that all major interest groups were to be consulted on policy.\n\nAfter the [[1999 Austrian legislative election|1999 legislative election]], several months of negotiations ended in early 2000 when the \u00d6VP formed a [[coalition government]] with the right-wing populist [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6) led by [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]. The FP\u00d6 had won just a few hundred more votes than the \u00d6VP, but was considered far too controversial to lead a government. The \u00d6VP's [[Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel]] became [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]]\u2014the first \u00d6VP Chancellor of Austria since 1970. This caused widespread outrage in Europe and the [[European Union]] imposed informal diplomatic sanctions on Austria, the first time that it imposed sanctions on a member state. Bilateral relations were frozen (including contacts and meetings at an inter-governmental level) and Austrian candidates would not be supported for posts in European Union international offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/feb2000/haid-f22.shtml|title=The European Union's sanctions against Austria|publisher=WSWS|date=22 February 2000|accessdate=4 September 2012}}</ref> Austria threatened to veto all applications by countries for European Union membership until the sanctions were lifted.<ref>{{cite news|author=Donald G.

The [[2002 Austrian legislative election|2002 legislative election]] resulted in a landslide victory (42.27% of the vote) for the \u00d6VP under Sch\u00fcssel. Haider's FP\u00d6 was reduced to 10.16% of the vote.\n\nAfter the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) split from the FP\u00d6 in 2005, the BZ\u00d6 replaced the FP\u00d6 in the government coalition, which lasted until 2007. Austria for the first time had a government containing of a party that was founded during the parliamentary term.\n\nIn the [[2006 Austrian legislative election|2006 legislative election]], the \u00d6VP were defeated and after much negotiations agreed to become junior partner in a grand coalition with the SP\u00d6, with new party chairman [[Wilhelm Molterer]] as [[Finance Minister of Austria|Finance Minister]] and [[Vice-Chancellor of Austria|Vice Chancellor]] under SP\u00d6 leader [[Alfred Gusenbauer]], who became Chancellor. The next [[2008 Austrian legislative election|legislative election in 2008]] saw the \u00d6VP lose 15 seats with an 8.35% decrease in its share of the vote.\n\nThe \u00d6VP won the largest share of the vote (30.0%) in the [[2009 European Parliament election in Austria|2009 European elections]] with 846,709, votes but their number of seats remained the same.\n\n=== States ===\nAt the [[states of Austria|state level]], the \u00d6VP has long dominated the rural states of [[Lower Austria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Styria]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Vorarlberg]]. It is less popular in the [[city state]] of Vienna and in the rural, but less strongly Catholic states of [[Burgenland]] and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. In 2004, it lost its [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] in the [[Salzburg (state)|State of Salzburg]], where they kept its result in seats (14) in 2009 and in 2005 in [[Styria]] for the first time.\n\n=== Chairpersons since 1945 ===\nThe chart below shows a timeline of \u00d6VP chairpersons and the [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellors of Austria]].

Equally problematic, the model is not designed to assess the effect on trade from trade agreements \u2013 in fact, the model is profoundly ill suited for such an exercise. No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade. The reason is simple: if a model cannot predict the effects on the flows and profile of trade as a consequence of trade liberalisation, it is of no use at all.\"<ref name=\":30\"/> They add, \"In Capaldo\u2019s analysis, structural change and the emergence of new industries do not play a role at all. Capaldo implicitly assumes that an economy with its labour and capital does not respond and adjust to new circumstances. New competition only leads to new unemployment.

Busch and [[McGill University]] Professor Krzysztof J. Pelc note that modern trade deals are long and complex because they often tackle [[non-tariff barriers to trade]], such as different standards and regulations, in addition to [[tariff]]s. Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

No trade economist, regardless what school of thought he or she comes from, has ever used this model to make estimates of trade.

Due to steadily decreasing tariff barriers since WWII, countries have become increasingly likely to enact trade barriers in the form of non-tariff barriers. National firms often lobby their own governments to enact regulations that are designed to keep out foreign firms. The TPP addresses many of these \"disguised restrictions on trade\" by, for instance, \"basing these measures on agreed-upon science; making the process of formulating regulations more transparent; and giving foreign exporters opportunities to offer substantive input in the formulation of these measures.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/08/02/yes-the-tpp-agreement-is-over-5000-pages-long-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing/|title=Yes, the TPP agreement is over 5,000 pages long.

The series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 21, 1997. Although 11 episodes (plus a [[Television pilot|pilot]]) were produced, the series was canceled after only three had aired.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter being fired from the [[soap opera]] ''Days to Remember'', down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson (Tim Curry) moves into [[Manhattan]]'s Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin (Annie Potts), whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days.  Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her.\n\nSimon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious {{frac|7|1|2}}-year-old Daniel ([[Luke Tarsitano]]) and angst-ridden teen Gwen ([[Marla Sokoloff]]).  The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos ([[Steve Carell]]), also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films.  Also seen are Rose ([[Liz Torres]]), the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain ([[John O'Hurley]]), the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton (Devin Neil Oatway), a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse ([[Danny Strong]]), a geek who is smitten with Gwen.\n\nEpisodes mostly centered around Simon's outlandish shenanigans and attempts to break back into show business.\n\n==Cast & Characters==\n*[[Tim Curry]] as Simon Ferguson<br />The star of his acting class, Simon was a British actor with a promising career ahead of him, even garnering an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1977, but his ego got in the way. After gaining a reputation for being difficult to work with, he was forced to take roles in [[straight-to-video]] fare like \"''[[Hardbodies|Hardbodies 3]]'',\" and eventually the trashy TV [[soap opera]] \"''Days to Remember''.\"  Simon's only real friend is Hadley, whom he was briefly married to decades earlier.\n*[[Annie Potts]] as Hadley Martin<br />Hailing from [[Tennessee]], Hadley moved to [[New York City|New York]] to pursue an acting career, but following a string of rejection and failed marriages, she found herself playing a single-mom to a pair of kids while managing a hotel in [[Manhattan]].\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Yorgo Galfanikos<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Yorgo Calfanikos (character)\n|publisher=Internet Movie Database\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168426/\n|accessdate=2009-12-31\n}}</ref><br />A [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant who's obsessed with presenting the perfect meal, chef Yorgo exudes a manic temperament that comes across as hostile even when he's being sincere.\n*[[Luke Tarsitano]] as Daniel Martin<br />Hadley's 7-year-old son questions everything and is a constant source of aggravation for both his sister and Simon.\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Gwen Martin<br />Hadley's defiant teenage daughter, who's smitten with boys and social status.\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Rose<br />The hefty Assistant Manager of The Metropolitan Hotel, the Hispanic Rose takes no guff from anyone and is quick to spout off her opinion on any subject.\n*[[John O'Hurley]] as Robert McSwain<br />The infrequently-seen hotel investor is conservative to the point of being repressed, and his crush on Hadley is transparent.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was pitched in early 1996 to ABC president [[Ted Harbert]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Paeth|first=Greg |title=You'll Be Underwhelmed By ABC's 'Over the Top'|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=October 21, 1997}}</ref> and although it would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development.  Tim Curry was aboard and wanted the relationship between the two leads to be loosely based on his relationship with friend and next door neighbor Annie Potts, to whom he said, \"I wish you could do this with me!\"<ref name=NYDailyNews>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1997/10/20/1997-10-20_to_her_co-star__annie_potts_.html|title=To Her Co-Star, Annie Potts Is the 'Top'|last=Williams |first=Scott |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|date=October 20, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Potts was starring in the TV spin-off of the popular film ''[[Dangerous Minds (TV series)|Dangerous Minds]]'' at the time, so it did not seem as though a reunion was imminent (the two had previously co-starred together as husband and wife in the film ''[[Pass the Ammo]]'').  Three days before they were ready to shoot the pilot for ''Over the Top'', ''[[Dangerous Minds (TV series)|Dangerous Minds]]'' was canceled,<ref name=Arthel>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8LLdK_SCgU|title=Tim Curry on Arthel and Fred Show 1997 - Part 2|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> and although Potts was heartbroken over the cancellation of that series,<ref name=NYDailyNews /> she jumped at the chance to work with Curry again.\n\nThe premise of the pilot was that Curry's character, actor Simon Ferguson, was fired from his soap opera, so he visited the quaint [[bed and breakfast]] in [[Upstate New York]] owned by his ex-wife, Kate (Potts), whom he was once married to for six months.  Although flabbergasted with Simon, Kate ultimately decided to let her ex stay on as a new addition to the staff.  The cast was rounded out by [[Luke Tarsitano]] and [[Natanya Ross]] as Kate's children from a subsequent marriage, [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as the maid, and a then-unknown actor named [[Steve Carell]] as manic chef Yorgo.\n\nBy the time the pilot was filmed, ABC Entertainment president [[Ted Harbert]] had been replaced by [[Jamie Tarses]], whom executive producer [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]] was dating.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-10-21/lifestyle/9710200200_1_fawlty-towers-premiere-week-simon-ferguson|title='Top' a Flop|last=Jicha |first=Tom|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Rumors began to swirl that the series was only picked up as a result of their romance, and it did not help matters that the press was only shown snippets of the pilot episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/glow/1997/10/21glow.html|title=Blue Glow|last=Millman|first=Joyce|publisher=[[salon.com]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  In the months between the time the series was picked up and its scheduled premiere, Morton and Tarses' relationship ended.\n\nOriginally slated to debut on September 23, 1997<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289604,00.html|title=On the Air: September 26, 1997|last=Flint |first=Joe |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 26, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> the show's premiere was delayed until October 21, opposite the [[World Series]],<ref name=sun /> so it could be retooled.  [[Natanya Ross]] and [[Debra Jo Rupp]] were replaced by [[Marla Sokoloff]] and [[Liz Torres]], and [[John O'Hurley]]'s character was written into the show on a recurring basis. Kate was renamed Hadley and her character became more sympathetic toward Simon. The setting was changed to New York City and the pilot was reshot (as the episode \"I'm Bonnie, I'm Clyde\").  The reason given for the retooling was because in NYC there would be more opportunities \"for comedic interaction with city characters\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/arts/if-they-can-make-it-there.html|title=If They Can Make It There|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> but the press began to speculate that the changes were again a result of the failed Tarses/Morton romance.  Morton sidestepped this question by claiming, \"We needed to give Tim a bigger playing field,\"<ref name=EW /> and that the cast \"was not as comfortable with each other as we wanted\".<ref name=EW />  ABC, meanwhile, claimed that they did not want their 8:00&nbsp;p.m. lead-in show, ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'', to face off against what was expected to be a high-rated season premiere of ''[[Mad About You]]'',<ref name=EW /> so they rearranged the schedule.  \"By shifting ''Soul Man'''s time slot for the first few weeks of the season,\" Tarses released in a public statement, \"we're giving this pivotal series the luxury to recapture its audience without intense premiere competition.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Carmody|first=John|title=The TV Column|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 11, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe show's stars, however, remained optimistic.

Potts, meanwhile, also did some interviews, barely acknowledging the behind the scenes problems and claiming that the show should speak for itself.\n\n''Over the Top'' received minuscule network promotion (generally only small blurbs tacked onto the ends of commercials for ''Soul Man''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQMOyz6RuyY|title=Soul Man - Over the Top - ABC 1997 Promo|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>) and aired for three weeks with dismal ratings before being canceled (in some markets the final November 4 episode was bumped off the schedule unannounced for election coverage, and some ''[[TV Guide]]'' listings were a little slow to catch up, citing the unaired episodes \"Who's Afraid of Simon Ferguson?\" and \"The Review\" in the weeks following the show's cancellation).

The series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 21, 1997. Although 11 episodes (plus a [[Television pilot|pilot]]) were produced, the series was canceled after only three had aired.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter being fired from the [[soap opera]] ''Days to Remember'', down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson (Tim Curry) moves into [[Manhattan]]'s Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin (Annie Potts), whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days.  Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her.\n\nSimon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious {{frac|7|1|2}}-year-old Daniel ([[Luke Tarsitano]]) and angst-ridden teen Gwen ([[Marla Sokoloff]]).  The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos ([[Steve Carell]]), also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films.  Also seen are Rose ([[Liz Torres]]), the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain ([[John O'Hurley]]), the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton (Devin Neil Oatway), a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse ([[Danny Strong]]), a geek who is smitten with Gwen.\n\nEpisodes mostly centered around Simon's outlandish shenanigans and attempts to break back into show business.\n\n==Cast & Characters==\n*[[Tim Curry]] as Simon Ferguson<br />The star of his acting class, Simon was a British actor with a promising career ahead of him, even garnering an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1977, but his ego got in the way. After gaining a reputation for being difficult to work with, he was forced to take roles in [[straight-to-video]] fare like \"''[[Hardbodies|Hardbodies 3]]'',\" and eventually the trashy TV [[soap opera]] \"''Days to Remember''.\"  Simon's only real friend is Hadley, whom he was briefly married to decades earlier.\n*[[Annie Potts]] as Hadley Martin<br />Hailing from [[Tennessee]], Hadley moved to [[New York City|New York]] to pursue an acting career, but following a string of rejection and failed marriages, she found herself playing a single-mom to a pair of kids while managing a hotel in [[Manhattan]].\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Yorgo Galfanikos<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Yorgo Calfanikos (character)\n|publisher=Internet Movie Database\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168426/\n|accessdate=2009-12-31\n}}</ref><br />A [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant who's obsessed with presenting the perfect meal, chef Yorgo exudes a manic temperament that comes across as hostile even when he's being sincere.\n*[[Luke Tarsitano]] as Daniel Martin<br />Hadley's 7-year-old son questions everything and is a constant source of aggravation for both his sister and Simon.\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Gwen Martin<br />Hadley's defiant teenage daughter, who's smitten with boys and social status.\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Rose<br />The hefty Assistant Manager of The Metropolitan Hotel, the Hispanic Rose takes no guff from anyone and is quick to spout off her opinion on any subject.\n*[[John O'Hurley]] as Robert McSwain<br />The infrequently-seen hotel investor is conservative to the point of being repressed, and his crush on Hadley is transparent.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was pitched in early 1996 to ABC president [[Ted Harbert]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Paeth|first=Greg |title=You'll Be Underwhelmed By ABC's 'Over the Top'|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=October 21, 1997}}</ref> and although it would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development.

Three days before they were ready to shoot the pilot for ''Over the Top'', ''[[Dangerous Minds (TV series)|Dangerous Minds]]'' was canceled,<ref name=Arthel>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8LLdK_SCgU|title=Tim Curry on Arthel and Fred Show 1997 - Part 2|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> and although Potts was heartbroken over the cancellation of that series,<ref name=NYDailyNews /> she jumped at the chance to work with Curry again.\n\nThe premise of the pilot was that Curry's character, actor Simon Ferguson, was fired from his soap opera, so he visited the quaint [[bed and breakfast]] in [[Upstate New York]] owned by his ex-wife, Kate (Potts), whom he was once married to for six months.  Although flabbergasted with Simon, Kate ultimately decided to let her ex stay on as a new addition to the staff.  The cast was rounded out by [[Luke Tarsitano]] and [[Natanya Ross]] as Kate's children from a subsequent marriage, [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as the maid, and a then-unknown actor named [[Steve Carell]] as manic chef Yorgo.\n\nBy the time the pilot was filmed, ABC Entertainment president [[Ted Harbert]] had been replaced by [[Jamie Tarses]], whom executive producer [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]] was dating.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-10-21/lifestyle/9710200200_1_fawlty-towers-premiere-week-simon-ferguson|title='Top' a Flop|last=Jicha |first=Tom|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Rumors began to swirl that the series was only picked up as a result of their romance, and it did not help matters that the press was only shown snippets of the pilot episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/glow/1997/10/21glow.html|title=Blue Glow|last=Millman|first=Joyce|publisher=[[salon.com]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  In the months between the time the series was picked up and its scheduled premiere, Morton and Tarses' relationship ended.\n\nOriginally slated to debut on September 23, 1997<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289604,00.html|title=On the Air: September 26, 1997|last=Flint |first=Joe |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 26, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> the show's premiere was delayed until October 21, opposite the [[World Series]],<ref name=sun /> so it could be retooled.  [[Natanya Ross]] and [[Debra Jo Rupp]] were replaced by [[Marla Sokoloff]] and [[Liz Torres]], and [[John O'Hurley]]'s character was written into the show on a recurring basis. Kate was renamed Hadley and her character became more sympathetic toward Simon. The setting was changed to New York City and the pilot was reshot (as the episode \"I'm Bonnie, I'm Clyde\").  The reason given for the retooling was because in NYC there would be more opportunities \"for comedic interaction with city characters\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/arts/if-they-can-make-it-there.html|title=If They Can Make It There|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> but the press began to speculate that the changes were again a result of the failed Tarses/Morton romance.  Morton sidestepped this question by claiming, \"We needed to give Tim a bigger playing field,\"<ref name=EW /> and that the cast \"was not as comfortable with each other as we wanted\".<ref name=EW />  ABC, meanwhile, claimed that they did not want their 8:00&nbsp;p.m. lead-in show, ''[[Soul Man (TV series)|Soul Man]]'', to face off against what was expected to be a high-rated season premiere of ''[[Mad About You]]'',<ref name=EW /> so they rearranged the schedule.  \"By shifting ''Soul Man'''s time slot for the first few weeks of the season,\" Tarses released in a public statement, \"we're giving this pivotal series the luxury to recapture its audience without intense premiere competition.\"\n<ref>{{cite news|last=Carmody|first=John|title=The TV Column|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 11, 1997}}</ref>\n\nThe show's stars, however, remained optimistic.
