In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/03/200309110456.htm|title=COVID-19 infections in U.S. may be much higher, new estimates show|date=|website=sciencedaily.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n<div class=\"toccolours\" style=\"width:800px; margin:1em 0;\"><center>'''COVID19 Epidemic curve selected countries (Logarithmic scale / from the 100th case)'''</center>\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=3\n|width=600\n|height=600\n|xAxisTitle= Day \n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|yAxisTitle= No. of new cases\n|legend= Legend \n<!-- PLease clipboard copy the \"}x=...\" and \"y1=...\" lines from the log plot of total cases when you update these charts -->\n\n<!-- Search string CASES_X -->\n|x=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,\n<!-- Search string CASES_Y -->\n|y1Title=Italy\n|y1=100,229,322,445,650,888,1128,1694,2036,2502,3089,3858,4636,5883,7375,9172,10149,12462,15113,17660,21157,24747,27980,31506,35713,41035,47021,53578,59138,63927,69176,74386,80539,86498,92472,97889,101739,105793,110574,115242,119827,124632,128948,132547,135586,139422,143626,147577,152271,156363,159516,\n|y4Title=China\n|y4=100,198,270,300,400,547,639,916,1399,2062,2863,5494,6070,8125,9783,11871,16607,19693,23680,27409,30553,34075,36778,39790,42306,44699,59832,66292,68347,70446,72364,74158,75002,75891,76288,76936,77150,77658,78064,78824,79251,79824,80026,80151,80270,80409,80552,80651,80695,80735,80754,80778,80793,80813,80824,80844,80860,80881,\n|y3Title=Czech Rep.\n|y3=100,116,141,189,198,383,450,560,765,889,1047,1161,1287,1472,1763,2022,2395,2657,2817,3001,3308,3589,3858,4190,4472,4587,4822,5017,5312,5569,5732,5902,5991,6059,\n|y2Title=Netherlands\n|y2=100,128,188,264,321,382,503,614,804,959,1135,1413,1705,2051,2460,2994,3631,4204,4749,5560,6412,7431,8603,9762,10866,11750,12595,13614,14697,15723,16627,17851,18803,19580,20549,21762,23097,24413,25587,26551,\n|y5Title=S.Korea\n|y5=100,204,433,602,833,977,1261,1766,2337,3150,3736,4335,5186,5621,6088,6593,7041,7314,7478,7513,7755,7869,7979,8086,8162,8236,8320,8413,8565,8652,8799,8897,8961,9037,9137,9241,9332,9478,9583,9661,9786,9887,9976,10062,10156,10237,10284,10331,10384,10423,10450,10480,10512,10537,10564,\n|y10Title=Slovakia\n|y10=100,105,123,138,179,186,204,216,226,269,292,314,336,363,400,426,450,471,485,534,581,682,701,715,728,742,769,\n|y7Title=Germany\n|y7=100,151,188,240,349,534,684,847,1112,1565,1966,2745,3675,4585,5813,6012,7156,8198,10999,13957,16662,18610,22672,27436,31554,36508,42228,48582,52547,57298,61913,67336,73522,79696,85778,91714,95391,99225,103228,108202,113525,117658,120479,123016,125098,\n|y8Title=Japan\n|y8=100,132,144,157,164,186,210,230,239,254,268,284,317,349,408,455,488,514,568,620,675,716,780,814,829,873,914,950,1007,1054,1086,1128,1193,1291,1387,1499,1693,1866,1953,2178,2384,2617,2920,3139,3654,3906,4257,4667,5347,6005,6748,7370,\n|y9Title=Sweden\n|y9=100,137,161,203,260,356,500,687,814,941,1032,1121,1196,1292,1439,1639,1770,1934,2046,2286,2824,3069,3447,3700,4028,4435,4947,5466,6131,6443,6830,7206,7693,8419,9141,9685,10151,10446,10865,10948,\n|y6Title=United States\n|y6=100,175,252,353,497,645,936,1205,1598,2163,2825,3501,4373,5664,8074,12022,17439,23710,32341,42751,52690,64916,81966,101012,121105,140223,160686,186082,212814,241626,273808,307876,333593,362955,393602,425746,459989,493567,525436,553493,578178,\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n|yScaleType=log<!-- This is the line that makes this plot have a log axis -->\n|yAxisMin = 100 <!-- Needed to avoid trying to show the values y2, y3 of 0, impossible on log scale because log(0)=-infinity -->\n}}</div>\n<small>*Datasource: Wikipedia</small>\n\n<small>Czech restriction actions:/ '''Day0''': Schools closed / '''Day2''': State of Emergency: close of sport facilities&amp;close restaurants&amp;bars at 8pm,border control,travel restrictions,ban 30+events /'''Day3''': Criminalize spreading virus on purpose/'''Day4''': Complete closure all shops restaurants&amp;bars ex:food shops,petrol,pharmacies/'''Day5''': Nationwide quarantine ex: shopping, employment need/ '''Day6''': Borders closed&amp;closure municipalities in Olomouc region/ '''Day8''': Mandatory nose&amp;mouth cover / '''Day9''': Special 7\u20139 shop-opening hours for seniors.\n</small>\n\n==Basic reproduction number==\nIn epidemiology, [[Basic reproduction number|the basic reproduction number]] (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R<sub>0</sub>, pronounced R nought or R zero<ref>Milligan, Gregg N.; Barrett, Alan D.

In 2005 and 2006 it was rated by [https://www.forbes.com Forbes.com] at number 8 in the Top 10 Topless beaches in the World. Clifton is neighbored by the suburbs of [[Camps Bay, Cape Town|Camps Bay]] and [[Bantry Bay, Cape Town|Bantry Bay]].\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Image:Cliftonbeach1.jpg|thumb|left|Lion's head from Clifton 4th Beach]]\nThe area has a set of 4 [[beach]]es which are frequently used destinations for both locals and [[tourism|tourists]].<ref>\"CAPE TOWN\" (Nov 2010) '' Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel'', Intellitravel Media, Inc., New York</ref> The beaches, which are named from 1st to 4th, are separated by falls of [[granite]] boulders and have almost pure white granitic sand. The four beaches of Clifton are one of the few areas well protected from the notorious south-easterly wind, which has a great deal to do with its popularity with bathers. A fifth beach, before First Beach, called Moses Beach (so-called because of the papyrus plants that grow along it), appears and disappears as the sand is washed in and out with the seasons. The water, although chilly (12\u201316&nbsp;\u00b0C), plays host to many [[watersports]], mostly surfing, both board and body. The strongest surf is at First, diminishing to Fourth, where it is the weakest. Fourth beach (to the South), is the most populated and glamorous venue;<ref>\"Cape Escape\" (Dec 2005) ''Variety'', suppl. V LIFE 400. 13: 46,48.</ref> attracting families. Yachts anchor off Fourth beach, especially on summer weekends. Third beach, the smallest beach, is known as a venue for gay culture. Second beach is populated by students playing beach volleyball and beach bats. First beach, to the north, draws a mixed crowd of locals and surfers. Clifton Beach was noted as one of [http://www.discovery.com Discovery.com's] best beaches by region.\n\nClifton's 4th beach has also been awarded the [[Blue Flag Beach|Blue Flag award]] in recognition of its environmental, safety and tourist standards.\n\nThe small size of the properties on which bungalows are built between Fourth and Second beaches is attributable to the fact that the area was laid out by the City of Cape Town for returning soldiers who had fought in World War I. The original bungalows, now all but replaced by new structures, were built from the packing cases that conveyed imported motor cars during the 1920s and 30s. Narrow flights of stairs run between Victoria Road and the various beaches. These houses now fetch very high prices on the housing market, despite being only able to be reached by stairs, and, in most cases, having no garaging.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAn interesting feature of Clifton's 4 beaches involves the water temperatures and annual denudation and re-deposit of the bay's sugar-white sands, although for the most part protected in the 'wind shadow' of Lion's Head mountain that stands behind Clifton (on its eastern side).\n\nThe strong prevailing south-east wind of summer (October to April), being off-shore, moves the warmer top layer of water out of the bay \u2013 with the result that a compensating strong inflow of icy cold water is set up into the bay. This tends to make water temperatures in summer dip to their lowest levels \u2013 sometimes below 10 \u00b0C. It also has the effect of re-depositing sand (stripped in winter) onto the beaches, so that by late summer, Clifton's beaches are at their widest, allowing for easy pedestrian movement along the waterline, from beach to beach.\n\nBy contrast, winter's howling north-west gales drive warm surface-water into the bay, setting up a compensating outflow of water along the bottom.

In 2005 and 2006 it was rated by [https://www.forbes.com Forbes.com] at number 8 in the Top 10 Topless beaches in the World. Clifton is neighbored by the suburbs of [[Camps Bay, Cape Town|Camps Bay]] and [[Bantry Bay, Cape Town|Bantry Bay]].\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Image:Cliftonbeach1.jpg|thumb|left|Lion's head from Clifton 4th Beach]]\nThe area has a set of 4 [[beach]]es which are frequently used destinations for both locals and [[tourism|tourists]].<ref>\"CAPE TOWN\" (Nov 2010) '' Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel'', Intellitravel Media, Inc., New York</ref> The beaches, which are named from 1st to 4th, are separated by falls of [[granite]] boulders and have almost pure white granitic sand. The four beaches of Clifton are one of the few areas well protected from the notorious south-easterly wind, which has a great deal to do with its popularity with bathers. A fifth beach, before First Beach, called Moses Beach (so-called because of the papyrus plants that grow along it), appears and disappears as the sand is washed in and out with the seasons. The water, although chilly (12\u201316&nbsp;\u00b0C), plays host to many [[watersports]], mostly surfing, both board and body. The strongest surf is at First, diminishing to Fourth, where it is the weakest. Fourth beach (to the South), is the most populated and glamorous venue;<ref>\"Cape Escape\" (Dec 2005) ''Variety'', suppl. V LIFE 400. 13: 46,48.</ref> attracting families. Yachts anchor off Fourth beach, especially on summer weekends. Third beach, the smallest beach, is known as a venue for gay culture. Second beach is populated by students playing beach volleyball and beach bats. First beach, to the north, draws a mixed crowd of locals and surfers. Clifton Beach was noted as one of [http://www.discovery.com Discovery.com's] best beaches by region.\n\nClifton's 4th beach has also been awarded the [[Blue Flag Beach|Blue Flag award]] in recognition of its environmental, safety and tourist standards.\n\nThe small size of the properties on which bungalows are built between Fourth and Second beaches is attributable to the fact that the area was laid out by the City of Cape Town for returning soldiers who had fought in World War I. The original bungalows, now all but replaced by new structures, were built from the packing cases that conveyed imported motor cars during the 1920s and 30s. Narrow flights of stairs run between Victoria Road and the various beaches. These houses now fetch very high prices on the housing market, despite being only able to be reached by stairs, and, in most cases, having no garaging.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAn interesting feature of Clifton's 4 beaches involves the water temperatures and annual denudation and re-deposit of the bay's sugar-white sands, although for the most part protected in the 'wind shadow' of Lion's Head mountain that stands behind Clifton (on its eastern side).\n\nThe strong prevailing south-east wind of summer (October to April), being off-shore, moves the warmer top layer of water out of the bay \u2013 with the result that a compensating strong inflow of icy cold water is set up into the bay. This tends to make water temperatures in summer dip to their lowest levels \u2013 sometimes below 10 \u00b0C. It also has the effect of re-depositing sand (stripped in winter) onto the beaches, so that by late summer, Clifton's beaches are at their widest, allowing for easy pedestrian movement along the waterline, from beach to beach.\n\nBy contrast, winter's howling north-west gales drive warm surface-water into the bay, setting up a compensating outflow of water along the bottom. This water movement tends to cause the bay (and most of the adjacent Atlantic Seaboard) to fill with relatively warm water (10 - 20&nbsp;\u00b0C) during winter \u2013 but also strips the sand from the beaches, causing temporary beach erosion that exposes the granite boulder headlands that define the beaches. This peculiarity often startles those unaccustomed to the regular cycle; during these periods, city officials have been known to petition to have sand dumped on the Clifton shore to rectify what they perceive as a defect. But, each summer, Clifton repairs itself with new sand.\n\n==Shark attacks==\nClifton has had just two separate shark attacks. In 1942, Johan Christian Bergh was attacked by a shark 30 meters off the 4th beach. Bergh's body was never recovered. Witnesses report seeing a 6-meter [[great white shark]] swim along the surf's backline and take Mr. Bergh in two rapid attacks.

Alexander would then venture into [[Punjab]] (land of five rivers), which was conquered by [[Darius the Great]] before him. Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.\n\nAlexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]]. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323&nbsp;BC, the [[Diadochi]] or \"successors\" founded their own kingdoms. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]] and extended as far as India.\n\nThe [[Mauryan Empire]], founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], would first [[Conquest of the Nanda Empire|conquer the Nanda Empire]]. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]]. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the [[Indus Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained.\n\nThe Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest Indian empire]]. Following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place.<ref>The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare\n30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper</ref> As ascribed in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the Emperor spread [[Dharma]] as Buddhism throughout his empire.

The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD&nbsp;10). Even though the region was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st\u20133rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive.\n\n[[Buddhism in India]] was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as [[Bengal]] largely ended during the [[Islamic invasions of India]].\n\n==Cultural interaction==\n{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}\nThe length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.\n\n===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331\u2013325&nbsp;BC)===\n[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Victory coin\" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] {{circa|322&nbsp;BC}}, following his campaigns in [[India]].<br/>'''Obverse''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].<br/>'''Reverse''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.<br/>Silver.

The legend states that they then returned home and spread the Buddha's teaching.<ref>Foltz, ''Religions of the Silk Road'', p. 43</ref>\n\nIn 326 BC, Alexander conquered the Northern region of India. King Ambhi of Taxila, known as [[Taxiles]], surrendered his city, a notable Buddhist center, to Alexander.

The Greek biographer [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] explained that Pyrrho's equanimity and detachment from the world were acquired in India.<ref>\"He would withdraw from the world and live in solitude, rarely showing himself to his relatives; this is because he had heard an Indian reproach [[Anaxarchus]], telling him that he would never be able to teach others what is good while he himself danced attendance on kings in their court.

Before this innovation, Buddhist art was \"[[aniconism|aniconic]]\": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).\n\nThis reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.<ref>\"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time\".

In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n\n{{multiple image|align=left\n|image1=StandingBuddha.jpg\n|width1=125\n|caption1=Standing Buddha, Gandhara, 1st century AD.\n|image2=Buddha-Vajrapani-Herakles.JPG\n|width2=200\n|caption2=[[Heracles|Herculean]] depiction of [[Vajrapani]] (right), as the protector of the Buddha, 2nd century AD [[Gandhara]], [[British Museum]].\n}}\nMany of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st\u20132nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330&nbsp;BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]]. The curly hair of Buddha is described in the famous list of the [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]] in the Buddhist sutras.

Alexander would then venture into [[Punjab]] (land of five rivers), which was conquered by [[Darius the Great]] before him. Alexander crossed the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Jhelum River]] when defeating Porus and appointing him as a satrap following the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. Alexander's army would mutiny and retreat along the [[Beas River]] when confronted by the [[Nanda Empire]], thus wouldn't conquer Punjab entirely.\n\nAlexander founded several cities in his new territories in the areas of the [[Amu Darya]] and [[Bactria]], and Greek settlements further extended to the [[Khyber Pass]], [[Gandhara]] (see [[Taxila (modern)|Taxila]]), and the [[Punjab]]. Following Alexander's death on June 10, 323&nbsp;BC, the [[Diadochi]] or \"successors\" founded their own kingdoms. General [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]] set up the [[Seleucid Empire]] in [[Anatolia]] and [[Central Asia]] and extended as far as India.\n\nThe [[Mauryan Empire]], founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], would first [[Conquest of the Nanda Empire|conquer the Nanda Empire]]. Chandragupta would then defeat the Seleucid Empire during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]]. This resulted in the transfer of the Macedonian satraps in the [[Indus Valley]] and [[Gandhara]] to the Mauryan Empire. Furthermore, a marriage alliance was enacted which granted Seleucus's daughter as Chandragupta's wife for diplomatic relations. The conflict additionally led to the transfer of 500 war elephants to the Seleucid Empire from the Mauryan Empire, presumably as expenses of lives lost and damages sustained.\n\nThe Mauryan Emperor Ashoka established the [[List of largest empires in India|largest Indian empire]]. Following the destructive [[Kalinga War]], Ashoka converted to Buddhism. Abandoning an expansionist agenda, Ashoka would adopt humanitarian reformation in place.<ref>The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Development of the Humanitarian Ideal in Warfare\n30-04-1995 Article, International Review of the Red Cross, No. 305, by Gerald Draper</ref> As ascribed in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], the Emperor spread [[Dharma]] as Buddhism throughout his empire.

The Greco-Bactrians were followed by the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]] (180&nbsp;BC&nbsp;\u2013 AD&nbsp;10). Even though the region was conquered by the [[Indo-Scythians]] and the [[Kushan Empire]] (1st\u20133rd centuries AD), Buddhism continued to thrive.\n\n[[Buddhism in India]] was a major religion for centuries until a major Hindu revival from around the 5th century, with remaining strongholds such as [[Bengal]] largely ended during the [[Islamic invasions of India]].\n\n==Cultural interaction==\n{{see also|Hellenistic influence on Indian art}}\nThe length of the Greek presence in Central Asia and northern India provided opportunities for interaction, not only on the artistic, but also on the religious plane.\n\n===Alexander the Great in Bactria and India (331\u2013325&nbsp;BC)===\n[[File:Alexander victory coin Babylon silver c 322 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|\"Victory coin\" of [[Alexander the Great]], minted in [[Babylon]] {{circa|322&nbsp;BC}}, following his campaigns in [[India]].<br/>'''Obverse''': Alexander being crowned by [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]].<br/>'''Reverse''': Alexander attacking [[King Porus]] on his elephant.<br/>Silver.

Before this innovation, Buddhist art was \"[[aniconism|aniconic]]\": the Buddha was only represented through his symbols (an empty throne, the [[Bodhi Tree]], [[Buddha footprint]]s, the [[Dharmachakra]]).\n\nThis reluctance towards anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha, and the sophisticated development of aniconic symbols to avoid it (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear), seem to be connected to one of the Buddha's sayings reported in the ''[[Digha Nikaya]]'' that discouraged representations of himself after the extinction of his body.<ref>\"Due to the statement of the Master in the ''Dighanikaya'' disfavouring his representation in human form after the extinction of body, reluctance prevailed for some time\".

In India as well, it was only natural for the Greeks to create a single common divinity by combining the image of a Greek [[god-king]] ([[Apollo]], or possibly the deified founder of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]], [[Demetrius I of Bactria]]), with the traditional [[physical characteristics of the Buddha]].\n\n{{multiple image|align=left\n|image1=StandingBuddha.jpg\n|width1=125\n|caption1=Standing Buddha, Gandhara, 1st century AD.\n|image2=Buddha-Vajrapani-Herakles.JPG\n|width2=200\n|caption2=[[Heracles|Herculean]] depiction of [[Vajrapani]] (right), as the protector of the Buddha, 2nd century AD [[Gandhara]], [[British Museum]].\n}}\nMany of the stylistic elements in the representations of the Buddha point to Greek influence: [[himation]], the [[contrapposto]] stance of the upright figures, such as the 1st\u20132nd century Gandhara standing Buddhas, the stylized curly hair and [[ushnisha]] apparently derived from the style of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] (330&nbsp;BC) and the measured quality of the faces, all rendered with strong artistic [[Realism (arts)|realism]]. A large quantity of [[sculpture]]s combining Buddhist and purely Hellenistic styles and [[iconography]] were excavated at the modern site of [[Hadda, Afghanistan]].

The Bani Sakhr migrated to central Jordan from the [[Hijaz]] in the late eighteenth century.<ref>Falconry in Arabia, Mark Allen; 1980, p.33.</ref> According to the 1986 Jordanian Electoral Law, the Bani Sakhr tribe is made up of fourteen clans: Al-Fayez; AL-Jahawsheh;Al-Khirshan; Al-Jbour; Al-Salim; Al-Badareen; Al-Gudah; Al-Hammad; Al-Shra'ah and Al-Zaben (traditionally known collectively as the Ka'abnah half of the Bani Sakhr); Al-Ghbein; Al-Amir; Al-Ka'abna; Al-Hgeish; Al-Saleet, and Al-Taybeen (traditionally known collectively as the Twaga half of the Bani Sakhr).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Muhammad|first1=Ghazi bin|title=The Tribes of Jordan at the Beginning of the Twenty-First Century|date=1999|url=http://rissc.jo/?option=com_content&view=article&id=275%3Athe-tribes-of-jordan-at-the-beginning-of-the-twenty-first-century-&catid=59%3Aturab--rutab-series&Itemid=84|page=10|edition=first|accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Al Faiz.jpg|thumb|right|Sheikh [[Mithqal Fayez|Mithqal Pasha Al-Fayez]], Jerusalem, 1933]]\n\n==Origin==\nThe Bani Sakhr was tribe title that was given to more than one tribe, but the greatest and most famous of its tribes that were are the sons of Sakhr Al-Ta\u2019yun from Bani [[Tayy]], who refer to their lineage to an offense of the famous [[Qahtanite|Qahtaniya tribe]]; specifically the [[Kahlan|Kahlani]] sub-group. The Tayy's lived in what is now the [[Ha'il Region]], where Sakhr Al-Ta'yun and the now Bani Sakhr mainly lived on top of the \"Mountain of Lions\".{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThen the Bani Sakhr migrated to occupy the lands [[Tayma]] to [[Al-\u02bfUla|Al-Ula]]; where they were adjacent to the [[Harb tribe|Bani Harb]] which led to the mixing of the two tribes. including some genealogists to fall into error and consider the tribe of Bani Sakhr a part of [[Harb tribe|Bani Harb]]. The Bani Sakhr were also adjacent to [[Anazzah|Bani Anazzah]], whom inhabited the [[Khaybar|Khayber]], and between the two tribes there were several conflicts, including the orientalist [[Frederick Peake|Frederick Gerard Peake]] in his book \"''A History of Jordan and its Tribes'', x, 1958\" that the tribe of Bani Sakhr clashed with tribes of Anazzah on the way to migrate to the [[Levant]]. The battle ended with the Anazzah's defeat, forcing some of their sub-groups to migrate to the northern more, and this explains the hostility between the two tribes.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Frederick's book, he also documented the clash between Bani Sakhr and the [[Al-Dhafeer|Al-Dhafeer tribes]] and that they defeated [[Al-Dhafeer]]. However, Al-Dhafeer regrouped again under the leadership of their knight Sultan Ibn Suwit, and followed Bani Sakhr, whom where heading heading north of the Arabian Peninsula. The two tribes met again in Wadi Azraq, now known as [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]], on the Saudi-Jordanian border. Banu Sakhr was able once again to defeat the tribes of Al-Dhafeer, killing Sheikh Sultan Ibn Suwit where he lies in his tomb in that region next to a water ravine the was named after him (Ghadeer Sultan).{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nBani Sakhr then headed towards [[Balqa Governorate|Al-Balqa]] however their stay did not last long because the tribes didn't welcome them, most notably the [[:ar:\u0639\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646_(\u0642\u0628\u064a\u0644\u0629)|Al-Adwan (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646)]] whom where extending their influence over the region. Bani Sakhr went to Palestine and stayed for a period of time until it soon returned to Al-Balqa. At this time, the area was under the sovereignty of the Sardiyya tribe, which was imposing a tax on the tribes that inhabited the areas in and around Al-Balqa, however when the Bani Sakhr returned, they refused to get taxed, which led to a heated situation between them.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThis conflict lead to the first alliance between Bani Sakhr and Al-Adwan where they joined forces with the intent to annihilate the Sardiyya tribe.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1799 the Beni Sakhr joined the Es-Sabhah and other tribes in a full-scale [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|battle]] against a force from [[Napoleon]]'s army under the command of [[General Kleber]]. The fighting occurred south of [[Nazareth]], with the French having such an advantage in terms of guns and artillery that Amir Rabah, the leader of the Beni Saqr, commenting on the effectiveness of his spear, said that he \"could not swim in hell with a stick.\"<ref>Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/114/mode/1up 114].</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the Beni Sakhr lived as nomads. Their income came from trading [[camel]]s and from the protection they could give, or refuse to give, to more settled peoples. In 1867, the [[Ottoman Empire]] launched a raid which defeated the Beni Sakhr and ended their practice of collecting ''khuwwa'' (protection money) from established settlements.\n\nFor fifty years up to 1920 the Bani Sakhr were friends and allies of the [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]] dynasty. The relationship ended with [[Ibn Saud]]'s conquest of the [[Nejd]]. It had its roots in the early nineteenth century when Abdullah Ibn Rashid was fleeing the Ibn Ali family after a conflict over leadership of the [[Shammar]] tribe. Ibn Rashid and his brother with a single camel arrived at the tents belonging to [[Haditha Al-Khraisha|Ali Al-Khraisha]], leader of the Beni Sakhr and father of [[Haditha Al-Khraisha]]. Sheikh [[Haditha Al-Khraisha|Ali Al-Khraisha]] was not there but all the same they were given hospitality. During the night the camel died and the next day they continued their flight on foot. Some distance from the camp they met Sheikh [[Haditha Al-Khraisha|Ali Al-Khraisha]] returning home. On hearing their story he insisted on them taking the camel he was riding, claiming that no guest who came into his camp riding should leave on foot. When Ibn Rashid came to power in the Nejd this deed was remembered.<ref>Glubb, 1978, pp. [https://archive.org/details/arabianadventure0000glub/page/157 157]-8.</ref>\n\nIn 1875 a member of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s survey team reported finding the Beni Sakhr in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Ghor]], a considerable extent of which was under cultivation. They had several herds containing 100 to 300 head of cattle and many sheep and goats as well as camels and horses. He mentions that they had fewer camels than previously since their power had been broken 7 or 8 years earlier by Mohammed Said, Pasha of [[Nablus]], but that the current government was impotent. He counted 150 tents and estimated the tribe strength as 400 men.<ref>Tyrwhitt Drake, 1875, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme07pale#page/n37/mode/1up 28], [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme07pale#page/n41/mode/1up 32]</ref>\n\nTwo years later, 1877, the survey team led by Lieutenant [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], found the Bani Sakhr camped on the road to [[Jenin]], and later between [[Beisan]] and [[Tiberias]]. Kitchener reported that their Sheikh, Fendy Alfayez, was the most powerful local leader and could muster 4,500 fighting men. The sheikh showed Kitchener a coat of mail that probably dated to the early centuries of the Arab conquests and appeared to be on good terms with the government. The tribe showed no sign of lawlessness, though local farmers had to harvest their crops early to avoid them being eaten by the grazing camels. The Beni Sakhr showed no interest in the ongoing war in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Balkans]] and expressed a strong dislike of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].<ref>Kitchener, 1877, p.

This time they were camped in [[Wadi al-Far'a|Wadi Farrah]] having left the area around [[Zir'in|Zerin]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]] following the murder near [[Nazareth]] of a British man, Mr Gale, about which they had come under suspicion. Sheikh Fendy was absent at [[Bosra]] selling camel to pilgrims on the [[Haj]]. The Beni Sakhr were close to having a monopoly in this trade and could make \u00a31,500 in a season. Whilst in Bosra the sheikh was arrested. His son was killed in a rescue attempt. The father was released and is reported as having said \"My son and I were servants of the Sultan, now he has one less\".

Immediately after the meeting Lawrence fled fearing betrayal. El Fayez was killed shortly afterwards. By June 1918 the Bani Sakhr were united in their opposition to the Turks and were offering to provide the Husseini forces with at least eleven thousand men costing \u00a330,000(\u00a31,715,944.76 adjusted to inflation as of April,2020) a month.

The Bani Sakhr were saved from this by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government ruling Jordan at the time. In exchange, the British required the Bani Sakhr to give up their nomadic lifestyle and turned more towards a semi-nomadic life. In the decades since then, pressures on the Bani Sakhr to give up part of their land have led to occasional tension between them and the Jordanian government.

The Tayy's lived in what is now the [[Ha'il Region]], where Sakhr Al-Ta'yun and the now Bani Sakhr mainly lived on top of the \"Mountain of Lions\".{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThen the Bani Sakhr migrated to occupy the lands [[Tayma]] to [[Al-\u02bfUla|Al-Ula]]; where they were adjacent to the [[Harb|Bani Harb]] which led to the mixing of the two tribes. including some genealogists to fall into error and consider the tribe of Bani Sakhr a part of [[Harb|Bani Harb]]. The Bani Sakhr were also adjacent to [[Anazzah|Bani Anazzah]], whom inhabited the [[Khaybar|Khayber]], and between the two tribes there were several conflicts, including the orientalist [[Frederick Peake|Frederick Gerard Peake]] in his book \"''A History of Jordan and its Tribes'', x, 1958\" that the tribe of Bani Sakhr clashed with tribes of Anazzah on the way to migrate to the [[Levant]]. The battle ended with the Anazzah's defeat, forcing some of their sub-groups to migrate to the northern more, and this explains the hostility between the two tribes.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn Frederick's book, he also documented the clash between Bani Sakhr and the [[Al-Dhafeer|Al-Dhafeer tribes]] and that they defeated [[Al-Dhafeer]]. However, Al-Dhafeer regrouped again under the leadership of their knight Sultan Ibn Suwit, and followed Bani Sakhr, whom where heading heading north of the Arabian Peninsula. The two tribes met again in Wadi Azraq, now known as [[Azraq, Jordan|Azraq]], on the Saudi-Jordanian border. Banu Sakhr was able once again to defeat the tribes of Al-Dhafeer, killing Sheikh Sultan Ibn Suwit where he lies in his tomb in that region next to a water ravine the was named after him (Ghadeer Sultan).{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nBani Sakhr then headed towards [[Balqa Governorate|Al-Balqa]] however their stay did not last long because the tribes didn't welcome them, most notably the [[:ar:\u0639\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646_(\u0642\u0628\u064a\u0644\u0629)|Al-Adwan (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0646)]] whom where extending their influence over the region. Bani Sakhr went to Palestine and stayed for a period of time until it soon returned to Al-Balqa. At this time, the area was under the sovereignty of the Sardiyya tribe, which was imposing a tax on the tribes that inhabited the areas in and around Al-Balqa, however when the Bani Sakhr returned, they refused to get taxed, which led to a heated situation between them.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThis conflict lead to the first alliance between Bani Sakhr and Al-Adwan where they joined forces with the intent to annihilate the Sardiyya tribe.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Background==\nIn the 1799 the Beni Sakhr joined the Es-Sabhah and other tribes in a full-scale [[Battle of Mount Tabor (1799)|battle]] against a force from [[Napoleon]]'s army under the command of [[General Kleber]]. The fighting occurred south of [[Nazareth]], with the French having such an advantage in terms of guns and artillery that Amir Rabah, the leader of the Beni Saqr, commenting on the effectiveness of his spear, said that he \"could not swim in hell with a stick.\"<ref>Macalister and Masterman, 1906, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme38pale#page/114/mode/1up 114].</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the Beni Sakhr lived as nomads. Their income came from trading [[camel]]s and from the protection they could give, or refuse to give, to more settled peoples. In 1867, the [[Ottoman Empire]] launched a raid which defeated the Beni Sakhr and ended their practice of collecting ''khuwwa'' (protection money) from established settlements.\n\nFor fifty years up to 1920 the Bani Sakhr were friends and allies of the [[Rashidi dynasty|Al Rashid]] dynasty. The relationship ended with [[Ibn Saud]]'s conquest of the [[Nejd]]. It had its roots in the early nineteenth century when Abdullah Ibn Rashid was fleeing the Ibn Ali family after a conflict over leadership of the [[Shammar]] tribe. Ibn Rashid and his brother with a single camel arrived at the tents belonging to [[Haditha Al-Khraisha|Ali Al-Khraisha]], leader of the Beni Sakhr and father of [[Haditha Al-Khraisha]]. Sheikh [[Haditha Al-Khraisha|Ali Al-Khraisha]] was not there but all the same they were given hospitality. During the night the camel died and the next day they continued their flight on foot. Some distance from the camp they met Sheikh [[Haditha Al-Khraisha|Ali Al-Khraisha]] returning home. On hearing their story he insisted on them taking the camel he was riding, claiming that no guest who came into his camp riding should leave on foot. When Ibn Rashid came to power in the Nejd this deed was remembered.<ref>Glubb, 1978, pp. [https://archive.org/details/arabianadventure0000glub/page/157 157]-8.</ref>\n\nIn 1875 a member of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s survey team reported finding the Beni Sakhr in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Ghor]], a considerable extent of which was under cultivation. They had several herds containing 100 to 300 head of cattle and many sheep and goats as well as camels and horses. He mentions that they had fewer camels than previously since their power had been broken 7 or 8 years earlier by Mohammed Said, Pasha of [[Nablus]], but that the current government was impotent. He counted 150 tents and estimated the tribe strength as 400 men.<ref>Tyrwhitt Drake, 1875, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme07pale#page/n37/mode/1up 28], [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme07pale#page/n41/mode/1up 32]</ref>\n\nTwo years later, 1877, the survey team led by Lieutenant [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], found the Bani Sakhr camped on the road to [[Jenin]], and later between [[Beisan]] and [[Tiberias]]. Kitchener reported that their Sheikh, Fendy Alfayez, was the most powerful local leader and could muster 4,500 fighting men. The sheikh showed Kitchener a coat of mail that probably dated to the early centuries of the Arab conquests and appeared to be on good terms with the government. The tribe showed no sign of lawlessness, though local farmers had to harvest their crops early to avoid them being eaten by the grazing camels. The Beni Sakhr showed no interest in the ongoing war in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Balkans]] and expressed a strong dislike of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].<ref>Kitchener, 1877, p.

She wrote a number of books, including a popular guide to American wildflowers.\n\n==Early life and education==\nFrances Theodora Smith was born in New York in 1861 to Denton Smith, a tea merchant, and Harriet Shelton Smith.<ref name=cassandra/> She had a sister, Alice Josephine (1859\u20131909), who became an artist and later illustrated two of her books. She was educated privately at Miss Comstock\u2019s School. She is said to have gained her love of botany during summers spent with her grandparents in rural New York state.<ref name=sierra/>\n\nHer first husband, William Starr Dana, whom she married in 1884, was a naval officer. He died in an 1890 flu epidemic, and six years later she married James Russell Parsons, a politician in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] and later a diplomat.<ref name=sierra/> They had a son, Russell and a daughter, Dorothea, who died as a toddler.<ref name=cassandra/> James himself died in 1902 in an automobile accident in Mexico City.<ref name=cassandra/>\n\nFollowing James's death, Parsons moved to New York City, where she was an active supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as well as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. She served in various official capacities on party committees, and she managed [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]]'s successful campaign to become president of New York's Board of Aldermen.<ref name=cassandra/> She was also an advocate of [[women's suffrage]].<ref name=sierra/>\n\n==Career==\nFollowing the loss of her first husband, Parsons' sought solace in long walks with her friend the illustrator [[Marion Satterlee]].<ref name=cassandra/> These outings prompted her first and most important botanical work, ''How to Know the Wild Flowers'' (1893), which was the first [[field guide]] to [[North America]]n [[wildflower]]s.<ref name=sierra/> It was something of a sensation, the first printing selling out in five days.<ref name=sierra/> ''How to Know the Wild Flowers'' garnered favorable responses from [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], among others.<ref name=sierra/> The work went through several editions in Parsons's lifetime and has remained in print into the 21st century.

She wrote a number of books, including a very popular guide to American wildflowers.\n\n==Early life and education==\nFrances Theodora Smith was born in New York in 1861 to Denton Smith, a tea merchant, and Harriet Shelton Smith.<ref name=cassandra/> She had a sister, Alice Josephine (1859\u20131909), who became an artist and later illustrated two of her books. She was educated privately at Miss Comstock\u2019s School. She is said to have gained her love of botany during summers spent with her grandparents in rural New York state.<ref name=sierra/>\n\nHer first husband, William Starr Dana, whom she married in 1884, was a naval officer. He died in an 1890 flu epidemic, and six years later she married James Russell Parsons, a politician in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]] and later a diplomat.<ref name=sierra/> They had a son, Russell and a daughter, Dorothea, who died as a toddler.<ref name=cassandra/> James himself died in 1902 in an automobile accident in Mexico City.<ref name=cassandra/>\n\nFollowing James's death, Parsons moved to New York City, where she was an active supporter of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as well as the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. She served in various official capacities on party committees, and she managed [[Fiorello H. La Guardia]]'s successful campaign to become president of New York's Board of Aldermen.<ref name=cassandra/> She was also an advocate of [[women's suffrage]].<ref name=sierra/>\n\n==Career==\nFollowing the loss of her first husband, Parsons' sought solace in long walks with her friend the illustrator [[Marion Satterlee]].<ref name=cassandra/> These outings prompted her first and most important botanical work, ''How to Know the Wild Flowers'' (1893), which was the first [[field guide]] to [[North America]]n [[wildflower]]s.<ref name=sierra/> It was something of a sensation, the first printing selling out in five days.<ref name=sierra/> ''How to Know the Wild Flowers'' garnered favorable responses from [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], among others.<ref name=sierra/> The work went through several editions in Parsons's lifetime and has remained in print into the 21st century. It was organized by flower colors and illustrated with 48 full-page color plates by [[Elsie Louise Shaw]] (missing from later editions) and 110 full-page black-and-white illustrations by Satterlee.\n\nParsons' second book, ''According to Season'' (1894), was a compendium of nature writing that she had previously published in ''The New York Tribune''.<ref name=cassandra/>\n\nHer third book, ''Plants and Their Children'' (1896), was intended for children and was listed as one of the 50 best children\u2019s books of its day.<ref name=cassandra/>\n\nIn 1899, Parsons published ''How to Know the Ferns'', a companion to her first guidebook.

They consist of 12 [[almshouse]]s and a [[refectory]], together with a {{lang|nl|[[hofje]]}} or courtyard garden, to be used by the city's [[Poverty|poor]]. After her death, the buildings were placed under the control of the Maria van Pallaes Foundation and another 28 almshouses were later built using her [[inheritance]]. The original 12 houses and refectory are now owned by the {{ill|Utrechts Monumentenfonds|lt=Utrecht Monument Foundation|nl||WD=}} and are a [[Rijksmonument|Dutch national heritage site]].\n\n== Early life ==\nVan Pallaes was born in 1587 in the Dutch city of [[Utrecht]]. She was the oldest child of Lubbert Jansz van Pallaes (died 1610) and Maria Johansdr van Reede (died 1649). She had two younger brothers: Lubbertus (died 1624) and Johan (died 1650). Both her parents came from [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician families]] and she was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=5}}<ref name=\"1001 bio\">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Pallaes, Maria van (1587-1664) |encyclopedia=1001 vrouwen uit de Nederlandse geschiedenis |publisher=Uitgeverij Vantilt |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/pallaes |accessdate=6 July 2019 |last=Volbeda |first=Marja |date=13 February 2013 |editor-last=Hell |editor-first=Maarten |publication-place=Nijmegen, Netherlands |at=Biography nr. 205 |language=nl-NL |isbn=9789460041419 |editor-last2=Huiskamp |editor-first2=Marloes |via=Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1606, at the age of 19, Van Pallaes married Hendrick van Schroyesteijn, a lawyer at the court of Utrecht, in the presence of the city's [[schepen|aldermen]]. He was also a Roman Catholic. Van Pallaes had more possessions and capital than Van Schroyesteijn at the time of their marriage. They bought a house along the [[Oudegracht]] but later moved to {{lang|nl|'t Groot Huijs}} on {{ill|Oudkerkhof|nl}} where Van Pallaes lived for the rest of her life.<ref name=FOOTNOTEAanstoot20155 /> The couple had six children: Johan, Lubbertus, Adriana, Margaretha, Livinius and Hendrick. In Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn's [[Will and testament|will]] of 1624, their oldest son, Johan, was not mentioned as an heir; he was presumably disinherited but it is not known why. From 1624 Johan was not mentioned in any other documents or wills by Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn.{{Sfn|Cornelis|1996|pp=153\u2013154}} The youngest child, Hendrick, had not yet been born in 1624 and is therefore not mentioned in the will.{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=6}}\n\nVan Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn remained Roman Catholics for the rest of their lives. As a result of the [[History of the Netherlands#The Reformation|Dutch Reformation]], practising their Catholic faith had been prohibited in Utrecht since 1580. Nevertheless, they continued their devotions, making use of [[clandestine church]]es; Van Pallaes' mother similarly practised Catholicism in Utrecht after the Reformation, despite having been raised as a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. Two of Van Pallaes' children had Catholic [[religious vocation]]s: Hendrick became a [[priest]] and Adriana became a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] in [[Antwerp]].{{sfn|Cornelis|1996|p=153}}\n\n== Later life ==\nVan Pallaes lost most of her loved ones in her later life. First, her son Livinius died when about 10 in 1624.{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|pp=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=2}} Six years later, her husband, Van Schroyesteijn, died in 1630. She also lost four other children: Margaretha, the only child to be married,<ref name=\"1001 bio\" /> died in 1645; Lubbertus in 1646, Hendrick before 1649, and Johan, the oldest child, in {{circa|1649}}.<ref name=FOOTNOTEAanstoot20152 /> As all Van Pallaes' children remained childless, there were no grandchildren.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" />{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=7}}\n\nVan Pallaes owned various houses in Utrecht as well as [[estate (land)|estate]]s and residences in the surroundings. In 1649, she sent a request to the government of Utrecht, asking for permission to freely decide over her inheritance.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" /> Her only remaining child, Adriana, was a member of a [[Mendicant orders|mendicant order]] and, as such, was not able to inherit. If Van Pallaes had not filed a request, her family fortune would have gone to the community of Utrecht. She decided to use her funds as [[Charity (practice)|charity]] for the city's needy inhabitants. It is likely that she did not just do so because she cared for the poor but because she believed she would be rewarded with a place in [[heaven]] after her death.{{sfn|Cornelis|1996|p=154}}\n\n=== Foundation of the first almshouses ===\n[[File:Agnietenstraat hoek Nieuwe Gracht naar het noord-westen - Utrecht - 20234995 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|The 12 almshouses founded by Van Pallaes. The corner house is the refectory.|alt=A black and white picture showing a row of houses, taken from the corner of the street]]\n\nIn 1651, Van Pallaes bought [[real estate|land]] from Utrecht's {{ill|Agnietenklooster (Utrecht)|lt=Agnietenmonastery|nl}} to establish a {{lang|nl|[[hofje]]}} or collection of buildings with an adjoining court on the street now known as the Agnietenstraat. She charged a [[general contractor]] (whose identity is not known) to build 12 almshouses and a [[refectory]] there.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTECornelis1996154\" /> Each house was designed to have two floors, with two rooms on each floor, except for one of them, which had a different layout. The houses were {{convert|4.5 x 7|m|ft}}, with a [[Community gardening|community garden]] to the rear. This garden had a few toilets attached to its walls in groups of two or three and connected to a [[cesspit]].{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe corner house served as a refectory and meeting place for the administrators of the foundation (who were appointed to that position by Van Pallaes in her will). Residents could only eat in the refectory if, for some reason, they were unable to eat in their own homes. Sometimes they  were invited to the refectory to meet the administrators. The refectory was rebuilt as an additional building in 1667, three years after Van Pallaes' death. As of 2019, the building still maintains the original locks.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTEAanstoot201510\u201311\" />\n\nAll residents of the houses were subject to various conditions. First of all, those receiving support from the [[Deacon|diaconate]] or similar sources were not eligible for residence. Second, residents were housed either with their spouse or with another individual of the same sex. If a spouse died, they were not allowed to [[Remarriage|remarry]] and were forced to leave. Third, residents who committed physical violence or had an \"unsuitable\" lifestyle were dismissed. Fourth, when residents died, their inheritance was transferred to the Maria van Pallaes Foundation, which paid for their [[funeral]]. Unusually for the times, Van Pallaes allowed both Catholics and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to live in the houses.{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=12}}\n\nEvery year, the residents received wheat, butter and cheese, partly grown by Van Pallaes' [[tenant farmer]]s, from the foundation. Van Pallaes was probably present herself on such occasions. After her death, the foundation's administrators handed out the food while sitting under a painting of Van Pallaes. In 1849, residents started receiving [[Dutch guilder|\u0192]]10, {{convert|70|kg|lb}} of [[potatoes]] and {{convert|100|L|impgal}} of [[coal]] every year instead of the wheat, butter and cheese.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" /> Towards the end of the 20th century, they stopped receiving money, as new [[social security]] programs rendered financial support unnecessary.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTEAanstoot201512\" />\n\n== Death ==\nAfter a long period of sickness, Van Pallaes died on 23 October 1664. An extensive and costly funeral ceremony was held following her death. The bells of [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|St. Martin's Cathedral]] were rung, as were those of St. Jan's Church, the [[Buurkerk]] and Saint Nicholas' Church.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTEAanstoot20157\" /> After the funeral, she was interred in her family grave at St. Martin's Cathedral. Ten years later, the grave was destroyed in a [[tornado]].{{sfn|Cornelis|1996|p=157}}\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nAfter Van Palleas' death, her property was inherited by the Maria van Pallaes Foundation, which was headed by the two directors she had appointed. From that point on, incumbent directors would select their successors themselves. Over the course of the foundation's existence, an additional 28 almshouses were constructed using Van Pallaes' inheritance. The foundation continued to operate until 1910, when the [[college van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] of Utrecht started managing the houses. In 1978, the municipality bought the houses, transferring ownership of the original 12 almshouses and the refectory to the [[Utrecht Monument Foundation]] two years later.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe foundation's original almshouses and refectory were granted ''[[rijksmonument]]'' status in 1967 which, as of March 2020, they still hold.<ref>{{Citation |title=36005 Agnietenstraat 8 3512 XB te Utrecht |url=https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/36005 |language=nl |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, a [[corbel]] was revealed honouring Van Palles.

They consist of 12 [[almshouse]]s and a [[refectory]], together with a {{lang|nl|[[hofje]]}} or courtyard garden, to be used by the city's [[Poverty|poor]]. After her death, the buildings were placed under the control of the Maria van Pallaes Foundation and another 28 almshouses were later built using her [[inheritance]]. The original 12 houses and refectory are now owned by the {{ill|Utrechts Monumentenfonds|lt=Utrecht Monument Foundation|nl||WD=}} and are a [[Rijksmonument|Dutch national heritage site]].\n\n== Early life ==\nVan Pallaes was born in 1587 in the Dutch city of [[Utrecht]]. She was the oldest child of Lubbert Jansz van Pallaes (died 1610) and Maria Johansdr van Reede (died 1649). She had two younger brothers: Lubbertus (died 1624) and Johan (died 1650). Both her parents came from [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician families]] and she was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=5}}<ref name=\"1001 bio\">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Pallaes, Maria van (1587-1664) |encyclopedia=1001 vrouwen uit de Nederlandse geschiedenis |publisher=Uitgeverij Vantilt |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/pallaes |accessdate=6 July 2019 |last=Volbeda |first=Marja |date=13 February 2013 |editor-last=Hell |editor-first=Maarten |publication-place=Nijmegen, Netherlands |at=Biography nr. 205 |language=nl-NL |isbn=9789460041419 |editor-last2=Huiskamp |editor-first2=Marloes |via=Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1606, at the age of 19, Van Pallaes married Hendrick van Schroyesteijn, a lawyer at the court of Utrecht, in the presence of the city's [[schepen|aldermen]]. He was also a Roman Catholic. Van Pallaes had more possessions and capital than Van Schroyesteijn at the time of their marriage. They bought a house along the [[Oudegracht]] but later moved to {{lang|nl|'t Groot Huijs}} on {{ill|Oudkerkhof|nl}} where Van Pallaes lived for the rest of her life.<ref name=FOOTNOTEAanstoot20155 /> The couple had six children: Johan, Lubbertus, Adriana, Margaretha, Livinius and Hendrick. In Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn's [[Will and testament|will]] of 1624, their oldest son, Johan, was not mentioned as an heir; he was presumably disinherited but it is not known why. From 1624 Johan was not mentioned in any other documents or wills by Van Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn.{{Sfn|Cornelis|1996|pp=153\u2013154}} The youngest child, Hendrick, had not yet been born in 1624 and is therefore not mentioned in the will.{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=6}}\n\nVan Pallaes and Van Schroyesteijn remained Roman Catholics for the rest of their lives. As a result of the [[History of the Netherlands#The Reformation|Dutch Reformation]], practising their Catholic faith had been prohibited in Utrecht since 1580. Nevertheless, they continued their devotions, making use of [[clandestine church]]es; Van Pallaes' mother similarly practised Catholicism in Utrecht after the Reformation, despite having been raised as a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]. Two of Van Pallaes' children had Catholic [[religious vocation]]s: Hendrick became a [[priest]] and Adriana became a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] in [[Antwerp]].{{sfn|Cornelis|1996|p=153}}\n\n== Later life ==\nVan Pallaes lost most of her loved ones in her later life. First, her son Livinius died when about 10 in 1624.{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|pp=6\u20137}}{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=2}} Six years later, her husband, Van Schroyesteijn, died in 1630. She also lost four other children: Margaretha, the only child to be married,<ref name=\"1001 bio\" /> died in 1645; Lubbertus in 1646, Hendrick before 1649, and Johan, the oldest child, in {{circa|1649}}.<ref name=FOOTNOTEAanstoot20152 /> As all Van Pallaes' children remained childless, there were no grandchildren.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" />{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=7}}\n\nVan Pallaes owned various houses in Utrecht as well as [[estate (land)|estate]]s and residences in the surroundings. In 1649, she sent a request to the government of Utrecht, asking for permission to freely decide over her inheritance.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" /> Her only remaining child, Adriana, was a member of a [[Mendicant orders|mendicant order]] and, as such, was not able to inherit. If Van Pallaes had not filed a request, her family fortune would have gone to the community of Utrecht. She decided to use her funds as [[Charity (practice)|charity]] for the city's needy inhabitants. It is likely that she did not just do so because she cared for the poor but because she believed she would be rewarded with a place in [[heaven]] after her death.{{sfn|Cornelis|1996|p=154}}\n\n=== Foundation of the first almshouses ===\n[[File:Agnietenstraat hoek Nieuwe Gracht naar het noord-westen - Utrecht - 20234995 - RCE.jpg|thumb|right|The 12 almshouses founded by Van Pallaes. The corner house is the refectory.|alt=A black and white picture showing a row of houses, taken from the corner of the street]]\n\nIn 1651, Van Pallaes bought [[real estate|land]] from Utrecht's {{ill|Agnietenklooster (Utrecht)|lt=Agnietenmonastery|nl}} to establish a {{lang|nl|[[hofje]]}} or collection of buildings with an adjoining court on the street now known as the Agnietenstraat. She charged a [[general contractor]] (whose identity is not known) to build 12 almshouses and a [[refectory]] there.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTECornelis1996154\" /> Each house was designed to have two floors, with two rooms on each floor, except for one of them, which had a different layout. The houses were {{convert|4.5 x 7|m|ft}}, with a [[Community gardening|community garden]] to the rear. This garden had a few toilets attached to its walls in groups of two or three and connected to a [[cesspit]].{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe corner house served as a refectory and meeting place for the administrators of the foundation (who were appointed to that position by Van Pallaes in her will). Residents could only eat in the refectory if, for some reason, they were unable to eat in their own homes. Sometimes they  were invited to the refectory to meet the administrators. The refectory was rebuilt as an additional building in 1667, three years after Van Pallaes' death. As of 2019, the building still maintains the original locks.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTEAanstoot201510\u201311\" />\n\nAll residents of the houses were subject to various conditions. First of all, those receiving support from the [[Deacon|diaconate]] or similar sources were not eligible for residence. Second, residents were housed either with their spouse or with another individual of the same sex. If a spouse died, they were not allowed to [[Remarriage|remarry]] and were forced to leave. Third, residents who committed physical violence or had an \"unsuitable\" lifestyle were dismissed. Fourth, when residents died, their inheritance was transferred to the Maria van Pallaes Foundation, which paid for their [[funeral]]. Unusually for the times, Van Pallaes allowed both Catholics and [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to live in the houses.{{sfn|Aanstoot|2015|p=12}}\n\nEvery year, the residents received wheat, butter and cheese, partly grown by Van Pallaes' [[tenant farmer]]s, from the foundation. Van Pallaes was probably present herself on such occasions. After her death, the foundation's administrators handed out the food while sitting under a painting of Van Pallaes. In 1849, residents started receiving [[Dutch guilder|\u0192]]10, {{convert|70|kg|lb}} of [[potatoes]] and {{convert|100|L|impgal}} of [[coal]] every year instead of the wheat, butter and cheese.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" /> Towards the end of the 20th century, they stopped receiving money, as new [[social security]] programs rendered financial support unnecessary.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTEAanstoot201512\" />\n\n== Death ==\nAfter a long period of sickness, Van Pallaes died on 23 October 1664. An extensive and costly funeral ceremony was held following her death. The bells of [[St. Martin's Cathedral, Utrecht|St. Martin's Cathedral]] were rung, as were those of St. Jan's Church, the [[Buurkerk]] and Saint Nicholas' Church.<ref name=\"FOOTNOTEAanstoot20157\" /> After the funeral, she was interred in her family grave at St. Martin's Cathedral. Ten years later, the grave was destroyed in a [[tornado]].{{sfn|Cornelis|1996|p=157}}\n\n=== Inheritance ===\nAfter Van Palleas' death, her property was inherited by the Maria van Pallaes Foundation, which was headed by the two directors she had appointed. From that point on, incumbent directors would select their successors themselves. Over the course of the foundation's existence, an additional 28 almshouses were constructed using Van Pallaes' inheritance. The foundation continued to operate until 1910, when the [[college van burgemeester en wethouders|municipal executive board]] of Utrecht started managing the houses. In 1978, the municipality bought the houses, transferring ownership of the original 12 almshouses and the refectory to the [[Utrecht Monument Foundation]] two years later.<ref name=\"1001 bio\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe foundation's original almshouses and refectory were granted ''[[rijksmonument]]'' status in 1967 which, as of March 2020, they still hold.<ref>{{Citation |title=36005 Agnietenstraat 8 3512 XB te Utrecht |url=https://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/36005 |language=nl |access-date=22 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, a [[corbel]] was revealed honouring Van Palles.
