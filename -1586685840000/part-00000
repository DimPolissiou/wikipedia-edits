[[Taxation]] and its [[legal tender]] enable power to discharge debt and establish the [[fiat money]] as currency, giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met. In addition, fines, fees and licenses create demand for the currency. This can be a currency issued by the domestic government, or a foreign currency.<ref>[[Warren Mosler|Mosler, Warren]].

Because the government can issue its own currency at will, MMT maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's [[deficit spending]] or [[budget surplus]]) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and [[unemployment]], and not a means of funding the government's activities by itself. The approach of MMT typically reverses theories of governmental [[austerity]].

New York: Federal\nReserve Bank of New York.</ref>\n\nWhen the government spends money, the treasury debits its operating account at the central bank, and deposits this money into private bank accounts (and hence into the commercial banking system). This money adds to the total deposits in the commercial bank sector. Taxation works exactly in reverse; private bank accounts are debited, and hence deposits in the commercial banking sector fall. In the United States, a portion of tax receipts are deposited in the treasury operating account, and a portion in commercial banks' designated [[Treasury Tax and Loan]] accounts.<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /><ref name=\"NYFed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed21.html|title=Treasury and Tax and Loan Program|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York|date=April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Government bonds and interest rate maintenance===\n[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|right|350px|The Federal Reserve raising the [[Federal Funds Rate]] above [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury]] interest rates creates an [[inverted yield curve]], which is a predictor of recessions.]]\nVirtually all central banks set an interest rate target, and conduct [[open market operations]] to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT, the issuing of government bonds is best understood as an operation to ''offset'' government spending rather than a requirement to ''finance'' it.<ref name=\"FullPrimer\" />\n\nIn most countries, commercial banks\u2019 reserve accounts with the central bank must have a positive balance at the end of every day; in some countries, the amount is specifically set as a proportion of the liabilities a bank has (i.e. its customer deposits). This is known as a [[reserve requirement]].\nAt the end of every day, a commercial bank will have to examine the status of their reserve accounts. Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a ''lending rate'' (sometimes known as a ''[[discount window|discount rate]]'') on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a ''support rate'' from the central bank. Some countries, such as [[Economy of Japan|Japan]], have a support rate of zero.<ref name=\"bis.org\">[http://www.bis.org/publ/work292.pdf?noframes=1 \"Unconventional monetary policies: an appraisal\"] by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat, Bank for International Settlements, November 2009</ref>\n\nBanks with more reserves than they need will be willing to lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the [[interbank lending market]]. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.<ref name=\"bis.org\"/>\n\nUnder an MMT framework where government spending injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw them from the banking system,<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /> government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves have been added to the banking system (see [[#Vertical transactions|vertical transactions]]). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.<ref name=\"Fullwiler2005\">Fullwiler, Scott T. (2005) \"Paying Interest on Reserve Balances: It\u2019s More Significant Than You Think\" (Working Paper No. 38), Wartburg College and the UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref>\n\nThe alternate case is where the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, there may be a system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that the correct amount of reserves is on hand in the banking system.<ref name=\"Bell2000\">Bell, Stephanie, (2000), \"Do Taxes and Bonds Finance Government Spending?\", Journal of Economic Issues, 34, issue 3, p. 603-620</ref>\n\nCentral banks manage this by buying and selling government bonds on the open market. On a day where there are excess reserves in the banking system, the central bank sells bonds and therefore removes reserves from the banking system, as private individuals pay for the bonds. On a day where there are not enough reserves in the system, the central bank buys government bonds from the private sector, and therefore adds reserves to the banking system.\n\nIt is important to note that the central bank buys bonds by simply creating money \u2014 it is not financed in any way.<ref name=\"Bell287\">Bell, Stephanie (1999), \"Functional Finance: What, Why, and How?\" (Working Paper No. 287), UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref> It is a net injection of reserves into the banking system.

In this case the only way the government can sustainably repay its foreign debt is to ensure that its currency is continually in high demand by foreigners over the period that it wishes to repay the debt \u2013 an exchange rate collapse would potentially multiply the debt many times over asymptotically, making it impossible to repay. In that case, the government can default, or attempt to shift to an export-led strategy or raise interest rates to attract foreign investment in the currency. Either one has a negative effect on the economy.<ref>[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11854 \"There is no financial crisis so deep that cannot be dealt with by public spending \u2013 still!\"] Bill Mitchell, 11 October 2010</ref>\n\n==Policy implications==\n{{Further|NAIBER}}\n\nEconomist [[Stephanie Kelton]] explained several policy claims made by MMT in March 2019:\n*Under MMT, [[fiscal policy]] (i.e., government taxing and spending decisions) is the primary means of achieving full employment, establishing the budget deficit at the level necessary to reach that goal. In mainstream economics, [[monetary policy]] (i.e., central bank adjustment of interest rates and its balance sheet) is the primary mechanism, assuming there is some interest rate low enough to achieve full employment. Kelton claims that cutting interest rates is ineffective in a slump, because businesses expecting weak profits and few customers will not invest at even very low interest rates.\n*Government interest expenses are proportional to interest rates, so raising rates is a form of stimulus (it increases the budget deficit and injects money into the private sector, other things equal), while cutting rates is a form of austerity.\n*Achieving full employment can be administered via a federally funded [[job guarantee]], which acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]]. When private sector jobs are plentiful, the government spending on guaranteed jobs is lower, and vice versa.\n*Under MMT, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., money creation to fund purchases) can increase bank reserves, which can lower interest rates. In mainstream economics, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., debt issuance and spending) can result in higher interest rates, crowding out economic activity.<ref name=\"Kelton1\"/><ref name=\"Kelton2\"/>\n\nEconomist [[John T. Harvey]] explained several of the premises of MMT and their policy implications in March 2019:\n*The private sector treats labor as a cost to be minimized, so it cannot be expected to achieve full employment without government creating jobs as well, such as through a job guarantee.\n*The public sector's deficit is the private sector's surplus and vice-versa, by accounting identity, a reason why private sector debt increased during the Clinton-era budget surpluses.\n*Idle resources (mainly labor) can be activated by money creation. Not acting to do so is immoral.\n*Demand can be insensitive to interest rate changes, so a key mainstream assumption, that lower interest rates lead to higher demand, is questionable.\n*When the economy is below full employment, there is a \"free lunch\" in creating money to fund government expenditure to achieve full employment. Unemployment is a burden; full employment is not.\n*Creating money alone does not cause inflation; spending it when the economy is at or above full employment can.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2019/03/05/mmt-sense-or-nonsense/#37c9928b5852 Forbes-John T.

A Critique of ''This Time Is Different'', by Reinhart and Rogoff,\"] Levy Economics Institute (June 2010), p. 15.</ref>\n\nIn this theory, sovereign government is not ''financially'' constrained in its ability to spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy anything that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a [[debt ceiling]] law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms, or public) could cause inflationary pressures.\n\nMMT economists advocate a government-funded [[job guarantee]] scheme to eliminate [[involuntary unemployment]]. Proponents argue that this can be consistent with [[price stability]] as it targets unemployment directly rather than attempting to increase private sector job creation indirectly through a much larger economic stimulus, and maintains a \"buffer stock\" of labor that can readily switch to the private sector when jobs become available. A job guarantee program could also be considered an [[automatic stabilizer]] to the economy, expanding when private sector activity cools down and shrinking in size when private sector activity heats up.<ref name=\"elrJobGuarantee\">L.

He argues that these insights are well captured by standard Keynesian stock-flow consistent [[IS-LM model]]s, and have been well understood by Keynesian economists for decades. He also criticizes MMT for \"assum[ing] away the problem of fiscal\u2013monetary conflict\"<ref name=\"palley2\"/> \u2014 that is, that the governmental body that creates the spending budget (e.g. Congress) may refuse to cooperate with the governmental body that controls the money supply (e.g. the [[Federal Reserve]]).

[[Taxation]] and its [[legal tender]] enable power to discharge debt and establish the [[fiat money]] as currency, giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met. In addition, fines, fees and licenses create demand for the currency. This can be a currency issued by the domestic government, or a foreign currency.<ref>[[Warren Mosler|Mosler, Warren]].

Because the government can issue its own currency at will, MMT maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's [[deficit spending]] or [[budget surplus]]) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and [[unemployment]], and not a means of funding the government's activities by itself. The approach of MMT typically reverses theories of governmental [[austerity]].

Fullwiler, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1723198 \"Modern Monetary Theory\u2014A Primer on the Operational Realities of the Monetary System,\"] Wartburg College; Bard College - The Levy Economics Institute (30 August 2010).</ref>\n\nA sovereign government typically has an operating account with the country's central bank. From this account, the government can spend and also receive taxes and other inflows.<ref name=def1013 /> Each commercial bank also has an account with the central bank, by means of which it manages its reserves (that is, money for clearing and settling interbank transactions).<ref name=\"Meulendyke\">Meulendyke, A.M. (1998) U.S. Monetary Policy and Financial Markets. New York: Federal\nReserve Bank of New York.</ref>\n\nWhen the government spends money, the treasury debits its operating account at the central bank, and deposits this money into private bank accounts (and hence into the commercial banking system). This money adds to the total deposits in the commercial bank sector. Taxation works exactly in reverse; private bank accounts are debited, and hence deposits in the commercial banking sector fall. In the United States, a portion of tax receipts are deposited in the treasury operating account, and a portion in commercial banks' designated [[Treasury Tax and Loan]] accounts.<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /><ref name=\"NYFed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/fedpoint/fed21.html|title=Treasury and Tax and Loan Program|accessdate=16 June 2016|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of New York|date=April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Government bonds and interest rate maintenance===\n[[File:U.S. Treasuries.png|thumb|right|350px|The Federal Reserve raising the [[Federal Funds Rate]] above [[United States Treasury security|U.S. Treasury]] interest rates creates an [[inverted yield curve]], which is a predictor of recessions.]]\nVirtually all central banks set an interest rate target, and conduct [[open market operations]] to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT, the issuing of government bonds is best understood as an operation to ''offset'' government spending rather than a requirement to ''finance'' it.<ref name=\"FullPrimer\" />\n\nIn most countries, commercial banks\u2019 reserve accounts with the central bank must have a positive balance at the end of every day; in some countries, the amount is specifically set as a proportion of the liabilities a bank has (i.e. its customer deposits). This is known as a [[reserve requirement]].\nAt the end of every day, a commercial bank will have to examine the status of their reserve accounts. Those that are in deficit have the option of borrowing the required funds from the central bank, where they may be charged a ''lending rate'' (sometimes known as a ''[[discount window|discount rate]]'') on the amount they borrow. On the other hand, the banks that have excess reserves can simply leave them with the central bank and earn a ''support rate'' from the central bank. Some countries, such as [[Economy of Japan|Japan]], have a support rate of zero.<ref name=\"bis.org\">[http://www.bis.org/publ/work292.pdf?noframes=1 \"Unconventional monetary policies: an appraisal\"] by Claudio Borio and Piti Disyatat, Bank for International Settlements, November 2009</ref>\n\nBanks with more reserves than they need will be willing to lend to banks with a reserve shortage on the [[interbank lending market]]. The surplus banks will want to earn a higher rate than the support rate that the central bank pays on reserves; whereas the deficit banks will want to pay a lower interest rate than the discount rate the central bank charges for borrowing. Thus they will lend to each other until each bank has reached their reserve requirement. In a balanced system, where there are just enough total reserves for all the banks to meet requirements, the short-term interbank lending rate will be in between the support rate and the discount rate.<ref name=\"bis.org\"/>\n\nUnder an MMT framework where government spending injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw them from the banking system,<ref name=\"Bell2000\" /> government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government spends more than it taxes, reserves have been added to the banking system (see [[#Vertical transactions|vertical transactions]]). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.<ref name=\"Fullwiler2005\">Fullwiler, Scott T. (2005) \"Paying Interest on Reserve Balances: It\u2019s More Significant Than You Think\" (Working Paper No. 38), Wartburg College and the UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref>\n\nThe alternate case is where the government receives more taxes on a particular day than it spends. In this case, there may be a system-wide deficit of reserves. As a result, surplus funds will be in demand on the interbank market, and thus the short-term interest rate will rise towards the discount rate. Thus, if the central bank wants to maintain a target interest rate somewhere between the support rate and the discount rate, it must manage the liquidity in the system to ensure that the correct amount of reserves is on hand in the banking system.<ref name=\"Bell2000\">Bell, Stephanie, (2000), \"Do Taxes and Bonds Finance Government Spending?\", Journal of Economic Issues, 34, issue 3, p. 603-620</ref>\n\nCentral banks manage this by buying and selling government bonds on the open market. On a day where there are excess reserves in the banking system, the central bank sells bonds and therefore removes reserves from the banking system, as private individuals pay for the bonds. On a day where there are not enough reserves in the system, the central bank buys government bonds from the private sector, and therefore adds reserves to the banking system.\n\nIt is important to note that the central bank buys bonds by simply creating money \u2014 it is not financed in any way.<ref name=\"Bell287\">Bell, Stephanie (1999), \"Functional Finance: What, Why, and How?\" (Working Paper No. 287), UMKC Center for Full Employment and Price Stability</ref> It is a net injection of reserves into the banking system.

In this case the only way the government can sustainably repay its foreign debt is to ensure that its currency is continually in high demand by foreigners over the period that it wishes to repay the debt \u2013 an exchange rate collapse would potentially multiply the debt many times over asymptotically, making it impossible to repay. In that case, the government can default, or attempt to shift to an export-led strategy or raise interest rates to attract foreign investment in the currency. Either one has a negative effect on the economy.<ref>[http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11854 \"There is no financial crisis so deep that cannot be dealt with by public spending \u2013 still!\"] Bill Mitchell, 11 October 2010</ref>\n\n==Policy implications==\n{{Further|NAIBER}}\n\nEconomist [[Stephanie Kelton]] explained several policy claims made by MMT in March 2019:\n*Under MMT, [[fiscal policy]] (i.e., government taxing and spending decisions) is the primary means of achieving full employment, establishing the budget deficit at the level necessary to reach that goal. In mainstream economics, [[monetary policy]] (i.e., central bank adjustment of interest rates and its balance sheet) is the primary mechanism, assuming there is some interest rate low enough to achieve full employment. Kelton claims that cutting interest rates is ineffective in a slump, because businesses expecting weak profits and few customers will not invest at even very low interest rates.\n*Government interest expenses are proportional to interest rates, so raising rates is a form of stimulus (it increases the budget deficit and injects money into the private sector, other things equal), while cutting rates is a form of austerity.\n*Achieving full employment can be administered via a federally funded [[job guarantee]], which acts as an [[automatic stabilizer]]. When private sector jobs are plentiful, the government spending on guaranteed jobs is lower, and vice versa.\n*Under MMT, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., money creation to fund purchases) can increase bank reserves, which can lower interest rates. In mainstream economics, expansionary fiscal policy (i.e., debt issuance and spending) can result in higher interest rates, crowding out economic activity.<ref name=\"Kelton1\"/><ref name=\"Kelton2\"/>\n\nEconomist [[John T. Harvey]] explained several of the premises of MMT and their policy implications in March 2019:\n*The private sector treats labor as a cost to be minimized, so it cannot be expected to achieve full employment without government creating jobs as well, such as through a job guarantee.\n*The public sector's deficit is the private sector's surplus and vice-versa, by accounting identity, a reason why private sector debt increased during the Clinton-era budget surpluses.\n*Idle resources (mainly labor) can be activated by money creation. Not acting to do so is immoral.\n*Demand can be insensitive to interest rate changes, so a key mainstream assumption, that lower interest rates lead to higher demand, is questionable.\n*When the economy is below full employment, there is a \"free lunch\" in creating money to fund government expenditure to achieve full employment. Unemployment is a burden; full employment is not.\n*Creating money alone does not cause inflation; spending it when the economy is at or above full employment can.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2019/03/05/mmt-sense-or-nonsense/#37c9928b5852 Forbes-John T.

A Critique of ''This Time Is Different'', by Reinhart and Rogoff,\"] Levy Economics Institute (June 2010), p. 15.</ref>\n\nIn this theory, sovereign government is not ''financially'' constrained in its ability to spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy anything that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a [[debt ceiling]] law). The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy (whether households, firms, or public) could cause inflationary pressures.\n\nMMT economists advocate a government-funded [[job guarantee]] scheme to eliminate [[involuntary unemployment]]. Proponents argue that this can be consistent with [[price stability]] as it targets unemployment directly rather than attempting to increase private sector job creation indirectly through a much larger economic stimulus, and maintains a \"buffer stock\" of labor that can readily switch to the private sector when jobs become available. A job guarantee program could also be considered an [[automatic stabilizer]] to the economy, expanding when private sector activity cools down and shrinking in size when private sector activity heats up.<ref name=\"elrJobGuarantee\">L.

He argues that these insights are well captured by standard Keynesian stock-flow consistent [[IS-LM model]]s, and have been well understood by Keynesian economists for decades. He also criticizes MMT for \"assum[ing] away the problem of fiscal\u2013monetary conflict\"<ref name=\"palley2\"/> \u2014 that is, that the governmental body that creates the spending budget (e.g. Congress) may refuse to cooperate with the governmental body that controls the money supply (e.g. the [[Federal Reserve]]). In Palley's view the policies proposed by MMT proponents would cause serious financial instability in an open economy with [[Floating exchange rate|flexible exchange rates]], while using [[Fixed exchange-rate system|fixed exchange rates]] would restore hard financial constraints on the government and \"undermines MMT\u2019s main claim about sovereign money freeing governments from standard market disciplines and financial constraints\". He also argues that MMT lacks a plausible [[Monetary inflation|theory of inflation]], particularly in the context of full employment in the [[employer of last resort]] policy first proposed by [[Hyman Minsky]] and advocated by [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]] and other MMT theorists; of a lack of appreciation of the financial instability that could be caused by permanently zero interest rates; and of overstating the importance of government created money.

Despite this, the Bermuda Government was historically responsible for maintaining Militia for the defence of the Colony.\n\n==History==\n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain [[John Smith of Jamestown|John Smith's]] 1624 map of [[Bermuda]], showing contemporary fortifications.]]\nThe defence of the colony against an expected Spanish attack was the first concern of the first [[Governor of Bermuda]], Richard Moore, when he and fifty-one other settlers arrived at Bermuda aboard the Plough on the 11 July 1612, to join the three men left behind in Bermuda from the 1609 wreck of the [[Sea Venture]]. The construction of fortified [[coastal artillery]] batteries was consequently prioritised over other construction, with the artillery manned by volunteers (convicted criminals were also sometimes sentenced to serve in the batteries instead of imprisonment). A militia was also raised on the lines of the militia in England, which grew to a battalion composed of nine companies (one for each parish). All fit males between the ages of 16 and 60, whether free, indentured, or enslaved, were liable for militia service.\n\nBermuda tended toward the Royalist side during the [[English Civil War]], being the first of six colonies to recognise [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King on the execution of his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in 1649, and was one of those targeted by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]], which was passed on the 30 October 1650. With control of the \"army\" (the militia), the colony's Royalists deposed the Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, elected John Trimingham to replace him, and exiled many of its Parliamentary-leaning [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] to settle the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Bermuda's defences (coastal artillery batteries and forts, as well as its militia) were too powerful for the task force sent in 1651 by Parliament under the command of Admiral Sir [[George Ayscue]] to capture the Royalist colonies. The Parliamentary Navy was consequently forced to blockade Bermuda for several months 'til the Bermudians negotiated a peace.\n\nBermuda became the primary [[Royal Navy]] headquarters and dockyard in the [[Western Atlantic]], following American independence, there was a parallel build-up of military defences to protect the naval base. Seeing the militia as having become superfluous, with the large number of regular soldiers then present, the Colonial Government allowed it to lapse after the [[War of 1812]], however, it did raise volunteer units at the end of the century to form a reserve for the [[Bermuda Garrison|military garrison]].\n\nFollowing the loss of Britain's ports in thirteen of its former continental colonies after the [[American War of Independence]], Bermuda assumed a new strategic prominence for the Royal Navy. When [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], a centrally located port founded in 1790, became the seat of government in 1815, it was partly resultant from the Royal Navy having invested twelve years, following American independence, in charting Bermuda's reefs. It did this in order to locate the deepwater channel by which shipping might reach the islands in, and at the West of, the Great Sound, which it had begun acquiring with a view to building a [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|naval base]]. However, that channel also gave access to Hamilton Harbour. The Royal Navy had originally invested in property around St. George's, but slowly moved all of its operations to the West End once the channel had been charted. In addition to serving as a naval base and coaling station for its North America & West Indies Squadron, the Royal Navy developed Bermuda as its only dockyard between the Canadian Maritimes and the West Indies where major repairs to large vessels could be made. It was initially the winter headquarters of the Admiralty based in the Maritimes, but became the year-round headquarters during the course of the century. The blockade of the southern US Atlantic Seaboard, as well as the [[Burning of Washington]], carried out during the War of 1812, was orchestrated from the Admiralty House in Bermuda, then located at Mount Wyndham, in Bailey's Bay, [http://www.rootsweb.com/~bmuwgw/mtwyndham.html] just prior to the ill-fated British assaults on Plattsburg, Baltimore and New Orleans.\n\n[[File:Bermuda Regiment Corporal.jpg|thumb|left|A Bermuda Regiment Corporal]]\nPrior to the American War of Independence, the only Regular Army unit in Bermuda was an Independent Company, based in St. George's. With the buildup of the Royal Naval establishment in the first decades of the nineteenth century, a large number of military fortifications and batteries were constructed, and the numbers of regular infantry, artillery, and support units that composed the [[British Army]] garrison were steadily increased. The investment into military infrastructure by the War Office proved unsustainable, and poorly thought-out, with far too few artillery men available to man the hundreds of guns emplaced. Rapid technological advance in artillery rendered many of the forts obsolete before they were completed, and several were abandoned, or removed from use, soon after construction. Following the [[Crimean War]], the trend was towards reducing military garrisons in colonies like Bermuda, partly for economic reasons, and partly as it became recognised that the Royal Navy's own ships could provide a better defence for the Dockyard, and Bermuda. Still, the important strategic location of Bermuda meant that the withdrawal, which began, at least in intent, in the 1870s, was carried out very slowly over several decades, continuing until after the [[Great War]]. The last Regular Army units were not withdrawn until the Dockyard itself closed in the 1950s. In the 1860s, however, the major build-up of naval and military infrastructure brought vital money into Bermuda at a time when its traditional (cedar- and sail cloth-based) maritime industries were giving way under the assault of steel hulls and steam propulsion. The American Civil War, also, briefly, provided a shot-in-the-arm to the local economy. Tourism and agricultural industries would develop in the latter half of the nineteenth century, however, it was defence infrastructure that formed the central platform of the economy into the twentieth century.\n\n[[File:St. David's Battery (or the Examination Battery), St. David's, Bermuda in 2011.jpg|thumb|The defunct ''St. David's Battery'' (also known as the \"[[Examination battery|Examination Battery]]\"), on St. David's Island, in 2011]]\nThe Colony's prominence as a naval station was underlined during both world wars thanks of its location in the North Atlantic Ocean, its naturally-protected waters, and the presence of the Royal Naval Dockyard and its military defences. With the US, the primary threat to Bermuda in the nineteenth century, becoming an ally in both wars, US forces began to make use of Bermuda also.\n[[File:US Army camp at Turtle Hill Bermuda in WWII.jpg|thumb|US Army battery at Turtle Hill, within Warwick Camp, Bermuda in WWII]]\nThe US had operated a [[United States Navy|US Naval]] station on the island during the latter stages of the [[World War I]] to serve anti-submarine vessels crossing to the European war zone, and [[United States Navy|US Navy]] vessels had also used the island, which was a hub for [[Battle of the Atlantic|trans-Atlantic convoys]]. This involvement of the allied US forces in Bermuda was built upon in the [[Second World War]]. Before the USA had entered that conflict, the British Government had granted it a free, 99-year base lease in Bermuda, along with a similar grant in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] for what became the [[Ernest Harmon Air Force Base]]. These grants were an extension of the [[Lend-Lease]] agreement, but not actually part of it, and no loan of ships or other war material was received in return (although the agreement for the airfield to be constructed in Bermuda was that it be shared with the [[Royal Air Force]]). The US Army and the US Navy both began construction of air stations (an [[airfield]] and a [[flying boat]] station, respectively) in 1941, along with coast artillery batteries, and the USA operated these bases until the end of the Cold War. The bases consisted of 5.8&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2.25&nbsp;mi\u00b2) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. From 1941 through 1945 the [[Bermuda Base Command]] coordinated the US Army's [[USAAF|air]], anti-aircraft, and [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|coast artillery]] assets in Bermuda.<ref name=USBerm1>[http://www.bermuda-online.org/milquit.htm Bermuda Online: American military bases in Bermuda 1941 to 1995.]</ref>\n\nThe US bases were not the only, or even the first, air stations operating in Bermuda, however. The civil airport, a flying boat station on Darrell's Island, was taken over by the RAF at the start of the war, and used by two commands. The government airline, [[Imperial Airways]]/[[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]], which had operated Darrell's Island before the war, adopted its war time role, and its camouflaged flying boats maintained trans-Atlantic service through Bermuda throughout the war. US Navy aircraft also briefly operated from Darrell's Island, maintaining anti-submarine air parols, before their own base was operational. Before the US entry into the war, anti-submarine air patrols were flown on an ad-hoc basis by the [[Supermarine Walrus|Walrus]] flying boats of the Royal Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm]], operating from its own base on Boaz Island.\n[[File:WD Ordnance Survey Marker Bermuda.JPG|thumb|[[War Department (UK)|War Department]] [[Ordnance Survey]] Marker, Bermuda.]]\n\nWith the buildup of the US bases on the island, the enduring alliance post-war, under [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation|NATO]], Britain's re-assessment of its global military role and responsibilities in light of subsequent break up of the [[British Empire]], and its near bankruptcy from the cost of the war, the value placed on the Imperial bases in Bermuda rapidly diminished on the end of the conflict. However, the air bases remained in operation long after the war. Also, from 1954 to 1995 the US Navy operated an submarine-detecting [[SOSUS]] station designated [[Naval Facility Bermuda]] in a former Army coast artillery bunker at Tudor Hill.<ref name=USBerm1/>\n\nThe Royal Naval dockyard and the attendant military garrison were closed during the 1950s. A small supply base, [[HMS Malabar (shore establishment)|HMS ''Malabar'']], continued to operate within the Dockyard until it, too, was closed, along with the American and Canadian bases, in 1995. The US bases closed on 1 September of that year, but unresolved issues\u2014primarily related to environmental factors\u2014delayed the formal return of the base lands to the Government of Bermuda, which finally occurred in 2002.\nThe only military units remaining in Bermuda, today, are the [[Bermuda Regiment]], an amalgam of the voluntary units formed in the 19th century, and army and naval cadet corps.\n\n==Naval and Military branches==\n*The [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]]\n*[[Bermuda Police Service]]\n*[[Bermuda Reserve Police]]\n*[[Airport Security Police (Bermuda)|Airport Security Police]]\n*[[Bermuda Cadet Corps]]\n*[[Bermuda Sea Cadet Corps]]\n\n==Defunct or amalgamated==\n*[[Bermuda Militia Artillery]]\n*[[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]]\n*[[Bermuda Volunteer Engineers]]\n*[[Bermuda Militia Infantry]]\n*[[Bermuda Home Guard]]\n\n'''Military expenditures 2005/06 (Revised) \u2013 dollar figure:''' $5,687,000 (Defence), $50,467,000 (Police).\n\n'''Military expenditures \u2013 per cent of GDP:''' 0.11 NA% (Not including Police).\n\n'''Military \u2013 note:''' defence of [[Bermuda]] is the responsibility of the [[United Kingdom]]\n\n'''Adapted from the [[CIA World Factbook]] 2000.'''\n\n'''See also [http://www.gov.bm/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_5438_234_1036_43/http%3B/portalcontent.gov.bm%3B7087/publishedcontent/publish/gov__top_level__org__house_/government/gov___budget_statement/gadget_1.pdf Government of Bermuda Budget Statement 2006/07 (pdf file).]'''\n\n== Historical naval and military bases and establishments of Bermuda ==\n*[[Privateer#Bermudians|Bermudian Privateering]]\n*[[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard Bermuda, and the Royal Navy in Bermuda]] 1795\u20131995.\n*[[RNAS Boaz Island (HMS Malabar)|Royal Navy (Fleet Air Arm), Royal Naval Air Station Boaz Island (HMS Malabar)]] 1939\u20131943.\n*[[Corps of Colonial Marines#Second Corps|Corps of Colonial Marines.]] 1814\u20131816.\n*[[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]\n*[[Bermuda Garrison|British Army, Bermuda Garrison]]. 1701\u20131957.\n*[[Bermuda Militias 1612-1815|Bermuda Militia.]] 1612\u20131815.\n*[[St. George's Garrison, Bermuda|St. George's Garrison]]\n*[[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]]\n*[[Warwick Camp (Bermuda)|Warwick Camp]]\n*[[Boaz Island and Watford Island (British Army base)]]\n*[[Ordnance Island]]\n*[[Agar's Island, Bermuda|Agar's Island]]\n*[[Bermuda Volunteer/Territorial Army Units 1895-1965|Locally raised Volunteer and Territorial Army Units.]] 1895\u20131965.\n*[[Royal Air Force, Bermuda, 1939-1945|Royal Air Force, RAF Darrell's Island.]] 1939\u20131945.\n*[[Kindley Air Force Base|Royal Air Force, Kindley Field.]] 1943\u20131945\n*[[CFS Bermuda#NRS Bermuda|Royal Canadian Navy, HMCS Somers Isles.]] 1944\u20131945.\n*[[CFS Bermuda#NRS Bermuda|Royal Canadian Navy, Naval Radio Station Bermuda.]] 1944\u20131968.\n*[[CFS Bermuda|Canadian Forces Station Bermuda, Daniel's Head.]] 1968\u20131993.\n\n== Former US Bases In Bermuda ==\n\n*[[United States Naval Station White's Island, Bermuda|United States Naval Station, Base 24, on White's Island, Bermuda]].

Standing {{convert|6|ft|m}} and weighing {{convert|215|lb|kg}}, Bradley was a [[switch hitter]] who threw right-handed. During an 11-year career in [[Major League Baseball]], Bradley played with the [[Montreal Expos]] (2000\u201301), [[Cleveland Indians]] (2001\u201303), [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (2004\u201305), [[Oakland Athletics]] (2006\u201307), [[San Diego Padres]] (2007), [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] (2008), [[Chicago Cubs]] (2009), and [[Seattle Mariners]] (2010\u201311). His career was also marred by legal troubles and several notable on-field incidents.\n\nBorn in [[Harbor City, California]], Bradley attended [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] before he was drafted by the Expos in the [[1996 Major League Baseball draft]]. After playing four seasons of [[minor league baseball]] for the organization, he made his major league debut on July 19, 2000. In 2001, Bradley was traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for pitching [[prospect (sports)|prospect]] [[Zach Day]]; he was again traded in 2004 to the Los Angeles Dodgers. After playing in 216 games for the Dodgers, the most among all teams he has played for, Bradley was traded to the Oakland Athletics for [[Andre Ethier]]. Bradley was traded to the Padres in 2007, was granted [[free agent|free agency]] after one season with the team, and signed with the Texas Rangers in 2007. He was voted to the 2008 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] with the Rangers, and led the American League with a .436 [[on-base percentage]] and a .999 [[on-base plus slugging]] percentage. For the year, Bradley finished 17th in American League [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] voting.\n\nAfter becoming a free agent, Bradley signed with the Chicago Cubs in January 2009, who traded him in December of that year to the Seattle Mariners.

Cheaper versions were then produced, including laminated chipboard, high-pressure laminates and steel boards with a matte-finished or glossy white, usually polyester or acrylic, coating. Enameled whiteboards, also referred to as porcelain, and sometimes glass boards, have the advantage that markings can be erased completely; other materials tend to become stained over time. Enameled boards are more expensive and less used in commercial environments, but in more demanding environments with heavier use, such as educational establishments, porcelain boards are considered superior.\n\nOther types of dry marker boards are also available, such as high gloss vinyl and [[coated paper]], which can be rolled up, high-density two-part high gloss paints, glass and coated acrylics and polypropylene magic whiteboards which use static electricity to cling to walls, windows, and doors.\n\nClear marker surfaces, made of glass (matte or glossy) or specially coated acrylic, became available around the [[2000s (decade)|mid-2000s]]. They are generally manufactured from technical glass, e.g. for monitor screen filters, which is optically coated.\n\n=== Adhesive whiteboards ===\nWhiteboard material can be bought in rolls, sheets, and pre-formed boards. Adhesive whiteboards come in either a sheet or a roll and feature a stick back enabling the user to create a custom size board or project with the material. Although adhesive whiteboard material does not come in a thick, hard glass or painted steel plate, the melamine allows for a flexible material while preserving the high-quality whiteboard attributes of other surface materials.<ref name=\":0\" /> Adhesive whiteboards allow for custom projects such as dry erase wall calendars, whiteboard tables, cupboard grocery lists, indoor games for kids, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.discountmagnet.com/informationcenter/resources/5-ways-to-use-whiteboards|title=5 Creative Ways to Use Dry Erase & Adhesive Whiteboards|website=www.discountmagnet.com|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Erasable marker ===\nThe whiteboard pen (also called a [[whiteboard marker]] or dry erasable marker) was invented by Jerry Woolf of Techform Laboratories and later patented by [[Pilot Pen]] in 1975. <ref>{{cite patent|title=Writing surface and ink composition for marking thereon|date=Feb 16, 1971|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US3563782|inventor-last=D|inventor2-last=U|inventor3-last=A|inventor-first=Atchley Raymond|inventor2-first=Liberman Isaiah|inventor3-first=Woolf Jerome|issue=US3563782 A|accessdate=2017-08-14}}</ref>It is a non-permanent marker and uses an erasable ink that adheres to the writing surface without binding to or being absorbed by it. Applications range from temporary writing with acetate sheets (for use with overhead projectors) to whiteboards and similar glossy surfaces. The erasable ink does not contain the toxic chemical compounds xylene and/or toluene, unlike permanent markers.\n\n== Surface materials ==\nThere are six types of materials commonly used for whiteboard surfaces:\n\n; [[Melamine resin|Melamine]]: A [[resin]]-infused paper which is typically used over a substrate that can range from particle board to MDF (medium density fiberboard).  Melamine boards range in quality primarily because of the amount of resin deposited on the base material.  Some melamine boards remain clean (no ghosting) for a long time, others less so.  Generally, this least expensive type of whiteboard is most commonly found in use in non-institutional applications.  They are available in any [[office supply]] stores. Performance varies widely. These boards are not suitable for heavy use, as in many educational cases, with time the paint erodes and the original surface reappears.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=How It works|url=https://www.remarkablecoating.com/how-it-works/|website=Remarkable Coating|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>\n;  [[steel]] or [[aluminum]]: Painted steel and aluminum dry erase also have a wide range of quality.  Painted surfaces tend to be smoother, which leads to better methods of erasing.  The painted surface is generally a multiple layer of coatings made up of a base coat in color (most commonly white) and a clear performance coating that is the dry erase component.  Paint varies from electron beam cured coatings to UV and other coating systems.  Good commercial grade painted steel or aluminum has excellent dry erase properties and many will be able to have permanent marker cleaned from the surface.  Any coated surface is susceptible to scratching.  Painted steel surfaces are magnetic and allow the use of magnets. Painted aluminum surfaces are rarely used as a base for whiteboards as they are not magnetic and are more expensive than steel.  Painted steel whiteboards are most commonly used for custom printed whiteboards.  These products are used as tracking boards, patient information boards and tournament and training boards.\n; Hardcoat laminate: Here again the performance varies over a wide range depending on the amount of resin used in the manufacturer.  Basically, this category primarily uses melamine as its dry erase performance coat and therefore falls into the melamine universe.  Depending on the manufacturer (and the price) these laminate often are less porous and highly resistant to staining. Less common than other whiteboard surfaces, because they usually are used in combination with something else (a cabinet, doors or table tops for example). (This statement applies to Porcelain steel which is the only lifetime warranty available on the market)\n; [[Porcelain]], [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]-on-[[steel]]: [[Ceramic]] fired onto a steel surface in a kiln.  They are the most durable surfaces, and most carry a lifetime [[warranty]].  They are very common in heavy-use industrial settings. They are highly scratch-resistant, although materials harder than glass, such as [[diamond]], can scratch them. They do not absorb dry erase or permanent marker ink.  They allow the use of [[magnets]].  The surface can be cleaned with any non-abrasive cleaner suitable for porcelain, then rinsed off with water to prevent smearing.  Permanent marker can be removed using a polar solvent such as ethanol, isopropanol or acetone, or by writing over it with a dry-erase marker and erasing it.\n; Tempered glass:[[Tempered glass]] is easier to erase.  Most tempered glass white boards have no frame.\n; [[Polypropylene]] film: Polypropylene film is temporary and uses [[static electricity]] to cling to existing surfaces. It works with dry whiteboard markers and wipes. Whiteboards are reusable and materials are recyclable.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Grease pencil]]\n*[[Flip chart]]\n*[[Album (Ancient Rome)]], a board chalked or painted white, on which public notices were inscribed in black\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Whiteboards}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Office equipment]]\n[[Category:Writing media]]\n[[Category:Educational devices]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|physical whiteboards|software-based wipeboards|Wipeboarding}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n[[File:Blank whiteboard.JPG|thumb|A blank whiteboard]]\n[[File:NCTR Intern Claire Boyle (15558843862).jpg|thumb|Researcher writing on a whiteboard]]\n\nA '''whiteboard''' (also known by the terms '''marker board''', '''dry-erase board''', '''wipe board''', '''dry-wipe board''', and '''pen-board''') is a glossy, usually white surface for making nonpermanent markings (an evolved version of the blackboard).

Jerry does odd jobs for a living as he is an undergraduate but Nick has a white-collar job. However, both find themselves jobless due to the economic downturn. Jerry has a school-age nephew named Veer (Master Virej Desai) whom he looks after, as the child has lost his parents. Nick intends to marry his girlfriend, Radhika Awasthi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), who dreams of a lovely wedding, a great honeymoon and a wonderful house to live in after marriage.\n\nOut of a job, Jerry finds it difficult to even pay the school fees of his nephew because of which the government is on the verge of giving the custody of his nephew to a foster family. Nick fears he won't be able to fulfill the dreams of his to-be wife. It is to tide over the difficult times that Jerry and Nick turn to the oldest profession in the world. Jerry and Nick become male escorts for the company \"Desi Boyz\", fulfilling the fantasies of girls and ladies. Nonetheless, Jerry is unable to prevent his nephew from being sent to a foster home; and Nick loses Radhika when she learns of what he has been up to while she is away in India. Frustrated, Nick blames Jerry for forcing him into the profession and asks him to move out of his house and life.\n\nNick now tries to win Radhika back and help comes from the most unlikely source \u2013 Radhika's father Suresh ([[Anupam Kher]]) who has come to London with her. Meanwhile, Jerry registers in college again to complete his graduation so that he can earn enough money to get his nephew back home. In college, Jerry meets Tanya Sharma ([[Chitrangada Singh]]) who used to be his classmate and is now a professor at the same college. Sparks fly between Jerry and Tanya. To make Nick jealous, Radhika dates a man named Ajay ([[Omi Vaidya]]). Nick starts to pick on Ajay, often calling him Vijay intentionally. After some reconsideration, Radhika forgives Nick, but Nick rejects her after she disapproves of Jerry. Meanwhile, Jerry graduates college and also wins Tanya's heart. Nick comes and apologizes to Jerry. All is forgiven when Nick and Jerry reconcile. Jerry then helps Radhika win back Nick.\n\nNick then helps Jerry get a high paying job, and Jerry decides to go to court and get back the custody of his nephew. Ajay turns out to be the lawyer against Jerry's case. He decides to get revenge on Nick by not letting Jerry win his case. Ajay tells the court about Jerry being a male escort and what a bad role model he would be to his nephew, bringing in 3 witnesses to testify against Jerry. He asks each of them if they had paid Jerry for sex, but only one says yes. Ajay is on the verge of winning, but Mr. Desi Boyz comes into the courtroom and influences the judge. Then, Jerry makes an inspiring speech to the judge. He ends up winning the case and gaining full custody of Veer. The economy improves and everyone is happy in the end. In a short ending scene, a newspaper article is shown, that states the recession will strike back, then Mr. Desi Boyz gives a call and says that he has gotten the license for a branch in Mumbai.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Jignesh 'Jerry' Patel (Rocco)\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] as Nikhil 'Nick' Mathur (Hunter)\n* [[Sanjay Dutt]] as Mr. Khalnayak\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Radhika Awasthi\n* [[Chitrangada Singh]] as Tanya Sharma\n* [[Master Virej Desai]] as Veer Patel\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Suresh Awasthi, Radhika's father\n* [[Omi Vaidya]] as Ajay Bapat\n* [[Mohnish Bahl]] as Social Worker\n* [[Shraman Jain]] as Rohan, Jerry's Friend\n* [[Bharati Achrekar]] as Jerry's mother\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Mr. Dhillon\n* [[Ashwin Mushran]] as Defence Lawyer\n* [[Bruna Abdullah]] in a Special Appearance in song \"Subha Hone Na De\"\n* [[Larissa Bonesi]] in a Special Appearance in song \"Subha Hone Na De\"\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Desi Boyz'' was reported to be inspired by the aftermath of thousands of Indian students being duped by various universities in the West such as Tri Valley University, Herguan University, London Metropolitan University and University of Navarra.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuteja|first=Joginder|title=\"'Desi Boyz' is a 'Dramady' with a lot of 'Soul'\" - Akshay|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/74018.html|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yount|first=Stacey|title=More on Desi Boyz|url=http://bollyspice.com/31795/more-on-desi-boyz|accessdate=17 November 2011|date=6 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Varma|first=Lipika|title=I have got all that I wanted, says Akshay Kumar|url=http://www.emirates247.com/bollywood/take-one/i-have-got-all-that-i-wanted-says-akshay-kumar-2011-11-17-1.428712|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plagiarism==\nThe basic plot and even some of the scenes of the movie have been lifted from various [[Adam Sandler]] movies like ''[[Reign Over Me]]'', ''[[Billy Madison]]'' and ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/11031-movie-review-karan-a-on-why-desi-boyz-is-the-best-of-the-worst-but-still-only-gets-2-stars.html|title=Movie Review: Karan A on Why Desi Boyz Is the Best of the Worst But Still Only Gets 2 Stars|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Desi Boyz'' started filming on 7 November 2010,<ref>{{cite web|title=Desi Boyz Starring Deepika Padukone, Akshay Kumar Begins Production|url=http://www.sawfnews.com/Bollywood/65670.aspx|accessdate=15 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110123500/http://www.sawfnews.com/Bollywood/65670.aspx|archive-date=10 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and completed shooting in May 2011.

Jerry does odd jobs for a living as he is an undergraduate but Nick has a white-collar job. However, both find themselves jobless due to the economic downturn. Jerry has a school-age nephew named Veer (Master Virej Desai) whom he looks after, as the child has lost his parents. Nick intends to marry his girlfriend, Radhika Awasthi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), who dreams of a lovely wedding, a great honeymoon and a wonderful house to live in after marriage.\n\nOut of a job, Jerry finds it difficult to even pay the school fees of his nephew because of which the government is on the verge of giving the custody of his nephew to a foster family. Nick fears he won\u2019t be able to fulfill the dreams of his to-be wife. It is to tide over the difficult times that Jerry and Nick turn to the oldest profession in the world. Jerry and Nick become male escorts for the company \"Desi Boyz\", fulfilling the fantasies of girls and ladies. Nonetheless, Jerry is unable to prevent his nephew from being sent to a foster home; and Nick loses Radhika when she learns of what he has been up to while she is away in India. Frustrated, Nick blames Jerry for forcing him into the profession and asks him to move out of his house and life.\n\nNick now tries to win Radhika back and help comes from the most unlikely source \u2013 Radhika\u2019s father Suresh ([[Anupam Kher]]) who has come to London with her. Meanwhile, Jerry registers in college again to complete his graduation so that he can earn enough money to get his nephew back home. In college, Jerry meets Tanya Sharma ([[Chitrangada Singh]]) who used to be his classmate and is now a professor at the same college. Sparks fly between Jerry and Tanya. To make Nick jealous, Radhika dates a man named Ajay ([[Omi Vaidya]]). Nick starts to pick on Ajay, often calling him Vijay intentionally. After some reconsideration, Radhika forgives Nick, but Nick rejects her after she disapproves of Jerry. Meanwhile, Jerry graduates college and also wins Tanya's heart. Nick comes and apologizes to Jerry. All is forgiven when Nick and Jerry reconcile. Jerry then helps Radhika win back Nick.\n\nNick then helps Jerry get a high paying job, and Jerry decides to go to court and get back the custody of his nephew. Ajay turns out to be the lawyer against Jerry's case. He decides to get revenge on Nick by not letting Jerry win his case. Ajay tells the court about Jerry being a male escort and what a bad role model he would be to his nephew, bringing in 3 witnesses to testify against Jerry. He asks each of them if they had paid Jerry for sex, but only one says yes. Ajay is on the verge of winning, but Mr. Desi Boyz comes into the courtroom and influences the judge. Then, Jerry makes an inspiring speech to the judge. He ends up winning the case and gaining full custody of Veer. The economy improves and everyone is happy in the end. In a short ending scene, a newspaper article is shown, that states the recession will strike back, then Mr. Desi Boyz gives a call and says that he has gotten the license for a branch in Mumbai.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Akshay Kumar]] as Jignesh 'Jerry' Patel (Rocco)\n* [[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]] as Nikhil 'Nick' Mathur (Hunter)\n* [[Sanjay Dutt]] as Mr. Khalnayak\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Radhika Awasthi\n* [[Chitrangada Singh]] as Tanya Sharma\n* [[Master Virej Desai]] as Veer Patel\n* [[Anupam Kher]] as Suresh Awasthi, Radhika's father\n* [[Omi Vaidya]] as Ajay Bapat\n* [[Mohnish Bahl]] as Social Worker\n* [[Shraman Jain]] as Rohan, Jerry's Friend\n* [[Bharati Achrekar]] as Jerry's mother\n* [[Satish Kaushik]] as Mr. Dhillon\n* [[Ashwin Mushran]] as Defence Lawyer\n* [[Bruna Abdullah]] in a Special Appearance in song \"Subha Hone Na De\"\n* [[Larissa Bonesi]] in a Special Appearance in song \"Subha Hone Na De\"\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Desi Boyz'' was reported to be inspired by the aftermath of thousands of Indian students being duped by [http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/waiting-to-happen-a-hundred-trivalleys/article3817234.ece various universities in the West] such as Tri Valley University, Herguan University, London Metropolitan University and University of Navarra.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuteja|first=Joginder|title=\"'Desi Boyz' is a 'Dramady' with a lot of 'Soul'\" - Akshay|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/74018.html|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Yount|first=Stacey|title=More on Desi Boyz|url=http://bollyspice.com/31795/more-on-desi-boyz|accessdate=17 November 2011|date=6 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Varma|first=Lipika|title=I have got all that I wanted, says Akshay Kumar|url=http://www.emirates247.com/bollywood/take-one/i-have-got-all-that-i-wanted-says-akshay-kumar-2011-11-17-1.428712|accessdate=17 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plagiarism==\nThe basic plot and even some of the scenes of the movie have been lifted from various [[Adam Sandler]] movies like ''[[Reign Over Me]]'', ''[[Billy Madison]]'' and ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mensxp.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/11031-movie-review-karan-a-on-why-desi-boyz-is-the-best-of-the-worst-but-still-only-gets-2-stars.html|title=Movie Review: Karan A on Why Desi Boyz Is the Best of the Worst But Still Only Gets 2 Stars|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''Desi Boyz'' started filming on 7 November 2010,<ref>{{cite web|title=Desi Boyz Starring Deepika Padukone, Akshay Kumar Begins Production|url=http://www.sawfnews.com/Bollywood/65670.aspx|accessdate=15 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110123500/http://www.sawfnews.com/Bollywood/65670.aspx|archive-date=10 November 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> and completed shooting in May 2011.
