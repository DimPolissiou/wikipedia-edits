The film premiered on May 21, 2007 at the [[Cannes Film Market]]. It was later adapted in [[Bollywood]] as ''[[Accident on Hill Road]]'' starring [[Celina Jaitley]] in Mena Suvari's role. It was the final film Gordon directed before his death.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] where Thomas \"Tom\" Bardo ([[Stephen Rea]]) is having a particularly bad day; not only has his unemployment run out, but he has also been evicted from his apartment. Retirement-home caregiver Brandi Boski ([[Mena Suvari]]) is potentially up for a promotion at work, and celebrates with a night of drinking and [[MDMA]] before driving home. On the way home, Brandi hits Tom with her car and he becomes trapped in her car's windshield. Afraid of being arrested, Brandi continues to [[Hit and run (vehicular)|drive]] home with the promise that she will get Tom help. But as she begins to debate the issue, Brandi feels the accident will destroy her life and opts to take a [[taxicab|taxi]] to work, leaving him to die slowly in her garage. When Tom realizes that, he painfully tries to escape.\n\nBrandi enlists the help of her boyfriend, Rashid ([[Russell Hornsby]]), in an attempt to kill and dispose of Tom. Meanwhile, Tom is able to pull himself free from the windshield, but before he is able to escape the garage, Rashid and Brandi restrain him. They go back into Brandi's house and decide to kill Tom, and hide the evidence by [[Cremation|burning]] both Tom's corpse and the car.\n\nRashid returns to the garage, and prepares to shoot the apparently unconscious Tom with a revolver. But Tom, secretly awake, manages to attack Rashid before stabbing him through the eye with a concealed pen, killing him. During the brawl, a shot is discharged from the gun, prompting Brandi to investigate. Tom tries to start the car, but Brandi enters the garage before he is able to do so. Tom knocks Brandi over and limps out of the garage towards the street, taking Rashid's gun with him.\n\nBrandi pursues Tom, wielding a hammer from the garage. Tom pleads with Brandi to stay back, not wanting to fire on her, but she subdues him with the hammer. She drags Tom back to the garage and begins dousing the room with gasoline, panicking. She hopes that the police will conclude that Tom broke in, attacked Rashid and accidentally became engulfed in flames while trying to burn the garage down. However, Tom is able to sneak back into the car, start it and drive forwards, pinning Brandi against the back of the garage.\n\nBrandi begs for help, while Tom steps out of the car and lights a match. He asks why she didn't help him, and Brandi says she doesn't know, and continues to plead for her life. Tom decides to spare Brandi and extinguishes the match. Brandi suddenly produces Rashid's revolver and fires on Tom, who ducks beside the car and a stray bullet ignites the gasoline, setting Brandi alight. As she screams in pain, burning to death, Tom struggles to the front of the garage and is able to open the door. Tom stumbles out onto the driveway and collapses as neighbours surround him, alerted by the fire. Tom is helped away and turns to look back at the burning garage, where Brandi's screaming has subsided.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Brandi Boski\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Thomas \"Tom\" Bardo\n* [[Russell Hornsby]] as Rashid\n* Rukiya Bernard as Tanya\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Petersen\n* [[Lionel Mark Smith]] as Sam\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Mr. Binckley\n* [[R.D.

The film premiered on May 21, 2007 at the [[Cannes Film Market]]. It was later adapted in [[Bollywood]] as ''[[Accident on Hill Road]]'' starring [[Celina Jaitley]] in Mena Suvari's role. It was the final Gordon directed before his death.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film takes place in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] where Thomas \"Tom\" Bardo ([[Stephen Rea]]) is having a particularly bad day; not only has his unemployment run out, but he has also been evicted from his apartment. Retirement-home caregiver Brandi Boski ([[Mena Suvari]]) is potentially up for a promotion at work, and celebrates with a night of drinking and [[MDMA]] before driving home. On the way home, Brandi hits Tom with her car and he becomes trapped in her car's windshield. Afraid of being arrested, Brandi continues to [[Hit and run (vehicular)|drive]] home with the promise that she will get Tom help. But as she begins to debate the issue, Brandi feels the accident will destroy her life and opts to take a [[taxicab|taxi]] to work, leaving him to die slowly in her garage. When Tom realizes that, he painfully tries to escape.\n\nBrandi enlists the help of her boyfriend, Rashid ([[Russell Hornsby]]), in an attempt to kill and dispose of Tom. Meanwhile, Tom is able to pull himself free from the windshield, but before he is able to escape the garage, Rashid and Brandi restrain him. They go back into Brandi's house and decide to kill Tom, and hide the evidence by [[Cremation|burning]] both Tom's corpse and the car.\n\nRashid returns to the garage, and prepares to shoot the apparently unconscious Tom with a revolver. But Tom, secretly awake, manages to attack Rashid before stabbing him through the eye with a concealed pen, killing him. During the brawl, a shot is discharged from the gun, prompting Brandi to investigate. Tom tries to start the car, but Brandi enters the garage before he is able to do so. Tom knocks Brandi over and limps out of the garage towards the street, taking Rashid's gun with him.\n\nBrandi pursues Tom, wielding a hammer from the garage. Tom pleads with Brandi to stay back, not wanting to fire on her, but she subdues him with the hammer. She drags Tom back to the garage and begins dousing the room with gasoline, panicking. She hopes that the police will conclude that Tom broke in, attacked Rashid and accidentally became engulfed in flames while trying to burn the garage down. However, Tom is able to sneak back into the car, start it and drive forwards, pinning Brandi against the back of the garage.\n\nBrandi begs for help, while Tom steps out of the car and lights a match. He asks why she didn't help him, and Brandi says she doesn't know, and continues to plead for her life. Tom decides to spare Brandi and extinguishes the match. Brandi suddenly produces Rashid's revolver and fires on Tom, who ducks beside the car and a stray bullet ignites the gasoline, setting Brandi alight. As she screams in pain, burning to death, Tom struggles to the front of the garage and is able to open the door. Tom stumbles out onto the driveway and collapses as neighbours surround him, alerted by the fire. Tom is helped away and turns to look back at the burning garage, where Brandi's screaming has subsided.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mena Suvari]] as Brandi Boski\n* [[Stephen Rea]] as Thomas \"Tom\" Bardo\n* [[Russell Hornsby]] as Rashid\n* Rukiya Bernard as Tanya\n* Carolyn Purdy-Gordon as Petersen\n* [[Lionel Mark Smith]] as Sam\n* [[Wayne Robson]] as Mr. Binckley\n* [[R.D.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, but their visibility depends on the life stage of the organism. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). The membranes' proximity to one another often makes them difficult to distinguish. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cell. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |taal=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

In G. garnhami three parts can be seen: epimerite, protomerite en deutomerite, although, it depends on the life stage of G. garnhami whether these three parts can be seen. a characteristic of gregarins is the typical construction of the pellicula that is formed by a [[Cell membrane]] and two cytoplasmamembranes (the latter is often referred to as the inner membrane complex, IMC or alveoli). Often the membranes are very close together making to see the distinction between them. This structure is often also referred to as the tri-layered structure. Beneath the inner membrane a [[Basal lamina|basal (internal) lamina]] can be seen. This basal lamina separates the epicytic foldings from the rest of the cell. These epicytic foldings form the outer surface of G. garnhami and hundreds of these can be observed at the surface enlarging the surface of the cell.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vivier |first1=E |last2=Petitprez |first2=A |title=The outer membrane complex and its development at the time of the formation of daughter cells in Toxoplasma gondii|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology |date=November 1969 |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=329\u201342 |doi=10.1083/jcb.43.2.329 |pmid=5344151|pmc=2107857 |taal=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=M.

This can be seen throughout the American region where medical authorities have achieved rabies control.\n\nIn Haiti, the CDC is mainly focusing on dog-mediated rabies. Specifically in collaboration with the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission, the CDC has trained, to date, more than 20 MARNDR laboratory personnel in rabies diagnostic methods (Direct Fluorescent Antibody [DFA] and Direct Rapid Immunohistochemistry Test [dRIT]).  The organizations have also improved a diagnostic laboratory in Port-au-Prince by providing it with advanced equipment. The surveillance system is a bite-reporting model where the public and medical providers report bite events to rabies control officers. In addition, more than 30 field veterinary and health agents were trained in rabies surveillance, in support of this effort.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2011, the CDC along with MARNDR initiated a five-year rabies infrastructure improvement program that focused on surveillance, diagnostics, and education. The MSPP also helped out by improving public education on rabies. Because Haiti has a gross national income per capita of US$1,035, it is the only country in the American region that is part of the group of low-income countries. The World Bank has classified 33 other low-income countries in Africa and Asia, where dog-mediated rabies is a major problem and results in thousands of deaths annually. The persistence of dog rabies is connected to limited resources and weak governance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn conducting a rabies assessment, rabies control officers try to locate the offending animal. Animals that have bitten a victim are either euthanized and tested or quarantined for 14 days while remaining in their owner's residence. In addition, animals who show signs of rabies are tested, regardless of human exposure. This surveillance program is restricted to two of the ten geographical departments of the country (West and Artibonite) for security reasons.  The area includes approximately 50 percent of the Haitian population. The CDC and the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission support the mission by maintaining four Haitian staff in the West Department and three in the Artibonite Department, respectively. Results of this mission showed the level of under-reporting of canine rabies. Specifically, six cases of rabid dogs in early December, 2012, were reported for the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the first nine months of the surveillance mission, 42 rabid dogs were identified in just three communities in Port-au-Prince during the first nine months in 2012. That being said, no laboratory-based surveillance exists for the human population that is exposed to rabies and all diagnoses are based on clinical history. This is because of the lack of laboratory facilities, making it difficult to identify evidence for the virus in humans and shed light on the disease as a whole for them, in Haiti. There are insufficient numbers of pathologists to collect samples for human rabies, as well.  There do exist other methods for viral antigen detection that may merit study.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013, the CDC and its partners began an animal rabies surveillance program in several regions of Haiti and saw an 18-fold rise in detection of rabid animals. In 2015, the CDC evaluated Haiti's canine rabies vaccination program and found that only 45 percent of dogs were vaccinated, far short of the 70 percent needed to stop the spread of rabies in the dog population. In addition, the researchers found that Haiti had nearly 1,000,000 dogs, twice as many as previously thought.<ref name=\"CDCrabies\" />\n\nThe CDC and its partners had already begun a dog vaccination trial in evaluating the best vaccination methods for dogs in Haiti. As a part of this effort, they vaccinated 3,000 dogs in just four days during the summer of 2016 and planned to vaccinate a total of 8,000 dogs as part of this campaign.<ref name=\"CDCrabies\" />\n\n==Challenges==\nIn Haiti, the control of dog rabies is led by the MARNDR while the MSPP manages health-care and rabies prevention in the human population. The separation of these ministries makes it easier for responsibilities to be divided among them.  Communication about finding the source of exposure and implementing control methods to prevent further cross-species transmission is also more effective. This task is difficult enough within departments of the same ministry, (e.g., health care and epidemiology), which can be seen in experiences elsewhere. This is why a comprehensive evaluation of Haiti's rabies program should heavily consider the costs and benefits of this separation of responsibilities between the two ministries early on.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite a planned mass vaccination for dogs in 2013, no campaign was actually conducted. Authorities in Haiti relied on funds donated by the World Bank for the purchase of approximately 500,000 doses of inactivated, injectable vaccine (IMRAB by Merial).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://imrab.us.merial.com/imrab/index.shtml|title=The Benefits of IMRAB {{!}} IMRAB\u00ae  The world\u2019s leading rabies vaccine|website=imrab.us.merial.com|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref> Although the funds were awarded in April 2013, the vaccine itself did not arrive until 2014 when the dog vaccination finally went underway in September 2014. The process as a whole was expected to terminate in January 2015. The lack of manpower needed to deliver faster implementation made it impossible for the campaign to be completed in less than four months.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother challenge presented is vaccination failure, which usually leads to recurrent rabies in dogs and inconsistent control of the disease.  The failures that disrupt annual campaigns or have insufficient coverage, for example, are seen as the main cause for this problem. Another factor is that in Haiti, dog vaccinations have been inconsistently applied. Back in 2012 when the last mass vaccination was led by the MARNDR, approximately 400,000 dogs were vaccinated. With this in mind, considering a current human population of approximately 10,000,000, a relation of one dog per ten people, and aiming to attain 70 percent of vaccine coverage, 700,000 dogs would have to be vaccinated. Assessing the effectiveness of this vaccination campaign is difficult because the dog population figures are unreliable (estimates range from 800,000 to 1,200,000 dogs), and though the overall success seems to be limited.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe number of rabid dogs detected by the MARNDR, MSPP, and CDC is a huge risk to people and is not accurately reflected in their surveillance figures. Although international support is common in both technical help and donations, it is not comprehensive. In addition, the MARNDR, MSPP, and other actors do not communicate effectively because of human resource limitations. That being said, the 2015 elimination goal in the region was compromised and control of the disease could not yet be achieved, despite the efforts of resolute national officials. In conclusion, rabies in the dog population is still a problem and major threat to the Haitian population.<ref name=\":0\" /><!--==Funding==\nFunding:MFM, JBPL, and RW received no specific funding for this work. EC, VJDRV, JMR, JLP, and Contributed to the work as part of PAHO regional technical cooperation role, for which general funds exist. Both CDC and PAHO had a role in the studydesign and other stages. CDC support the dog surveillance activities, and PAHO the mission to Haiti(for EC and VJDRV), involvement of colleagues from PAHO Haiti office (JMR and JLP) and Panaftosa(OC). Neither PAHO nor CDC supported the ministries or their employees (MFM and JBPL).Competing Interests:The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\ngathered during the mission that comprised a review of the evidence and control plans to date, compare them against the basic capacities of a comprehensive rabies programme, and discuss-the findings in the light of the elimination goal in the region by 2015.\n\n==Section one and intro==\nThe Context PAHO\u2019s regional programme of rabies control defines Haiti as a priority country, i.e., countries where canine rabies variants are either circulating or did so in the recent past. The context and capacities of priority countries are diverse, and efforts are undergoing to evaluate the best port-folio of actions to address country-specific limitations [2]. Brazil, for example, remains a priority country because of the persistent, albeit well-circumscribed, occurrence of dog-mediated human rabies in the northeast of the country, in the state of Maranhao [3]. Even with this occurrence,\n\n=='''Brazil'''==\nremains a successful example in the control of dog-mediated rabies, and constitutes an important technical reference in the region. With the aim of promoting south-to-south collaboration, the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the ministry solely responsible for the control of dog-transmitted rabies in the country, assisted PAHO\u2019s mission to Haiti. Specifically on rabies, Brazil has donated human and canine vaccines to Haiti in the past. One of the objectives of the PAHO mission was to explore ways to enhance this collaboration, for example, in the form of direct technical assistance on the ground. Such assistance would complement the activities currently conducted by the CDC.\n\nTo help with this basic capacity, the CDC has conveyed to the MSPP its willingness to assist in human sample collection, shipping of samples, and diagnostic testing at CDC\u2019s  rabies laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, US. To date, only one sample has been shipped to the CDC, which tested negative for rabies.At a meeting during the mission, MSPP officials reported three human cases in 2013, eightin 2012, 13 in 2011, and one in 2010, all allegedly due to canine rabies. These numbers indicate severe under-reporting when compared with modeling figures that show Haiti as the main contributor of the estimated 200 human deaths by dog-transmitted rabies per year in the region[3]. The above structural limitations do not extend to animal samples that are analysed at the MARNDR rabies laboratory.\n\nTosupport the vaccination campaign, MARNDR is implementing a solar-powered cold chain(Fig 1), over and above the available cold chain facilities in MSPP field premises, previouslyused to support dog vaccination campaigns.\n==sec==\nOn this note, dogbites are now, together with six notifiable conditions, part of the daily reporting requirements from 114 health units (out of more than 900 in the country) to a central epidemiology unit in Port-au-Prince, the capital. This intensive reporting pressure on health officials should increase rabies awareness across the health system, and lead to an increase in the number of dog attacks reported. The aggregation of this information, analysis, and feedback to the sources on a regu-lar basis would further improve awareness among health officials of the rabies risks.As reported by health officials, 1,657 dog bites were recorded in 2013 by the 114 sentinelhealth centers. For a population of approximately 10 million people, this results in a 0.016% of the population bitten by dogs; five times lower than the 0.08% average reported by the coun-tries that attended the 14thmeeting of National Rabies Programme Managers (REDIPRA inSpanish) in Lima (Per\u00fa) in 2013 [7], and many more times lower than the 1.8% reported inother countries where canine rabies is also endemic [8]. Analyses of the number of animalaggressions reported by the public may inform the level of awareness within the populationwith regard to the risk of rabies. A simple and short questionnaire about the motivation of thevisit by the dog bitten patient, i.e., whether it was related to fear of rabies, could be administeredto refine this inference. Further checks on the quality of the data should help explain apparentreporting artifacts, such as the fact that all registered victims of dog attacks were five years oldor older, a finding that challenges results elsewhere that consistently report young children asPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20154 / 10\n\n==chidren==\nthe main victims of dog bites [9,10,11]. The surveillance artifact may hide greater under-reporting of rabies cases if this population group is not captured by the bite registration mecha-nisms, and should trigger questions as to where do children younger than five years old go forbite treatment.At the time of the review, the MSPP had more than 15,000 doses of human vaccine for PEPin stock. These vaccines belonged to a lot of 20,000 Vero cell rabies vaccines for intramuscularadministration donated by Brazil in 2013. This volume of vaccine should be enough to coverthe needs of the country for at least two years given the current use rate of 8,000 doses per year.In addition to sufficient numbers, vaccine must be stored in adequate conditions and in such away that allows its prompt availability across the country.\n\nA national consultant hired byPAHO/Haiti visited twelve sites in Port-au-Prince during the last months of 2013 and reportedadequate cold chain. We had no data about the conditions outside the capital.At an annual use rate of 8,000 human vaccine doses (as per PAHO/Haiti\u2019s warehouse rec-ords), the country could face a surplus of several thousand doses by the end of their shelf life inearly 2015. Solutions to the adequate use of this potential excess of vaccine, before they reachtheir expiration date, might contemplate increasing the distribution of vaccine to areas where itis not currently available, e.g., outside the capital. According to MSPP officials, all large hospi-tals in the country (between 40 and 50) had stocks of human vaccine. Ensuring that vaccineFig 1.

MSPPofficials confirmed that they do not record this key performance indicator. At the time of the mission, the amount and availability of any stock of immunoglobulin was not ascertained.Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis The 2013 WHO expert consultation on rabies report [3] indicates the administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis for those populations at continuous or high risk of rabies, especially children. Although the current stock of vaccine could support such strategy, and indirectly reduce the potential surplus of vaccine by 2015, the logistics of the distribution, rationale for application, and the required follow-up would make this operation impossible given the current avail-able resources.Outbreak Control Activities This capacity comprises surveillance, awareness raising, and control specific activities, within a defined time and space context, implemented following the confirmation of a case of rabies.These can include enhanced surveillance of animal populations at risk, ring vaccination, and awareness campaigns for the population. The rabies national plan provides protocols to guarantee the exchange of information between MSPP and the MARNDR after the occurrence of rabies events.\n\nFor example, the communication of dog attacks by the MSPP to the MARNDR, for the latter to initiate surveillance and control activities, occurs after a number of dog attacks are recorded for a specific area. At the time of this review, it was not possible to ascertain the criteria, e.g., number of dogs and period of time that trigger this communication, nor was it possible to verify the completeness of epidemiological reports around the cases.Reactive vaccination of susceptible animals after confirmation of rabies within the local community is also part of these case control activities, however, the amount of canine vaccine available for this purpose at the time of the mission, around 1,000 doses, appeared insufficient. Education Rabies educational capacity comprises activities towards health professionals and the general public to enhance and maintain awareness of rabies risks.\n\n==sec==\n\nTo this end, the MSPP conducted a training activity for 40 health officials of the central region on PEP in 2013. This training fol-lowed four similar courses delivered in 2012. It was not possible to ascertain if these activities were all part of a training plan.MSPP and PAHO/Haiti officials stated the critical importance of training for health official son PEP, data form completion, etc., and stressed the ongoing need for these activities given thehigh staff turnover. Training on PEP application should help to change the current practice of delaying prophylaxis after exposure if the animal can be observed. This practice can lead to fatal delays [3] and it needs to be replaced with the immediate application of PEP after expo-sure even if the animal can be observed.For MARNDR officials, there are currently no training plans, although the CDC trained more than 30 veterinary officials in June 2013, and delivers regular training to personnel of theMARNDR laboratory responsible for rabies diagnosis.Identification of Other Risks Cases of canine rabies together with the significant numbers of mongoose cases reported from the Dominican Republic could be seen as a threat to Haiti\u2019s rabies status [7]. Despite this beinga genuine concern, and an indication of a source of rabies in Haiti\u2019s wildlife, it is not high in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20156 / 10\n\nthe list of priorities given the many limitations affecting the other capacities. Any medium- orlong-term strategy in the future must contemplate the wildlife source. In the short term, enhanced communication and coordination of control efforts with the neighbouring Domini-can Republic would bring benefits to the two countries.DiscussionDespite having a National Rabies Plan for the period 2007\u20132012, and an evaluation of it in 2011, little of the plan could be delivered due to insufficient resources at the MSPP andMARNDR. Whereas in other countries in the region the main interest resides on how rabiescontrol activities are operationalised, as the focus is on the optimization of well-establishedprocesses, in Haiti this is not the case, as some basic rabies capacities are still wanting. This istrue for the episodic mass canine vaccination campaigns, and the lack of diagnostic facilitiesfor human rabies cases. Given that canine vaccination is the most effective measure to controldog-mediated human rabies, the intermittent nature of the mass campaigns and their insuffi-cient coverage will not allow for the control of the disease any time soon, let alone itselimination.The inconsistent and insufficient canine vaccination campaigns will also stop short of deliv-ering a number of related positive effects associated with vaccination, e.g., increased awarenessin the population due to the high visibility of the campaigns, and a sense of purpose among theofficials responsible for rabies control. Not only that, the ongoing occurrence of dog cases dueto low levels of immunity in the population, despite large logistic efforts, can easily lead to frus-tration among officials and hamper participation by the population [12].Following recommendations from the 14thREDIPRA meeting [7] canine rabies vaccine hasbeen recently added to PAHO\u2019s Revolving Fund (RF). Countries in the region can now requestcanine vaccine from the RF.\n\n==sec==\nDespite the advantages provided by the inclusion of the caninevaccine in the RF, e.g., consistent vaccine quality and more competitive prices, the evidence tosupport the allocation of funds within the MSPP and MARNDR to purchase rabies vaccine isnot sufficient. This evidence can only be gathered by means of adequate surveillance to informthe burden of rabies against that of other diseases.Although there are models that estimate a much larger number of human rabies cases inHaiti [3], these cases remain unobserved, and lead to no reaction by the already overstretchedand under-resourced Haitian health system. This appears logical as the impact of these esti-mated, but unobserved, cases is difficult to demonstrate relative to that of other conditions thatprovide counts of actual data and lead to health care expenditure. Disease estimates adjustedfor under-ascertainment trigger little policy action [13], at least at the operational level, and arenot a substitute for actual surveillance data. The dog surveillance work conducted by theMARNDR with technical support by the CDC is, therefore, critical. Short of reliable records onthe real count of human rabies cases, measures of rabies risk approximated by the dog surveil-lance figures, in combination with dog bite data, can provide an indication of the much higherlevel of rabies exposure in the population.Surveillance findings need to be disseminated to attain their objective: inform and influencedecision, at as many levels as possible. There is value in reporting back to the sources of data for awareness and motivation reasons, to local authorities to inform strategic and operationaldecisions pertaining to the rabies programme, and to international forums to raise awareness about the situation in Haiti. To this end, Haiti should return to the regular reporting of surveil-lance figures and details of the cases to the regional database on rabies (SIRVERA) held atPANAFTOSA [6]. By having up-to-date data by country and aggregated figures, PAHO canreport progress towards the goal of elimination in the region, and identify countries in need ofPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20157 / 10\n\n==sec==\n\ngreater focus, such as Haiti. At this critical stage in the race to elimination, with fewer cases and diminishing resources and available skill pool in the region, collecting and sharing as much information as possible on the epidemiology and, critically, on the processes leading to the surveillance and control of the disease remains as important as ever.Following from the recommendations of the last REDIPRA meeting [7], PAHO coordinated in 2014 a proficiency exercise for 35 laboratories from 23 countries to assess regional consistency in direct fluorescent antibody techniques.\n\nHaiti\u2019s MARNDR reference laboratory has participated in this exercise. This shows the commitment of the Haitian authorities to improve their processes. This willingness should be extended to seek the utilization of the MARNDR laboratory premises for the diagnoses of human rabies cases, over and above legitimate administrative and organizational concerns. On this note, as of July 2014, there is discussion about developing a plan for a joint human and animal rabies diagnostic facility in the North Depart-ment. If successful, this will represent the second animal rabies diagnostic facility and first human rabies diagnostic facility in the country. The initiative to create a joint human/animal rabies diagnostic laboratory would maximize the use of the limited human resource and infra-structure capital. Given the current low recognition of human rabies, and the fact that the majority of routine diagnostic testing will be on animal samples, it is not feasible to create diagnostic facility solely devoted to human diagnostics, nor train personnel in human rabies diagnostics alone.\n\n==Brazil again==\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health is willing to help Haiti by extending its donations of vaccine to on-field technical support.  This includes aiding areas that are planning vaccine campaigns, administering PEP training, and more. This contribution will add to the increasing need for a strategic framework with clear objectives like controlling dog-mediated rabies first to ensure the efficient elimination of dog mediated human cases, and coordination between donors. The impact of missions like this appears reduced in terms of observing rapid changes in response to limitations that are well known by the local officials.\n\nThe benefit could come in the form of notes like this and their dissemination:to increase awareness among international donors, senior authorities in Haiti, and within PAHO. A planned communication campaign is just one of the activities contained in the strategic document, being drafted at the time of writing, to support a rabies task force in Haiti. Keyto this strategy, and responding to a critical lack of this capacity, is the need for coordination among the multiple partners that deliver rabies activities in Haiti. Better integration among partners should lead to greater impact and more efficient use of resources. Coordination and speaking with one voice before Haitian authorities would also increase the critical mass of rabies control efforts and deliver a more consistent and rotund message. The funding of a rabies coordinator/rabies champion, who will work primarily towards ensuring regular and sufficient canine vaccination campaigns and prompt availability of human vaccine for the next two to three years, is being discussed at the time of writing.\n\nThe current situation in Haiti clearly impacts the region\u2019s 2015 elimination goal [1] as it was not achieved. The countries of the region will have to make a new goal that recognizes the distinct situations across the region. Most of the areas where dog-mediated human rabies is no longer a public health problem will benefit from efficiency gains and enhanced knowledge management to ensure institutional memory and experience dissemination. These efforts should also benefit the reduced number of countries and areas, such as Haiti, where rabies remains a public health concern. Specific plans for dog rabies control, such as those described above, will require contributions from a number of regional partners and neighboring countries. The PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20158 / 10\n\n==sec==\n\nforthcoming 2015 REDIPRA meeting will provide the platform to hold these discussions and agree on a new regional goal.A general limitation of the findings described here is that they originate from unstructured questions, observations, and notes from meetings and field visits. A more comprehensive plat-form to collect precise information on the levels of performance within the capacities, as well as on process-related indicators, is the subject of current work by PANAFTOSA.-->\n\n<ref name=\"FenelonDely2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Fenelon|first1=N.|last2=Dely|first2=P.|last3=Katz|first3=M.

At the program level, several components are critical, including: adequate and prompt recognition of the need for PEP by the public, if exposed, and by health officials, prompt and sufficient availability of high-quality PEP, and adequate follow-up of PEP use. Health officials' awareness of the need for PEP after a dog bite can only be achieved if the exposure is attended to immediately and communicated effectively.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Millien|first=Max F.|last2=Pierre-Louis|first2=Jocelyne B.|last3=Wallace|first3=Ryan|last4=Caldas|first4=Eduardo|last5=Rwangabgoba|first5=Jean M.|last6=Poncelet|first6=Jean L.|last7=Cosivi|first7=Ottorino|last8=Del Rio Vilas|first8=Victor J.|date=2015-06-25|title=Control of Dog Mediated Human Rabies in Haiti: No Time to Spare|journal=PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases|volume=9|issue=6|doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806|issn=1935-2727|pmc=4481514|pmid=26110845|page=e0003806}}</ref>\n\n==Animal treatment ==\nDog vaccination is most effective for controlling dog-mediated rabies. This can be seen throughout the American region where medical authorities have achieved rabies control.\n\nIn Haiti, the CDC is mainly focusing on dog-mediated rabies. Specifically in collaboration with the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission, the CDC has trained, to date, more than 20 MARNDR laboratory personnel in rabies diagnostic methods (Direct Fluorescent Antibody [DFA] and Direct Rapid Immunohistochemistry Test [dRIT]).  The organizations have also improved a diagnostic laboratory in Port-au-Prince by providing it with advanced equipment. The surveillance system is a bite-reporting model where the public and medical providers report bite events to rabies control officers. In addition, more than 30 field veterinary and health agents were trained in rabies surveillance, in support of this effort.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2011, the CDC along with MARNDR initiated a five-year rabies infrastructure improvement program that focused on surveillance, diagnostics, and education. The MSPP also helped out by improving public education on rabies. Because Haiti has a gross national income per capita of US$1,035, it is the only country in the American region that is part of the group of low-income countries. The World Bank has classified 33 other low-income countries in Africa and Asia, where dog-mediated rabies is a major problem and results in thousands of deaths annually. The persistence of dog rabies is connected to limited resources and weak governance.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn conducting a rabies assessment, rabies control officers try to locate the offending animal. Animals that have bitten a victim are either euthanized and tested or quarantined for 14 days while remaining in their owner's residence. In addition, animals who show signs of rabies are tested, regardless of human exposure. This surveillance program is restricted to two of the ten geographical departments of the country (West and Artibonite) for security reasons.  The area includes approximately 50 percent of the Haitian population. The CDC and the NGO Christian Veterinary Mission support the mission by maintaining four Haitian staff in the West Department and three in the Artibonite Department, respectively. Results of this mission showed the level of under-reporting of canine rabies. Specifically, six cases of rabid dogs in early December, 2012, were reported for the country.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the first nine months of the surveillance mission, 42 rabid dogs were identified in just three communities in Port-au-Prince during the first nine months in 2012. That being said, no laboratory-based surveillance exists for the human population that is exposed to rabies and all diagnoses are based on clinical history. This is because of the lack of laboratory facilities, making it difficult to identify evidence for the virus in humans and shed light on the disease as a whole for them, in Haiti. There are insufficient numbers of pathologists to collect samples for human rabies, as well.  There do exist other methods for viral antigen detection that may merit study.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2013, the CDC and its partners began an animal rabies surveillance program in several regions of Haiti and saw an 18-fold rise in detection of rabid animals. In 2015, the CDC evaluated Haiti's canine rabies vaccination program and found that only 45 percent of dogs were vaccinated, far short of the 70 percent needed to stop the spread of rabies in the dog population. In addition, the researchers found that Haiti had nearly 1,000,000 dogs, twice as many as previously thought.<ref name=\"CDCrabies\" />\n\nThe CDC and its partners had already begun a dog vaccination trial in evaluating the best vaccination methods for dogs in Haiti. As a part of this effort, they vaccinated 3,000 dogs in just four days during the summer of 2016 and planned to vaccinate a total of 8,000 dogs as part of this campaign.<ref name=\"CDCrabies\" />\n\n==Challenges==\nIn Haiti, the control of dog rabies is led by the MARNDR while the MSPP manages health-care and rabies prevention in the human population. The separation of these ministries makes it easier for responsibilities to be divided among them.  Communication about finding the source of exposure and implementing control methods to prevent further cross-species transmission is also more effective. This task is difficult enough within departments of the same ministry, (e.g., health care and epidemiology), which can be seen in experiences elsewhere. This is why a comprehensive evaluation of Haiti's rabies program should heavily consider the costs and benefits of this separation of responsibilities between the two ministries early on.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite a planned mass vaccination for dogs in 2013, no campaign was actually conducted. Authorities in Haiti relied on funds donated by the World Bank for the purchase of approximately 500,000 doses of inactivated, injectable vaccine (IMRAB by Merial).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://imrab.us.merial.com/imrab/index.shtml|title=The Benefits of IMRAB {{!}} IMRAB\u00ae  The world\u2019s leading rabies vaccine|website=imrab.us.merial.com|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref> Although the funds were awarded in April 2013, the vaccine itself did not arrive until 2014 when the dog vaccination finally went underway in September 2014. The process as a whole was expected to terminate in January 2015. The lack of manpower needed to deliver faster implementation made it impossible for the campaign to be completed in less than four months.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother challenge presented is vaccination failure, which usually leads to recurrent rabies in dogs and inconsistent control of the disease.  The failures that disrupt annual campaigns or have insufficient coverage, for example, are seen as the main cause for this problem. Another factor is that in Haiti, dog vaccinations have been inconsistently applied. Back in 2012 when the last mass vaccination was led by the MARNDR, approximately 400,000 dogs were vaccinated. With this in mind, considering a current human population of approximately 10,000,000, a relation of one dog per ten people, and aiming to attain 70 percent of vaccine coverage, 700,000 dogs would have to be vaccinated. Assessing the effectiveness of this vaccination campaign is difficult because the dog population figures are unreliable (estimates range from 800,000 to 1,200,000 dogs), and though the overall success seems to be limited.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe number of rabid dogs detected by the MARNDR, MSPP, and CDC is a huge risk to people and is not accurately reflected in their surveillance figures. Although international support is common in both technical help and donations, it is not comprehensive. In addition, the MARNDR, MSPP, and other actors do not communicate effectively because of human resource limitations. That being said, the 2015 elimination goal in the region was compromised and control of the disease could not yet be achieved, despite the efforts of resolute national officials. In conclusion, rabies in the dog population is still a problem and major threat to the Haitian population.<ref name=\":0\" /><!--==Funding==\nFunding:MFM, JBPL, and RW received no specific funding for this work. EC, VJDRV, JMR, JLP, and Contributed to the work as part of PAHO regional technical cooperation role, for which general funds exist. Both CDC and PAHO had a role in the studydesign and other stages. CDC support the dog surveillance activities, and PAHO the mission to Haiti(for EC and VJDRV), involvement of colleagues from PAHO Haiti office (JMR and JLP) and Panaftosa(OC). Neither PAHO nor CDC supported the ministries or their employees (MFM and JBPL).Competing Interests:The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\ngathered during the mission that comprised a review of the evidence and control plans to date, compare them against the basic capacities of a comprehensive rabies programme, and discuss-the findings in the light of the elimination goal in the region by 2015.\n\n==Section one and intro==\nThe Context PAHO\u2019s regional programme of rabies control defines Haiti as a priority country, i.e., countries where canine rabies variants are either circulating or did so in the recent past. The context and capacities of priority countries are diverse, and efforts are undergoing to evaluate the best port-folio of actions to address country-specific limitations [2]. Brazil, for example, remains a priority country because of the persistent, albeit well-circumscribed, occurrence of dog-mediated human rabies in the northeast of the country, in the state of Maranhao [3]. Even with this occurrence,\n\n=='''Brazil'''==\nremains a successful example in the control of dog-mediated rabies, and constitutes an important technical reference in the region. With the aim of promoting south-to-south collaboration, the Ministry of Health of Brazil, the ministry solely responsible for the control of dog-transmitted rabies in the country, assisted PAHO\u2019s mission to Haiti. Specifically on rabies, Brazil has donated human and canine vaccines to Haiti in the past. One of the objectives of the PAHO mission was to explore ways to enhance this collaboration, for example, in the form of direct technical assistance on the ground. Such assistance would complement the activities currently conducted by the CDC.\n\nTo help with this basic capacity, the CDC has conveyed to the MSPP its willingness to assist in human sample collection, shipping of samples, and diagnostic testing at CDC\u2019s  rabies laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia, US. To date, only one sample has been shipped to the CDC, which tested negative for rabies.At a meeting during the mission, MSPP officials reported three human cases in 2013, eightin 2012, 13 in 2011, and one in 2010, all allegedly due to canine rabies. These numbers indicate severe under-reporting when compared with modeling figures that show Haiti as the main contributor of the estimated 200 human deaths by dog-transmitted rabies per year in the region[3]. The above structural limitations do not extend to animal samples that are analysed at the MARNDR rabies laboratory.\n\nTosupport the vaccination campaign, MARNDR is implementing a solar-powered cold chain(Fig 1), over and above the available cold chain facilities in MSPP field premises, previouslyused to support dog vaccination campaigns.\n==sec==\nOn this note, dogbites are now, together with six notifiable conditions, part of the daily reporting requirements from 114 health units (out of more than 900 in the country) to a central epidemiology unit in Port-au-Prince, the capital. This intensive reporting pressure on health officials should increase rabies awareness across the health system, and lead to an increase in the number of dog attacks reported. The aggregation of this information, analysis, and feedback to the sources on a regu-lar basis would further improve awareness among health officials of the rabies risks.As reported by health officials, 1,657 dog bites were recorded in 2013 by the 114 sentinelhealth centers. For a population of approximately 10 million people, this results in a 0.016% of the population bitten by dogs; five times lower than the 0.08% average reported by the coun-tries that attended the 14thmeeting of National Rabies Programme Managers (REDIPRA inSpanish) in Lima (Per\u00fa) in 2013 [7], and many more times lower than the 1.8% reported inother countries where canine rabies is also endemic [8]. Analyses of the number of animalaggressions reported by the public may inform the level of awareness within the populationwith regard to the risk of rabies. A simple and short questionnaire about the motivation of thevisit by the dog bitten patient, i.e., whether it was related to fear of rabies, could be administeredto refine this inference. Further checks on the quality of the data should help explain apparentreporting artifacts, such as the fact that all registered victims of dog attacks were five years oldor older, a finding that challenges results elsewhere that consistently report young children asPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20154 / 10\n\n==chidren==\nthe main victims of dog bites [9,10,11]. The surveillance artifact may hide greater under-reporting of rabies cases if this population group is not captured by the bite registration mecha-nisms, and should trigger questions as to where do children younger than five years old go forbite treatment.At the time of the review, the MSPP had more than 15,000 doses of human vaccine for PEPin stock. These vaccines belonged to a lot of 20,000 Vero cell rabies vaccines for intramuscularadministration donated by Brazil in 2013. This volume of vaccine should be enough to coverthe needs of the country for at least two years given the current use rate of 8,000 doses per year.In addition to sufficient numbers, vaccine must be stored in adequate conditions and in such away that allows its prompt availability across the country.\n\nA national consultant hired byPAHO/Haiti visited twelve sites in Port-au-Prince during the last months of 2013 and reportedadequate cold chain. We had no data about the conditions outside the capital.At an annual use rate of 8,000 human vaccine doses (as per PAHO/Haiti\u2019s warehouse rec-ords), the country could face a surplus of several thousand doses by the end of their shelf life inearly 2015. Solutions to the adequate use of this potential excess of vaccine, before they reachtheir expiration date, might contemplate increasing the distribution of vaccine to areas where itis not currently available, e.g., outside the capital. According to MSPP officials, all large hospi-tals in the country (between 40 and 50) had stocks of human vaccine. Ensuring that vaccineFig 1.

MSPPofficials confirmed that they do not record this key performance indicator. At the time of the mission, the amount and availability of any stock of immunoglobulin was not ascertained.Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis The 2013 WHO expert consultation on rabies report [3] indicates the administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis for those populations at continuous or high risk of rabies, especially children. Although the current stock of vaccine could support such strategy, and indirectly reduce the potential surplus of vaccine by 2015, the logistics of the distribution, rationale for application, and the required follow-up would make this operation impossible given the current avail-able resources.Outbreak Control Activities This capacity comprises surveillance, awareness raising, and control specific activities, within a defined time and space context, implemented following the confirmation of a case of rabies.These can include enhanced surveillance of animal populations at risk, ring vaccination, and awareness campaigns for the population. The rabies national plan provides protocols to guarantee the exchange of information between MSPP and the MARNDR after the occurrence of rabies events.\n\nFor example, the communication of dog attacks by the MSPP to the MARNDR, for the latter to initiate surveillance and control activities, occurs after a number of dog attacks are recorded for a specific area. At the time of this review, it was not possible to ascertain the criteria, e.g., number of dogs and period of time that trigger this communication, nor was it possible to verify the completeness of epidemiological reports around the cases.Reactive vaccination of susceptible animals after confirmation of rabies within the local community is also part of these case control activities, however, the amount of canine vaccine available for this purpose at the time of the mission, around 1,000 doses, appeared insufficient. Education Rabies educational capacity comprises activities towards health professionals and the general public to enhance and maintain awareness of rabies risks.\n\n==sec==\n\nTo this end, the MSPP conducted a training activity for 40 health officials of the central region on PEP in 2013. This training fol-lowed four similar courses delivered in 2012. It was not possible to ascertain if these activities were all part of a training plan.MSPP and PAHO/Haiti officials stated the critical importance of training for health official son PEP, data form completion, etc., and stressed the ongoing need for these activities given thehigh staff turnover. Training on PEP application should help to change the current practice of delaying prophylaxis after exposure if the animal can be observed. This practice can lead to fatal delays [3] and it needs to be replaced with the immediate application of PEP after expo-sure even if the animal can be observed.For MARNDR officials, there are currently no training plans, although the CDC trained more than 30 veterinary officials in June 2013, and delivers regular training to personnel of theMARNDR laboratory responsible for rabies diagnosis.Identification of Other Risks Cases of canine rabies together with the significant numbers of mongoose cases reported from the Dominican Republic could be seen as a threat to Haiti\u2019s rabies status [7]. Despite this beinga genuine concern, and an indication of a source of rabies in Haiti\u2019s wildlife, it is not high in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20156 / 10\n\nthe list of priorities given the many limitations affecting the other capacities. Any medium- orlong-term strategy in the future must contemplate the wildlife source. In the short term, enhanced communication and coordination of control efforts with the neighbouring Domini-can Republic would bring benefits to the two countries.DiscussionDespite having a National Rabies Plan for the period 2007\u20132012, and an evaluation of it in 2011, little of the plan could be delivered due to insufficient resources at the MSPP andMARNDR. Whereas in other countries in the region the main interest resides on how rabiescontrol activities are operationalised, as the focus is on the optimization of well-establishedprocesses, in Haiti this is not the case, as some basic rabies capacities are still wanting. This istrue for the episodic mass canine vaccination campaigns, and the lack of diagnostic facilitiesfor human rabies cases. Given that canine vaccination is the most effective measure to controldog-mediated human rabies, the intermittent nature of the mass campaigns and their insuffi-cient coverage will not allow for the control of the disease any time soon, let alone itselimination.The inconsistent and insufficient canine vaccination campaigns will also stop short of deliv-ering a number of related positive effects associated with vaccination, e.g., increased awarenessin the population due to the high visibility of the campaigns, and a sense of purpose among theofficials responsible for rabies control. Not only that, the ongoing occurrence of dog cases dueto low levels of immunity in the population, despite large logistic efforts, can easily lead to frus-tration among officials and hamper participation by the population [12].Following recommendations from the 14thREDIPRA meeting [7] canine rabies vaccine hasbeen recently added to PAHO\u2019s Revolving Fund (RF). Countries in the region can now requestcanine vaccine from the RF.\n\n==sec==\nDespite the advantages provided by the inclusion of the caninevaccine in the RF, e.g., consistent vaccine quality and more competitive prices, the evidence tosupport the allocation of funds within the MSPP and MARNDR to purchase rabies vaccine isnot sufficient. This evidence can only be gathered by means of adequate surveillance to informthe burden of rabies against that of other diseases.Although there are models that estimate a much larger number of human rabies cases inHaiti [3], these cases remain unobserved, and lead to no reaction by the already overstretchedand under-resourced Haitian health system. This appears logical as the impact of these esti-mated, but unobserved, cases is difficult to demonstrate relative to that of other conditions thatprovide counts of actual data and lead to health care expenditure. Disease estimates adjustedfor under-ascertainment trigger little policy action [13], at least at the operational level, and arenot a substitute for actual surveillance data. The dog surveillance work conducted by theMARNDR with technical support by the CDC is, therefore, critical. Short of reliable records onthe real count of human rabies cases, measures of rabies risk approximated by the dog surveil-lance figures, in combination with dog bite data, can provide an indication of the much higherlevel of rabies exposure in the population.Surveillance findings need to be disseminated to attain their objective: inform and influencedecision, at as many levels as possible. There is value in reporting back to the sources of data for awareness and motivation reasons, to local authorities to inform strategic and operationaldecisions pertaining to the rabies programme, and to international forums to raise awareness about the situation in Haiti. To this end, Haiti should return to the regular reporting of surveil-lance figures and details of the cases to the regional database on rabies (SIRVERA) held atPANAFTOSA [6]. By having up-to-date data by country and aggregated figures, PAHO canreport progress towards the goal of elimination in the region, and identify countries in need ofPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20157 / 10\n\n==sec==\n\ngreater focus, such as Haiti. At this critical stage in the race to elimination, with fewer cases and diminishing resources and available skill pool in the region, collecting and sharing as much information as possible on the epidemiology and, critically, on the processes leading to the surveillance and control of the disease remains as important as ever.Following from the recommendations of the last REDIPRA meeting [7], PAHO coordinated in 2014 a proficiency exercise for 35 laboratories from 23 countries to assess regional consistency in direct fluorescent antibody techniques.\n\nHaiti\u2019s MARNDR reference laboratory has participated in this exercise. This shows the commitment of the Haitian authorities to improve their processes. This willingness should be extended to seek the utilization of the MARNDR laboratory premises for the diagnoses of human rabies cases, over and above legitimate administrative and organizational concerns. On this note, as of July 2014, there is discussion about developing a plan for a joint human and animal rabies diagnostic facility in the North Depart-ment. If successful, this will represent the second animal rabies diagnostic facility and first human rabies diagnostic facility in the country. The initiative to create a joint human/animal rabies diagnostic laboratory would maximize the use of the limited human resource and infra-structure capital. Given the current low recognition of human rabies, and the fact that the majority of routine diagnostic testing will be on animal samples, it is not feasible to create diagnostic facility solely devoted to human diagnostics, nor train personnel in human rabies diagnostics alone.\n\n==Brazil again==\nThe Brazilian Ministry of Health is willing to help Haiti by extending its donations of vaccine to on-field technical support.  This includes aiding areas that are planning vaccine campaigns, administering PEP training, and more. This contribution will add to the increasing need for a strategic framework with clear objectives like controlling dog-mediated rabies first to ensure the efficient elimination of dog mediated human cases, and coordination between donors. The impact of missions like this appears reduced in terms of observing rapid changes in response to limitations that are well known by the local officials.\n\nThe benefit could come in the form of notes like this and their dissemination:to increase awareness among international donors, senior authorities in Haiti, and within PAHO. A planned communication campaign is just one of the activities contained in the strategic document, being drafted at the time of writing, to support a rabies task force in Haiti. Keyto this strategy, and responding to a critical lack of this capacity, is the need for coordination among the multiple partners that deliver rabies activities in Haiti. Better integration among partners should lead to greater impact and more efficient use of resources. Coordination and speaking with one voice before Haitian authorities would also increase the critical mass of rabies control efforts and deliver a more consistent and rotund message. The funding of a rabies coordinator/rabies champion, who will work primarily towards ensuring regular and sufficient canine vaccination campaigns and prompt availability of human vaccine for the next two to three years, is being discussed at the time of writing.\n\nThe current situation in Haiti clearly impacts the region\u2019s 2015 elimination goal [1] as it was not achieved. The countries of the region will have to make a new goal that recognizes the distinct situations across the region. Most of the areas where dog-mediated human rabies is no longer a public health problem will benefit from efficiency gains and enhanced knowledge management to ensure institutional memory and experience dissemination. These efforts should also benefit the reduced number of countries and areas, such as Haiti, where rabies remains a public health concern. Specific plans for dog rabies control, such as those described above, will require contributions from a number of regional partners and neighboring countries. The PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | DOI:10.1371/journal.pntd.0003806 June 25, 20158 / 10\n\n==sec==\n\nforthcoming 2015 REDIPRA meeting will provide the platform to hold these discussions and agree on a new regional goal.A general limitation of the findings described here is that they originate from unstructured questions, observations, and notes from meetings and field visits. A more comprehensive plat-form to collect precise information on the levels of performance within the capacities, as well as on process-related indicators, is the subject of current work by PANAFTOSA.-->\n\n<ref name=\"FenelonDely2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Fenelon|first1=N.|last2=Dely|first2=P.|last3=Katz|first3=M.

On October 7, 1999, WFMF returned as the call sign and the name \"102.5 WFMF\" was resurrected a short time later.\n\nSince being bought by Capstar, WFMF has been through several owners as a result of buyouts.  Capstar was purchased by Chancellor Media in 1998 (and renamed AMFM Communications), which in turn was purchased by [[Clear Channel Communications]] in 2000.  In 2014, Clear Channel switched its name to [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]\n\n==HD radio==\nAn [[Ibiquity]]-licensed station, WFMF began broadcasting an [[HD Radio]] signal in August 2007.

Officially established on 15 May 1910, the club played as ''St. Pauli TV'' in the [[Kreisliga]] Gro\u00df-Hamburg (Alsterkreis) until 1924, when a separate football side called St. Pauli was formed. The team played as an undistinguished lower-to-mid table side until making their first appearance in 1934 in the top-flight [[Gauliga Nordmark]], 1 of 16 premier level divisions created in the re-organization of German football that took place under the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. They were immediately relegated, but returned to the top flight in 1936. Relegated again in 1940, St. Pauli re-appeared in the [[Gauliga]] Hamburg in 1942, and played there until the end of [[World War II]].\n\n===Post-war football===\n[[File:St. Pauli Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of St Pauli league performance after WWII]]\nAfter the war, the club resumed play in the [[Oberliga Nord]] in 1947. A second-place finish in the 1947\u201348 season led St. Pauli to its first appearance in the national championship rounds. They advanced as far as the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 2\u20133 by eventual champions [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]]. The club continued to play well throughout the early 1950s, but were unable to overtake rivals [[Hamburger SV]], finishing in second place in five of the next seven seasons, and going out in the early rounds in each of their championship-round appearances from 1949 to 1951. In the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, St. Pauli were overtaken by rivals such as [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] and [[VfL Osnabr\u00fcck]], but finished fourth a number of times.\n\n===Promotion to the Bundesliga===\nIn 1963, the [[Bundesliga]] \u2013 West Germany's new top-flight professional league \u2013 was formed. Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen, and [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] joined the new circuit as the top-finishers from the Oberliga Nord, while St. Pauli found themselves in the second-tier Regionalliga Nord.\n\nNearly a decade-and-a-half of frustration followed. St. Pauli won their division in 1964, but finished bottom of their group in the promotion play-off round. They took their next Regionalliga Nord title in 1966 and, while they performed far better in the play-offs, still failed to advance to the top-flight, losing out to [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] on goal difference, having conceded two more goals. Division championships in 1972 and 1973, and runner-up finishes in 1971 and 1974, were each followed by promotion-round play-off disappointment.\n\nThe success of the Bundesliga, and the growth of professional football in West Germany, led to the formation of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974. St. Pauli was part of the new second-tier professional circuit in the 2. Bundesliga Nord and in 1977, they finally advanced to the top flight as winners of their division. The team survived just one season at the highest level in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe club's return to the 2. Bundesliga Nord was also short-lived. On the verge on bankruptcy in 1979, they were denied a license for the following season and were sent down to the [[Oberliga (football)|Oberliga Nord (III)]]. Strong performances that set the team atop that division in 1981 and 1983 were marred by poor financial health. By 1984, the club had recovered sufficiently to return to the 2. Bundesliga, overtaking Werder Bremen's amateur side who, despite finishing two points ahead of St. Pauli, were ineligible for promotion.\n\n===\"Kult\" phenomenon===\n[[File:Stpauli.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Skull and crossbones symbol on a supporter flag.]]\nIt was in the mid-1980s that St. Pauli's transition from a standard traditional club into a \"[[cult following|Kult]]\" club began. The club was also able to turn the location of its ground in the dock area part of town, near Hamburg's famous [[Reeperbahn]] \u2013 centre of the city's night life and its [[red-light district]] \u2013 to its advantage. An alternative fan scene slowly emerged, built around [[left-wing politics|left-leaning politics]], [[activism|social activism]] and the event and party atmosphere of the club's matches. Supporters adopted the [[Jolly Roger|skull and crossbones]] as their own unofficial emblem. St. Pauli became the first team in Germany to officially ban [[nationalism#Varieties|right-wing nationalist activities]] and displays in its stadium in an era when fascist-inspired [[football hooliganism]] threatened the game across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freedompress.org.uk/news/2010/05/16/fc-st-pauli-pirates-of-the-league/ |title=St Pauli: Pirates of the League |publisher=Freedom Press |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref> In 1981, the team was averaging small crowds of only 1,600 spectators, but by the late 1990s they were frequently selling out their entire 20,000-capacity ground.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of FC St.Pauli|url=http://rebelultras.com/2014/02/10/history-of-fc-st-pauli/|website=Rebel Ultras|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe skull and crossbones symbol had always been associated with St Pauli (the city quarter) in one way or another. Hamburg fostered the most famous pirate of Germany, [[Klaus St\u00f6rtebeker]], and the symbol had been used by the 1980s squatters at [[Hafenstra\u00dfe]]. However, the one who should be credited with finally bringing the symbol to the terraces is probably Doc Mabuse, the singer of a Hamburg punk band. As the legend tells, he first grabbed the flag from a stall while passing drunk through the [[Hamburger Dom|Dom]] on his way to the Millerntor-Stadion.<ref>Hesse, Ulrich (2010), ''Bakom Helvetets Portar'', Offside, Number 6, Offside Press AB, p 110-111.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the media in Germany began to recognize the ''Kult''-image of the club, focusing on the [[punk ideologies|punk]] part of the fan-base in TV broadcasts of the matches. By this time, the media also started to establish nicknames like \"''Freibeuter der Liga''\" (\"[[Buccaneer]]s of the League\") as well as the satirical \"''das Freudenhaus der Liga''\" (\"Brothel of the League\", literally \"House of Joy\").\n\nSt. Pauli moved in and out of the Bundesliga over the course of the next dozen years: the club was narrowly relegated to the Oberliga in the 1984\u201385 season, but won the 1985\u201386 championship and returned to 2. Bundesliga. Two increasingly strong years followed, resulting in promotion and three seasons in the Bundesliga, from 1988 to 1991. Four seasons followed in 2. Bundesliga, and then another two in the Bundesliga In 1995 to 1997, before another return to the 2. Bundesliga.\n\n===Into the new millennium===\n[[File:Millerntor budapester 2009.JPG|right|thumb|The new South Tribune of the [[Millerntor-Stadion]], seen from Budapester Stra\u00dfe.]]\n[[File:FC St. Pauli logo.svg|thumb|150px|Former logo]]\nUntil 2010, the club's most recent appearance in the top-flight had been a single-season cameo in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. A win against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], the reigning [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] winners, led to the popular \"''Weltpokalsiegerbesieger''\" (\"World Club Champion beaters\") shirts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brux|first1=Sven|title=CLUB HISTORY|url=https://www.fcstpauli.com/en/club/history/|website=fcstpauli.com|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> However, the team finished last in the league, partly because the management did not trust the team which surprisingly won the promotion in 2001, but rather spent the additional money from Bundesliga TV contracts and advertisements on expensive but disappointing players.{{Original research inline|date=May 2010}} After the relegation to the 2. Bundesliga, only a skeleton of the successful 2001 team remained. The [[2002\u201303 2. Bundesliga|2002\u201303 season]] ended up in chaos, with the team fighting relegation (ultimately in vain) from the very beginning, various coaches departing and other problems internal to the club.\n\nWith the club almost bankrupt again and the less-lucrative [[Regionalliga (football)|Regionaliga Nord (III)]] looming, the club began its fund-raising activities, the so-called \"''Retteraktion''\". They printed [[t-shirt]]s with the club's crest surrounded by the word ''Retter'' (\"rescuer/saviour\") and more than 140,000 were sold within six weeks. They also organized a lucrative benefit game, against Bayern Munich, to raise funds to save the club.\n\nThe club has also been active in terms of charity and in 2005 the club, the team and the fans initiated the [[Viva con Agua de Sankt Pauli]] campaign, which collects money for water-dispensers for schools in [[Cuba]], for clean water in [[Rwanda]] et cetera.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 2. Bundesliga|2005\u201306 season]], the team enjoyed unprecedented success in the [[DFB-Pokal]], with wins over [[SV Wacker Burghausen|Burghausen]], [[VfL Bochum]] and, significantly, Bundesliga sides [[Hertha BSC]] and, in the quarter-finals on 25 January 2006, Werder Bremen. Their 3\u20131 victory in front of a sell-out Millerntor crowd, and their subsequent place in the DFB Cup semi-final, netted the club approximately \u20ac1&nbsp;million in TV and sponsorship money, going a long way to saving the club from immediate financial ruin.\n\nSt. Pauli finally went out of the cup to Bayern Munich on 12 April, going down 3\u20130 with a goal from [[Owen Hargreaves]] and two from [[Claudio Pizarro]]. Coincidentally, Bayern were also St. Pauli's opponents and dispatchers in the first round of [[2006\u201307 DFB-Pokal|the following season's cup]].\n\nAfter success in the 2006\u201307 season, the team was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. After defeating [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]] in the [[2009\u201310 2. Bundesliga|2009\u201310 season]], the team secured promotion back to the Bundesliga for the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]]. On 16 February 2011, during the 2010\u201311 season and for the first time since 1977, St Pauli defeated their bitter cross-city rivals Hamburger SV away at the [[Volksparkstadion]] courtesy of a [[Gerald Asamoah]] goal. The team, however, finished the domestic season in last place, resulting in their relegation to the 2. Bundesliga for the [[2011\u201312 2. Bundesliga|2011\u201312 season]]. Since then, the club has remained in the 2. Bundesliga, finishing fourth in 2011\u201312 but declining in results since then.\n\n==Honours==\n===League===\n* '''[[2.

The Fundamental Principles were passed by an overwhelming majority at the St. Pauli Congress in 2009 and they go beyond solely football.\n\nThe first five Principles states that:\n\n\u2013 ''\"In its totality, consisting of members, staff, fans and honorary officers, St. Pauli FC is a part of the society by which it is surrounded and so is affected both directly and indirectly by social changes in the political, cultural and social spheres.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"St. Pauli FC is conscious of the social responsibility this implies, and represents the interests of its members, staff, fans and honorary officers in matters not just restricted to the sphere of sport.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"St. Pauli FC is the club of a particular city district, and it is to this that it owes its identity. This gives it a social and political responsibility in relation to the district and the people who live there.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"St. Pauli FC aims to put across a certain feeling for life and symbolises sporting authenticity. This makes it possible for people to identify with the club independently of any sporting successes it may achieve. Essential features of the club that encourage this sense of identification are to be honoured, promoted and preserved.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"Tolerance and respect in mutual human relations are important pillars of the'' St. Pauli philosophy.''\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fcstpauli.com/en/club/guiding-principles/ |title=Principles \u2013 FC St. Pauli |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\nThe home venue of the FC St Pauli is the [[Millerntor-Stadion]]. Work on the stadium began in 1961, but its completion was delayed until 1963 as there was initially no drainage system in place, making the pitch unplayable after rain. It originally held 32,000 supporters, but the capacity was later reduced for safety reasons.\n\nIn 1970, the stadium was renamed the Wilhelm Koch-Stadium in honour of a former club president. However, this name became highly controversial when it was discovered that Wilhelm Koch had been a member of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] during the war. After protests by fans, the name was changed back to Millerntor-Stadion in 1999.\n\nA total redevelopment began in 2006. The final phase of the redevelopment work ended with the completion of the new north stand in July 2015.

Officially established on 15 May 1910, the club played as ''St. Pauli TV'' in the [[Kreisliga]] Gro\u00df-Hamburg (Alsterkreis) until 1924, when a separate football side called St. Pauli was formed. The team played as an undistinguished lower-to-mid table side until making their first appearance in 1934 in the top-flight [[Gauliga Nordmark]], 1 of 16 premier level divisions created in the re-organization of German football that took place under the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. They were immediately relegated, but returned to the top flight in 1936. Relegated again in 1940, St. Pauli re-appeared in the [[Gauliga]] Hamburg in 1942, and played there until the end of [[World War II]].\n\n===Post-war football===\n[[File:St. Pauli Performance Chart.png|260px|thumb|Historical chart of St Pauli league performance after WWII]]\nAfter the war, the club resumed play in the [[Oberliga Nord]] in 1947. A second-place finish in the 1947\u201348 season led St. Pauli to its first appearance in the national championship rounds. They advanced as far as the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 2\u20133 by eventual champions [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]]. The club continued to play well throughout the early 1950s, but were unable to overtake rivals [[Hamburger SV]], finishing in second place in five of the next seven seasons, and going out in the early rounds in each of their championship-round appearances from 1949 to 1951. In the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, St. Pauli were overtaken by rivals such as [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] and [[VfL Osnabr\u00fcck]], but finished fourth a number of times.\n\n===Promotion to the Bundesliga===\nIn 1963, the [[Bundesliga]] \u2013 West Germany's new top-flight professional league \u2013 was formed. Hamburger SV, Werder Bremen, and [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] joined the new circuit as the top-finishers from the Oberliga Nord, while St. Pauli found themselves in the second-tier Regionalliga Nord.\n\nNearly a decade-and-a-half of frustration followed. St. Pauli won their division in 1964, but finished bottom of their group in the promotion play-off round. They took their next Regionalliga Nord title in 1966 and, while they performed far better in the play-offs, still failed to advance to the top-flight, losing out to [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] on goal difference, having conceded two more goals. Division championships in 1972 and 1973, and runner-up finishes in 1971 and 1974, were each followed by promotion-round play-off disappointment.\n\nThe success of the Bundesliga, and the growth of professional football in West Germany, led to the formation of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974. St. Pauli was part of the new second-tier professional circuit in the 2. Bundesliga Nord and in 1977, they finally advanced to the top flight as winners of their division. The team survived just one season at the highest level in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe club's return to the 2. Bundesliga Nord was also short-lived. On the verge on bankruptcy in 1979, they were denied a license for the following season and were sent down to the [[Oberliga (football)|Oberliga Nord (III)]]. Strong performances that set the team atop that division in 1981 and 1983 were marred by poor financial health. By 1984, the club had recovered sufficiently to return to the 2. Bundesliga, overtaking Werder Bremen's amateur side who, despite finishing two points ahead of St. Pauli, were ineligible for promotion.\n\n===\"Kult\" phenomenon===\n[[File:Stpauli.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Skull and crossbones symbol on a supporter flag.]]\nIt was in the mid-1980s that St. Pauli's transition from a standard traditional club into a \"[[cult following|Kult]]\" club began. The club was also able to turn the location of its ground in the dock area part of town, near Hamburg's famous [[Reeperbahn]] \u2013 centre of the city's night life and its [[red-light district]] \u2013 to its advantage. An alternative fan scene slowly emerged, built around [[left-wing politics|left-leaning politics]], [[activism|social activism]] and the event and party atmosphere of the club's matches. Supporters adopted the [[Jolly Roger|skull and crossbones]] as their own unofficial emblem. St. Pauli became the first team in Germany to officially ban [[nationalism#Varieties|right-wing nationalist activities]] and displays in its stadium in an era when fascist-inspired [[football hooliganism]] threatened the game across Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freedompress.org.uk/news/2010/05/16/fc-st-pauli-pirates-of-the-league/ |title=St Pauli: Pirates of the League |publisher=Freedom Press |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=17 May 2014}}</ref> In 1981, the team was averaging small crowds of only 1,600 spectators, but by the late 1990s they were frequently selling out their entire 20,000-capacity ground.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of FC St.Pauli|url=http://rebelultras.com/2014/02/10/history-of-fc-st-pauli/|website=Rebel Ultras|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe skull and crossbones symbol had always been associated with St Pauli (the city quarter) in one way or another. Hamburg fostered the most famous pirate of Germany, [[Klaus St\u00f6rtebeker]], and the symbol had been used by the 1980s squatters at [[Hafenstra\u00dfe]]. However, the one who should be credited with finally bringing the symbol to the terraces is probably Doc Mabuse, the singer of a Hamburg punk band. As the legend tells, he first grabbed the flag from a stall while passing drunk through the [[Hamburger Dom|Dom]] on his way to the Millerntor-Stadion.<ref>Hesse, Ulrich (2010), ''Bakom Helvetets Portar'', Offside, Number 6, Offside Press AB, p 110-111.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the media in Germany began to recognize the ''Kult''-image of the club, focusing on the [[punk ideologies|punk]] part of the fan-base in TV broadcasts of the matches. By this time, the media also started to establish nicknames like \"''Freibeuter der Liga''\" (\"[[Buccaneer]]s of the League\") as well as the satirical \"''das Freudenhaus der Liga''\" (\"Brothel of the League\", literally \"House of Joy\").\n\nSt. Pauli moved in and out of the Bundesliga over the course of the next dozen years: the club was narrowly relegated to the Oberliga in the 1984\u201385 season, but won the 1985\u201386 championship and returned to 2. Bundesliga. Two increasingly strong years followed, resulting in promotion and three seasons in the Bundesliga, from 1988 to 1991. Four seasons followed in 2. Bundesliga, and then another two in the Bundesliga In 1995 to 1997, before another return to the 2. Bundesliga.\n\n===Into the new millennium===\n[[File:Millerntor budapester 2009.JPG|right|thumb|The new South Tribune of the [[Millerntor-Stadion]], seen from Budapester Stra\u00dfe.]]\n[[File:FC St. Pauli logo.svg|thumb|150px|Former logo]]\nUntil 2010, the club's most recent appearance in the top-flight had been a single-season cameo in [[2001\u201302 Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. A win against [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], the reigning [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] winners, led to the popular \"''Weltpokalsiegerbesieger''\" (\"World Club Champion beaters\") shirts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brux|first1=Sven|title=CLUB HISTORY|url=https://www.fcstpauli.com/en/club/history/|website=fcstpauli.com|accessdate=15 February 2017}}</ref> However, the team finished last in the league, partly because the management did not trust the team which surprisingly won the promotion in 2001, but rather spent the additional money from Bundesliga TV contracts and advertisements on expensive but disappointing players.{{Original research inline|date=May 2010}} After the relegation to the 2. Bundesliga, only a skeleton of the successful 2001 team remained. The [[2002\u201303 2. Bundesliga|2002\u201303 season]] ended up in chaos, with the team fighting relegation (ultimately in vain) from the very beginning, various coaches departing and other problems internal to the club.\n\nWith the club almost bankrupt again and the less-lucrative [[Regionalliga (football)|Regionaliga Nord (III)]] looming, the club began its fund-raising activities, the so-called \"''Retteraktion''\". They printed [[t-shirt]]s with the club's crest surrounded by the word ''Retter'' (\"rescuer/saviour\") and more than 140,000 were sold within six weeks. They also organized a lucrative benefit game, against Bayern Munich, to raise funds to save the club.\n\nThe club has also been active in terms of charity and in 2005 the club, the team and the fans initiated the [[Viva con Agua de Sankt Pauli]] campaign, which collects money for water-dispensers for schools in [[Cuba]], for clean water in [[Rwanda]] et cetera.\n\nDuring the [[2005\u201306 2. Bundesliga|2005\u201306 season]], the team enjoyed unprecedented success in the [[DFB-Pokal]], with wins over [[SV Wacker Burghausen|Burghausen]], [[VfL Bochum]] and, significantly, Bundesliga sides [[Hertha BSC]] and, in the quarter-finals on 25 January 2006, Werder Bremen. Their 3\u20131 victory in front of a sell-out Millerntor crowd, and their subsequent place in the DFB Cup semi-final, netted the club approximately \u20ac1&nbsp;million in TV and sponsorship money, going a long way to saving the club from immediate financial ruin.\n\nSt. Pauli finally went out of the cup to Bayern Munich on 12 April, going down 3\u20130 with a goal from [[Owen Hargreaves]] and two from [[Claudio Pizarro]]. Coincidentally, Bayern were also St. Pauli's opponents and dispatchers in the first round of [[2006\u201307 DFB-Pokal|the following season's cup]].\n\nAfter success in the 2006\u201307 season, the team was promoted to the 2. Bundesliga. After defeating [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]] in the [[2009\u201310 2. Bundesliga|2009\u201310 season]], the team secured promotion back to the Bundesliga for the [[2010\u201311 Bundesliga|2010\u201311 season]]. On 16 February 2011, during the 2010\u201311 season and for the first time since 1977, St Pauli defeated their bitter cross-city rivals Hamburger SV away at the [[Volksparkstadion]] courtesy of a [[Gerald Asamoah]] goal. The team, however, finished the domestic season in last place, resulting in their relegation to the 2. Bundesliga for the [[2011\u201312 2. Bundesliga|2011\u201312 season]]. Since then, the club has remained in the 2. Bundesliga, finishing fourth in 2011\u201312 but declining in results since then.\n\n==Honours==\n===League===\n* '''[[2.

The Fundamental Principles were passed by an overwhelming majority at the St. Pauli Congress in 2009 and they go beyond solely football.\n\nThe first five Principles states that:\n\n\u2013 ''\"In its totality, consisting of members, staff, fans and honorary officers, St. Pauli FC is a part of the society by which it is surrounded and so is affected both directly and indirectly by social changes in the political, cultural and social spheres.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"St. Pauli FC is conscious of the social responsibility this implies, and represents the interests of its members, staff, fans and honorary officers in matters not just restricted to the sphere of sport.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"St. Pauli FC is the club of a particular city district, and it is to this that it owes its identity. This gives it a social and political responsibility in relation to the district and the people who live there.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"St. Pauli FC aims to put across a certain feeling for life and symbolises sporting authenticity. This makes it possible for people to identify with the club independently of any sporting successes it may achieve. Essential features of the club that encourage this sense of identification are to be honoured, promoted and preserved.\"''\n\n\u2013 ''\"Tolerance and respect in mutual human relations are important pillars of the'' St. Pauli philosophy.''\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fcstpauli.com/en/club/guiding-principles/ |title=Principles \u2013 FC St. Pauli |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stadium==\nThe home venue of the FC St Pauli is the [[Millerntor-Stadion]]. Work on the stadium began in 1961, but its completion was delayed until 1963 as there was initially no drainage system in place, making the pitch unplayable after rain. It originally held 32,000 supporters, but the capacity was later reduced for safety reasons.\n\nIn 1970, the stadium was renamed the Wilhelm Koch-Stadium in honour of a former club president. However, this name became highly controversial when it was discovered that Wilhelm Koch had been a member of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] during the war. After protests by fans, the name was changed back to Millerntor-Stadion in 1999.\n\nA total redevelopment began in 2006. The final phase of the redevelopment work ended with the completion of the new north stand in July 2015.
