The popular vote was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President.\n\nMissouri's participation in the election was a point of political dispute. On March 9, 1820, Congress had passed a law directing Missouri to hold a convention to form a constitution and a state government. This law stated that \"the said state, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union, upon an equal footing with the original states, in all respects whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=Act of March 6, ch. 23, vol. 3 |title=United States Statutes at Large |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845)) |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |year=1820 |pages=545\u2013548}}</ref> However, when Congress reconvened in November 1820, the admission of Missouri became an issue of contention. Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire. He argued that since Missouri had not yet officially become a state, it had no right to cast any electoral votes. Immediately, Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] of Virginia argued that Missouri's votes must be counted.

Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire. He argued that since Missouri had not yet officially become a state, it had no right to cast any electoral votes. Immediately, Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] of Virginia argued that Missouri's votes must be counted. Chaos ensued, and order was restored only with the counting of the vote as per the resolution and then adjournment for the day.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Gales and Seaton |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 14, 1821 |title=Annals of Congress |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1856 |pages=1147\u20131165}}</ref>\n\n==Popular candidates==\nExcluding two-campaign two-term presidents, including candidates who eventually lost\n* Franklin Roosevelt - 4 times (4 terms)\n* Grover Cleveland - 3 times (2 terms)\n* Martin Van Buren - 2 times (1 term)\n* William Jennings Bryan - 2 times (0 terms)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNeOTptSgKI County-by-county results since 1860]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n{{MissouriFederalElections}}\n\n{{United States presidential elections}}\n\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Missouri| ]]\n", "name_user": "MyPreferredUsernameWasTaken", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 951233751 byBD2412(talk) Not relevant)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_Missouri"}

Celebrations of carnival had been especially lively and drunken by Indians and castas.  The authorities' toleration in the earlier colonial period was replaced by a repression of this period of social inversion and role reversal.  Although there had been efforts to tamp down the festivities in the late seventeenth century, with the period under viceroy Don [[Juan de Acu\u00f1a]] the measures finally seemed to take hold; \"the viceroy stopped it in its tracks and it never recovered.\"<ref>Juan Pedro Viqueira Alb\u00e1n, ''Propriety and Permissiveness in Bourbon Mexico''.

From the late 19th century to the early 20th, the festival as a major public event has made something of a comeback in areas such as [[Veracruz]], northwestern Mexico and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.<ref name=\"eucaristia\"/> The large scale celebrations have mostly become divorced from their religious roots with commercialization in the latter 20th century.

Residents in neighborhoods just outside the city wall created new forms of music from European, African and indigenous traditions. The original major festival for these communities was [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] but eventually it shifted to Carnival. These early 18th century Carnival traditions with people in colorful costumes dancing to African-derived chuchumb\u00e9 rhythms provoked the disapproval of church officials. Despite this, the festival continued to evolve in the 19th into formal balls for the elite as well as street celebrations for the city's popular classes. Many of these events were held over a two-week period before Ash Wednesday. The celebrations were severely regulated and restricted during the [[French Intervention in Mexico]].\n\nIn the late 19th century, Liberals decided it was a vestige of colonialism and sought to eliminate it which made celebration of the event a private affair among the wealthy.<ref name=\"Brooklyn\">{{cite web |url= http://www.brooklynrail.org/2003/12/express/the-roots-of-carnival-in-veracruz-mexico|author= Andrew Grant Wood |title= The Roots of Carnival in Veracruz, Mexico |publisher=Brookyln Rail |location=New York |accessdate=November 22, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"agrantwood\">{{cite web|url=http://cdigital.uv.mx/bitstream/123456789/8953/1/Pages139-174.pdf |title=Carnaval en Veracruz: celebraciones p\u00fablicas, identidad y el inicio del turismo |last=Wood |first=Andrew Grant |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Carnival in Veracruz: public celebrations, identity and the beginnings of tourism |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406205126/http://cdigital.uv.mx/bitstream/123456789/8953/1/Pages139-174.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], carnival was re initiated in 1925 with a committee sponsored by the Alianza de Ferrocarrileros, the first citywide celebration of the event in about fifty years.

The authorities' toleration in the earlier colonial period was replaced by a repression of this period of social inversion and role reversal.  Although there had been efforts to tamp down the festivities in the late seventeenth century, with the period under viceroy Don [[Juan de Acu\u00f1a]] the measures finally seemed to take hold; \"the viceroy stopped it in its tracks and it never recovered.\"<ref>Juan Pedro Viqueira Alb\u00e1n, ''Propriety and Permissiveness in Bourbon Mexico''.

Residents in neighborhoods just outside the city wall created new forms of music from European, African and indigenous traditions. The original major festival for these communities was [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] but eventually it shifted to Carnival. These early 18th century Carnival traditions with people in colorful costumes dancing to African-derived chuchumb\u00e9 rhythms provoked the disapproval of church officials. Despite this, the festival continued to evolve in the 19th into formal balls for the elite as well as street celebrations for the city's popular classes. Many of these events were held over a two-week period before Ash Wednesday. The celebrations were severely regulated and restricted during the [[French Intervention in Mexico]].\n\nIn the late 19th century, Liberals decided it was a vestige of colonialism and sought to eliminate it which made celebration of the event a private affair among the wealthy.<ref name=\"Brooklyn\">{{cite web |url= http://www.brooklynrail.org/2003/12/express/the-roots-of-carnival-in-veracruz-mexico|author= Andrew Grant Wood |title= The Roots of Carnival in Veracruz, Mexico |publisher=Brookyln Rail |location=New York |accessdate=November 22, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"agrantwood\">{{cite web|url=http://cdigital.uv.mx/bitstream/123456789/8953/1/Pages139-174.pdf |title=Carnaval en Veracruz: celebraciones p\u00fablicas, identidad y el inicio del turismo |last=Wood |first=Andrew Grant |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Carnival in Veracruz: public celebrations, identity and the beginnings of tourism |accessdate=November 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406205126/http://cdigital.uv.mx/bitstream/123456789/8953/1/Pages139-174.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], carnival was re initiated in 1925 with a committee sponsored by the Alianza de Ferrocarrileros, the first citywide celebration of the event in about fifty years.

Costumes include various masks, depictions animals such as doves, and tiger hunts. Those in the tiger costume use mirrors for eyes.<ref name=\"ymascarn\"/> In [[Silacayoapan]] in the same state, the celebration began very simply. Dancers, restricted to men, dressed and use charcoal as make up to look like this coastal area's Afro Mexican population. If masks were used, they are simple structures made from gourds or [[Agave americana|maguey]] fronds. Since the latter 20th century on the celebration has evolved with a greater variety of costumes include men dressed as women, devils etc. Carnival always ends with a mock battle in the central plaza between two rival neighborhoods called Guadalupe and La Loma, throwing fruit and dried seeds.

Dances are done by men in costume, especially on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday generally as old men or as women. There has been some influence from modern carnivals and culture such as the appearance of costumes of North American origin.

She uses her power to emotionally connect with a hurting coworker, Simon, whom she has a crush on. Later, her gift allows her to communicate with her father for the first time in months. Zoey organizes a sailing trip to lift her father's spirits, and takes charge at work in dealing with a system [[software bug]]. This impresses her boss, Joan, who agrees to give her the promotion.

Out of desperation, she finishes the whole project herself, upsetting Joan, who is disappointed at her inability to be an effective manager. At home, Zoey's father sings \"[[Moondance (song)|Moondance]]\" to her mother. Zoey believes it's a sign he wants to get intimate. She tells her mother, who is delighted, since her husband, despite gaining more control over his muscle movements thanks to improved medication, is still unable to effectively communicate with her.

Despite the absences, a close match was expected, given both teams were traditional [[FIFA World Cup]] forces, sharing eight tournaments won and having previously met in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final]], where Brazil won 2\u20130 and earned their fifth title. This match, however, ended in a shocking loss for Brazil; Germany led 5\u20130 at half time, with four goals scored within six minutes, and subsequently brought the score up to 7\u20130 in the second half. Brazil scored a consolation goal in the last minute, ending the match 7\u20131. Germany's [[Toni Kroos]] was selected as the [[man of the match]].\n\nThe game marked several [[List of FIFA World Cup records|tournament records]]. Germany's win marked the largest margin of victory in a [[FIFA World Cup]] semi-final. The game saw Germany overtake Brazil as the highest scoring team in World Cup tournament history and become the first team to reach eight World Cup Finals. [[Miroslav Klose]] scored his 16th career World Cup goal and surpassed Brazil's own [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] as [[FIFA World Cup top goalscorers|the tournament's all-time record goalscorer]]. Brazil's loss broke their 62-match unbeaten streak at home in competitive matches, going back to the [[1975 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] (where they lost 3\u20131 to [[Peru national football team|Peru]]), equalled their biggest ever margin of defeat in a match alongside a [[1920 South American Championship#Matches|6\u20130 loss to Uruguay in 1920]], and broke the record for the most goals ever conceded by Brazil in an international match. Ultimately, the match was described as a national humiliation.\n\nThe game has subsequently been dubbed the '''''Mineirazo''''' ('''''Mineira\u00e7o''''' {{IPA-pt|minej\u02c8\u027easu|}}, ''Agony of Mineir\u00e3o''), evoking a previous \"[[Mongrel complex|spirit of national shame]]\" known as the ''[[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanazo]]'' (''Maracana\u00e7o'') in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] on home soil to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. Brazil subsequently lost 3\u20130 to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the third place play-off. Germany went on to win the World Cup for the fourth time, defeating [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Brazil vs. Chile in Mineir\u00e3o 05.jpg|thumb|upright|Brazil failed their appeal to rescind captain [[Thiago Silva]]'s suspension for the match.]]\n[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] was hosting the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the second time (first was [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]), and had won the tournament on five previous occasions.

Despite the absences, a close match was expected, given both teams were traditional [[FIFA World Cup]] forces, sharing eight tournaments won and having previously met in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final]], where Brazil won 2\u20130 and earned their fifth title. This match, however, ended in a shocking loss for Brazil; Germany led 5\u20130 at half time, with four goals scored within six minutes, and subsequently brought the score up to 7\u20130 in the second half. Brazil scored a consolation goal in the last minute, ending the match 7\u20131. Germany's [[Toni Kroos]] was selected as the [[man of the match]].\n\nThe game marked several [[List of FIFA World Cup records|tournament records]]. Germany's win marked the largest margin of victory in a [[FIFA World Cup]] semi-final. The game saw Germany overtake Brazil as the highest scoring team in World Cup tournament history and become the first team to reach eight World Cup Finals. [[Miroslav Klose]] scored his 16th career World Cup goal and surpassed Brazil's own [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] as [[FIFA World Cup top goalscorers|the tournament's all-time record goalscorer]]. Brazil's loss broke their 62-match unbeaten streak at home in competitive matches, going back to the [[1975 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] (where they lost 3\u20131 to [[Peru national football team|Peru]]), equalled their biggest ever margin of defeat in a match alongside a [[1920 South American Championship#Matches|6\u20130 loss to Uruguay in 1920]], and broke the record for the most goals ever conceded by Brazil in an international match. Ultimately, the match was described as a national humiliation.\n\nThe game has subsequently been dubbed the '''''Mineirazo''''' ('''''Mineira\u00e7o''''' {{IPA-pt|minej\u02c8\u027easu|}}, ''Agony of Mineir\u00e3o''), evoking a previous \"[[Mongrel complex|spirit of national shame]]\" known as the ''[[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|Maracanazo]]'' (''Maracana\u00e7o'') in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] on home soil to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. Brazil subsequently lost 3\u20130 to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the third place play-off. Germany went on to win the World Cup for the fourth time, defeating [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Brazil vs. Chile in Mineir\u00e3o 05.jpg|thumb|upright|Brazil failed their appeal to rescind captain [[Thiago Silva]]'s suspension for the match.]]\n[[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] was hosting the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the second time (first was [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]]), and had won the tournament on five previous occasions.
