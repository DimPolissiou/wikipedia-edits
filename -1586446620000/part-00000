She makes friends with Fay, who is initially wary of immigrants, Patty, who seeks more attention from her husband, and Magda, an immigrant from Slovenia who introduces her to her other European friends. Patty buys a pink nightdress that gets her the attention from her husband that she seeks, but he believes that he has upset her with his attention and disappears for the season. Magda invites Lisa and Fay to a New Year's Eve party at Magda's house and introduces Fay to Rudi, a Hungarian immigrant who is looking for a wife. Lisa is introduced to Michael, the son of Hungarian immigrants to Australia. A dress Lisa wants to buy is marked down from 150 guineas to 75 guineas during the next summer sale, then later to 50 guineas. Patty's husband returns and they reconcile when she explains that she wants his attention, and Patty soon becomes pregnant. Lisa gets honours on her school leaving exam and applies for a scholarship at Sydney University after getting the approval of her father. Rudi buys a new apartment and proposes to Fay in it. Lisa is upset that the dress she likes is no longer on display, but Magda has only hidden it away now that it has been reduced to 35 guineas, which Lisa can now afford. She buys the dress and wears it to a party celebrating her test scores. Magda says that she has picked out a location for a store where she will sell high-end fashion. Magda asks Lisa what she will do after finishing her studies at Sydney University and Lisa says that she wants to be an actress, or a poet, or a novelist, or maybe all three.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Julia Ormond]] as Magda\n* [[Angourie Rice]] as Lisa\n* [[Rachael Taylor]] as Fay\n* [[Ryan Corr]] as Rudi\n* [[Susie Porter]] as Mrs. Miles\n* [[Shane Jacobson]] as Mr. Miles\n* [[Noni Hazlehurst]] as Miss Cartwright\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as Mr. Ryder\n* Alison McGirr as Patty\n* [[Vincent Perez]] as Stefan\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n''Ladies in Black'' was twenty years in the making, with writer-director [[Bruce Beresford]] attached to the project.

Although not an officer of the law, he uses his skills from his former career as a successful, yet admittedly fraudulent, [[Mediumship|psychic medium]] to help a team of CBI agents solve murders. The real reason for Jane's involvement with law enforcement is to track down the [[serial killer]] known as [[Red John]], who was responsible for the brutal murders of his wife, Angela Ruskin Jane, and his daughter, Charlotte Anne Jane.\n\nBefore the murders, Jane had a lucrative career as a [[Confidence trick|con man]], successfully posing as a psychic medium and enjoyed near-celebrity status. Five years before the events in the show's pilot episode, he appeared on television to claim that his [[paranormal]] abilities helped the police [[Offender profiling|profile]] a serial killer named Red John. Red John, angered by the perceived slight, murdered Jane's wife and his young daughter in revenge.\n\nJane subsequently abandoned his career and teamed with the CBI, using his skills to help them solve various crimes. His main focus is on the cases involving Red John or Red John [[Copycat crime|copycats]]. He admits to faking the [[supernatural]] aspects of his skills, often asserting that \"there's no such thing as psychics,\" yet he has finely honed skills in [[cold reading]], [[hypnosis]], and [[picking pockets]], as well as his intuitive observations and an immense insight into the [[Psyche (psychology)|human psyche]] and the behavior of witnesses.\n\nHis associates at the CBI include colleagues [[Wayne Rigsby]], [[Grace Van Pelt]], and [[Kimball Cho]], and their boss, [[Teresa Lisbon]]. Various directors and recurring civilians come across as the show unfolds, including: Bret Stiles, Gale Bertram, Kristina Frye, Madeleine Hightower, JJ Laroche and Walter Mashburn.\n\nAs the show progresses, the focus shifts from general cases during seasons one to three, to solely catching Red John, throughout seasons four to six. At the midpoint of season six, the Red John case is solved, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] steps in, closing the CBI, and the show adopts a new track for two seasons, along with a few new characters. The show still focuses on case solving, together with emotional episodes.\n\n==Production==\nHaving developed [[Rome (TV series)|''Rome'']] for HBO, Heller was interested in doing something different and wanted to prove himself. CBS were looking for a show that would work as a companion to [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]], and Heller \nwelcomed the challenge of developing a popular show within the constraints of prime time network television and adapted his concept to fit.<ref>{{cite web |date= 28 November 2008 |last1= Bernhard |first1= Lisa |title= \u2018The Mentalist\u2019 on CBS Is a Hit, but What\u2019s Its Future? |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/arts/television/30bern.html |website= The New York Times }}</ref>\nHeller describes the character as being a combination of a Sherlock Holmes type and street psychic, part detective helping people and part con-artist selling people lies.

Although not an officer of the law, he uses his skills from his former career as a successful, yet admittedly fraudulent, [[Mediumship|psychic medium]] to help a team of CBI agents solve murders. The real reason for Jane's involvement with law enforcement is to track down the [[serial killer]] known as [[Red John]], who was responsible for the brutal murders of his wife, Angela Ruskin Jane, and his daughter, Charlotte Anne Jane.\n\nBefore the murders, Jane had a lucrative career as a [[Confidence trick|con man]], successfully posing as a psychic medium and enjoyed near-celebrity status. Five years before the events in the show's pilot episode, he appeared on television to claim that his [[paranormal]] abilities helped the police [[Offender profiling|profile]] a serial killer named Red John. Red John, angered by the perceived slight, murdered Jane's wife and his young daughter in revenge.\n\nJane subsequently abandoned his career and teamed with the CBI, using his skills to help them solve various crimes. His main focus is on the cases involving Red John or Red John [[Copycat crime|copycats]]. He admits to faking the [[supernatural]] aspects of his skills, often asserting that \"there's no such thing as psychics,\" yet he has finely honed skills in [[cold reading]], [[hypnosis]], and [[picking pockets]], as well as his intuitive observations and an immense insight into the [[Psyche (psychology)|human psyche]] and the behavior of witnesses.\n\nHis associates at the CBI include colleagues [[Wayne Rigsby]], [[Grace Van Pelt]], and [[Kimball Cho]], and their boss, [[Teresa Lisbon]]. Various directors and recurring civilians come across as the show unfolds, including: Bret Stiles, Gale Bertram, Kristina Frye, Madeleine Hightower, JJ Laroche and Walter Mashburn.\n\nAs the show progresses, the focus shifts from general cases during seasons one to three, to solely catching Red John, throughout seasons four to six. At the midpoint of season six, the Red John case is solved, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] steps in, closing the CBI, and the show adopts a new track for two seasons, along with a few new characters. The show still focuses on case solving, together with emotional episodes.\n\n==Production==\nHaving developed [[Rome (TV series)|''Rome'']] for HBO, Heller was interested in doing something different and wanted to prove himself. CBS were looking for a show that would work as a companion to [[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]], and Heller \nwelcomed the challenge of developing a popular show within the constraints of prime time network television and adapted his concept to fit.<ref>{{cite web |date= 28 November 2008 |last1= Bernhard |first1= Lisa |title= \u2018The Mentalist\u2019 on CBS Is a Hit, but What\u2019s Its Future? |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/arts/television/30bern.html |website= The New York Times }}</ref>\nHeller describes the character as being a combination of a Sherlock Holmes type and street psychic, part detective helping people and part con-artist selling people lies.

It was part of a subterranean [[bunker]] complex constructed in two phases in 1936 and 1944. It was the last of the [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] (''F\u00fchrerhauptquartiere'') used by [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]].\n\nHitler took up residence in the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' on 16 January 1945, and it became the centre of the Nazi regime until the last week of World War II in Europe. Hitler married [[Eva Braun]] there on 29 April 1945, less than 40 hours before [[Death of Adolf Hitler|they committed suicide]].\n\nAfter the war, both the old and new Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets. The underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988\u201389, despite some attempts at demolition. The excavated sections of the old bunker complex were mostly destroyed during reconstruction of that area of Berlin. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque was installed with a schematic diagram. Some corridors of the bunker still exist but are sealed off from the public.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe [[Reich Chancellery]] bunker was initially constructed as a temporary [[air-raid shelter]] for Hitler, who actually spent very little time in the capital during most of the war. Increased bombing of Berlin led to expansion of the complex as an improvised permanent shelter. The elaborate complex consisted of two separate shelters, the ''[[Vorbunker]]'' (\"forward bunker\"; the upper bunker), completed in 1936, and the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', located {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} lower than the ''Vorbunker'' and to the west-southwest, completed in 1944.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|pp=117, 119, 123}}{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2004|p=56}} They were connected by a stairway set at right angles and could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|p=28}} The ''Vorbunker'' was located {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} beneath the cellar of a large reception hall behind the old Reich Chancellery at Wilhelmstrasse&nbsp;77.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|p=117}} The ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' was located about {{convert|8.5|m|ft}} beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery, {{convert|120|m|ft}} north of the new Reich Chancellery building at [[Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]]&nbsp;6.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|p=123}} Besides being deeper under ground, the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' had significantly more reinforcement. Its roof was made of concrete almost {{convert|3|m|ft}} thick.{{sfn|McNab|2014|pp=21, 28}} About 30&nbsp;small rooms were protected by approximately {{convert|4|m|ft}} of concrete; exits led into the main buildings, as well as an emergency exit up to the garden. The ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' development was built by the [[Hochtief]] company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in Berlin begun in 1940.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|pp=117, 119, 121\u2013123}}\n\nHitler's accommodations were in this newer, lower section, and by February 1945 it had been decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=97}} After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, there was a long corridor with a series of rooms on each side.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=28}} On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=28}} On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office.{{sfn|McNab|2011|p=109}}{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=29}} On the wall hung a large portrait of [[Frederick the Great]],  one of Hitler's heroes.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=97, 901\u2013902}} A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=29}} Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a door that led out into the waiting room/ante-room.{{sfn|McNab|2011|p=109}}{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=29}}\n\nThe bunker complex was self-contained.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=901}} However, as the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' was below the [[water table]], conditions were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove [[groundwater]]. A diesel generator provided electricity, and [[well water]] was pumped in as the water supply.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} Communications systems included a [[telex]], a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated at the end of the war, Hitler received much of his war news from [[BBC]] radio broadcasts and via courier.{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=184}}\n\n== Events in 1945 ==\n{{See also|Battle of Berlin|Death of Adolf Hitler}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Reichskanzlei-Fuehrerbunker.svg\n| width1    = 300\n| caption1  = Plan of the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''\n| image2    = Reichskanzlei-Vorbunker.png\n| width2    = 300\n| caption2  = Plan of the ''[[Vorbunker]]''\n}}\n\nHitler moved into the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' on 16 January 1945, joined by his senior staff, including [[Martin Bormann]]. [[Eva Braun]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] joined them in April, while [[Magda Goebbels]] and [[Goebbels children|their six children]] took residence in the upper ''Vorbunker''.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=278}} Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including [[Traudl Junge]]), a nurse named [[Erna Flegel]], and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant [[Rochus Misch]]. Initially, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=902}} Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before returning to the bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog [[Blondi]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=902}} The bunker was crowded, the atmosphere was oppressive, and air raids occurred daily.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=785}} Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=597}} Conferences took place for much of the night,{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=785}} often until 05:00.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=903}}\n\nOn 16 April, the [[Red Army]] started the [[Battle of Berlin]], and they started to encircle the city by 19 April.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=217\u2013233}} Hitler made his last trip to the surface on 20 April, his 56th birthday, going to the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery where he awarded the [[Iron Cross]] to boy soldiers of the [[Hitler Youth]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=251}} That afternoon, Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=255}}\n\nHitler was in denial about the dire situation and placed his hopes on the units commanded by Waffen-SS General [[Felix Steiner]], the ''Armeeabteilung Steiner'' (\"[[Army Detachment Steiner]]\"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the encircling Soviet [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] and ordered the German [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|Ninth Army]], south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a [[pincer attack]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|pp=87\u201388}} That evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=255, 256}} Hitler was told at his afternoon situation conference on 22 April that Steiner's forces had not moved, and he fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack was not going to be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost\u2014and he blamed his generals. Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=275}}\n\nOn 23 April,{{efn|name=appointment}} Hitler appointed [[General of the Artillery (Germany)|General of the Artillery]] [[Helmuth Weidling]], commander of the [[LVI Panzer Corps]], as the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, replacing Lieutenant-Colonel (''[[Oberstleutnant]]'') [[Ernst Kaether]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=934}} The Red Army had consolidated their [[investment (military)|investment]] of Berlin by 25 April, despite the commands being issued from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. There was no prospect that the German defence could do anything but delay the city's capture.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=111}} Hitler summoned Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] from Munich to Berlin to take over command of the Luftwaffe from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], and he arrived on 26 April along with his mistress, the test pilot [[Hanna Reitsch]].{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=228}}\n\nOn 28 April, Hitler learned that ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] was trying to discuss surrender terms with the Western Allies through Count [[Folke Bernadotte]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=923\u2013925, 943}} and Hitler considered this treason.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=943\u2013946}} Himmler's SS representative in Berlin [[Hermann Fegelein]] was shot after being [[court-martial]]ed for desertion, and Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=946}}{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=228}} On the same day, General [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] made his last telephone call from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' to [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Chief of [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German Armed Forces High Command]] (OKW) in [[F\u00fcrstenberg/Havel|F\u00fcrstenberg]]. Krebs told him that all would be lost if relief did not arrive within 48 hours. Keitel promised to exert the utmost pressure on Generals [[Walther Wenck]], commander of the [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|Twelfth Army]], and [[Theodor Busse]], commander of the Ninth Army. Meanwhile, Bormann wired to German Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]: \"Reich Chancellery a heap of rubble.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=228}} He said that the foreign press was reporting fresh acts of treason and \"that without exception Sch\u00f6rner, Wenck and the others must give evidence of their loyalty by the quickest relief of the F\u00fchrer\".{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=119}}\n\nThat evening, von Greim and Reitsch flew out from Berlin in an [[Arado Ar 96]] trainer. Field Marshal von Greim was ordered to get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached [[Potsdamerplatz]], only a city block from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''.{{efn|name=orders}}{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=342}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=118}} During the night of 28 April, General Wenck reported to Keitel that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front and it was no longer possible for his army to relieve Berlin.{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}} Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off the attempt.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=119}}\n\nHitler married Eva Braun after midnight on 28\u201329 April in a small civil ceremony within the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. He then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|his last will and testament]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=343}}{{efn|name=will and marriage}} Hans Krebs, [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]], Goebbels, and Bormann witnessed and signed the documents at approximately 04:00.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=343}} Hitler then retired to bed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=950}}\n\nLate in the evening of 29 April, Krebs contacted Jodl by radio: \"Request immediate report. Firstly of the whereabouts of Wenck's spearheads. Secondly of time intended to attack. Thirdly of the location of the Ninth Army. Fourthly of the precise place in which the Ninth Army will break through. Fifthly of the whereabouts of General [[Rudolf Holste]]'s spearhead.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}} In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: \"Firstly, Wenck's spearhead bogged down south of [[Schwielow Lake]]. Secondly, Twelfth Army therefore unable to continue attack on Berlin. Thirdly, bulk of Ninth Army surrounded. Fourthly, Holste's Corps on the defensive.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=120}}{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=357|loc=last paragraph}}{{efn|name=reply}}\n\nSS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke]], commander of the centre government district of Berlin, informed Hitler during the morning of 30 April that he would be able to hold for less than two days. Later that morning, Weidling informed Hitler that the defenders would probably exhaust their ammunition that night and again asked him for permission to break out. Weidling finally received permission at about 13:00.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=358}} [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler shot himself]] in the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' that afternoon, and Braun took [[cyanide]].{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|pp=160\u2013182}}{{sfn|Linge|2009|p=199}} In accordance with Hitler's instructions, the bodies were burned in the garden behind the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=956\u2013957}} Goebbels became the new [[Head of Government]] and Chancellor of Germany (''[[Reichskanzler]]'') in accordance with Hitler's last will and testament. ''Reichskanzler'' Goebbels and Bormann sent a radio message to D\u00f6nitz at 03:15, informing him of Hitler's death, and D\u00f6nitz was appointed as the new President of Germany (''Reichspr\u00e4sident'') in accordance with Hitler's last wishes.{{sfn|Williams|2005|pp=324, 325}}\n\nKrebs talked to General [[Vasily Chuikov]], commander of the [[Soviet 8th Guards Army]], at about 04:00 on 1 May,{{efn|name=meeting}} and Chuikov demanded unconditional surrender of the remaining German forces. Krebs did not have the authority to surrender, so he returned to the bunker.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1135\u20131137}} In the late afternoon, Goebbels [[Magda Goebbels#Suicide|had his children poisoned]], and he and his wife left the bunker at around 20:30.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} Goebbels' SS adjutant [[G\u00fcnther Schw\u00e4germann]] testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him up the stairs and out to the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots, then walked up the remaining stairs and saw the lifeless bodies of the couple outside. He then followed Joseph Goebbels' order and had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} The bodies were then doused with petrol and set alight, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} \n\nWeidling had given the order for the survivors to break out to the northwest, and the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery was led by Mohnke; they tried unsuccessfully to break through the Soviet rings and were captured the next day. Mohnke was interrogated by [[SMERSH]], like others who were captured from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. The third breakout attempt from the Reich Chancellery was made around 01:00 on 2 May, and Bormann managed to cross the [[Spree]]. [[Arthur Axmann]] followed the same route and reported seeing Bormann's body a short distance from the [[Weidendammer bridge]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=383, 389}}{{efn|name=no orders}}\n\nAt 01:00, the Soviet forces picked up a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps requesting a cease-fire. Down in the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=387}} The last defenders in the area of the bunker complex were French SS volunteers of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)]], and they remained until the early morning.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=407}} The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=387, 388}} General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00, and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23.{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}} [[Johannes Hentschel]], the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either left or committed suicide, as the [[field hospital]] in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=287}} The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the ''Vorbunker'' with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=398}}\n\n== Post-war events ==\nThe ruins of both Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 as part of an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the [[East Germany|East German]] government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|pp=48, 49}} Because it was near the [[Berlin Wall]], the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988\u201389.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|pp=49, 50}} During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|pp=46, 48, 50\u201353}}\n\nGovernment authorities wanted to destroy the last vestiges of these Nazi landmarks.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=21}} The construction of the buildings in the area around the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable.{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2004|pp=27, 28}} The emergency exit point for the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a [[parking lot|car park]].{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2004|p=27}}\n\nOn 8 June 2006, during the lead-up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], an information board was installed to mark the location of the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. The board, including a schematic diagram of the bunker, can be found at the corner of In den Ministerg\u00e4rten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Stra\u00dfe, two small streets about three minutes' walk from [[Potsdamer Platz]].

It was part of a subterranean [[bunker]] complex constructed in two phases in 1936 and 1944. It was the last of the [[F\u00fchrer Headquarters]] (''F\u00fchrerhauptquartiere'') used by [[Adolf Hitler]] during [[World War II]].\n\nHitler took up residence in the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' on 16 January 1945, and it became the centre of the Nazi regime until the last week of World War II in Europe. Hitler married [[Eva Braun]] there on 29 April 1945, less than 40 hours before [[Death of Adolf Hitler|they committed suicide]].\n\nAfter the war, both the old and new Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets. The underground complex remained largely undisturbed until 1988\u201389, despite some attempts at demolition. The excavated sections of the old bunker complex were mostly destroyed during reconstruction of that area of Berlin. The site remained unmarked until 2006, when a small plaque was installed with a schematic diagram. Some corridors of the bunker still exist but are sealed off from the public.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe [[Reich Chancellery]] bunker was initially constructed as a temporary [[air-raid shelter]] for Hitler, who actually spent very little time in the capital during most of the war. Increased bombing of Berlin led to expansion of the complex as an improvised permanent shelter. The elaborate complex consisted of two separate shelters, the ''[[Vorbunker]]'' (\"forward bunker\"; the upper bunker), completed in 1936, and the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', located {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} lower than the ''Vorbunker'' and to the west-southwest, completed in 1944.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|pp=117, 119, 123}}{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2004|p=56}} They were connected by a stairway set at right angles and could be closed off from each other by a bulkhead and steel door.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|p=28}} The ''Vorbunker'' was located {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} beneath the cellar of a large reception hall behind the old Reich Chancellery at Wilhelmstrasse&nbsp;77.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|p=117}} The ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' was located about {{convert|8.5|m|ft}} beneath the garden of the old Reich Chancellery, {{convert|120|m|ft}} north of the new Reich Chancellery building at [[Vo\u00dfstra\u00dfe]]&nbsp;6.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|p=123}} Besides being deeper under ground, the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' had significantly more reinforcement. Its roof was made of concrete almost {{convert|3|m|ft}} thick.{{sfn|McNab|2014|pp=21, 28}} About 30&nbsp;small rooms were protected by approximately {{convert|4|m|ft}} of concrete; exits led into the main buildings, as well as an emergency exit up to the garden. The ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' development was built by the [[Hochtief]] company as part of an extensive program of subterranean construction in Berlin begun in 1940.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|pp=117, 119, 121\u2013123}}\n\nHitler's accommodations were in this newer, lower section, and by February 1945 it had been decorated with high-quality furniture taken from the Chancellery, along with several framed oil paintings.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=97}} After descending the stairs into the lower section and passing through the steel door, there was a long corridor with a series of rooms on each side.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=28}} On the right side were a series of rooms which included generator/ventilation rooms and the telephone switchboard.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=28}} On the left side was Eva Braun's bedroom/sitting room (also known as Hitler's private guest room), an ante-chamber (also known as Hitler's sitting room), which led into Hitler's study/office.{{sfn|McNab|2011|p=109}}{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=29}} On the wall hung a large portrait of [[Frederick the Great]],  one of Hitler's heroes.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=97, 901\u2013902}} A door led into Hitler's modestly furnished bedroom.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=29}} Next to it was the conference/map room (also known as the briefing/situation room) which had a door that led out into the waiting room/ante-room.{{sfn|McNab|2011|p=109}}{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=29}}\n\nThe bunker complex was self-contained.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=901}} However, as the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' was below the [[water table]], conditions were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove [[groundwater]]. A diesel generator provided electricity, and [[well water]] was pumped in as the water supply.{{sfn|Lehrer|2006|pp=124\u2013125}} Communications systems included a [[telex]], a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated at the end of the war, Hitler received much of his war news from [[BBC]] radio broadcasts and via courier.{{sfn|Taylor|2007|p=184}}\n\n== Events in 1945 ==\n{{See also|Battle of Berlin|Death of Adolf Hitler}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Reichskanzlei-Fuehrerbunker.svg\n| width1    = 300\n| caption1  = Plan of the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''\n| image2    = Reichskanzlei-Vorbunker.png\n| width2    = 300\n| caption2  = Plan of the ''[[Vorbunker]]''\n}}\n\nHitler moved into the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' on 16 January 1945, joined by his senior staff, including [[Martin Bormann]]. [[Eva Braun]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] joined them in April, while [[Magda Goebbels]] and [[Goebbels children|their six children]] took residence in the upper ''Vorbunker''.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=278}} Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including [[Traudl Junge]]), a nurse named [[Erna Flegel]], and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant [[Rochus Misch]]. Initially, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=902}} Afterwards, he would have tea with his secretaries before returning to the bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog [[Blondi]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=902}} The bunker was crowded, the atmosphere was oppressive, and air raids occurred daily.{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=785}} Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep.{{sfn|Speer|1971|p=597}} Conferences took place for much of the night,{{sfn|Bullock|1999|p=785}} often until 05:00.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=903}}\n\nOn 16 April, the [[Red Army]] started the [[Battle of Berlin]], and they started to encircle the city by 19 April.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=217\u2013233}} Hitler made his last trip to the surface on 20 April, his 56th birthday, going to the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery where he awarded the [[Iron Cross]] to boy soldiers of the [[Hitler Youth]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=251}} That afternoon, Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=255}}\n\nHitler was in denial about the dire situation and placed his hopes on the units commanded by Waffen-SS General [[Felix Steiner]], the ''Armeeabteilung Steiner'' (\"[[Army Detachment Steiner]]\"). On 21 April, Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the encircling Soviet [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] and ordered the German [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|Ninth Army]], south-east of Berlin, to attack northward in a [[pincer attack]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|pp=87\u201388}} That evening, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of Berlin.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=255, 256}} Hitler was told at his afternoon situation conference on 22 April that Steiner's forces had not moved, and he fell into a tearful rage when he realised that the attack was not going to be carried out. He openly declared for the first time the war was lost\u2014and he blamed his generals. Hitler announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=275}}\n\nOn 23 April,{{efn|name=appointment}} Hitler appointed [[General of the Artillery (Germany)|General of the Artillery]] [[Helmuth Weidling]], commander of the [[LVI Panzer Corps]], as the commander of the Berlin Defense Area, replacing Lieutenant-Colonel (''[[Oberstleutnant]]'') [[Ernst Kaether]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=934}} The Red Army had consolidated their [[investment (military)|investment]] of Berlin by 25 April, despite the commands being issued from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. There was no prospect that the German defence could do anything but delay the city's capture.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=111}} Hitler summoned Field Marshal [[Robert Ritter von Greim]] from Munich to Berlin to take over command of the Luftwaffe from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], and he arrived on 26 April along with his mistress, the test pilot [[Hanna Reitsch]].{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=228}}\n\nOn 28 April, Hitler learned that ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] was trying to discuss surrender terms with the Western Allies through Count [[Folke Bernadotte]],{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=923\u2013925, 943}} and Hitler considered this treason.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=943\u2013946}} Himmler's SS representative in Berlin [[Hermann Fegelein]] was shot after being [[court-martial]]ed for desertion, and Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=946}}{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=228}} On the same day, General [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|Hans Krebs]] made his last telephone call from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' to [[Field Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Chief of [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German Armed Forces High Command]] (OKW) in [[F\u00fcrstenberg/Havel|F\u00fcrstenberg]]. Krebs told him that all would be lost if relief did not arrive within 48 hours. Keitel promised to exert the utmost pressure on Generals [[Walther Wenck]], commander of the [[12th Army (Wehrmacht)|Twelfth Army]], and [[Theodor Busse]], commander of the Ninth Army. Meanwhile, Bormann wired to German Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]: \"Reich Chancellery a heap of rubble.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=228}} He said that the foreign press was reporting fresh acts of treason and \"that without exception Sch\u00f6rner, Wenck and the others must give evidence of their loyalty by the quickest relief of the F\u00fchrer\".{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=119}}\n\nThat evening, von Greim and Reitsch flew out from Berlin in an [[Arado Ar 96]] trainer. Field Marshal von Greim was ordered to get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached [[Potsdamerplatz]], only a city block from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''.{{efn|name=orders}}{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=342}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=118}} During the night of 28 April, General Wenck reported to Keitel that his Twelfth Army had been forced back along the entire front and it was no longer possible for his army to relieve Berlin.{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}} Keitel gave Wenck permission to break off the attempt.{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=119}}\n\nHitler married Eva Braun after midnight on 28\u201329 April in a small civil ceremony within the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. He then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated [[last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|his last will and testament]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=343}}{{efn|name=will and marriage}} Hans Krebs, [[Wilhelm Burgdorf]], Goebbels, and Bormann witnessed and signed the documents at approximately 04:00.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=343}} Hitler then retired to bed.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=950}}\n\nLate in the evening of 29 April, Krebs contacted Jodl by radio: \"Request immediate report. Firstly of the whereabouts of Wenck's spearheads. Secondly of time intended to attack. Thirdly of the location of the Ninth Army. Fourthly of the precise place in which the Ninth Army will break through. Fifthly of the whereabouts of General [[Rudolf Holste]]'s spearhead.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}} In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: \"Firstly, Wenck's spearhead bogged down south of [[Schwielow Lake]]. Secondly, Twelfth Army therefore unable to continue attack on Berlin. Thirdly, bulk of Ninth Army surrounded. Fourthly, Holste's Corps on the defensive.\"{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}}{{sfn|Ziemke|1969|p=120}}{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=357|loc=last paragraph}}{{efn|name=reply}}\n\nSS-''[[Brigadef\u00fchrer]]'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke]], commander of the centre government district of Berlin, informed Hitler during the morning of 30 April that he would be able to hold for less than two days. Later that morning, Weidling informed Hitler that the defenders would probably exhaust their ammunition that night and again asked him for permission to break out. Weidling finally received permission at about 13:00.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=358}} [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler shot himself]] in the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' that afternoon, and Braun took [[cyanide]].{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|pp=160\u2013182}}{{sfn|Linge|2009|p=199}} In accordance with Hitler's instructions, the bodies were burned in the garden behind the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=956\u2013957}} Goebbels became the new [[Head of Government]] and Chancellor of Germany (''[[Reichskanzler]]'') in accordance with Hitler's last will and testament. ''Reichskanzler'' Goebbels and Bormann sent a radio message to D\u00f6nitz at 03:15, informing him of Hitler's death, and D\u00f6nitz was appointed as the new President of Germany (''Reichspr\u00e4sident'') in accordance with Hitler's last wishes.{{sfn|Williams|2005|pp=324, 325}}\n\nKrebs talked to General [[Vasily Chuikov]], commander of the [[Soviet 8th Guards Army]], at about 04:00 on 1 May,{{efn|name=meeting}} and Chuikov demanded unconditional surrender of the remaining German forces. Krebs did not have the authority to surrender, so he returned to the bunker.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=1135\u20131137}} In the late afternoon, Goebbels [[Magda Goebbels#Suicide|had his children poisoned]], and he and his wife left the bunker at around 20:30.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} There are several different accounts on what followed. According to one account, Goebbels shot his wife and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} Goebbels' SS adjutant [[G\u00fcnther Schw\u00e4germann]] testified in 1948 that the couple walked ahead of him up the stairs and out to the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots, then walked up the remaining stairs and saw the lifeless bodies of the couple outside. He then followed Joseph Goebbels' order and had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}} The bodies were then doused with petrol and set alight, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} \n\nWeidling had given the order for the survivors to break out to the northwest, and the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery was led by Mohnke; they tried unsuccessfully to break through the Soviet rings and were captured the next day. Mohnke was interrogated by [[SMERSH]], like others who were captured from the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. The third breakout attempt from the Reich Chancellery was made around 01:00 on 2 May, and Bormann managed to cross the [[Spree]]. [[Arthur Axmann]] followed the same route and reported seeing Bormann's body a short distance from the [[Weidendammer bridge]].{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=383, 389}}{{efn|name=no orders}}\n\nAt 01:00, the Soviet forces picked up a radio message from the LVI Panzer Corps requesting a cease-fire. Down in the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', General Krebs and General Burgdorf committed suicide by gunshot to the head.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=387}} The last defenders in the area of the bunker complex were French SS volunteers of the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)]], and they remained until the early morning.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=407}} The Soviet forces then captured the Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=387, 388}} General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 6:00, and his meeting with Chuikov ended at 8:23.{{sfn|Dollinger|1997|p=239}} [[Johannes Hentschel]], the master electro-mechanic for the bunker complex, stayed after everyone else had either left or committed suicide, as the [[field hospital]] in the Reich Chancellery above needed power and water. He surrendered to the Red Army as they entered the bunker complex at 09:00 on 2 May.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=287}} The bodies of Goebbels' six children were discovered on 3 May. They were found in their beds in the ''Vorbunker'' with the clear mark of cyanide shown on their faces.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=398}}\n\n== Post-war events ==\nThe ruins of both Chancellery buildings were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 as part of an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the [[East Germany|East German]] government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|pp=48, 49}} Because it was near the [[Berlin Wall]], the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988\u201389.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|pp=49, 50}} During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.{{sfn|Mollo|1988|pp=46, 48, 50\u201353}}\n\nGovernment authorities wanted to destroy the last vestiges of these Nazi landmarks.{{sfn|McNab|2014|p=21}} The construction of the buildings in the area around the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable.{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2004|pp=27, 28}} The emergency exit point for the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a [[parking lot|car park]].{{sfn|Kellerhoff|2004|p=27}}\n\nOn 8 June 2006, during the lead-up to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], an information board was installed to mark the location of the ''F\u00fchrerbunker''. The board, including a schematic diagram of the bunker, can be found at the corner of In den Ministerg\u00e4rten and Gertrud-Kolmar-Stra\u00dfe, two small streets about three minutes' walk from [[Potsdamer Platz]].

The film had been lauded by critics, but due to the business troubles of its distributor, [[Embassy Pictures]], received no advertising campaign. Boorman paid for [[VHS]] copies of the film to be made available to Academy members for no charge at certain [[Los Angeles]] video rental stores. Despite the novelty of his campaign, however, ''Emerald Forest'' received no Oscar nominations.<ref name=LosAngelesTimes>{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-oscar-screeners-20180301-story.html |title=The Oscar screener was invented by accident, and other secrets of an awards season staple |last=Miller  |first=Daniel  |date=March 1, 2018  |website=The Los Angeles Times  |publisher= |access-date=March 13, 2018 |quote=\"The Emerald Forest\" didn't get any Oscar nominations \u2014 but Boorman's gambit made an impact: He effectively invented the movie screener, now an integral part of Hollywood's awards season apparatus. }}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] announced that they would be ceasing distribution of screeners to Academy members, citing fears of [[copyright infringement]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2003-10-14-oscar-dvd-side_x.htm|title=What's the big Oscar DVD 'screener' flap?|last=Seiler|first=Andy|date=2003-10-14|work=[[USA Today]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> A group of independent film makers sued and won a decision against the MPAA. The MPAA later reinstated the screeners with the implementation of a new policy requiring recipients to sign a binding contract that they would not share the screeners with others.\n\nIn January 2004, Academy member [[Carmine Caridi]] was announced as a ''person of interest'' in an ongoing [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into [[Warez#Movie piracy|video piracy]]. He was subsequently expelled from the Academy, after he was found to have sent as many as 60 screeners a year for at least three years to a contact called Russell Sprague in [[Illinois]]. Caridi was later ordered to pay [[Warner Bros.]] for copyright infringement of two of their films, ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'' and ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', a total of $300,000 ($150,000 per title).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.warnermediagroup.com/newsroom/press-releases/2004/11/23/carmine-caridi-motion-picture-academy-member-who-handed-over-his|title=Carmine Caridi, Motion Picture Academy Member Who Handed Over His Awards Screeners for Illegal Duplication, Ordered to Pay $300,000 to Warner Bros.
