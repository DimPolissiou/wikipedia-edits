It is common for a kollel to pay a token stipend to its students. Students of [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] yeshiva gedolas usually learn in yeshiva until they get married.\n\nHistorically, yeshivas were attended by males only. Today, all non-Orthodox and a few [[Modern Orthodox]] yeshivas are open to females. Although there are separate schools for Orthodox women and girls,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://matzav.com/sarah-schenirer-ah-the-mother-of-the-bais-yaakov-movement-on-her-yahrtzeit-today-26-adar |title=Sarah Schenirer a\u201dh, the Mother of the Bais Yaakov Movement, On Her Yahrtzeit, Today, 26 Adar |website=matzav.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>  (''[[midrasha]]'' or \"seminary\") these do not follow the same structure or curriculum as the traditional yeshiva for boys and men.\n\n==Etymology==\nAlternate spellings and names include ''yeshivah'' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0251\u02d0}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4}}, sitting (n.); ''metivta'' and ''[[mesivta]]'' ({{lang-arc|\u05de\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d0}} ''methivta''); ''[[beth midrash]]''; Talmudical academy, rabbinical academy and rabbinical school. The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century. After the scattering of the yeshiva, education in Jewish religious studies became the responsibility of individual [[synagogues]]. No organization ever came to replace the three great yeshivot of Jerusalem, Sura and Pumbedita.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgement in One Volume |last=Goitein |first=S.D. |editor-last=Lassner |editor-first=Jacob |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1999 |isbn=9780520240599 |url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520240599/a-mediterranean-society |accessdate=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Geonic Period to the 19th century===\nAfter the Geonic Period Jews went on to establishing more Yeshiva academies in Europe and in Northern Africa. One of these include the [[History of the Jews in Kairouan|Kairuan yeshiva]] in Spain (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e7\u05d0\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d0\u05df) that was established by Chushiel Ben Elchanan (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05d5\u05e9\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05dc\u05d7\u05e0\u05df) in 974.<ref>\u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05e0\u05d3 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e6\u05dc\u05d0\u05dc \u05e1. \u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, '''\u05e2\u05dd \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc - \u05ea\u05d5\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea 4000 \u05e9\u05e0\u05d4 - \u05de\u05d9\u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e2\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5'''</ref>\n\nTraditionally, every town [[rabbi]] had the right to maintain a number of full-time or part-time pupils in the town's [[beth midrash]] (study hall), which was usually adjacent to the synagogue. Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

The six-weeks-long semester is the shortest yet most intense session, as it comes before the High Holidays of [[Rosh Hashanah]] and Yom Kippur.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis.

The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], and (less often) [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Jewish educational institution for Torah study}}\n{{About| the Jewish educational system|the private university|Yeshiva University| the website|Yeshiva.co}}\n{{original research|date=April 2019}}\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|religion}} \n[[File:Mirs 14.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Mir Yeshiva (Jerusalem)]] - largest yeshiva in the world]]\n[[File:BaisMedrashInterior.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A typical [[beth midrash|''bet midrash'']] - [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]], [[Baltimore]]]]\n[[File:Carteret beis medrash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Chavrusas in study - [[Yeshiva Gedola of Carteret]]]]\n[[File:OrYisrael8885.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Morning ''seder'', [[Petah_Tikva#Schools_and_religious_institutions|Or-Yisrael]] (a yeshiva founded by the [[Chazon Ish]])]]\n[[File:RoyLindmanRabbinicalSchoolJerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Students in ''[[Shiur (Torah)|shiur]]'', [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Rav_Kav_giving_Shiur_Klali_in_Yeshivas_Kerem_B'Yavne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Shiur klali'', [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]]]]\nA '''yeshiva''' ({{IPAc-en|j|\u0259|\u02c8|\u0283|i\u02d0|v|\u0259}}; {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4||sitting}}; pl. {{rtl-lang|he|\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea}}, {{transl|he|yeshivot}} or {{transl|he|yeshivos}}) is a [[Jewish education|Jewish]] [[educational institution]] that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the [[Talmud]] and the [[Torah]], and [[Halacha]] (Jewish law).

The word ''[http://www.binyanolam.net yeshiva]'' is applied to the activity of learning in class, and hence to a learning \"session.\"<ref>\"Session\", in fact, similarly derives from the Latin ''sedere'', \"to sit.\"</ref>\n\nThe transference in meaning of the term from the learning session to the institution itself appears to have occurred by the time of the great [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]] and [[Pumbedita]], which were known as ''shte ha-yeshivot'' (the two colleges).\n\n==History==\n:''See [[Jewish education #The yeshiva]]''\n===Origins===\nThe [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal prayers. Likewise, every [[beth din]] (\"house of judgement\") was attended by a number of pupils up to three times the size of the court ([[Mishnah]], tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]). These might be indications of the historicity of the classical yeshiva. As indicated by the [[Talmud]],<ref>(Where in the Talmud, and in which Talmud (Bavli or Yerushalmi?)</ref> adults generally took off two months a year, [[Elul]] and [[Adar]], the months preceding the [[pilgrimage festivals]] of [[Sukkot]] and [[Pesach]], called ''Yar\u1e25ei Kalla'' ([[Aramaic]] for \"Months of Kallah\") to study. The rest of the year, they worked.\n\n===Geonic Period===\n[[File:Rabbi Ashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A depiction of [[Sura Academy|Sura]] (from [[Beit Hatefutsot]])]]\nThe Geonic period takes its name from [[Gaon (Hebrew)|''Gaon'']], the title bestowed on the heads of the three yeshivas in existence from the third to the thirteenth century. The Geonim acted as the principals of their individual yeshivot, and as spiritual leaders and high judges for the wider communities tied to them. The yeshiva conducted all official business in the name of its Gaon, and all correspondence to or from the yeshiva was addressed directly to the Gaon.\n\nThroughout the Geonic Period there were three yeshivot. These were named for the cities in which they were located: [[Jerusalem]], [[Sura (city)|Sura]], and [[Pumbedita]]; the yeshiva of Jerusalem would later relocate to [[Cairo]], and the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita to [[Baghdad]], but retain their original names. Each Jewish community would associate itself with one of the three yeshivot; Jews living around the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] typically followed the yeshiva in Jerusalem, while those living in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and modern-day [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]] typically followed one of the two yeshivot in Baghdad. There was however, no requirement for this, and each community could choose to associate with any of the yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshiva served as the highest educational institution for the [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbis]] of this period. In addition to this, the yeshiva wielded immense power as the principal body for interpreting [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. In this regard, the community saw the Gaon of a yeshiva as the highest judge on all matters of Jewish law. Each yeshiva ruled differently on matters of ritual and law; the other yeshivot accepted these divisions, and all three ranked as equally orthodox. The yeshiva also served as an administrative authority, in conjunction with local communities, by appointing members to serve as the head of local congregations. Those appointed as the head of a congregation would serve as a go-between for the local congregation and the larger yeshiva it was attached to. These local leaders would also submit questions to the yeshiva to obtain final rulings on issues of dogma, ritual, or law. Each congregation was expected to follow only one yeshiva to prevent conflict with different rulings issued by different yeshivot.\n\nThe yeshivot were financially supported through a number of means. There were fixed, but voluntary, yearly contributions made to the yeshivas; these annual contributions were collected and handled by the local leaders appointed by the yeshiva. Private gifts and donations from individuals were also common, especially during holidays, and could consist of money or goods.\n\nThe yeshiva of Jerusalem was finally forced into exile in Cairo in 1127, and eventually dispersed entirely. Likewise, the yeshivot of Sura and Pumbedita were dispersed following the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasions of the 13th century.

Their cost of living was covered by community taxation. After a number of years, the students who received ''[[semikhah]]'' (rabbinical ordination) would either take up a vacant rabbinical position elsewhere or join the workforce.\n\n====Lithuanian yeshivas====\n[[Image:Volozhin yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Old photo of the Volozhin yeshiva]]\n[[File:Ponivez1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Ponevezh Yeshiva]] in [[Bnei Brak]], [[Israel]]]] \nOrganised [[Torah study]] was revolutionised by [[Chaim Volozhin]], an influential 18th-century Lithuanian leader of Judaism and disciple of the [[Vilna Gaon]]. In his view, the traditional arrangement did not cater to those who were looking for more intensive study.\n\nWith the support of his teacher, Volozhin gathered a large number of interested students and started a yeshiva in the town of [[Valozhyn]], located in modern-day [[Belarus]]. The [[Volozhin yeshiva]] was closed some 60 years later in 1892 due to the Russian government's demands for the introduction of certain secular studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schacter|first1=Jacob J. |title=Haskalah, Secular Studies and the Close of the Yeshiva in Volozhin in 1892 |jstor=40914771 |journal=The Torah U-Madda Journal |volume=2 |pages=76\u2013133 |date=1990}}</ref> Thereafter, a number of yeshivot opened in other towns and cities, most notably [[Yeshivas Knesses Yisrael (Slabodka)|Slabodka]], [[Panev\u0117\u017eys]], [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Brisk tradition and Soloveitchik dynasty|Brisk]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. Many prominent contemporary ''yeshivot'' in the United States and [[Israel]] are continuations of these institutions, and often bear the same name.\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Israel Salanter]] initiated the [[Mussar movement]] in non-Hasidic Lithuanian Jewry, which sought to encourage yeshiva students and the wider community to spend regular times devoted to the study of Jewish ethical works. Concerned by the new social and religious changes of the [[Haskalah]] (the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), and other emerging political ideologies (such as [[Zionism]]) that often opposed traditional Judaism, the masters of Mussar saw a need to augment [[Talmudic]] study with more personal works. These comprised earlier classic Jewish ethical texts ([[mussar literature]]), as well as a new literature for the movement. By focusing the student on self-understanding and introspection, often with profound psychological insight, the spiritual aims of Judaism could be internalized.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> After early opposition, the Lithuanian yeshiva world saw the need for this new component in their curriculum, and set aside times for individual mussar study and mussar talks (\"mussar shmues\"). A ''[[mashgiach ruchani]]'' (spiritual mentor) encouraged the personal development of each student. To some degree, this Lithuanian movement arose in response, and as an alternative, to the separate mystical study of the [[Hasidic Judaism]] world. Hasidism began in the previous century within traditional Jewish life in Ukraine, and spread to Hungary, Poland and Russia. As the 19th Century brought upheavals and threats to traditional Judaism, the Mussar teachers saw the benefit of the new spiritual focus in Hasidism, and developed their alternative ethical approach to spirituality.\n\nSome variety developed within Lithuanian yeshivas to methods of studying Talmud and ''mussar'', for example whether the emphasis would be placed on ''beki'ut'' (breadth) or ''iyyun'' (depth). ''[[Pilpul]]'', a type of in-depth analytical and casuistic argumentation popular from the 16th to 18th centuries that was traditionally reserved for the profound nuances of investigative Talmudic study, was not always given a place. The new analytical approach of the [[Brisker method]], developed by [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], has become widely popular; however, there are other approaches such as those of [[Mir yeshiva (Poland)|Mir]], [[Yeshivas Rabbeinu Yisrael Meir HaKohen|Chofetz Chaim]], and [[Telshe yeshiva|Telz]]. In ''mussar'', different schools developed, such as Slabodka and [[Novardok Yeshiva|Novhardok]], though today, a decline in devoted spiritual self-development from its earlier intensity has to some extent levelled out the differences.\n\n====Hasidic yeshivas====\n[[File:Breslov Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Breslov (Hasidic group) |Breslov]] Yeshiva in [[Mea Shearim]], [[Jerusalem]].]]\n[[Image:Satmer Yeshiva.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] Yeshiva in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].]]\nWith the success of the yeshiva institution in Lithuanian Jewry, the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] world developed their own yeshivas, in their areas of Eastern Europe. These comprised the traditional Jewish focus on Talmudic literature that is central to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], augmented by study of [[Hasidic philosophy]] (Hasidism). Examples of these Hasidic yeshivas are the [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]] yeshiva system of [[Tomchei Temimim]], founded by [[Sholom Dovber Schneersohn]] in Russia in 1897, and the [[Chachmei Lublin Yeshiva]] established in Poland in 1930 by [[Meir Shapiro]], who is renowned in both Hasidic and Lithuanian Jewish circles for initiating the [[Daf Yomi]] daily cycle of Talmud study.\n\nIn many Hasidic yeshivas, study of Hasidic texts is a secondary activity, similar to the additional mussar curriculum in Lithuanian yeshivas. These paths see Hasidism as a means to the end of inspiring emotional ''[[devekut]]'' (spiritual attachment to God) and mystical enthusiasm. In this context, the personal pilgrimage of a Hasid to his [[Rebbe]] is a central feature of spiritual life, in order to awaken spiritual fervour. Often, such paths will reserve the [[Shabbat]] in the yeshiva for the sweeter teachings of the classic texts of Hasidism. \n\nIn contrast, Chabad and [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov]], in their different ways, place daily study of their dynasties' Hasidic texts in central focus; see [[#Ethics, mysticism and philosophy|below]]. Illustrative of this is Sholom Dovber Schneersohn's wish in establishing the Chabad yeshiva system, that the students should spend a part of the daily curriculum learning Chabad Hasidic texts \"with ''pilpul''\". The idea to learn Hasidic mystical texts with similar logical profundity, derives from the unique approach in the works of the Rebbes of Chabad, initiated by its founder [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]], to systematically investigate and articulate the \"Torah of the [[Baal Shem Tov]]\" in intellectual forms. Further illustrative of this is the differentiation in Chabad thought (such as the \"Tract on Ecstasy\" by [[Dovber Schneuri]]) between general Hasidism's emphasis on emotional enthusiasm and the Chabad ideal of intellectually reserved ecstasy. In the Breslov movement, in contrast, the daily study of works from the imaginative, creative radicalism of [[Nachman of Breslov]] awakens the necessary soulfulness with which to approach other Jewish study and observance.\n\n====Sephardi yeshivas====\n:''See: [[:Category:Sephardic yeshivas]], as well the more complete, [[:he:\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea|\u05e7\u05d8\u05d2\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4:\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea]]''\n[[File:Porat Yosef Yeshiva, Geula branch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Geula]] branch of Porat Yosef Yeshiva.]]\nAlthough the yeshiva as an institution is in some ways a continuation of the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia]], large scale educational institutions of this kind were not characteristic of the North African and Middle Eastern [[Sephardi]] Jewish world in pre-modern times: education typically took place in a more informal setting in the synagogue or in the entourage of a famous rabbi. In medieval Spain, and immediately following the expulsion in 1492, there were some schools which combined Jewish studies with sciences such as logic and astronomy, similar to the contemporary Islamic [[madrasa]]s. In 19th-century Jerusalem, a college was typically an endowment for supporting ten adult scholars rather than an educational institution in the modern sense; towards the end of the century a school for orphans was founded providing for some rabbinic studies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm |first=Daniel J. |last=Elazar |title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed? |accessdate=2018-10-06 |publisher=[[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]}}</ref> Early educational institutions on the European model were [[Midrash Bet Zilkha]] founded in 1870s Iraq and [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] founded in Jerusalem in 1914. Also notable is the [[Beit El Synagogue|Bet El yeshiva]] founded in 1737 in Jerusalem for advanced Kabbalistic studies. Later Sephardic yeshivot are usually on the model either of Porat Yosef or of the Ashkenazi institutions.\n\nThe Sephardic world has traditionally placed the study of [[Kabbalah]] (esoteric Jewish mysticism) in a more mainstream position than in the European [[Ashkenazi]] world. This difference of emphasis arose in reaction to the historical events of the [[Sabbatean]] heresy in the 17th Century, that suppressed widespread study of Kabbalah in Europe in favour of the strength of Rabbinic Talmudic study. In Eastern European Lithuanian life, Kabbalah was reserved for an intellectual elite, while the mystical revival of Hasidism articulated Kabbalistic theology through Hasidic thought. These factors did not affect the Sephardi Jewish world, which retained a wider connection to Kabbalah in its traditionally observant communities. With the establishment of Sephardi yeshivas in Israel after the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|immigration of the Arabic Jewish communities there]], some Sephardi yeshivas incorporated study of more accessible Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum. Nonetheless, the European prescriptions to reserve advanced Kabbalistic study to mature and elite students also influence the choice of texts in such yeshivas.\n\n===19th century to present===\n====Conservative movement yeshivas====\n[[File:JTSA 122 Bway jeh.JPG|250px|thumb|JTS building in [[Manhattan]]]]\nIn 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] was founded. It was headed by [[Zecharias Frankel]], and was viewed as the first educational institution associated with \"positive-historical Judaism\", the predecessor of [[Conservative Judaism]]. In subsequent years, Conservative Judaism established a number of other institutions of higher learning (such as the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] in New York City) that emulate the style of traditional yeshivas in significant ways. However, many do not officially refer to themselves as \"yeshivas\" (one exception is the [[Conservative Yeshiva]] in Jerusalem), and all are open to both women and men, who study in the same classrooms and follow the same curriculum. Students may study part-time, as in a kollel, or full-time, and they may study ''lishmah'' (for the sake of studying itself) or towards earning rabbinic ordination.\n\n====Nondenominational or mixed yeshivas====\nNon-denominational yeshivas and kollels with connections to Conservative Judaism include [[Yeshivat Hadar]] in New York, the leaders of whom include [[Rabbinical Assembly]] members [[Elie Kaunfer]] and [[Shai Held]]. The rabbinical school of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in California]] (AJR-CA) is led by Conservative rabbi Mel Gottlieb. The faculty of the [[Academy for Jewish Religion in New York]] and of the Rabbinical School of [[Hebrew College]] in [[Newton Centre]], Massachusetts also includes a large number of Conservative rabbis.\nSee also [[Institute of Traditional Judaism]].\n\nAdditionally, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, developed and led by Conservative and Reform rabbis, offers a two-year online rabbinical ordination program with a \"post-denominational\" rabbinical ordination.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishpluralism.org/ |title=Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary |publisher=PRS |date= January 23, 2019 |accessdate=February 14, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Reform and Reconstructionist seminaries====\n[[Hebrew Union College]] (HUC), affiliated with [[Reform Judaism]], was founded in 1875 under the leadership of [[Isaac Mayer Wise]] in Cincinnati, Ohio. HUC later opened additional locations in New York, Los Angeles, and Jerusalem. It is a rabbinical seminary or college mostly geared for the training of rabbis and clergy specifically. Similarly, the [[Reconstructionist Rabbinical College]] of [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], founded in Pennsylvania in 1968, functions to train its future clergy. Some Reform and Reconstructionist teachers also teach at non-denominational seminaries like the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York, the Academy for Jewish Religion in California, and the Rabbinical School of Hebrew College. In Europe, Reform Judaism trains rabbis at Leo Baeck College in London, UK and Abraham Geiger Kolleg in Potsdam, Germany. None of these institutions describes itself as a \"yeshiva\".\n\n====Contemporary Orthodox yeshivas====\n[[File:The old Beis Madrash Building of BMG.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Beth Medrash Govoha]], Lakewood, New Jersey -  largest yeshiva outside Israel.<ref name=LargestYeshivaOutsideIsrael>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/04/lakewood-yeshiva-looks-to-use-old-golf-course-for-new-campus.html|title=Lakewood yeshiva looks to use old golf course for new campus|author=Steve Strunsky|publisher=New Jersey On-Line LLC|date=April 16, 2019|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=Beth Medrash Gohova is said to be the world\u2019s largest Jewish-affiliated university outside of Israel.}}</ref><ref name=LargestYeshivaNorthAmerica>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/ocean/2017/08/11_ways_lakewood_is_like_nowhere_else_in_nj.html|title=10 ways Lakewood is unlike anywhere else in N.J.|author=Stephen Stirling|publisher=NJ Advance Media|accessdate=April 16, 2019|quote=The sea change can be pinned to one event: The founding of the Beth Medrash Govoha yeshiva in the mid-20th century.

Summer ''zman'' starts after Passover and lasts until [[Rosh Chodesh]] Av or [[Tisha B'Av]], a duration of about three months.\n\n===Chavruta-style learning===\n{{main|Chavruta}}\nYeshiva students prepare for and review the [[Shiur (Torah)|''shiur'']] (lecture) with their ''chavruta'' during a study session known as a ''seder''.<ref name=\"Forta\"/> In contrast to conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student repeats the information back in tests, ''chavruta''-style learning challenges the student to analyze and explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights of the meaning of the text.<ref name=\"agora\"/><ref name=\"jeff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rebjeff.com/1/category/singing/1.html |title=Bringing the People Together |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Reb Jeff}}</ref> A ''chavruta'' helps a student keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, organize his thoughts into logical arguments, and understand another person's viewpoint.<ref name=\"zobin\">{{cite book |pages=104&ndash;106 |title=Breakthrough to Learning Gemora: A Concise, Analytical Guide |last=Zobin |first=Zvi |year=1996 |publisher=Kest-Lebovits}}</ref>\n\nChavruta-style learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other, and then analyze, question, debate, and even argue their points of view to arrive at an understanding of the text.

The dual curriculum was pioneered by the Manhattan Talmudical Academy of [[Yeshiva University]] (now known as [[Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy]]) in 1916.\n#[[Mechina]] - For Israeli high-school graduates who wish to study for one year before entering the army. In [[Telshe yeshiva|Telshe]] yeshivas and in [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel|Ner Yisroel of Baltimore]], the Mesivtas/Yeshiva ketanas are known as Mechinas.\n#[[Beth Midrash]] - For high school graduates, and is attended from one year to many years, dependent on the career plans and affiliation of the student.\n#Yeshivat [[Hesder]] - Yeshiva that has an arrangement with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] by which the students enlist together in the same unit and, as much as is possible serve in the same unit in the army. Over a period of about 5 years there will be a period of service starting in the second year of about 16 months. There are different variations. The rest of the time will be spent in compulsory study in the yeshiva. The first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\n#[[Kollel]] - Yeshiva for married men. The kollel idea has its intellectual roots in the Torah;  [[Mishnah]] tractate [[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] mentions the law that a town can only be called a \"city\" if it supports ten men (''batlanim'') to make up the required [[minyan|quorum]] for communal learning. However, it is mostly a modern innovation of 19th-century Europe. A kollel will often be in the same location as the yeshiva.\n#[[Baal Teshuva]] yeshivot catering to the needs of the newly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].\nTraditionally, religious girls' schools are not called \"yeshiva.\" The [[Bais Yaakov]] system was started in 1918 under the guidance of [[Sarah Schenirer]]. This system provided girls with a Torah education, using a curriculum that skewed more toward practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) and the study of [[Tanakh]], rather than [[Talmud]]. Bais Yaakovs are strictly [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] schools. Non-Haredi girls' schools' curricula often includes the study of Mishnah and sometimes Talmud. They are also sometimes called \"yeshiva\" (e.g., Prospect Park Yeshiva). Post-high schools for women are generally called \"seminary\" or ''\"[[midrasha]]\"''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Languages===\n''Classes'' in most Lithuanian and Hasidic yeshivot (throughout the world) are taught in [[Yiddish]]; \n[[Kol Torah]], est 1939 in Jerusalem and headed by [[Shlomo Zalman Auerbach]] for over 40 years, was the first mainstream Haredi yeshiva to teach in Hebrew, as opposed to Yiddish.\nSephardi, Modern Orthodox, Zionist, and ''baal teshuvah'' yeshivot use [[Modern Hebrew]] or the local language. \n\nStudents learn with each other in whatever language they are most proficient, with Hasidic students usually learning in Yiddish, Israeli Lithuanian students in Hebrew, and American Lithuanian students in English.\n\n=== College credit ===\nAlthough often not encouraged, some yeshivas permit students to attend college on a limited basis. This concession is facilitated by arrangements for the student to receive credit towards a college degree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.YeshivaDegree.com |title=Guide To Degree Completion Programs for Yeshiva Students |year=2011 |publisher=YeshivaDegree.com |accessdate=2018-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402100219/http://www.yeshivadegree.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-02 |url-status=dead}}</ref> \n[[Yeshiva University]] in New York provides a year's worth of credit for yeshiva studies.\n\nHaredi institutions with similar arrangements in place include [[Lander College for Men]], [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel]] and [[Hebrew Theological College]].\nFor historical context see: [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], [[Volozhin yeshiva #History]], [[Yitzchok Hutner #Rabbinic and teaching career]] and [[Mesivta #Modern-day concept]].\n\n==Curriculum==\n[[Torah study]] at an Orthodox yeshiva comprises the study of [[rabbinic literature]], principally the Talmud, along with the study of ''[[Halacha]]'' (Jewish law); \n[[Musar literature|Musar]] and [[Hasidic philosophy]] are often studied also.\n<ref name=\"Actually\">{{cite news |last=Krakowski|first=Moshe |date=26 December 2018 |title=What Yeshiva Kids Are Actually Studying All Day |url=https://forward.com/life/faith/416616/what-yeshiva-kids-are-actually-studying-all-day/ |work=Forward |location= |access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref> \nIn some institutions, classical [[Jewish philosophy]] or Kabbalah are formally studied, or the works of individual thinkers (such as [[Abraham Isaac Kook]]). \n\n[[Rabbi#Non-Orthodox_Judaism|Non-Orthodox institutions]] offer a synthesis of traditional and critical methods, allowing Jewish texts and tradition to encounter social change and modern scholarship. The curriculum focuses on classical Jewish subjects, including Talmud, Tanakh, Midrash, ''halacha'', and Philosophy, with an [[Biblical_criticism#Contemporary_methods|openness to modern scholarship]]. \nNote that, often, in these institutions less emphasis is placed on Talmud and Jewish law, \"but rather on sociology, cultural studies, and modern Jewish philosophy\".<ref name=\"Blane\">Rabbi [[Steven Blane]] (N.D.). [https://jsli.net/apply-online/ordination-weekends/ \"Ordination and Semicha\"], jsli.net</ref> \n(These institutions' focus is also on \"the other functions of a modern rabbi such as preaching, counselling, and pastoral work\". <ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ordination-semihah/2/ Ordination (Semicha)], myjewishlearning.com</ref>)\n[[Rabbi#Conservative_Judaism|Conservative programs]] occupy a position midway.<ref name=\"Blane\"/>\n\n===Talmud study===\n:''See also: [[Talmud #Commentaries]]; [[Gemara]]; [[Mishnah]]''\nIn the typical Orthodox yeshiva, the main emphasis is on Talmud study and analysis, or  ''[[Gemara]]''. Generally, two parallel Talmud streams are covered during a ''zman'' (trimester). The first is ''iyyun'' (in-depth study), often confined to selected legally focused tractates with an emphasis on analytical skills and close reference to the classical commentators; the second, ''beki'ut'', seeks to cover ground more speedily in order to build general knowledge of the Talmud.\n\nIn the yeshiva system of Talmudic study, the undergraduate yeshivot focus on eight ''[[Masekhet|mesechtohs]]'' ([[tractate]]s) that deal with civil jurisprudence (''[[Nezikin]]''); through them, the student can best master the [[Gemara #Argumentation and debate|proper technique of Talmudic analysis]]. After this technique is mastered, the student is ready to go on to other areas of the Talmud<ref name=\"Actually\"/> (see, for example, [[Yeshivas Ner Yisroel #Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates)]]). Tractates [[Berakhot (tractate)|''Berachot'']], [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Sukkah'']] and [[Sukkah (Talmud)|''Pesachim'']] are often included.\n\nWorks initially studied to clarify the Talmudic text are the commentary by [[Rashi]], and  ''[[Tosafot]]'', a parallel analysis and critique.\nThe integration of Talmud, Rashi and Tosafot, is considered as foundational - and prerequisite - to further analysis (in fact, this combination is sometimes referred to by its own acronym, ''\"gefet\"''  \u05d2\u05e4\u05f4\u05ea - ''[[Gemara]]'',  ''perush Rashi'',  ''Tosafot''). The [[Super-commentary|super-commentaries]] by  [[Solomon Luria|\"Maharshal\"]], [[Meir Lublin|\"Maharam\"]] and [[Samuel Edels|\"Maharsha\"]] address the three together.\n\nAt more advanced levels, additional ''[[Talmud#Commentaries|mefarshim]]'' (commentators) are studied: other ''[[rishonim]]'', from the 11th to 14th centuries, as well as ''[[acharonim]]'', from later generations. (There are two main schools of ''rishonim'', from France and from Spain, who will hold different interpretations and understandings of the Talmud.) \nAt these levels, students link the Talmudic discussion to [[Halakha #Codes of Jewish law|codified law]] - particularly ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' (i.e. [[Rambam]]), ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' - by studying, also, the halakha-focused commentaries of [[Asher_ben_Jehiel#Works|\"Rosh\"]], [[Isaac_Alfasi#Sefer_haHalachot|\"Rif\"]] and [[Mordechai_ben_Hillel#Magnum_opus|\"Mordechai\"]].\n\nIn general, as the [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|level of the ''shiur'']] progresses, so the student must integrate more of these commentaries into their analysis of the ''[[sugya]]'' (loosely, Talmudic  \"unit of analysis\");\nand understand their various implications re practical-halakha.\nAt the higher levels - in Lithuanian influenced Yeshivot - the \"[[Brisker method]]\" of analysis is employed, [[#Lithuanian yeshivas|as mentioned]].\nSome yeshivot - such as [[Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe|Birkat Moshe]] - particularly emphasize the Rambam.\nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' delivers a weekly ''shiur klali'' (comprehensive lecture), which sums up the week's learning; this is attended by all levels.\n\nTypically, boys begin their study of Talmud in middle school, initially studying [[Mishnah]], the component of Talmud where the underlying \"cases\" are presented. (At this stage, they have completed their survey of ''Chumash''; see [[#Torah_and_Bible_study|below]].)\nIn early high school, ''[[gemara]]'', the analytic component, is introduced; by late high school some are able to work with ''Tosafot''.\n\n===Jewish law===\nGenerally, a period is devoted to the study of practical ''halakha''. The text most commonly studied in Ashkenazi yeshivot is the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]'', a compilation of ''halakhic'' opinions rendered after the time of the writing of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. \nIn Sephardic yeshivot, the ''Shulchan Aruch'' itself is more commonly studied, along with the [[Beit Yosef (book)|''Bet Yosef'']] commentary; the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' and [[Yaakov_Chaim_Sofer#Works|''Kaf Hachaim'']] are also often studied;  [[Yosef_Hayyim#Works|''Ben Ish Hai'']] is a standard reference.\nIn [[Chabad]] yeshivot,<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\"/> emphasis is placed upon study of ''[[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]]''. Beginning students are encouraged to also work through the [[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|''Kitzur Shulchan Aruch'']], so as to survey all areas of applicable Halacha.  Other students, similarly,  additionally review the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' through [[Daily Rambam Study|its daily study cycle]] (this is often outside of any ''seder''), here including  halachot relating to, for example, the Temple.\n\nStudents in ''[[Semikha]]'' (Rabbinic ordination) programs, and often those in [[kollel]], devote the largest portion of their schedule to ''halakha''.\nThe focus is in-depth study of those areas where (community) Rabbis will typically be asked ''\"shaylas\"'', or Halachik questions - [[Shabbat]], [[Kashrut]] (referred to as ''\"Issur v'Heter\"''), often [[Niddah]], and (less often) [[Bereavement in Judaism |Avelut]] - and their sources.\n<ref name=\"RCA\"/> \n<ref>[http://www.smicha.co.il/ smicha.co.il] - resource for the [[Chief_Rabbinate_of_Israel#Semikhah|Semikha of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], maintained by Rabbi [https://www.srugim.co.il/tag/%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90 Harel Shapira]</ref> \n<ref name=\"Rabbinical College of America\">[http://rca.edu/media/pdf/1120/NbJg11207139.pdf ''CATALOG''], [[Rabbinical College of America]]</ref> \nThis entails the discussion of the ''halakha'' in the ''[[Arba'ah Turim]]'' and ''Bet Yosef'', through its final presentation in the ''Shulchan Aruch''; complemented by a study of key [[History of responsa in Judaism|''She'elot u-Teshuvot'']] ([[responsa]]), recent and historical.  \nThe underpin for this analysis is a deep knowledge of all relevant ''sugyas'', which are prepared accordingly within the schedule.\nStudents in a (Orthodox) Semikha program will thus have a strong background in Talmud, typically having spent at least four preceding years in Yeshiva;<ref name=\"RCA\">[http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/SemichaGuidelines22Dec2015.pdf ''Semicha Standards''], RCA Executive Committee, 2015.</ref> Kollel students likewise.\n(See [[Rabbi #Orthodox and Modern Orthodox Judaism]],\n[[Posek #Formulating a ruling (psak din)]].)\nDuring the morning ''seder'', Semikha students continue their Talmud studies, learning the same ''masechet'' as the rest of the Yeshiva.\n\n===Ethics, mysticism and philosophy===\nHaredi ''Yeshivot'' typically devote a ''seder'' to [[musar literature|''mussar'']] (ethics and character development). \nThe preeminent text studied is the ''[[Mesillat Yesharim]]'' (\"Path [of the] Just\") of [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]]. Other works of mussar literature studied include:\n*''[[Orchot Tzaddikim]]'' (\"Paths [of the] Righteous\"); its authorship and time of writing is uncertain, but as it quotes [[Maimonides]], it was written some time after his works were disseminated.\n*''[[Chovot ha-Levavot]]'' (\"Duties of the Hearts\") by [[Bahya ibn Paquda]].\n*''[[Ma'alot ha-Middot]]'' (\"Benefit [of good character] traits\") by [[Jehiel_ben_Jekuthiel_Anav|Jehiel Anav]]\n*''Mishnat R' Aharon'', Mussar Lectures on many topics by [[Aharon Kotler]].\n*''[[Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu|Mikhtav me-Eliyahu]]'', the works of [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]].\n\nHasidic yeshivot study the mystical, spiritual works of Hasidic philosophy (''Chassidus''). This draws on the earlier esoteric theology of ''[[Kabbalah]]'', but articulates it in terms of inner psychological awareness and personal analogies. This makes Jewish mysticism accessible and tangible, so that it inspires emotional ''[[dveikus]]'' (cleaving to God) and spiritual contribution to daily Jewish life. This serves some similar purposes to ''mussar'', but through different means and with different contributions to intellectual and emotional life. Chabad yeshivot, for example, study the [[Tanya]], the [[Likutei Torah]], and the voluminous works of the [[Chabad-Lubavitch#The leaders of Chabad-Lubavitch|Rebbes of Chabad]] for an hour and a half each morning, before prayers, and an hour and a half in the evening. \nSee [[#Hasidic yeshivas|above]].\n\n[[#Sephardi yeshivas|As mentioned]], Sephardi ''yeshivot'' often incorporate study of selected Kabbalistic texts into their curriculum - [[Primary texts of Kabbalah|standard texts]], as well as works by [[Yosef Hayyim]], [[Yehuda Fatiyah]] and [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]]. Kabbalistic sources are brought in ''Halachik'' works such as ''Kaf Hachaim'' and ''Ben Ish Hai'' - see [[Sephardic law and customs #Lurianic Kabbalah]] - and are then studied indirectly also.\n\nIn Hesder, [[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] yeshivot, ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish philosophy]] generalized / applied as \"[[Jewish thought]]\"; also ''[[Hashkafa]]'', \"worldview\") is taught formally, with classes systematically covering the [[Jewish_principles_of_faith|major topics]] and works (''[[Kuzari]], [[The Guide for the Perplexed|Moreh Nevukhim]], [[Sefer ha-Ikkarim]] , [[Emunoth ve-Deoth|Emunot ve-Deot]], [[Derech Hashem]]'' and others). Hesder yeshivot additionally devote specific time to the writings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], \"Rav Kook\", who articulated a unique personal blend of mysticism, creative exegesis and philosophy. The Modern Orthodox, similarly, study the works of [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], \"Rav Soloveitchik\".\nHasidic philosophy and Mussar are also often taught; ''[[Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel#Jewish_philosophy|Maharal]]'' may have a dedicated ''shiur''. Machshava is also a focus-area of many ''Midrashot''.\n\nSome Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas also include formal study of ''Hashkafa'', especially at ''[[ba'al teshuva]]'' focused yeshivas; many ''Semikha'' programs likewise, particularly those with an outreach, or \"''[[kiruv]]''\", component. Regardless, students here typically study the major works independent of a ''shiur''.\n\n===Torah and Bible study===\nIntensive study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Torah) with the commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaqi 1040 - 1105) is stressed and taught in all elementary grades.<ref name=\"Actually\"/> In Haredi and Hasidic yeshivas, this is often done with Yiddish translations. The rest of the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible, comprising ''[[Nevi'im]]'' and ''[[Ketuvim]]'') is usually taught through high school, although less intensively. \n\nIn Yeshivot, thereafter,  Chumash and Tanakh are studied less directly. Yeshiva students typically follow the practice of ''[[Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum]]'', independently studying the upcoming ''[[parashah]]'' ([[weekly Torah portion]]) twice in the original Hebrew and once in [[Targum Onkelos]] (an [[Aramaic]] translation), with Rashi's commentary. Students often also study [[Nachmanides#Commentary_on_the_Torah|Ramban's commentary]], and, less often, other commentaries from the ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' edition are reviewed. \nStudents may similarly study the Tanakh independently, but it is not taught ''per se''; exceptions are the five [[Megilloth]] and [[Psalms|Tehillim]]. \nThe ''Rosh Yeshiva'' usually delivers a weekly ''shiur'' on the ''parashah'', which is often [[Shiur (Torah)#Public study sessions|open to the public]]. \n\nBy contrast, in Hesder and Modern Orthodox yeshivot, the study of Chumash and Tanakh continues in parallel with Talmud study. These institutions offer formal ''shiurim'' in many, if not all, of the books of Nevi'im  and Ketuvim. These are often structured [[Shiur (Torah)#Class levels|by level]], similar to Talmud study, where the text is then analyzed in light of the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|various commentaries]] and [[Midrash#Classical_compilations|''Midrashim'']], typically complementing the ''Machshavah'' ''shiurim''. \n[[Oral_Torah#In_rabbinic_literature_and_commentary|More recent commentaries]] especially studied are ''[[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin#Bibliography|\"Netziv\"]]'' and  ''[[Malbim#Methodology and style|\"Malbim\"]]''; as well as reference works such as ''[[Da'at Miqra]]'' by [[Mordechai Breuer]] and others.\nThe commentaries by Ramban and [[Samson_Raphael_Hirsch#Commentary_on_the_Torah|\"Rav Hirsch\"]] provide much philosophical content.\nIntensive study of Tanakh, as for Machshava, is similarly a feature of many ''Midrashot''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bais Yaakov]]\n* [[Jewish day school]]\n* [[Mesivta]]\n* [[Religious school]]\n* [[Yeshivish]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{OrthodoxJudaism}}\n{{Jewish education}}\n{{Organized Jewish Life in the United States |Religious education}}\n\n[[Category:Yeshivas| ]]\n[[Category:Jewish education]]\n[[Category:Jewish religious occupations]]\n[[Category:Jewish educational institutions]]\n[[Category:Single-gender schools]]\n", "name_user": "Fintor", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContemporary Orthodox yeshivas", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshiva"}

It is composed of a single village, Dude\u0219tii Noi, part of [[Becicherecu Mic]] Commune until 2004, when it was split off.\n\n==Geography==\nDude\u0219tii Noi is situated at the south-eastern part of the [[Banat]]ian [[moorland]] as part of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], 84\u201399 m above [[sea level]].  The village has a population of 2,501, with 46 inhabitants per km\u00b2 (both status 2008) on an area of 54&nbsp;km\u00b2, and is located off rural highway no. 6 [[Timi\u0219oara]]&ndash;[[S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]], 13&nbsp;km north-west of [[Timi\u0219oara]], with railway access since the end of the 19th century. Dude\u0219tii Noi has [[continental climate]], with cold winters and hot summers, as well as short springs. The average annual temperature is 10.6&nbsp;\u00b0C. The farmlands are highly fertile and have [[Loess]] soil with a low [[water table]].\n\n==History==\n[[Dacians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Awards]], [[Serbs]], [[Slovenes]], [[Mongols]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] attacked or settled in the [[Banat]] over the centuries while thrusting aside or annihilating each other in mutual confrontations. The name of the village, ''Bessenovo'', originated from an earlier settlement by the [[Pechenegs]]. It was first documented in the papal registers in 1333. In 1551, the [[Ottoman wars|Ottomans]] entered the Banat. The occupation only ended when [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and the [[Austria]]n troops took Timi\u0219oara on October 13, 1756. By now the whole area had become depopulated, impoverished and marshy. In the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] the [[Banat of Temeswar]] was subordinated to the ''Hofkammer'' in [[Vienna]] as crown land of the [[Kaiser]] on July 21, 1718. [[Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy|Field Marshal Claudius Florimund Count de Mercy]] was assigned in 1720 with the administration, reclamation and administration of the Banat. Initially he recruited [[immigrant]]s predominantly from his native country [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] for the province entrusted in his care. The Lorrainian Johann O\u00dfwald, living in the Banat since 20 years already, recruited 60 German-Lorrainian families (290 souls) from the area around [[Mainz]] and [[Trier]] to settle in Beschenowa. 1748, as part of the ''Great Swabian Migrations'' of the [[Danube-Swabians]], this first group of voluntary Imperial colonists arrived, most of which came on floats called ''Ulmer Schachtel'' traveling on the river [[Danube]] from the German town of [[Ulm]] for about two or three weeks. 1750 a further group of settlers arrived. The name of ''Neubeschenowa'' was adopted to distinguish the village from Altbeschenowa, Bulgarian [[Dude\u015ftii Vechi]], also located in the Banat. Following the unrests by the ''Salpeters'' in the shire of [[Hauenstein]], [[Black Forest]], several families were deported by force and resettled in Neubeschenowa. Several decommissioned soldiers also settled in the community in 1763. The family of [[Habsburg-Lorraine]] signed over politically the ''Banat of Temeswar'' to [[Hungary]] in 1778.\n\nAugust 9, 1849 saw the [[Battle of Temesv\u00e1r|deciding battle]] of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] close to Neubeschenowa. 30,000 soldiers of the Austrian army with 108 [[cannon]], led by Count  [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]] met at the Nyarad Creek the 55,000 soldiers and 108 cannon strong Hungarian army under the command of the Generals [[Henryk Dembi\u0144ski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]. The victory of the Austrian troops ended the [[siege]] of Temeswars after 107 days, and the Banat becomes Austrian crown land once again. Following the [[Ausgleich]] between Austria and Hungary in 1867, the Banat and [[Transylvania]] come under Hungarian rule again. 325 emigrants left Neubeschenowa for North America 1906\u20131908, of which 65 returned later. The emigrants transferred 375,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] back home.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], 127 persons died or were [[missing in action]]. Following the collapse of the [[k.u.k.]] [[monarchy]], the [[Banat Republic]] was proclaimed in 1918. In 1918\u20131919 (confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919 and [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920), most of the Banat and Neubeschenowa became now part of Romania. The first [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] labour camp of the [[Hitler Youth]] of Banat was held in Neubeschenowa during the summer of 1933. During [[World War II]], 37 men die in the service of the Romanian army, and 83 men in the German Army. After Romania changed sides and joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], 19 families fled in September 1944, and all remaining inhabitants were evacuated to the neighbouring community of ''St. Andreas'' during September 29 \u2013 October 10.

It is composed of a single village, Dude\u0219tii Noi, part of [[Becicherecu Mic]] Commune until 2004, when it was split off.\n\n==Geography==\nDude\u0219tii Noi is situated at the south-eastern part of the [[Banat]]ian [[moorland]] as part of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], 84\u201399 m above [[sea level]].  The village has a population of 2,501, with 46 inhabitants per km\u00b2 (both status 2008) on an area of 54&nbsp;km\u00b2, and is located off rural highway no. 6 [[Timi\u0219oara]]&ndash;[[S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]], 13&nbsp;km north-west of [[Timi\u0219oara]], with railway access since the end of the 19th century. Dude\u0219tii Noi has [[continental climate]], with cold winters and hot summers, as well as short springs. The average annual temperature is 10.6&nbsp;\u00b0C. The farmlands are highly fertile and have [[Loess]] soil with a low [[water table]].\n\n==History==\n[[Dacians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Awards]], [[Serbs]], [[Slovenes]], [[Mongols]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] attacked or settled in the [[Banat]] over the centuries while thrusting aside or annihilating each other in mutual confrontations. The name of the village, ''Bessenovo'', originated from an earlier settlement by the [[Pechenegs]]. It was first documented in the papal registers in 1333. In 1551, the [[Ottoman wars|Ottomans]] entered the Banat. The occupation only ended when [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] and the [[Austria]]n troops took Timi\u0219oara on October 13, 1756. By now the whole area had become depopulated, impoverished and marshy. In the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] the [[Banat of Temeswar]] was subordinated to the ''Hofkammer'' in [[Vienna]] as crown land of the [[Kaiser]] on July 21, 1718. [[Count Claudius Florimund de Mercy|Field Marshal Claudius Florimund Count de Mercy]] was assigned in 1720 with the administration, reclamation and administration of the Banat. Initially he recruited [[immigrant]]s predominantly from his native country [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] for the province entrusted in his care. The Lorrainian Johann O\u00dfwald, living in the Banat since 20 years already, recruited 60 German-Lorrainian families (290 souls) from the area around [[Mainz]] and [[Trier]] to settle in Beschenowa. 1748, as part of the ''Great Swabian Migrations'' of the [[Danube-Swabians]], this first group of voluntary Imperial colonists arrived, most of which came on floats called ''Ulmer Schachtel'' traveling on the river [[Danube]] from the German town of [[Ulm]] for about two or three weeks. 1750 a further group of settlers arrived. The name of ''Neubeschenowa'' was adopted to distinguish the village from Altbeschenowa, Bulgarian [[Dude\u015ftii Vechi]], also located in the Banat. Following the unrests by the ''Salpeters'' in the shire of [[Hauenstein]], [[Black Forest]], several families were deported by force and resettled in Neubeschenowa. Several decommissioned soldiers also settled in the community in 1763. The family of [[Habsburg-Lorraine]] signed over politically the ''Banat of Temeswar'' to [[Hungary]] in 1778.\n\nAugust 9, 1849 saw the [[Battle of Temesv\u00e1r|deciding battle]] of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] close to Neubeschenowa. 30,000 soldiers of the Austrian army with 108 [[cannon]], led by Count  [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]] met at the Nyarad Creek the 55,000 soldiers and 108 cannon strong Hungarian army under the command of the Generals [[Henryk Dembi\u0144ski]] and [[J\u00f3zef Bem]]. The victory of the Austrian troops ended the [[siege]] of Temeswars after 107 days, and the Banat becomes Austrian crown land once again. Following the [[Ausgleich]] between Austria and Hungary in 1867, the Banat and [[Transylvania]] come under Hungarian rule again. 325 emigrants left Neubeschenowa for North America 1906\u20131908, of which 65 returned later. The emigrants transferred 375,000 [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Kronen]] back home.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], 127 persons died or were [[missing in action]]. Following the collapse of the [[k.u.k.]] [[monarchy]], the [[Banat Republic]] was proclaimed in 1918. In 1918\u20131919 (confirmed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919 and [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920), most of the Banat and Neubeschenowa became now part of Romania. The first [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] labour camp of the [[Hitler Youth]] of Banat was held in Neubeschenowa during the summer of 1933. During [[World War II]], 37 men die in the service of the Romanian army, and 83 men in the German Army. After Romania changed sides and joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], 19 families fled in September 1944, and all remaining inhabitants were evacuated to the neighbouring community of ''St. Andreas'' during September 29 \u2013 October 10. During the organised [[Expulsion of Germans from Romania after World War II]], 297 men and women were deported for reconstruction works to [[Ukraine]] in January and February 1945, of which 68 died in the coal mines as forced labourers. The remaining German population was expropriated. The first Romanian colonists arrived in July, and in 1947 almost every house in Neubeschenowa was occupied by Romanians. 1951\u20131956 saw the [[B\u0103r\u0103gan deportations|deportation]] of 62 families to the [[B\u0103r\u0103gan Plain]] to a makeshift [[shanty town]] by the name of Bumbac\u00e2ri [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044935/http://www.uihei.com/BarMapA.jpg], north-east of [[Bucure\u015fti]], after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] model of the [[Gulag]]. 22 of the 170 deported did not return.\n\nFollowing the ''Family Reunion Treaty'' between [[Germany]] and Romania in 1978, and later after the fall of the [[Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu|Ceau\u015fescu]] regime in December 1989, most of the [[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian]]/German population of Neubeschenowa left in 2 large waves of emigration, mainly to Germany.

The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url= http://www.bartleby.com/196/164.html |title=The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion |last=Frazer |first=James G. |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2002|isbn=0-486-42492-8 |edition=Abridged |location=Mineola, New York |pages= |oclc=49942157 |orig-year=1922}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives.

The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. Families took their dead cats to the sacred city of [[Bubastis]], where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories.

The usual ancient Greek word for 'cat' was {{lang|grc-Latn|ailouros}}, meaning 'thing with the waving tail'. Cats are rarely mentioned in [[ancient Greek literature]]. [[Aristotle]] remarked in his ''[[History of Animals]]'' that \"female cats are naturally [[Promiscuity|lecherous]].\" The Greeks later [[Interpretatio graeca|syncretized]] their own goddess [[Artemis]] with the Egyptian goddess Bastet, adopting Bastet's associations with cats and ascribing them to Artemis.

The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for [http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ news] reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"[http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ news]\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"[http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ news]\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly.

He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers.

[[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report.

The history of the coffee houses is traced from Arab countries, which was introduced in England in the 16th century.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. \"A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth\u2014the coffeehouse\u2014flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television.\"</ref> In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests.

The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement.

News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. \"Rituals of objectivity\", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated.\"</ref> The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.<ref name=Smith7 /><ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Th\u00e9ophraste Renaudot]]: \"History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true.\"</ref><ref name=Pettegree3>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. \"Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market\u2014and by the sixteenth century it was a real market\u2014was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information.\"</ref> Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.<ref name=Park675>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 675\u2013676. \"News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences.\"</ref> News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past\u2014or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some \"peg\", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.<ref name=Park675 /><ref>Schudson, \"When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History\"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff & Schudson; pp. 81\u201382.</ref> Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.<ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13\u201314.</ref> Hence the famous dictum that \"Dog Bites Man\" is not news, but \"Man Bites Dog\" is.<ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 678.</ref>\n\nAnother corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. \"It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, na\u00efve empiricism could not last.\"</ref> News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nParadoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. \"Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often\u2014whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder\u2014to shock.\"</ref><ref name=SKH>{{cite journal | last1 = Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck | first1 = Jesper | last2 = Karlsson | first2 = Michael | last3 = Hopmann | first3 = Nicolas | year = 2012 | title = Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news | url = | journal = Journalism Studies | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 5\u20136 }}</ref> This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105\u2013106.</ref> A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, \"if it bleeds, it leads\".<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.</ref>\n\n===Newsworthiness===\nNewsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.</ref> War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of telecommunication}}\n\n===Folk news===\nEvidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. \"The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing\u2014let alone printing presses or computers\u2014to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. [\u2026] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange.\"</ref> Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.</ref> Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, [[town crier]]s, etc.<ref>Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), p. 19.</ref>\n\nThe news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available. The history of the coffee houses is traced from Arab countries, which was introduced in England in the 16th century.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. \"A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth\u2014the coffeehouse\u2014flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television.\"</ref> In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.<ref>Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.</ref> In late medieval Britain, reports (\"tidings\") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.<ref>Lim, \"Take Writing\" (2006), pp. 1\u20136.</ref>\n\n===Government proclamations===\n[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 St\u00e4ndebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]\n\nBefore the invention of [http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ newspapers] in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.<ref>[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=19 May 2011}}</ref> The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).<ref>{{cite book|last=Bleumer|first=Gerrit|title=Electronic Postage Systems: Technology, Security, Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KCdvPCBHCjwC&pg=PA2|year=2007|page=2|isbn=9780387446066}}</ref> [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming dictator of Rome began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''.

The [[Zulu Kingdom]] used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by [[griot]]s. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27\u201330.</ref>\n\n[[Town criers]] were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.<ref>Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33\u201338.</ref> The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.<ref>Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58\u201372, 133\u2013136. \"In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3).

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1-4165-4861-4|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref> Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.<ref>Sara Shipley Hiles & Amanda Hinnart, \"Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming\"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.</ref>\n\nSome commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.<ref>John Soloski, \"News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News\", from ''Media, Culture & Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143\u2013145.</ref> This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: \"Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words.\"<ref>Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.</ref> In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.</ref> News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: \"The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead.

News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. \"Rituals of objectivity\", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.<ref>James S.

The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

It was historically subdivided into 100 '''luma''' ({{lang-hy|[[wikt:\u056c\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0561|\u056c\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0561]]}}). The word \"dram\" translates into English as \"money\" and is cognate with the Greek [[drachma]] and the Arabic [[dirham]], as well as the English weight unit [[Dram (unit)|dram]]. The first instance of a dram currency was in the period from 1199 to 1375, when silver coins called dram were issued.\n\n== History ==\nOn 21 September 1991, a national referendum proclaimed [[Armenia]] as a republic independent from the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Central Bank of Armenia]], established on 27 March 1993, was given the exclusive right of issuing the national currency.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] attempts were made to maintain a common currency (the [[ruble|Russian ruble]]) among [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states. Armenia joined this ruble zone. However it soon became clear that maintaining a [[currency union]] in the unstable political and economical circumstances of the post-Soviet states would be very difficult. The ruble zone effectively collapsed with the unilateral [[monetary reform in Russia, 1993]]. As result the states that were still participating ([[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Moldova]], Armenia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) were 'pushed out' and forced to introduce separate currencies.  \nArmenia was one of the last countries to do so when it introduced the dram on 22 November 1993.<ref>Pomfret, Richard (2001). The IMF and the Ruble zone. Available at: http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1057/ces.2002.17</ref>\n\n=== Armenian dram sign ===\n{{main|Armenian dram sign}}\n[[File:dramsign-oiriginal-idea.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The dram Sign]]\n\nAfter its proclamation of independence, [[Armenia]] put into circulation its own national currency, the Armenian Dram; this required a monetary sign. As the result of common business practice and the unique pattern of Armenian letters, the shape of the sign and its variations appeared in the business scratches (daybooks). Until the official endorsement of the sign a number of artists and businessmen developed and offered various shapes for it. Now the dram symbol is included in the Armenian standard for the national characters and symbols and in the Armenian computer fonts. The current standard sign for the Armenian dram (<span style=' font-family: \"Segoe UI Semilight\", inherit '>\u058f</span>, image: {{Armenian dram}}; {{lang-hy|'''\u0534\u0580\u0561\u0574'''}}; [[ISO 4217|code]]: AMD) was designed in 1995. In Unicode, it is encoded at {{unichar|058f|ARMENIAN DRAM SIGN|html=}}.\n\n==Coins==\nIn 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5 and 10 dram. \nIn 2003 and 2004, a second series consisting of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram coins was introduced to replace the first series.\n\nThe Central Bank has also issued a great number of commemorative coins intended for sale to collectors. A listing can be found at the authorized central bank distributors.<ref>[https://www.cba.am/en/SitePages/nccommemorativecoins.aspx  Armenian commemorative coins for sale]</ref><ref>[http://arm-moneti.blogspot.nl/ Armenian commemorative coins cathalogue]</ref>\n\n===First series (1994-2002)===\nIn 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5 and 10 dram.

It was historically subdivided into 100 '''luma''' ({{lang-hy|[[wikt:\u056c\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0561|\u056c\u0578\u0582\u0574\u0561]]}}). The word \"dram\" translates into English as \"money\" and is cognate with the Greek [[drachma]] and the Arabic [[dirham]], as well as the English weight unit [[Dram (unit)|dram]]. The first instance of a dram currency was in the period from 1199 to 1375, when silver coins called dram were issued.\n\n== History ==\nOn 21 September 1991, a national referendum proclaimed [[Armenia]] as a republic independent from the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Central Bank of Armenia]], established on 27 March 1993, was given the exclusive right of issuing the national currency.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] attempts were made to maintain a common currency (the [[ruble|Russian ruble]]) among [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] states. Armenia joined this ruble zone. However it soon became clear that maintaining a [[currency union]] in the unstable political and economical circumstances of the post-Soviet states would be very difficult. The ruble zone effectively collapsed with the unilateral [[monetary reform in Russia, 1993]]. As result the states that were still participating ([[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Moldova]], Armenia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) were 'pushed out' and forced to introduce separate currencies.  \nArmenia was one of the last countries to do so when it introduced the dram on 22 November 1993.<ref>Pomfret, Richard (2001). The IMF and the Ruble zone. Available at: http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1057/ces.2002.17</ref>\n\n=== Armenian dram sign ===\n{{main|Armenian dram sign}}\n[[File:dramsign-oiriginal-idea.jpg|thumb|100px|left|The dram Sign]]\n\nAfter its proclamation of independence, [[Armenia]] put into circulation its own national currency, the Armenian Dram; this required a monetary sign. As the result of common business practice and the unique pattern of Armenian letters, the shape of the sign and its variations appeared in the business scratches (daybooks). Until the official endorsement of the sign a number of artists and businessmen developed and offered various shapes for it. Now the dram symbol is included in the Armenian standard for the national characters and symbols and in the Armenian computer fonts. The current standard sign for the Armenian dram (<span style=' font-family: \"Segoe UI Semilight\", inherit '>\u058f</span>, image: {{Armenian dram}}; {{lang-hy|'''\u0534\u0580\u0561\u0574'''}}; [[ISO 4217|code]]: AMD) was designed in 1995. In Unicode, it is encoded at {{unichar|058f|ARMENIAN DRAM SIGN|html=}}.\n\n==Coins==\nIn 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5 and 10 dram. \nIn 2003 and 2004, a second series consisting of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 dram coins was introduced to replace the first series.\n\nThe Central Bank has also issued a great number of commemorative coins intended for sale to collectors. A listing can be found at the authorized central bank distributors.<ref>[https://www.cba.am/en/SitePages/nccommemorativecoins.aspx  Armenian commemorative coins for sale]</ref><ref>[http://arm-moneti.blogspot.nl/ Armenian commemorative coins cathalogue]</ref>\n\n===First series (1994-2002)===\nIn 1994, a first series of aluminium coins was introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 luma, 1, 3, 5 and 10 dram.
