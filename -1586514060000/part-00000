The river with the same name ([[Geoagiu River (Hunedoara)|Geoagiu]]) flows in this place into the Mure\u0219. The town has a population of 5,049. It administers ten villages: Aurel Vlaicu (formerly ''Bin\u021bin\u021bi''; ''Bencenc''), B\u0103c\u00e2ia (''Bakonya''), Boze\u0219 (''B\u00f3zes''), Cigm\u0103u (''Csigm\u00f3''), Gelmar (''Gyalm\u00e1r''), Geoagiu-B\u0103i (''Fered\u0151gy\u00f3gy''), Homorod (''Homor\u00f3d''), Mermezeu-V\u0103leni (''Ny\u00edrmez\u0151''), Renghet (''Renget'') and V\u0103leni (''Val\u00e9ny''). Geoagiu is situated in the historical region of [[Transylvania]].\n\n==History==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|2002 |6290\n|2011 |5049\n}}\n\nThe first settlements in the area can be found in the time of the [[Dacians]], in the 1st century BC, as shown by archeological discoveries. After the [[Roman conquest of Dacia|Roman conquest]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] built the [[Germisara (castra)|fort of Germisara]] in the 2nd century, however, it kept the original Dacian name. Germisara was defended by the [[Legio XIII Gemina]].\n\nThe name of ''Germisara'' meant \"hot water\" (''germi'' = \"heat\", ''sara'' = \"waterfall\") and it showed that the Dacians already knew of the thermal springs of the area. \nAnother opinion that the name came from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name of the [[Geoagiu River (Hunedoara)|Geoagiu River]] (''Gy\u00f3gy''), which means \"curative\". But more probably, the name is coming from the Hungarian word ''di\u00f3'' (nut as fruit) with the suffix -d, so, after the first documentary citation, \"villa Gyog\" from 1291 appeared as Dyod \u00e9s Dyog (1397), Aldyogh (1407), Algyogh (1412), Aldyod (1439), Alsodyod alio nomine Alsoffalwa (around 1444).\n\nThe first documentary citation of Geoagiu (it was written as \"villa Gyog\") was in the year 1291, when it was used as a land in the vicinity of ''Bintinti'' (now the village ''Aurel Vlaicu''). At the 2011 census, 89.7% of inhabitants were [[Romanians]], 8.81% Roma and 0.71% [[Hungarians]].\n\nThere are remains of the old Roman way made of plate stones from Geoagiu to Geoagiu B\u0103i.

The river with the same name ([[Geoagiu River (Hunedoara)|Geoagiu]]) flows in this place into the Mure\u0219. The town has a population of 5,049. It administers ten villages: Aurel Vlaicu (formerly ''Bin\u021bin\u021bi''; ''Bencenc''), B\u0103c\u00e2ia (''Bakonya''), Boze\u0219 (''B\u00f3zes''), Cigm\u0103u (''Csigm\u00f3''), Gelmar (''Gyalm\u00e1r''), Geoagiu-B\u0103i (''Fered\u0151gy\u00f3gy''), Homorod (''Homor\u00f3d''), Mermezeu-V\u0103leni (''Ny\u00edrmez\u0151''), Renghet (''Renget'') and V\u0103leni (''Val\u00e9ny''). Geoagiu is situated in the historical region of [[Transylvania]].\n\n==History==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|2002 |6290\n|2011 |5049\n}}\n\nThe first settlements in the area can be found in the time of the [[Dacians]], in the 1st century BC, as shown by archeological discoveries. After the [[Roman conquest of Dacia|Roman conquest]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] built the [[Germisara (castra)|fort of Germisara]] in the 2nd century, however, it kept the original Dacian name. Germisara was defended by the [[Legio XIII Gemina]].\n\nThe name of ''Germisara'' meant \"hot water\" (''germi'' = \"heat\", ''sara'' = \"waterfall\") and it showed that the Dacians already knew of the thermal springs of the area. \nAnother opinion that the name came from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name of the [[Geoagiu River (Hunedoara)|Geoagiu River]] (''Gy\u00f3gy''), which means \"curative\". But more probably, the name is coming from the Hungarian word ''di\u00f3'' (nut as fruit) with the suffix -d, so, after the first documentary citation, \"villa Gyog\" from 1291 appeared as Dyod \u00e9s Dyog (1397), Aldyogh (1407), Algyogh (1412), Aldyod (1439), Alsodyod alio nomine Alsoffalwa (around 1444).\n\nThe first documentary citation of Geoagiu (it was written as \"villa Gyog\") was in the year 1291, when it was used as a land in the vicinity of ''Bintinti'' (now the village ''Aurel Vlaicu'').
