If ''[[Ailanthus altissima|A.altissima]]'' is not present, they can lay their eggs on any stationary object, both manmade and natural. While eggs, they can easily move from place to place without being noticed, giving them an easy, yet accidental route towards infesting new areas. Its initial introduction to the United States is believed to be through this pathway, hitchhiking off of an imported stone from China and placed in Pennsylvania. When adults, ''L. delicatula'' can fly around its immediate area to find new host plants. It is highly suggested that their normal host, ''[[Ailanthus altissima|A. altissima]]'', be in the area for the organism to thrive.\n\nIn addition to being easily transported, ''L. delicatula'' feeds on a variety of plants. As nymphs, they feed on their host plant in which they were planted before moving to another in the area. They prefer live plant material to consume. It is uncertain if ''L. delicatula'' requires ''[[Ailanthus altissima|A. altissima]]'' to complete their life cycle or if they could finish development on a less desirable host.
